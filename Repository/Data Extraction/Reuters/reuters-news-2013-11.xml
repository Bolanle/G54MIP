&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Nov. 1, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC) congratulates IBM, a global technology manufacturer and consulting corporation, for receiving the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) 2013 Corporation of the Year Award. IBM is a longstanding partner of the USHCC, and was recognized at the 2013 USHCC National Convention's Million Dollar Club&#160;for investing over $100 million&#160;with Hispanic&#160;Business Enterprises (HBEs).
			
	"For decades, IBM has distinguished itself as&#160;a true&#160;champion of supplier diversity.&#160;This company recognizes that working with minority-owned firms is critical to their future commercial success, and quite frankly, a smart business practice that adapts to the economy of the new America," said USHCC President  CEO Javier Palomarez. "The USHCC is proud of&#160;IBM's continued accomplishments in the arena of diversity and inclusion, and we&#160;commend&#160;the NMSDC for honoring this world-renowned&#160;brand for&#160;their dedicated work in fostering the growth of American's diverse&#160;business communities."
	&#160;
	IBM is a founding member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable (BDR), an international coalition of 18 companies that individually invest more than $1 billion with minority-owned suppliers each year. In 2011, IBM celebrated 40 years of supplier diversity, and continues to expand its alliances with minority-owned businesses.
			
	IBM's continued success proves that supplier diversity can lead to profitable returns. According to a study conducted by the Hackett Group, an internationally based business consulting firm, companies with diverse supply chains see a 133% greater return on investments, when compared to their counterparts. The same report also discovered that companies working with minority-owned businesses spend 20% less on their operations, and have procurement teams half the size of their competitors.
			
	"The NMSDC honored an exemplary company with its most auspicious annual award. For years, the USHCC and IBM have worked together to expand opportunities for Hispanic owned businesses," said USHCC Chairman Marc Rodriguez. "We look forward to our continued partnership with IBM, as we explore new opportunities and celebrate shared victories."

      Fitch to Rate JPMCC 2013-C16 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through 
      Certificates; Presale Issued
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on the J.P. Morgan Chase 
      Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2013-C16 commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Outlooks as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$56,761,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      (a)Notional amount and interest only.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (b)Class A-S, class B and class C certificates may be exchanged for a 
      related amount of class EC certificates, and class EC certificates may 
      be exchanged for class A-S, class B and class C certificates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Oct. 31, 2013. Fitch does not expect to rate the $52,536,247 class NR 
      or the $85,194,247 interest only class X-C.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 60 loans secured by 113 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.136 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association; General Electric Capital 
      Corporation; Ladder Capital Finance LLC; and Redwood Commercial Mortgage 
      Corporation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 74.4% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 85.1%, and asset summary reviews on 85.1%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.10x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 106.6%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 8.52%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 8.73% to issuer cash flows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Leverage: This transaction has higher leverage than other recent 
      Fitch-rated fixed-rate deals. The pool's Fitch LTV of 106.6% is higher 
      than the 2012 and first-half 2013 averages of 97.2% and 99.8%, 
      respectively. However, excluding the two largest loans which are secured 
      by multifamily properties in New York City and San Francisco, the pool's 
      Fitch LTV is 103%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Multifamily Concentration: The pool has a multifamily concentration of 
      29.6%, which is significantly higher than the first-half 2013 average 
      concentration of 8.9%. The two largest loans in the pool, The Aire 
      (11.9%) and Veritas Multifamily Portfolio (8.1%) are collateralized by 
      multifamily properties located in CBDs of primary markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Subordinate Debt: Seven loans, representing 33.7% of the pool balance, 
      have subordinate debt in place, including the four of the five largest 
      loans in the pool (30.1%). The Aire has a $25 million B-note and 
      unsecured debt in place. The transaction has a Fitch total debt stack 
      LTV and DSCR of 118.9% and 1.01x, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Property Quality: Fitch assigned property quality grades of 'A' or 'A-' 
      to three of the 15 largest loans in the pool, which represent 17.9% of 
      the pool balance. Furthermore, property quality grades of 'B+' or better 
      were assigned to 65.7% of the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch performed two model-based break-even analyses to determine the 
      level of cash flow and value deterioration the pool could withstand 
      prior to $1 of loss being experienced by the 'BBB-sf' and 'AAAsf' rated 
      classes. Fitch found that the JPMCC 2013-C16 pool could withstand a 
      45.4% decline in value (based on appraised values at issuance) and an 
      approximately 13.3% decrease to the most recent actual cash flow prior 
      to experiencing a $1 of loss to the 'BBB-sf' rated class. Additionally, 
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 54.3% decline in value and 
      an approximately 27.5% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to any 'AAAsf' rated class.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying pre-sale report.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 
      rated 'CMS1-' by Fitch. The special servicer will be Midland Loan 
      Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association, rated 'CSS1' by 
      Fitch.

      Research and Markets: Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Market in UK 
      to 2016: Citrix Systems, Microsoft, Oracle  VMware Dominate the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/jkkxvx/virtual_desktop) 
      has announced the addition of the "Virtual 
      Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Market in UK 2012-2016" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The VDI market in the UK to grow at a CAGR of 12.92 percent over the 
      period 2012-2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cloud computing and cloud-based application provisioning is finding 
      increased adoption from end-users and enterprises across the globe. 
      Enterprises have realized the benefits associated with cloud computing 
      and are finding increasing adoption. Virtual desktop infrastructure 
      solutions are also being provided over the cloud infrastructure which is 
      cheaper compared to hosting similar solutions in the internal 
      infrastructure. The services are delivered to the end-users over the 
      internet which is decreasing the capital and operational expenses 
      associated with virtual desktop provisioning.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers is the increasing 
      adoption of handheld devices for enterprise computing by the enterprises 
      in the UK. Smartphones, tablets, and other handheld devices are equipped 
      with sufficient computing capabilities which are enabling the end-users 
      to access the enterprise content using their handheld devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is the rapid 
      evolution of technology across the globe creating the scarcity on the 
      expertise required to efficiently manage the network dynamics. The 
      network administrator must be experienced enough to tackle any problems 
      that are encountered during the execution.

      Research and Markets: Global Online Ad Spending Market to 2016: AOL, 
      Facebook, Google, Microsoft  Yahoo! Dominate the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/vdbp4l/global_online_ad) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Online Ad Spending Market 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of rapid digitalization, marketers have started using the 
      online medium for branding their product offerings rather than waiting 
      to receive a direct response. The advertising spend on branding through 
      online mediums has been increasing in the past few years, mainly because 
      of the increased adoption of broadband, smartphones, and tablets. There 
      has been increased ad spending on branding through online mediums 
      because companies have started realizing the opportunities online 
      mediums bring to them in the form of consumer insights, which can be 
      used for creating superior value propositions. Also, as a result of 
      higher consumer-brand involvement in the online medium, companies get 
      more consumer insights. Thus, the shift to brand advertising from direct 
      response advertising is expected to have a positive impact on the Global 
      Online Ad Spending market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main drivers in this market is the 
      increase in spending on online advertising. With the rising number of 
      internet users, various companies have channelized their ad budgets 
      toward the online medium for better targeting and positioning.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the key challenges in this market 
      is the growing concerns of data security among consumers. Consumers are 
      reluctant to share their personal information online or make online 
      transactions because there is a risk of their personal data being shared 
      by companies that could lead to a lack of privacy and in worse cases, 
      fraudulent transactions. Moreover, consumers are unaware about how and 
      when their information is being shared.

      Research and Markets: Global SaaS-based Enterprise Resource Planning 
      Software Market to 2016: Microsoft, NetSuite, Oracle  SAP Dominate the 
      Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/cn7thx/global_saasbased) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      SaaS-based Enterprise Resource Planning Software Market 2012-2016" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increasing influence of social networking sites such as Facebook, 
      Twitter and LinkedIn, allows SaaS-based ERP vendors to introduce social 
      networking in businesses that will help the employees to interact with 
      their customers. The linkage of SaaS-based ERP software with social 
      media gives employees a much more rich understanding of the 
      end-customer, making customer interaction more personal. The use of 
      social tools within ERP software also increases the degree of 
      integration between co-workers, which in turn improves the quality of 
      information captured about customers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moreover, inspired by the Apple Application Store, the ERP Application 
      Store has been introduced by SAP AG. SAP has also added the ability for 
      customers and partners to buy and resell its Business One ERP software 
      for smaller companies through the store. Vendors such as SAP AG, 
      NetSuite Inc., and Microsoft Corp. are actively building application 
      stores to provide smartphone access to ERP data. SaaS-based ERP is being 
      impacted by mobility and the propagation of smartphone applications, and 
      is focusing more on building out an ecosystem of applications that will 
      run with native functionality on the iPhone and Android.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers of the Global 
      SaaS-based ERP Software market is the increasing demand from SMEs. This 
      is because tasks such as implementation, continuous operation, backup, 
      updates, and infrastructure maintenance of the ERP software are handled 
      by SaaS vendors, thus reducing the total cost of ownership of ERP 
      solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that concern regarding data security is one 
      of the biggest challenges faced by end-users. Customers fear that 
      storing sensitive and personal data on a third-party cloud could make 
      such information vulnerable to data security breaches.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report also includes a discussion of the other vendors operating in 
      this market.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Refining weakness led to a surprise decline in Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) quarterly profit, and oil and gas well output increased but remained below target, sending the company's shares down 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital spending is running ahead of budget, while production is short of expectations due to a slow ramp-up of gas exports from Angola and damage to a customer's gas facility in Thailand from a lightning strike, the No. 2 U.S. oil company said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a bounceback in fourth-quarter oil and gas output would lead to Chevron producing between 98 percent and 99 percent of its 2013 forecast of 2.65 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (bpd), a company spokesman told analysts on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. refineries have been squeezed in the past year by a sharp reduction of the feedstock discount they had enjoyed from relatively cheaper U.S. crude oil, although that spread has started widening again over the past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downstream difficulties were shared widely, with Chevron's larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) reporting lower earnings on Thursday despite increased oil and gas output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors have been clamoring for more returns of capital from the world's biggest oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington reiterated that capital spending would flatten out once the company's huge Australian liquefied natural gas projects are out of the way, giving management more flexibility with cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the same time though, we do fundamentally believe our greatest value proposition for shareholders is finding and investing in the right resources and developing the right projects, so we will continue to invest in the business," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's third-quarter net income fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected $2.71 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings from its downstream arm, which includes refineries and chemical production, fell 45 percent to $380 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for upstream, the company produced 2.59 million bpd in the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Output is expected to grow 25 percent by 2017, boosted by Australian LNG. But the cost of those projects pushed Chevron's capital budget up by $7 billion in two years to $36.7 billion for 2013, and Yarrington said spending this year would be about 10 percent higher than that due to acreage acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares were down 2.3 percent at $117.20 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has outperformed Exxon in 2013, rising 11 percent, compared with 4 percent for the sector leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall in San Francisco; Editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 1 (Reuters) - Refining weakness led to a surprise

that capital spending would flatten out once the company's huge
Australian liquefied natural gas projects are out of the way,
giving management more flexibility with cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the same time though, we do fundamentally believe our
greatest value proposition for shareholders is finding and

&lt;p&gt;By Guillermo Parra-Bernal and Natalia Gomez&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO Nov 1 (Reuters) - Brazil faces no imminent risk
of losing its sovereign investment-grade debt ratings over the
next 18 months, Paulo Leme, chairman of Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 in Brazil, said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sees a solid economy in spite of inflation and exchange
rate volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not ruling out the risk for a potential rating action,
Leme said policies that enhance predictability and transparency
could reduce the likelihood of a downgrade or further outlook
revisions in the near-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil is rated Baa2 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by
Standard and Poor's and Fitch Ratings- the second-lowest
investment-grade rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite recent actions by Moody's and S, which lowered
their outlooks on Brazil's investment-grade ratings, "we are
facing no imminent economic problems...we're not in a
crisis-like mode," Leme said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we need is to eliminate uncertainties and implement
policies that eliminate the risk of a downgrade," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in October, Moody's lowered the outlook on Brazil's
Baa2 sovereign debt rating to "stable" from "positive," citing
the impact of years of low growth, flagging investment and
swelling debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moody's and its peers have stressed that government debt
trends are deteriorating: Brazil's gross debt equals almost 60
percent of gross domestic product, compared with median ratios
of 45 percent for Baa2-rated countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leme's remarks, made at an event sponsored by Brazil's
investment banking and mutual funds association Anbima, come
amid growing concerns that the country's economy is lagging
behind other emerging market countries.&lt;/p&gt;

into the ties between Madoff and the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New
York is also investigating the bank's activities in the
California and Midwest power markets that were the subject of a
$410 million settlement between JPMorgan and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the bank offered more specifics on the amount
of claims that investors and bond insurers had over
mortgage-backed securities. Total claims added up to
approximately $117 billion, $88 billion of which involves Bear
Stearns, Washington Mutual, JPMorgan or its affiliates as an
issuer and $29 billion of which involves the entities solely as
underwriters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company made the statements in a quarterly filing with

&lt;p&gt;Nov 1 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp, the second-largest
U.S. oil company, reported on Friday a decline in quarterly
profit due to the impact of lower refining margins, while oil
and gas production increased but remained short of its target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per
share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent
per day in the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd a year earlier.
The company has been targeting 2.65 million bpd for this year,
with output expected to grow by 25 percent by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;Our third quarter earnings were down from a year ago,&#8221; said Chairman 
      and CEO John Watson, &#8220;primarily reflecting lower margins for refined 
      products in the current period.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We continue to make good progress on our major capital projects,&#8221; 
      Watson added. &#8220;Construction continues, and important milestones are 
      being reached, on our Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects in Australia. 
      Important interim construction goals have been recently reached for our 
      Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico, in 
      preparation for their project start-ups scheduled for late 2014. We are 
      also moving forward on the development of our liquids-rich 
      unconventional properties in the United States.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Recent upstream highlights include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Australia &#8211; Signed binding long-term Sales and Purchase 
        Agreements with Tohoku Electric Power Company, Inc. for Wheatstone 
        LNG. Binding long-term agreements now cover 85 percent of Chevron&#8217;s 
        equity LNG offtake from Wheatstone.
      
			
				Australia &#8211; Acquired exploration interests in two blocks 
        located in the deepwater Bight Basin offshore South Australia.
      
			
				Canada &#8211; Successfully concluded the initial twelve-well 
        exploration drilling program in the liquids-rich portion of the 
        Duvernay Shale.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In the downstream business, we continued to advance our growth 
      investments,&#8221; said Watson. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC, the 
      company&#8217;s 50 percent-owned affiliate, announced a final investment 
      decision on its U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. This project 
      will include an ethane cracker with an annual design capacity of 1.5 
      million metric tons per year and two polyethylene facilities, each with 
      an annual design capacity of 500,000 metric tons per year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company purchased $1.25 billion of its common stock in the third 
      quarter 2013 under its share repurchase program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			UPSTREAM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worldwide net oil-equivalent production was 2.59 million barrels per day 
      in the third quarter 2013, up from 2.52 million barrels per day in the 
      2012 third quarter. The increase was primarily driven by lower 
      maintenance-related downtime at Tengizchevroil and project ramp-ups in 
      the United States, Nigeria and Angola, partially offset by normal field 
      declines.

      U.S. upstream earnings of $1.03 billion in the third quarter 2013 were 
      down $96 million from a year earlier, as higher crude oil and natural 
      gas realizations and increased production were more than offset by 
      higher depreciation, exploration and operating expenses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company&#8217;s average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural 
      gas liquids was $97 in the third quarter 2013, up from $91 a year ago. 
      The average sales price of natural gas was $3.23 per thousand cubic 
      feet, compared with $2.63 in last year&#8217;s third quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net oil-equivalent production of 655,000 barrels per day in the third 
      quarter 2013 was up 18,000 barrels per day, or 3 percent, from a year 
      earlier. Production increases in the Delaware Basin in New Mexico and 
      the Marcellus Shale in western Pennsylvania, along with the absence of 
      weather-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico, were partially offset by 
      normal field declines elsewhere.
			The net liquids component of 
      oil-equivalent production increased 2 percent in the 2013 third quarter 
      to 448,000 barrels per day, while net natural gas production increased 5 
      percent to 1.24 billion cubic feet per day.

      International upstream earnings of $4.07 billion increased $49 million 
      from the third quarter 2012. The increase between quarters was primarily 
      due to higher volumes and realizations for crude oil, largely offset by 
      the absence of a 2012 gain of approximately $600 million from the sale 
      of an equity interest in the Wheatstone Project, and higher operating 
      expenses in the current period. Foreign currency effects decreased 
      earnings by $188 million in the 2013 quarter, compared with a decrease 
      of $252 million a year earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The average sales price for crude oil and natural gas liquids in the 
      third quarter 2013 was $104 per barrel, up from $98 a year earlier. The 
      average price of natural gas was $5.88 per thousand cubic feet, compared 
      with $6.03 in last year&#8217;s third quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net oil-equivalent production of 1.93 million barrels per day in the 
      third quarter 2013 was up 51,000 barrels per day, or 3 percent, from a 
      year ago. Production increased primarily due to lower 
      maintenance-related downtime at Tengizchevroil and project ramp-ups in 
      Nigeria and Angola, partially offset by normal field declines. The net 
      liquids component of oil-equivalent production increased 2 percent to 
      1.28 million barrels per day, while net natural gas production increased 
      3 percent to 3.91 billion cubic feet per day.

      U.S. downstream operations earned $249 million in the third quarter 2013 
      compared with earnings of $456 million a year earlier. The decrease was 
      mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales and higher 
      operating expenses reflecting repair and maintenance activities at 
      company refineries. The decrease was partially offset by higher earnings 
      from the 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Refinery crude oil input of 831,000 barrels per day in the third quarter 
      2013 increased 52,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period. The 
      increase was primarily due to the absence of effects of an August 2012 
      incident at the refinery in Richmond, California that shut down the 
      crude unit, partially offset by planned maintenance activities at the 
      refinery in El Segundo, California in the current period. Refined 
      product sales of 1.19 million barrels per day were up 12,000 barrels per 
      day from the third quarter 2012, mainly reflecting higher gasoline 
      sales. Branded gasoline sales increased 2 percent to 529,000 barrels per 
      day.

      and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many 
      of which are beyond the company&#8217;s control and are difficult to predict. 
      Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what 
      is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The 
      reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking 
      statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. 
      Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update

		&lt;p&gt;
			Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing 
      crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and 
      chemicals margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of 
      exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness 
      of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological 
      developments; the results of operations and financial condition of 
      equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company&#8217;s 
      joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development 
      activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production 
      from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; 
      potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned 
      projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company&#8217;s 
      production or manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation 
      networks due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe 
      weather or crude oil production quotas that might be imposed by the 
      Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability 
      for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future 
      environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or 
      product changes required by existing or future environmental statutes, 
      regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other 
      pending or future litigation; the company&#8217;s future acquisition or 
      disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or

			Procter  Gamble&#8217;s My Black is Beautiful Celebrates Girls Gone M.A.D. 
      at the 2013 BLACK GIRLS ROCK!&#8482; Awards
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Three Amazing Young Women Honored for Imagining a Beautiful Future 
      by Making A Difference (M.A.D.) In Their Communities
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG&#8217;s My Black is Beautiful (MBIB) continues to drive its mission 
      forward with its latest program, Imagine A Future, to empower 
      young black girls to be their best selves through participating in the 
      2013 BLACK GIRLS ROCK!&#8482; Awards. The BLACK GIRLS ROCK! organization is 
      dedicated to promoting positive images of women of color in mass media.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Imagine a Future Program launched in 2012 with the support of 
      community organizations BLACK GIRLS ROCK! and the United Negro College 
      Fund (UNCF), aiming to positively impact the lives of one million black 
      girls over three years. This past April, the program sparked a national 
      conversation surrounding beauty with the release of the Imagine a 
      Future documentary, which followed Delaware teen Janet Goldsboro as 
      she traveled to South Africa to examine the historical and current 
      beauty and self-esteem issues that challenge black women and girls. 
      Since its debut, the program has also worked to equip young girls with 
      tools and solutions, such as scholarships, leadership camps, and online 
      consumer interactive tools.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Now in its second year, MBIB is continuing its momentum by celebrating 
      three dynamic young ladies at the 2013 BLACK GIRLS ROCK! Awards, each of 
      whom is &#8220;Making A Difference&#8221; (M.A.D.) in her community. After 
      identifying several social disparities, these M.A.D. girls &#8211; Brooklyn 
      Wright, Mary Pat Hector and Ty-Licia Hooker &#8211; have created 
      community-based initiatives that have already delivered positive impacts 
      in their communities and on the socio-political landscape.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing more rewarding than being given the opportunity to 
      honor young women who are committed to impacting their community,&#8221; said 
      Tatyana Ali, actress, activist and MBIB ambassador. &#8220;We&#8217;re proud of the 
      three role models we&#8217;re celebrating today, and we look forward to seeing 
      how their efforts continue to make a difference and compel other young 
      black girls to do the same.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Brooklyn Wright, 11, of Atlanta, GA., is an award winning &#8220;earth 
      saver,&#8221; who travels from school-to-school to share her passion for 
      litter prevention. Wright will donate learning gardens to 10 schools 
      this year and will have her first annual Earth Saver Girl day camp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mary Pat Hector, 15, of Atlanta, GA., founded &#8220;Youth Action USA&#8221; 
      in an effort to take a stand against gun violence, bullying and youth 
      issues. She also serves as the National Youth Director of National 
      Action Network Youth Move, an organization founded by civil rights 
      pioneer Reverend Al Sharpton.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Ty-Licia Hooker, 22, of Stockton, Calif., is president and 
      founder of two community outreach programs. She influences at-risk youth 
      through her programs STORM and the Summer Success and Leadership 
      Academy, where an emphasis is placed on youth development and maturation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These three young ladies are the epitome of what the Imagine A Future 
      program is all about, and it&#8217;s our privilege to honor them for their 
      dedication, hard work, and strength,&#8221; said Grace Janes, brand manager, 
      Procter  Gamble. &#8220;When we see exemplary examples such as these three

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Lawrence White and Michael Flaherty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Nov 1 (Reuters) - A top Goldman Sachs banker in
Asia is relocating to the United States to take on a global
role, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, after
playing a key part in the firm's efforts to broaden its business
amid a drop in equity offering volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan Dees, Goldman's co-head of investment banking for Asia,
is expected to move within the next few months, the sources
said. They could not confirm the exact title the American banker
will take on, but said it would be a global appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman earned large fees on a few select deals in Asia in
the last year, during which investment banks across the region
took on more complex financings and aimed for solo bookrunning
offerings rather than depending on the steady volume of equity
issuance they previously enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Goldman's Asia investment banking revamp,
Missouri-born Dees, 43, played a key role in two of Asia's three
largest ever initial public offerings: the $22.12 billion
listing of the Agricultural Bank of China and the
$20.5 billion flotation of insurer AIA Group Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other top Goldman deals this year included the latest in a
series of three bond sales for Malaysian state investment fund
1Malaysia Development Bhd. The transactions earned Goldman
hundreds of millions of dollars in fees according to media
reports, and also attracted some criticism from Malaysian
opposition politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment on Dees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources cited the opportunity to move up from a regional
to a global role, and also family reasons, to explain Dees'
departure from Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His wife and five children moved this summer to the U.S.
West Coast, where the children are now in school, the people
said. Before his six years in Hong Kong, Dees spent four years
in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People familiar with the matter said Dees was among the
bankers who worked around the clock last August to place AIG's
$7.6 billion selldown of AIA shares, Hong Kong's largest equity
deal for 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank and Goldman got the lead roles on
the deal, specifying on term sheets that they were the "active"
co-ordinators and bookrunners. That sparked a minor spat with
the other underwriters, with banks complaining that the term
sheets implied the rest were "passive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dees graduated from Duke University in 1992, going straight
to Goldman in New York. He was named managing director in 2001
and partner in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CO-HEADS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman named Dees and Matthew Westerman as its top Asia
investment bankers in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they took over as investment bank co-heads, Westerman
had most recently been global head of equity capital markets,
while Dees was the head of the financing group in Asia-Pacific
and chairman of the financing group for Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their priority was to continue the bank's efforts to
diversify revenues in Goldman Sachs' core investment banking
business in Asia, which, in common with other Wall Street banks,
had relied heavily on underwriting bumper stock offerings from
China's state-backed companies and other Greater China deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dwindling supply of those deals, coupled with a
proliferation in the number of underwriters handling them,
prompted Goldman to expand its smaller-than-average debt capital
markets platform and its derivatives business in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those businesses have become more lucrative as Asia's top
companies mature and demand more regular, and more
sophisticated, funding and hedging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010 and 2011, the majority of Goldman's Asia investment
banking revenues came from equity and M advisory fees,
according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman earned an estimated $346 million in Asia
Pacific investment banking, Thomson Reuters data show. That
revenue was spread across equity, bonds, loans and M, with
bonds taking the lion's share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the third quarter of 2012, investment banks made more
money from debt deals than underwriting stock offerings for the
first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People familiar with the matter say that Goldman is on track
to set a record for revenue this year for Asia Pacific
investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank may have earned as much as $700 million from
arranging private bond placements for 1MDB, according to
calculations by IFR magazine, a Thomson Reuters publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it earned more than $40 million, one source told Reuters
at the time, for its exclusive handling of China state oil
refiner Sinopec 's 3.1 billion share offer in February
this year.&lt;/p&gt;

			Portland General Electric Announces Third Quarter Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR)
			today reported net 
      income of $31 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, for the third 
      quarter of 2013. This compares with net income of $38 million, or 50 
      cents per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2012. The decrease in 
      earnings is primarily the result of higher power costs due to plant 
      outages and increased delivery system costs due to service restoration 
      work and other planned expenses. The company is reducing its full-year 
      2013 earnings guidance from $1.25 - $1.40 per share to $1.20 - $1.30 per 
      share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;While the generating plant outages have been challenging this year, the 
      balance of the company's operations have been very strong,&#8221; said Jim 
      Piro, president and chief executive officer. &#8220;Our performance in 
      distribution reliability and customer satisfaction is top quartile, we 
      reached a reasonable settlement on all issues in our 2014 general rate 
      case, and the construction of our new thermal and renewable resources is 
      proceeding on time and on budget.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Company updates
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Board of directors update&#8212;Effective Oct. 31, Chairman Corbin 
        McNeill has announced his retirement from PGE&#8217;s board of directors and 
        Jack Davis has been elected as the new chairman. McNeill joined the 
        board in 2004 and has made significant contributions to PGE during the 
        past decade.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Corbin has provided outstanding leadership, perspective and guidance 
      during his tenure as chairman,&#8221; Piro said. &#8220;We appreciate his steadfast 
      dedication and service to our customers, employees and shareholders.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Davis has been a member of the PGE board of directors since June 2012. 
      He has extensive knowledge of the utility industry with over 35 years of 
      utility experience at Arizona Public Service Company, including 
      management positions in generation, transmission, power operations and 
      customer service, and six years as chief executive officer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Generation projects&#8212;PGE is making progress on its three new 
        generation projects. Construction is underway on Port Westward Unit 2, 
        a 220 megawatt natural gas-fired capacity resource and on Tucannon 
        River, a 267 MW wind farm. Engineering and design is underway for the 
        Carty Generating Station, a 440 MW natural gas-fired energy resource, 
        and construction is expected to begin in early 2014.
      
			
				General rate case&#8212;PGE filed a 2014 general rate case in 
        February and has settled all items with the Oregon Public Utility 
        Commission staff and interveners. Stipulating parties have settled on 
        an allowed return on equity of 9.75 percent and an average rate base 
        of $3.1 billion. The stipulated items, including a recent stipulation 
        on pension expense, result in an expected increase of $67 million in 
        annual revenue requirements. The company will provide a final update 
        on power costs in November and awaits a final order from the OPUC in 
        December.
      
			
				Generation plant outages&#8212;The Boardman and Colstrip coal-fired 
        plants both tripped off-line on July 1st due to equipment 
        failures. Boardman came back online at the end of July and Colstrip is 
        expected to come back online in the first quarter of 2014. Coyote 
        Springs, one of PGE&#8217;s natural gas-fired plants, tripped off-line in 
        late August due to cracks in the steam turbine rotor. Repairs to the 
        plant are underway and Coyote Springs is expected to be online later 
        this month. PGE&#8217;s share of repair costs for the coal plants - 
        approximately $13 million - is expected to be covered by insurance, 
        net of approximately $2 million in deductibles. Repair costs for 
        Coyote Springs are estimated to be $2 million. All together, 
        replacement power costs in 2013 for the three outages are expected to 
        be $16 to $18 million.
      
			
				Transmission discussions with the Bonneville Power Administration&#8212;In 
        late October, PGE and BPA agreed to discontinue discussions regarding 
        PGE&#8217;s potential ownership of approximately 1,500 MW of BPA&#8217;s 
        transmission capacity rights. PGE and BPA concluded that they would 
        not be able to reach an agreement on financial terms that benefited 
        both PGE and BPA customers. At this time, PGE has determined that 
        transmission service offered under BPA&#8217;s open access transmission 
        tariff is the best option for meeting its current transmission needs.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Third quarter operating results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues decreased $15 million, or 3 percent, to $435 million in 
      the third quarter of 2013 from $450 million in the third quarter of 2012 
      primarily due to the net effect of the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        An $11 million decrease resulting from lower average prices due 
        primarily to the reduction in power costs as forecasted in the 
        company&#8217;s 2013 annual power cost update tariff and a slightly larger 
        portion of energy deliveries going to customers who purchase their 
        energy from electricity service suppliers;
      
			
        A $7 million decrease related to the company&#8217;s power cost adjustment 
        mechanism, as the estimated refund to customers related to the 2011 
        PCAM was reduced in the third quarter of 2012 as a result of the 
        application of the regulated earnings test, with no estimated refund 
        to or collection from customers recorded in the third quarter of 2013; 
        and
      
			
        A $3 million decrease related to the decoupling mechanism, with a $1 
        million potential refund recorded in the third quarter of 2013 
        compared with a $2 million potential collection recorded in the third 
        quarter of 2012; partially offset by
      
			
        $3 million, or 16 percent, increase in wholesale revenues consisting 
        of a 57 percent increase in the average price of wholesale power and a 
        25 percent decrease in the volume sold; and
      
			
        A $2 million increase related to a 1 percent increase in the volume of 
        retail energy delivered primarily due to the effects of weather. 
        Residential energy deliveries were up 2 percent, while commercial and 
        industrial deliveries were comparable to the third quarter of 2012.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Purchased power and fuel expense increased $8 million, or 4 percent, for 
      the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012. The 
      increase consisted of $15 million related to a 9 percent increase in the 
      average variable power cost, which is largely due to the unplanned plant 
      outages, partially offset by $7 million related to a 4 percent decrease 
      in total system load. During the third quarter of 2013, the company 
      incurred approximately $11 million of incremental replacement power 
      costs related to the unplanned plant outages.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Production and distribution expense increased $5 million, or 10 percent, 
      in the third quarter of 2013 compared with the third quarter of 2012, 
      primarily due to planned higher operating and maintenance costs related 
      to the company&#8217;s distribution system, including technology upgrades as 
      well as increased repair and restoration work.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interest expense decreased $2 million, or 7 percent, in the third 
      quarter of 2013 compared with the third quarter of 2012, due to an 
      increase in the allowance for debt funds used for construction driven by 
      a higher average construction work-in-progress balance resulting from 
      the commencement of the construction of Port Westward Unit 2, Carty 
      Generating Station and Tucannon River Wind Farm in 2013, as well as a 
      decrease in interest expense driven by the timing of the maturities and 
      issuances of long-term debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other income, net increased $6 million in the third quarter of 2013 
      compared with the third quarter of 2012, primarily due to higher 
      earnings on the non-qualified benefit plan trust assets, as well as an 
      increase in the allowance for equity funds used for construction from 
      the higher average CWIP balance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Income tax expense was $4 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared 
      with $19 million in the third quarter of 2012. The decrease is primarily 
      due to the decrease in the annual estimated pre-tax income for 2013 
      compared to 2012, which was driven by the $52 million expense for 
      Cascade Crossing and a $9 million industrial customer refund both 
      recorded in the second quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2013 earnings guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PGE is reducing full-year 2013 earnings guidance from $1.25 to $1.40 per 
      share to $1.20 to $1.30 per share primarily due to replacement power 
      costs for the Coyote Springs outage. This guidance range is based on:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Weather-adjusted energy deliveries comparable to weather-adjusted 2012;
      
			
        Normal hydro conditions and wind conditions in line with expectations;
      
			
        Incremental replacement power costs of $16 million to $18 million for 
        the three plant outages;
      
			
        Ongoing operating and maintenance costs between $440 million and $460 
        million;
      
			
        Depreciation expense between $240 million and $250 million; and
      
			
        Capital expenditures between $710 million and $730 million.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Excluding the impacts of the Cascade Crossing charge and the customer 
      billing matter, PGE&#8217;s adjusted operating earnings guidance for 2013 
      would be $1.70 to $1.80 per share, as shown below:

      Rediff's Data Journalism Shows Congress Lags BJP, AAP on Twitter for

			Rediff uses political chatter on social media to analyze people&#8217;s 
      sentiments

		&lt;p&gt;
      Rediff&#8217;s foray into data journalism continues, with yet another 
      insightful analysis, this time of the political chatter in social media 
      connected to the upcoming Delhi Assembly Elections.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rediff Labs Initiative shows the Congress party lagging behind both 
      the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party, through an analysis of re-tweets of 
      personalities connected with all the three parties as well as senior 
      journalists.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysis is based on re-tweets as a re-tweet is seen as an 
      endorsement, and is presented visually of the network of twitter users 
      actively re-tweeting famous politicians and journalists.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A twitter user is connected to a politician/journalist if he/she has 
      re-tweeted their tweets. Different colours have been assigned to 
      different parties, green for Congress, dark saffron for BJP, olive green 
      for Aam Aadmi Party and purple for the journalists.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - A top Goldman Sachs banker in Asia is relocating to the United States to take on a global role, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, after playing a key part in the firm's efforts to broaden its business amid a drop in equity offering volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

The transactions earned Goldman hundreds of millions of dollars in fees according to media reports, and also attracted some criticism from Malaysian opposition politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment on Dees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources cited the opportunity to move up from a regional to a global role, and also family reasons, to explain Dees' departure from Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His wife and five children moved this summer to the U.S. West Coast, where the children are now in school, the people said. Before his six years in Hong Kong, Dees spent four years in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People familiar with the matter said Dees was among the bankers who worked around the clock to help AIG place $6 billion of AIA shares in March 2012, in one of Hong Kong's largest equity deals last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Goldman got the lead roles on the deal, specifying on term sheets that they were the "active" co-ordinators and bookrunners. That sparked a minor spat with the other underwriters, with banks complaining that the term sheets implied the rest were "passive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dees graduated from Duke University in 1992, going straight to Goldman in New York.

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects deal value, month in paragraph 9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Lawrence White and Michael Flaherty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Nov 1 (Reuters) - A top Goldman Sachs banker in
Asia is relocating to the United States to take on a global
role, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, after
playing a key part in the firm's efforts to broaden its business
amid a drop in equity offering volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan Dees, Goldman's co-head of investment banking for Asia,
is expected to move within the next few months, the sources
said. They could not confirm the exact title the American banker
will take on, but said it would be a global appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman earned large fees on a few select deals in Asia in
the last year, during which investment banks across the region
took on more complex financings and aimed for solo bookrunning
offerings rather than depending on the steady volume of equity
issuance they previously enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Goldman's Asia investment banking revamp,
Missouri-born Dees, 43, played a key role in two of Asia's three
largest ever initial public offerings: the $22.12 billion
listing of the Agricultural Bank of China and the
$20.5 billion flotation of insurer AIA Group Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other top Goldman deals this year included the latest in a
series of three bond sales for Malaysian state investment fund
1Malaysia Development Bhd. The transactions earned Goldman

and partner in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CO-HEADS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman named Dees and Matthew Westerman as its top Asia
investment bankers in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they took over as investment bank co-heads, Westerman
had most recently been global head of equity capital markets,
while Dees was the head of the financing group in Asia-Pacific
and chairman of the financing group for Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their priority was to continue the bank's efforts to
diversify revenues in Goldman Sachs' core investment banking
business in Asia, which, in common with other Wall Street banks,
had relied heavily on underwriting bumper stock offerings from
China's state-backed companies and other Greater China deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dwindling supply of those deals, coupled with a
proliferation in the number of underwriters handling them,
prompted Goldman to expand its smaller-than-average debt capital
markets platform and its derivatives business in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those businesses have become more lucrative as Asia's top
companies mature and demand more regular, and more
sophisticated, funding and hedging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010 and 2011, the majority of Goldman's Asia investment
banking revenues came from equity and M advisory fees,
according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman earned an estimated $346 million in Asia
Pacific investment banking, Thomson Reuters data show. That
revenue was spread across equity, bonds, loans and M, with
bonds taking the lion's share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the third quarter of 2012, investment banks made more
money from debt deals than underwriting stock offerings for the
first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People familiar with the matter say that Goldman is on track
to set a record for revenue this year for Asia Pacific
investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank may have earned as much as $700 million from
arranging private bond placements for 1MDB, according to
calculations by IFR magazine, a Thomson Reuters publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it earned more than $40 million, one source told Reuters
at the time, for its exclusive handling of China state oil
refiner Sinopec 's 3.1 billion share offer in February
this year.

			Pfizer Receives FDA Approval for a Prior Approval Supplement for 
      EMBEDA&#174; (morphine sulfate and naltrexone 
      hydrochloride) Extended Release Capsules CII
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) has approved a Prior Approval Supplement for EMBEDA&#174; 
      (morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride) Extended Release 
      Capsules CII.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Prior Approval Supplement included an update to the EMBEDA 
      manufacturing process that addressed the pre-specified stability 
      requirement that led to the voluntary recall of EMBEDA from the market 
      in March 2011. Pfizer anticipates product availability in the second 
      quarter of 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About EMBEDA
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EMBEDA is indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a 
      continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended 
      period of time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Limitations of Use
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        EMBEDA is not for use as an as-needed (prn) analgesic, for pain that 
        is mild or not expected to persist for an extended period of time, for 
        acute pain, for postoperative pain, unless the patient is already 
        receiving chronic opioid therapy prior to surgery, or if the 
        postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist 
        for an extended period of time
      
			
        EMBEDA 100mg/4mg capsules are only for patients in whom tolerance to 
        an opioid of comparable potency is established.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BOXED WARNING:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ABUSE POTENTIAL, LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, ACCIDENTAL 
      EXPOSURE, and INTERACTION WITH ALCOHOL
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Abuse Potential
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			EMBEDA contains pellets of morphine sulfate, an opioid agonist, with 
      a sequestered core of naltrexone hydrochloride, an opioid receptor 
      antagonist.
			Morphine sulfate is a Schedule II controlled 
      substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid agonists, 
      legal or illicit. Assess each patient&#8217;s risk for opioid abuse or 
      addiction prior to prescribing EMBEDA. The risk for opioid abuse is 
      increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance 
      abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness 
      (e.g., major depressive disorder). Routinely monitor all patients 
      receiving EMBEDA for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction during 
      treatment.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Life-threatening Respiratory Depression
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Respiratory depression, including fatal cases, may occur with use of 
      EMBEDA, even when the drug has been used as recommended and not misused 
      or abused. Proper dosing and titration are essential and EMBEDA should 
      only be prescribed by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in 
      the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. Monitor 
      for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of EMBEDA or 
      following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow EMBEDA 
      capsules whole or to sprinkle the contents of the capsule on applesauce 
      and swallow immediately without chewing. Crushing, dissolving, or 
      chewing the pellets within the capsule can cause rapid release and 
      absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Accidental Exposure
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Accidental ingestion of EMBEDA, especially in children, can result in 
      a fatal overdose of morphine.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Interaction with Alcohol
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The co-ingestion of alcohol with EMBEDA may result in an increase of 
      plasma levels and potentially fatal overdose of morphine. Instruct 
      patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or 
      non-prescription products that contain alcohol while on EMBEDA therapy.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Contraindications EMBEDA is contraindicated in patients with 
      significant respiratory depression, acute or severe bronchial asthma in 
      an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment, 
      known or suspected paralytic ileus, or hypersensitivity (e.g., 
      anaphylaxis) to morphine or naltrexone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Abuse Potential EMBEDA contains morphine, an opioid agonist and a 
      Schedule II controlled substance. Morphine can be abused in a manner 
      similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. Such opioid agonists 
      are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are 
      subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or 
      dispensing EMBEDA where there is concern about increased risks of 
      misuse, abuse, or diversion. Misuse or abuse of EMBEDA by crushing, 
      chewing, snorting or injecting the dissolved product will result in the 
      uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk that 
      could result in overdose and death, and may also result in release of 
      sufficient naltrexone to precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent 
      individuals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Life Threatening Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is 
      the primary risk of EMBEDA and may lead to respiratory arrest and death. 
      Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to 
      breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a 
      &#8220;sighing&#8221; pattern of breathing. Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
      retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the 
      sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal 
      respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of EMBEDA, 
      the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a 
      dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when 
      initiating therapy with EMBEDA and following dose increases. Instruct 
      patients against use by individuals other than the patient for whom 
      EMBEDA was prescribed and to keep EMBEDA out of the reach of children, 
      as such inappropriate use may result in fatal respiratory depression.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Accidental Exposure Accidental ingestion of EMBEDA, especially in 
      children, can result in a fatal overdose of morphine.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Interaction with Alcohol The co-ingestion of alcohol with EMBEDA 
      can result in an increase of morphine plasma levels and potentially 
      fatal overdose of morphine. Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic 
      beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products containing 
      alcohol while on EMBEDA therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory 
      depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated 
      patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat 
      stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance compared to younger, 
      healthier patients. Therefore, monitor such patients closely, 
      particularly when initiating and titrating EMBEDA and when EMBEDA is 
      given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Use with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with 
      significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and 
      patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, 
      hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory 
      depression, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of EMBEDA 
      may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. Consider the use 
      of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Hypotensive Effects EMBEDA may cause severe hypotension including 
      orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an 
      increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has 
      already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent 
      administration of certain CNS depressant drugs. Monitor these patients 
      for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of 
      EMBEDA. In patients with circulatory shock, EMBEDA may cause 
      vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 
      Avoid the use of EMBEDA in patients with circulatory shock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Use with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor 
      patients taking EMBEDA who may be susceptible to the intracranial 
      effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and 
      respiratory depression as EMBEDA may reduce respiratory drive and the 
      resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial 
      pressure. Avoid the use of EMBEDA in patients with impaired 
      consciousness or coma.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Use with Gastrointestinal Conditions EMBEDA is contraindicated in 
      patients with paralytic ileus. Avoid the use of EMBEDA in patients with 
      other GI obstruction. The morphine in EMBEDA may cause spasm of the 
      sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, 
      including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause 
      increases in the serum amylase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Use with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The morphine in EMBEDA 
      may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may 
      induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist 
      analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of 
      therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic. Mixed agonists/antagonists 
      analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate 
      withdrawal symptoms. Consuming crushed, chewed or dissolved EMBEDA 
      capsules can release sufficient naltrexone to precipitate withdrawal in 
      opioid&#8211;dependent individuals, which usually appear within 5 minutes and 
      can last up to 48 hours. When discontinuing EMBEDA, gradually taper the 
      dose and do not abruptly discontinue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Driving and Operating Machinery EMBEDA may impair the mental or 
      physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities 
      such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive 
      or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects 
      of EMBEDA and know how they will react to the medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Adverse Reactions Most common adverse reactions (10%)are 
      constipation, nausea, and somnolence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Administration Considerations Individualize dosing based on 
      patient&#8217;s prior analgesic treatment experience, and titrate as needed to 
      provide adequate analgesia and minimize adverse reactions. When EMBEDA 
      is the first opioid analgesic, initiate EMBEDA therapy with the 20 
      mg/0.8 mg capsule. Instruct patients to swallow EMBEDA capsules intact, 
      or to sprinkle the capsule contents on applesauce and immediately 
      swallow without chewing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Drug Interactions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Concomitant use of alcohol with EMBEDA can result in an increase of 
        morphine plasma levels and potentially fatal overdose of morphine.
      
			
        Concurrent use of EMBEDA and other central nervous system depressants 
        (e.g. sedatives, hypnotics, general anesthetics, antiemetics, 
        phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and alcohol) can increase the 
        risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or 
        coma.
      
			
        Mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, 
        butorphanol) may reduce the analgesic effect of EMBEDA and/or may 
        precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. Avoid the use of 
        agonist/antagonist analgesics in patients receiving EMBEDA.
      
			
        Opioids may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal 
        relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.
      
			
        The effects of morphine may be potentiated by MAOIs. MAOIs have been 
        reported to potentiate the effects of morphine anxiety, confusion, and 
        significant depression of respiration or coma. EMBEDA should not be 
        used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such 
        treatment.
      
			
        Cimetidine can potentiate morphine-induced respiratory depression. 
        There is a report of confusion and severe respiratory depression when 
        a patient undergoing hemodialysis was concurrently administered 
        morphine and cimetidine.
      
			
        Morphine can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release 
        of antidiuretic hormone. Morphine may also lead to acute retention of 
        urine by causing spasm of the sphincter of the bladder, particularly 
        in men with enlarged prostates.
      
			
        Anticholinergics or other drugs with anticholinergic activity when 
        used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk 
        of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to 
        paralytic ileus.
      
			
        PGP inhibitors (e.g. quinidine) may increase the absorption/exposure 
        of morphine by about two-fold.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp's patent demand against Twitter Inc as it approaches an initial public offering highlights how few patents the social media company possesses compared with the established tech players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has accused Twitter of infringing three IBM patents, one of which relates to online advertising, according to a Twitter securities filing on Monday. Twitter said it has "meritorious defenses" to those claims, and IBM has not filed a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Twitter spokesman declined to comment beyond the filing, and an IBM representative also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long a prodigious stockpiler of intellectual property, IBM currently holds nearly 87,000 U.S. patents and published applications, according to a government database. Twitter, meanwhile, has only three. This suggests that the legal maneuvers involving IBM and Twitter will increase the pressure on Twitter to buy more patents, in order to build its leverage against older tech companies, patent experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not about the patents, it's about signaling to the market that you have a strong position so people don't line up to sue you," said Ron Laurie, a specialist in IP and investment banking for Inflexion Point Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patent claims against companies approaching an IPO are relatively common, as plaintiffs hope the need for a target company to minimize risks might force a lucrative settlement. In September, Twitter was sued twice for patent infringement the same week it announced its plans to go public, according to records maintained by Westlaw, a Thomson Reuters unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter raised the top end of its IPO price range by 25 percent on Monday, to $23 to $25 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Yahoo Inc sued Facebook Inc for patent infringement two months before Facebook's IPO. Yahoo eventually withdrew the lawsuit after a new Yahoo chief executive took over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Facebook ramped up a patent-buying spree shortly after the lawsuit was filed. Facebook bought 750 patents from IBM for an undisclosed sum, and then paid Microsoft Corp $550 million for hundreds of patents that originated with AOL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading up to its IPO, Facebook had disclosed 559 U.S. patents and applications. The company currently owns 2,151 patents and applications, according to the government's database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter has been vocal in the ongoing debate over how strong patent protections should be when it comes to software. Last year the company announced that it would not use patents for offensive purposes without permission from the employee who invented the technology. The company would only use patents defensively, it said, which means the patents could be used to countersue anyone who had struck first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the specific patents cited by IBM may not stand up in court, it is the threat from a company with so many resources that affects Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may turn out that these patents, under close scrutiny, are not terribly impactful," said Sanjay Prasad, an intellectual property consultant in Silicon Valley. "But there's a different issue of public perception, and in an IPO that can be important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

Machines Corp's patent demand against Twitter Inc

court, it is the threat from a company with so many resources
that affects Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may turn out that these patents, under close scrutiny,
are not terribly impactful," said Sanjay Prasad, an intellectual
property consultant in Silicon Valley. "But there's a different
issue of public perception, and in an IPO that can be
important."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 4 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange's
proposals to cut queues to get metal out of the warehouses could
increase price volatility and reduce transparency as more metal
moves off the exchange, Goldman Sachs said in a research
note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LME, the world's largest metals marketplace, has come
under regulatory and legal scrutiny over its metal storage
practices, with complaints about months-long queues to withdraw
physical metal from its warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clients of the warehouses say the system inflates the cost,
or premium, to secure metal. This is particularly so for
aluminium, which is used in packaging and transport, even though
the market is in global oversupply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, the LME proposed new rules to overhaul the
delivery system from next April that would force warehouses to
release more stocks once the wait-time breaches 100 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exchange, acquired by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing
 last year, said last month it had made a decision on
its proposal, and would reveal details at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which owns metals warehousing firm Metro but has
Chinese Walls between its research, banking divisions and
warehousing operations, said premium volatility had indeed
increased the cost of using the LME as a hedge against physical
prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly, should these costs increase, the demand for the
LME as a hedging tool against physical price risk may decline,"
Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But going too far in the other direction in managing this
basis (premium) risk may also impact the economic role of the
exchange market - reducing transparency, liquidity and impacting
the ability of the LME to create a buyer of first resort and
seller of last restort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support the mechanism of physical delivery of its futures
contracts the LME approves and licenses a network of around 700
warehouses across 36 locations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Increasing the load-out rate potentially lowers
transparency and increased LME rents and delivery-out charges as
warehouses attempt to recoup the costs of investing in
additional capacity to load out," Goldman Sachs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And limiting the load-in rate reduces the LME's ability to
create a market of last resort in times of surplus, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We find that 'managing' the queue by the LME could have
significant direct costs in the proper functioning of the
exchange which can increase price volatility and indirect social
costs by reducing transparency as more metal moves off
exchange," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LME warehouses hold 5.4 million tonnes of aluminium, but it
is concentrated in only two locations: Detroit, where Goldman's
Metro dominates, and Vlissingen in the Netherlands,
Glencore-Xstrata's Pacorini stronghold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metal buyers' complaints have resulted in U.S.-based
lawsuits by consumers, distributors and others alleging
aluminium price-fixing and anti-competitive behaviour by
investment banks, large trading houses and the LME.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, a defendant in some of the lawsuits, has dismissed
the lawsuits against them as without merit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 4 (Reuters) - U.S. computer software company Microsoft
Corp said on Monday it signed a 20-year power purchase
agreement for wind energy in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in a blog the agreement was part of its
commitment last year to become carbon neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will buy all of the energy from RES
Americas' 110-megawatt Keechi wind project, which is under
development near Jacksboro, about 70 miles (113 km) northwest of
Fort Worth. RES Americas is a unit of privately held, UK-based
renewable energy developer RES Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the wind farm is on the same electric grid
that powers its San Antonio data center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RES will begin construction of Keechi in early 2014 and will
begin delivering power in 2015. The wind farm will include 55
wind turbines manufactured mostly in Colorado by a unit of
Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas Wind Systems A/S
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in the blog, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency has recognized the company as the second
largest purchaser of green power in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said the Keechi wind power purchase "will
certainly not be our last."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is not alone among technology companies buying
renewable power. Google Inc, Apple Inc,
Facebook Inc, Rackspace Hosting Inc and
Salesforce.com Inc have all committed to powering their
data centers with more renewable power.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Award Recognizes Exemplary Service of a Senior Civilian, Eligible 
      for Regular Membership in the Naval Order, Whose Achievements Set 
      Individual Apart From Peers

      CACI International Inc (NYSE:CACI) 
      announced today that Dr. J.P. (Jack) London, USN (Ret.), CACI Executive 
      Chairman and Chairman of the Board, was honored with the Admiral of the 
      Navy George Dewey Award by the Naval Order of the United States. The 
      award, established in 2001, honors a U.S. citizen eligible for 
      membership in the Naval Order for unique achievements based on 
      exceptional insight, persistent effort, and firm determination to 
      continually advance the interests of the U.S. and its Sea Services. The 
      presentation was made at a formal ceremony during the Naval Order&#8217;s 
      annual congress in Charleston, S.C. on November 2.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Naval Order of the United States was founded in 1890 by descendants 
      of New England seafarers in support of the seagoing services based on 
      their own and their ancestors&#8217; military maritime service. The Order&#8217;s 
      &#8220;charge&#8221; is to encourage research and writing on naval and maritime 
      subjects and to promote the preservation of historic artifacts and 
      memories of naval and maritime history. London&#8217;s ancestor, Captain 
      Samuel Nicholson, served in the American Revolution (1776-83) and was 
      the first commanding officer of the USS Constitution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. London is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy (1959) and the Naval 
      Postgraduate School (1967). He holds a doctorate in business 
      administration conferred &#8220;with distinction&#8221; from George Washington 
      University (1971). In 2011, he was inducted into the Naval Postgraduate 
      School Hall of Fame, honoring alumni who have made the greatest 
      contributions to society, their nations, and the university. Earlier 
      this year, he was honored with the Nathan Hale Award from the Reserve 
      Officers Association. Dr. London serves on many boards, including the 
      Board of Directors of the U.S. Naval Institute, the U.S. Navy Memorial 
      Foundation, and the Naval Historical Foundation. He is also an active 
      member of the Navy League and the Naval Order of the United States. He 
      recently authored a book, Character: the Ultimate Success Factor, 
      that provides an insightful and practical demonstration of how 
      character, expressed through attitudes, actions, and resilience, is the 
      key to long-term success. Many of the anecdotes about character and 
      leadership in the book are from his Navy career.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During his 12 years of active duty as a Naval Officer (1959-1971) during 
      the Cold War, he was a naval aviator and carrier pilot serving with U.S. 
      Navy &#8220;hunter-killer&#8221; task forces arrayed against the Soviet Union&#8217;s 
      strategic nuclear submarine threat. He served during the Cuban Missile 
      Crisis quarantine (1962-63). At the height of the Vietnam War, he served 
      as aide and administrative assistant to Adm. J.D. (Jack) Arnold, the 
      Vice Chief of the Naval Material Command, Department of the Navy. Dr. 
      London left active duty in 1971 and joined the U.S. Navy Reserve, 
      retiring as a captain in 1983, after having served as commanding officer 
      of aeronautical engineering units with the Naval Air Systems Command, 
      Washington, D.C. Following active service, he was instrumental in 
      helping to build CACI into a worldwide information solutions and 
      services company with approximately 15,000 employees serving vital 
      national needs in defense, intelligence, homeland security, and the 
      modernization of government.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since the Navy became CACI&#8217;s first customer more than 50 years ago, the 
      company has supported numerous mission-critical programs for the 
      service. CACI solutions and services for the Navy range from systems 
      engineering and special communications requirements, to logistics and 
      material readiness, to fleet maintenance and aviation training.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the award, Dr. London noted, &#8220;I am both honored to be 
      recognized by such a remarkable organization as the Naval Order and 
      humbled to be the recipient of this prestigious award. It is always a 
      privilege to be able to represent the people of CACI in any way that 
      advances the best interests of our great nation and the inspiring 
      traditions of the U.S. Navy that are so integral to the story of 
      America.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Admiral Gregory G. Johnson, USN (Ret.), CACI Board member, said, &#8220;We are 
      pleased that the Naval Order of the United States has acknowledged Dr. 
      London&#8217;s achievements with the Admiral of the Navy George Dewey Award. 
      As a lifelong student of history, Jack has always had a keen interest in 
      and has strongly supported all the memorable facets of the U.S. Navy 
      that have made it the world&#8217;s premier sea power.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;RIYADH (Reuters) - The streets of the Saudi capital Riyadh were unusually quiet on Monday as many expatriates stayed at home to avoid the start of a government crackdown on illegal foreign workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building sites were deserted, Riyadh's stuttering rush-hour traffic flowed smoothly and many shops and market stalls were closed in normally busy neighborhoods that are home to large numbers of Saudi Arabia's lower-income foreign community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government of the world's top oil exporter has promised raids on businesses, markets and residential areas to catch expatriates whose visas are invalid because they are not working for the company that 'sponsored' their entry into the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Riyadh Industrial Zone, where many workers are foreigners, most shops were closed on Monday morning, according to a witness who said he saw a dozen people scurry for cover when they heard a police siren from a nearby road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nobody has come to buy anything at all today. It's a very bad situation," said Abu Safwat, a Syrian who owns a machine parts shop in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enforcement of visa rules is another effort to end a black market for cheap imported workers, cut the foreign labor force and free up private-sector jobs for Saudi nationals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The field security campaign, in coordination with the Labour Ministry, will take place in all cities, provinces, villages and rural towns," Interior Ministry spokesman Major-General Mansour Turki said in a statement on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official Saudi unemployment rate of 12 percent excludes a large number of citizens who say they are not seeking a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising private sector employment in a country where most Saudis are in government jobs, and where businesses employ more foreigners than locals, is a major challenge for the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About nine million foreigners, mostly unskilled laborers or domestic workers, live alongside 18 million Saudis. The money they send home is vital for their own nations, such as Yemen, Ethiopia, the Philippines, Indonesia, India, Pakistan and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LABOUR BLACK MARKET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, Saudi authorities ignored irregularities such as working for firms that had not sponsored their visas or in trades other than those listed on their immigration documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That spurred a black market in which foreigners overstayed visas, set up illegal businesses or took low-paid jobs in areas where authorities wanted Saudi workers hired on higher salaries - thwarting implementation of wide-ranging labour reforms that penalize companies for hiring more foreigners than locals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March the labour and interior ministries began raiding offices and markets before declaring an amnesty in April to enable foreigners to correct their visas without being fined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the amnesty expired on Monday the government issued repeated warnings for foreigners to correct their status or face punishments including prison, fines and deportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies employing expatriates without proper visas will also be fined, as will people or firms that charge expatriates a fee to sponsor their visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want foreigners to remain in the kingdom lawfully," said Deputy Labour Minister Mufrej al-Haqbani in remarks quoted by the local Arab News English-language daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long queue stretched down the road outside one visa office as Arab and South Asian foreign workers tried to leave without paying fines for overstaying. Some carried personal possessions in hopes of leaving immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Sri Lankan woman working as a freelance maid in Riyadh said she and several of her friends had decided to stay at home in case they were caught up in government raids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Batha district, home to many low-paid foreigners, some shops were shut and only Saudi employees were working in others. Market stalls had vanished from the normally busy street where vendors hawk fruit, vegetables, clothes and mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Angus McDowall and Marwa Rashad; Editing by Alistair Lyon)&lt;/p&gt;

			Foster Wheeler Selected for Initial Feed by Rosneft and ExxonMobil 
      for Proposed LNG Project in Russian Far East
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Foster Wheeler AG (Nasdaq:FWLT) announced today that a subsidiary of its 
      Global Engineering and Construction Group has been selected by Rosneft 
      and ExxonMobil to undertake the initial phase of the front-end 
      engineering design (FEED) for a proposed Russian Far East liquefied 
      natural gas (LNG) project. Foster Wheeler is one of two companies to be 
      awarded separate contracts for the initial FEED work prior to selection 
      of a single contractor for the second FEED phase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Foster Wheeler contract value was not disclosed and will be included 
      in the company&#8217;s fourth-quarter 2013 bookings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Foster Wheeler will undertake preliminary engineering and execution 
      planning for the LNG plant and associated gas pipelines, infrastructure 
      and marine facilities. The work will include location and concept 
      studies, design basis definition, main technical solutions development, 
      constructability assessment, definition of project execution strategies 
      and preparation of preliminary information for submission to the Russian 
      authorities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are delighted to have been selected by two of the world's major oil 
      and gas operators for this LNG liquefaction project in the Russian Far 
      East,&#8221; said Umberto della Sala, President and Chief Operating Officer of 
      Foster Wheeler AG. &#8220;This award is testament to Foster Wheeler's proven 
      capabilities in the design and construction of large-scale LNG 
      facilities in remote, challenging and environmentally sensitive 
      locations. Our proven track record in the delivery of LNG plants using 
      modularization and pre-fabrication strategies will be a key factor in 
      the development of robust and efficient concepts during the initial 
      front-end design phase.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased with the technical progress of our joint team of experts 
      from Rosneft and ExxonMobil,&#8221; said Igor Sechin, President, Rosneft. 
      &#8220;With our initial FEED contractors on board now we will see the project 
      begin to take shape in a matter of months. We are taking a determined 
      approach with this project to help monetize the gas resources of Russia.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Safe Harbor Statement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Foster Wheeler AG news releases may contain forward-looking statements 
      that are based on management&#8217;s assumptions, expectations and projections 
      about the Company and the various industries within which the Company 
      operates. These include statements regarding the Company&#8217;s expectations 
      about revenues (including as expressed by its backlog), its liquidity, 
      the outcome of litigation and legal proceedings and recoveries from 
      customers for claims and the costs of current and future asbestos claims 
      and the amount and timing of related insurance recoveries. Such 
      forward-looking statements by their nature involve a degree of risk and 
      uncertainty. The Company cautions that a variety of factors, including 
      but not limited to the factors described in the Company&#8217;s most recent 
      Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the 
      quarter ended March 31, 2013 which were filed with the U.S. Securities 
      and Exchange Commission, and the following, could cause the Company&#8217;s 
      business conditions and results to differ materially from what is 
      contained in forward-looking statements: benefits, effects or results of 
      the Company&#8217;s redomestication to Switzerland, benefits, effects or 
      results of the Company&#8217;s strategic renewal initiative, further 
      deterioration in global economic conditions, changes in investment by 
      the oil and gas, oil refining, chemical/petrochemical and power 
      generation industries, changes in the financial condition of its 
      customers, changes in regulatory environments, changes in project design 
      or schedules, contract cancellations, the changes in estimates made by 
      the Company of costs to complete projects, changes in trade, monetary 
      and fiscal policies worldwide, compliance with laws and regulations 
      relating to the Company&#8217;s global operations, currency fluctuations, war, 
      terrorist attacks and/or natural disasters affecting facilities either 
      owned by the Company or where equipment or services are or may be 
      provided by the Company, interruptions to shipping lanes or other 
      methods of transit, outcomes of pending and future litigation, including 
      litigation regarding the Company&#8217;s liability for damages and insurance 
      coverage for asbestos exposure, protection and validity of the Company&#8217;s 
      patents and other intellectual property rights, increasing global 
      competition, compliance with its debt covenants, recoverability of 
      claims against the Company&#8217;s customers and others by the Company and 
      claims by third parties against the Company, and changes in estimates 
      used in its critical accounting policies. Other factors and assumptions 
      not identified above were also involved in the formation of these 
      forward-looking statements and the failure of such other assumptions to 
      be realized, as well as other factors, may also cause actual results to 
      differ materially from those projected. Most of these factors are 
      difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond the Company&#8217;s 
      control. You should consider the areas of risk described above in 
      connection with any forward-looking statements that may be made by the 
      Company. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any 
      forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, 
      future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any 
      additional disclosures the Company makes in proxy statements, quarterly 
      reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K and current reports on 
      Form 8-K filed or furnished with to the Securities and Exchange

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Nov 6 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Asset
Management's chairman in Asia Pacific, Oliver Bolitho, will
retire at the end of 2013 after 15 years at the firm, according
to an internal memo obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolitho, who will take an advisory director's role at the
firm, moved to Hong Kong in 2007 and became the head of the unit
in the region in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He became the chairman last year after Sheila Patel took
over as the head of International Goldman Sachs Asset Management
responsible for EMEA as well as Asia Pacific ex-Japan, according
to another memo sent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will not replace Bolitho's role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian Investor had reported the news earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has narrowed its list of external candidates to replace Chief Executive Steve Ballmer to about five people, including Ford Motor Co chief Alan Mulally and former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, according to sources familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker also has at least three internal candidates on its shortlist, including former Skype CEO Tony Bates, who is now responsible for Microsoft's business development, and Satya Nadella, the company's cloud and enterprise chief, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the narrower list - the company started with about 40 names - the process could take a few more months, the sources said. In August, Ballmer said he would retire within 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The names of other candidates could not be learned, but the search committee is interviewing executives from a wide range of sectors, including life sciences and consumer, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to comment on the process and on behalf of the internal candidates. A Nokia representatives could not be reached immediately for comment late on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford spokesman Jay Cooney said: "There is no change from what we announced last November. Alan remains fully focused on continuing to make progress on our One Ford plan. We do not engage in speculation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have pushed Microsoft's board in recent months to look for a turnaround expert, such as Mulally or Computer Sciences Corp CEO Mike Lawrie, to succeed Ballmer. Some investors have also suggested to the board that co-founder Bill Gates should step down from his role as chairman, saying he stands in the way of radical reform at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft remains highly profitable and last month beat Wall Street's quarterly profit and revenue forecasts. But it has lost ground to Apple Inc and Google Inc in mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer has focused on making devices, such as the Surface tablet and Xbox gaming console, and turning key software into services provided over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors say that a new chief should not be bound by that strategy. They are concerned that, with both Gates and Ballmer up for re-election to Microsoft's board, they will retain their influence over the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates has focused his day-to-day efforts on philanthropy since 2008 when he vacated his office on campus. People close to him say he is not considering a return to the CEO position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the CEO search committee have been speaking with dissenting shareholders, according to sources familiar with the conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activist shareholder ValueAct Capital Management was offered a board seat by Microsoft in August. Several sources said the investor will also be given the same access as the board to the final five candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO CANDIDATES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulally, 68, is credited with inspiring a cultural change that helped Ford reverse its losses and avert a federal bailout in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear when Mulally will leave Ford, which he has led since 2006. He has repeatedly said he plans to adhere to his agreement to stay with Ford until the end of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But people familiar with the matter have previously said that Mulally is open to other opportunities and may leave Ford earlier if another job presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop ran Microsoft's business software division before jumping ship to Nokia in 2010. Although he is seen as an external candidate for the Microsoft CEO job, he is set to return to his former employer after the closure of its 5.44 billion euro acquisition of Nokia's handset business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nokia deal, which came soon after Ballmer's surprise decision to retire, was widely seen as putting Elop among the list of successors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the two known internal candidates have been gaining prominence within Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bates came to Microsoft two years ago as CEO of the acquired Skype and was recently elevated to lead the technology giant's business development and overall strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella's group is coming to the fore as the company struggles to catch up in online and mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Nadia Damouni; Additional reporting by Bill Rigby, Deepa Seetharaman and Nicola Leske; Editing by Paritosh Bansal, Andre Grenon and Richard Pullin)&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Management Commentary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Results in the quarter were strong, driven by returns from our growth capital investments and contributions from all three divisions," said Al Cadotte, President and CEO of Newalta. "We continue to focus on delivering creative solutions for our customers and the recent collaboration with DuPont Canada is one example of how we're moving forward with these initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to make excellent progress in the execution of our business plan. The 2013 capital program is fully committed with investments prioritized towards areas that provide the highest returns, more stable cash flows and lowest risk. Our growth investments this year will drive strong performance and attractive returns in 2014 and beyond."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consolidated Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third quarter revenue was up 12% to $212.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $51.2 million compared to Q3 2012. Improved results were primarily driven by contributions from growth investments in New Markets and higher event-based business at our Stoney Creek Landfill ("SCL"), further enhanced by a positive impact from commodity prices. Net earnings in the quarter decreased to $13.2 million compared to $15.2 million in the prior year. Excluding higher stock-based compensation expense, net finance charges related to a non-cash loss on embedded derivatives and income tax expense, net earnings would have increased 32% to $20.4 million compared to Q3 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year to date, revenue increased 10% to $579.6 million compared to prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $117.3 million, 8% higher than prior year, driven by contributions from growth investments in New Markets and Oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operational Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from New Markets in the quarter and year-to-date increased 11% and 21%, respectively, to $68.1 million and $165.0 million compared to prior year. Gross profit in the quarter and year-to-date increased 12% and 13%, respectively, to $25.1 million and $57.5 million compared to 2012. Strong performance in the quarter and year-to-date was primarily driven by returns from growth capital invested, including our two contracts to process mature fine tailings ("MFT").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Oilfield in the quarter and year-to-date was $49.0 million and $137.1 million, respectively, up slightly from prior year. Gross profit in the quarter and year-to-date increased 19% and 13%, respectively, to $19.9 million and $52.9 million compared to prior year. Positive results were driven by contributions from growth capital investments and improved commodity prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Industrial in the quarter and year-to-date increased 17% and 9%, respectively, to $95.1 million and $277.4 million compared to prior year. Gross profit in the quarter increased 46% to $14.2 million compared to prior year. Year-to-date gross profit was $32.1 million, flat to prior year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Highlights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta's Board of Directors declared a third quarter dividend of $0.11 per share ($0.44 per share annualized) paid October 15, 2013 to shareholders of record on September 30, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from contracts (fee for service solutions with terms longer than one year and no direct commodity price exposure) generated 13% of consolidated revenue trailing twelve months ("TTM") Q3 2013, compared to 8% in TTM Q3 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 were $43.4 million and $98.9 million, respectively, focused primarily on growth capital projects in New Markets and Oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio improved to 2.52 in Q3 2013, from 2.74 in Q2 2013. We anticipate ending the year at or about 2.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 17, 2013, we announced a development agreement with DuPont Canada to test an innovative water processing technology in the Alberta oil and gas industry. The water processing technology removes solids from water and facilitates a higher level of water re-use for customers at their sites. The collaboration between the companies will combine DuPont's innovative scientific and technical expertise with Newalta's operating capabilities and customer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2013 is expected to be approximately 20% higher than last year, based on commodity prices and drilling activity remaining at Q3 levels. Growth capital investments made over the past 18 months continue to deliver strong returns. SCL volumes are anticipated to be at the annual permitted capacity by the end of the year, or approximately 132,000 MT in Q4. Ville Ste-Catherine ("VSC") volumes in the fourth quarter are expected to be in line with our historical quarterly average. Performance in New Markets and Oilfield for the second half of 2013 remains in line with management's expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our 2013 capital budget of $190 million is fully committed. We continue to focus on growing our portfolio of longer term contracts, strengthening our foundation of stable cash flow, and maximizing returns from our existing assets. We have good visibility on our pipeline of organic growth capital projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly Conference Call&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management will hold a conference call on Wednesday, November 6, 2013 at 11:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss Newalta's performance for the third quarter ended September 30, 2013.

In particular, forward-looking statements included or incorporated by reference in this document include statements with respect to: &lt;/p&gt;
			
				future operating and financial results;
				anticipated industry activity levels;
            expected demand for our services;
            business prospects and strategy;
            capital expenditure programs and other expenditures;
            the amount of dividends declared or payable in the future;
            realization of anticipated benefits of growth capital investments, acquisitions and our technical development initiatives;
            our projected cost structure; and
            expectations and implications of changes in legislation. 
			&lt;p&gt;Such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, without limitation:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				general market conditions of the industries we service;
				strength of the oil and gas industry, including drilling activity;
				fluctuations in commodity prices for oil and the price we received for our recovered oil;
				fluctuations in commodity prices for lead including the price differential we pay for lead feedstock and the price we receive for our lead products;
				fluctuations in base oil prices including the price differential we pay for used oil and the price we receive for our finished lube oil products;
				fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates;
				supply of waste lead acid batteries as feedstock to support direct lead sales;
				demand for our finished lead products by the battery manufacturing industry;
				our ability to secure future capital to support and develop our business, including the issuance of additional common shares;
				the highly regulated nature of the environmental services and waste management business in which we operate;
				dependence on our senior management team and other operations management personnel with waste industry experience;
				the competitive environment of our industry in Canada and the U.S.;
				success of our growth, acquisition and technical development strategies including integration of businesses and processes into our operations and potential liabilities from acquisitions;
				potential operational and safety risks and hazards and obtaining insurance for such risks and hazards on reasonable financial terms;
				the seasonal nature of our operations;
				costs associated with operating our landfills and reliance on third party waste volumes;
				risk of pending and future legal proceedings; 
				risk to our reputation; 
				our ability to attract and retain skilled employees and maintain positive labour union relationships;
				open access for new industry entrants and the general unprotected nature of technology used in the waste industry;
				possible volatility of the price of, and the market for, our common shares, and potential dilution for shareholders in the event of a sale of additional shares; 
				financial covenants in our debt agreements that may restrict our ability to engage in transactions or to obtain additional financing; and 
				such other risks or factors described from time to time in reports we file with securities regulatory authorities.
				
			&lt;p&gt;By their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, that contribute to the possibility that the predictions, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking statements will not occur. Many other factors could also cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as intended, planned, anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. Furthermore, the forward-looking statements contained in this document are made as of the date of this document and are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Unless otherwise required by law, we do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information contained on our website does not form part of this press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Press Release contains references to certain financial measures, including some that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS" or "GAAP") and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other corporations or entities. These financial measures are identified and defined below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"EBITDA", "EBITDA per share", "Adjusted EBITDA", and "Adjusted EBITDA per share" are measures of our operating profitability. EBITDA provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to how these activities are financed, assets are amortized or how the results are taxed in various jurisdictions. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to recognizing stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation, a component of employee remuneration, can vary significantly with changes in the price of our common shares. As such, Adjusted EBITDA provides improved continuity with respect to the comparison of our operating results over a period of time. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

			&lt;p&gt;"Adjusted net earnings" and "Adjusted net earnings per share" are measures of our profitability. Adjusted net earnings provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to recognizing stock-based compensation recovery or expense and the gain or loss on embedded derivatives. Stock-based compensation, a component of employee remuneration, can vary significantly with changes in the price of our common shares. The gain on the embedded derivative is a result of the change in the trading price of the debentures and the volatility of the applicable bond market. As such, Adjusted net earnings provides improved continuity with respect to the comparison of our results over a period of time. Adjusted net earnings per share is derived by dividing Adjusted net earnings by the basic weighted average number of shares.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Management Commentary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Results in the quarter were strong, driven by returns from our growth capital investments and contributions from all three divisions," said Al Cadotte, President and CEO of Newalta. "We continue to focus on delivering creative solutions for our customers and the recent collaboration with DuPont Canada is one example of how we're moving forward with these initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to make excellent progress in the execution of our business plan. The 2013 capital program is fully committed with investments prioritized towards areas that provide the highest returns, more stable cash flows and lowest risk. Our growth investments this year will drive strong performance and attractive returns in 2014 and beyond."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consolidated Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third quarter revenue was up 12% to $212.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $51.2 million compared to Q3 2012. Improved results were primarily driven by contributions from growth investments in New Markets and higher event-based business at our Stoney Creek Landfill ("SCL"), further enhanced by a positive impact from commodity prices. Net earnings in the quarter decreased to $13.2 million compared to $15.2 million in the prior year. Excluding higher stock-based compensation expense, net finance charges related to a non-cash loss on embedded derivatives and income tax expense, net earnings would have increased 32% to $20.4 million compared to Q3 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year to date, revenue increased 10% to $579.6 million compared to prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $117.3 million, 8% higher than prior year, driven by contributions from growth investments in New Markets and Oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operational Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from New Markets in the quarter and year-to-date increased 11% and 21%, respectively, to $68.1 million and $165.0 million compared to prior year. Gross profit in the quarter and year-to-date increased 12% and 13%, respectively, to $25.1 million and $57.5 million compared to 2012. Strong performance in the quarter and year-to-date was primarily driven by returns from growth capital invested, including our two contracts to process mature fine tailings ("MFT").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Oilfield in the quarter and year-to-date was $49.0 million and $137.1 million, respectively, up slightly from prior year. Gross profit in the quarter and year-to-date increased 19% and 13%, respectively, to $19.9 million and $52.9 million compared to prior year. Positive results were driven by contributions from growth capital investments and improved commodity prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Industrial in the quarter and year-to-date increased 17% and 9%, respectively, to $95.1 million and $277.4 million compared to prior year. Gross profit in the quarter increased 46% to $14.2 million compared to prior year. Year-to-date gross profit was $32.1 million, flat to prior year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Highlights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta's Board of Directors declared a third quarter dividend of $0.11 per share ($0.44 per share annualized) paid October 15, 2013 to shareholders of record on September 30, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from contracts (fee for service solutions with terms longer than one year and no direct commodity price exposure) generated 13% of consolidated revenue trailing twelve months ("TTM") Q3 2013, compared to 8% in TTM Q3 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 were $43.4 million and $98.9 million, respectively, focused primarily on growth capital projects in New Markets and Oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio improved to 2.52 in Q3 2013, from 2.74 in Q2 2013. We anticipate ending the year at or about 2.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 17, 2013, we announced a development agreement with DuPont Canada to test an innovative water processing technology in the Alberta oil and gas industry. The water processing technology removes solids from water and facilitates a higher level of water re-use for customers at their sites. The collaboration between the companies will combine DuPont's innovative scientific and technical expertise with Newalta's operating capabilities and customer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2013 is expected to be approximately 20% higher than last year, based on commodity prices and drilling activity remaining at Q3 levels. Growth capital investments made over the past 18 months continue to deliver strong returns. SCL volumes are anticipated to be at the annual permitted capacity by the end of the year, or approximately 132,000 MT in Q4. Ville Ste-Catherine ("VSC") volumes in the fourth quarter are expected to be in line with our historical quarterly average. Performance in New Markets and Oilfield for the second half of 2013 remains in line with management's expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our 2013 capital budget of $190 million is fully committed. We continue to focus on growing our portfolio of longer term contracts, strengthening our foundation of stable cash flow, and maximizing returns from our existing assets. We have good visibility on our pipeline of organic growth capital projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly Conference Call&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management will hold a conference call on Wednesday, November 6, 2013 at 11:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss Newalta's performance for the third quarter ended September 30, 2013.

			&lt;p&gt;"Adjusted net earnings" and "Adjusted net earnings per share" are measures of our profitability. Adjusted net earnings provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to recognizing stock-based compensation recovery or expense and the gain or loss on embedded derivatives. Stock-based compensation, a component of employee remuneration, can vary significantly with changes in the price of our common shares. The gain on the embedded derivative is a result of the change in the trading price of the debentures and the volatility of the applicable bond market. As such, Adjusted net earnings provides improved continuity with respect to the comparison of our results over a period of time. Adjusted net earnings per share is derived by dividing Adjusted net earnings by the basic weighted average number of shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Joseph Ax&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 5 (Reuters) - The former Ecuadorean judge who
issued a $19 billion pollution judgment against Chevron Corp
 testified on Tuesday that he wrote the ruling alone, two
weeks after another judge testified that he had been paid to
ghostwrite much of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has accused U.S. lawyer Steven Donziger of bribing
the judges to win the award for a group of villagers who lived
in a contaminated area of northeastern Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the surface, the statements from Nicolas Zambrano, the
former judge who testified on Tuesday, appeared to go against
Chevron's claim that the judgment was a result of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But during several hours of tough questioning in a federal
court in New York, a Chevron lawyer was able to zero in on
several potential discrepancies in the judge's account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zambrano repeatedly insisted that he had authored the
188-page opinion on his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's your testimony that nobody else wrote any of those
words?" asked Randy Mastro, a lawyer for Chevron, which called
Zambrano as a witness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes," Zambrano replied through a translator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Zambrano awarded $18 billion to the villagers for
contamination that occurred between 1964 and 1992 at an oil
field operated by Texaco, which was later acquired by Chevron.
The award was increased to $19 billion to cover fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has maintained that Texaco cleaned up its share of
the waste before turning the field over to state-owned
Petroecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil company is asking U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan,
who is presiding over the trial without a jury, to prohibit
Donziger and the villagers from the Lago Agrio area from
collecting on the judgment in any U.S. court. A victory in the
United States would likely help Chevron defend against the
judgment in other countries where the villagers might seek to
enforce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastro worked hard in court to undermine Zambrano's
credibility, quizzing him on specific sections of the judgment
and asking how he could have cited French and English case law
despite not speaking those languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zambrano said that a woman whom he paid to take dictation
also helped him in his research, pulling documents from the
Internet and translating them into Spanish. He could not say
whether she spoke any foreign languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The testimony came two weeks after another former Ecuadorean
judge, Alberto Guerra, said he accepted $1,000 a month from a
lawyer representing the villagers to ghostwrite Zambrano's
rulings. Guerra also said Donziger was aware of the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testifying on Tuesday, Zambrano acknowledged that Guerra
helped draft rulings for him in other cases but denied that
Guerra had done so in the Chevron case. He also said he did not
pay Guerra for his assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mastro asked Zambrano why Guerra's datebook showed
multiple payments of $1,000 and $2,000 from Zambrano, he said he
did not know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the trial, Guerra testified that he would meet
Zambrano on Fridays to pick up court documents and would prepare
orders over the weekend before delivering them to Zambrano on
Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger has denied the bribery allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Donziger have sought to discredit Guerra's
testimony, saying that Chevron paid Guerra for his court
appearance and gave money to his family for relocation and
living expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have not yet had a chance to question Zambrano. In a
statement released on Tuesday, however, the defense team said
Mastro did not allow the judge to explain his answers fully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v. Steven Donziger et al, U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, No.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp released an emergency software fix on Tuesday after it learned that hackers had exploited a previously undiscovered security flaw in its widely used Office software to infect the PCs of its customers with tainted Word documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software maker said on its website that it had released the software, known as a "Fix It," as a temporary measure until it provides an update that will automatically patch computers to protect against the new threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said that it had learned of a "very limited" number of attacks that exploited the newly discovered vulnerability, mainly in the Middle East and South Asia. The company did not identify the victims, who received emails asking them to open the tainted Word documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability affects customers using Office 2003 and Office 2007 as well as those running Office 2010 on Windows XP and Server 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacks took advantage of an undiscovered flaw, or "zero day" vulnerability in industry parlance, which is usually only used on a limited number of high-value targets in a bid to keep the flaws a secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, when makers of widely used software programs issue a warning about a zero-day bug, groups of hackers rush to reverse-engineer the Fix Its so they can build computer viruses that also exploit the same vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuart McClure, chief executive officer of the cybersecurity firm Cylance Inc, said that businesses using vulnerable versions of Office should install the Fix It to prevent attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I definitely think it is something that needs to be patched," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix Its are pieces of software for remediating security flaws that must be manually downloaded and installed on PCs.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp released an
emergency software fix on Tuesday after it learned that hackers
had exploited a previously undiscovered security flaw in its
widely used Office software to infect the PCs of its customers
with tainted Word documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software maker said on its website that it had released
the software, known as a "Fix It," as a temporary measure until
it provides an update that will automatically patch computers to
protect against the new threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said that it had learned of a "very limited"
number of attacks that exploited the newly discovered
vulnerability, mainly in the Middle East and South Asia. The
company did not identify the victims, who received emails asking
them to open the tainted Word documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability affects customers using Office 2003 and
Office 2007 as well as those running Office 2010 on Windows XP
and Server 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacks took advantage of an undiscovered flaw, or "zero
day" vulnerability in industry parlance, which is usually only
used on a limited number of high-value targets in a bid to keep
the flaws a secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, when makers of widely used software programs
issue a warning about a zero-day bug, groups of hackers rush to
reverse-engineer the Fix Its so they can build computer viruses
that also exploit the same vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuart McClure, chief executive officer of the cybersecurity
firm Cylance Inc, said that businesses using vulnerable versions
of Office should install the Fix It to prevent attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I definitely think it is something that needs to be
patched," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix Its are pieces of software for remediating security
flaws that must be manually downloaded and installed on PCs.
They are designed to protect customers while Microsoft prepares
official updates, automatically delivered via the Internet to be
installed on computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Fix It is available at this link: here&lt;/p&gt;

			Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated Reports Third Quarter and First 
      Nine Months 2013 Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (NASDAQ: COKE) today announced it 
      earned $16.2 million, or basic net income per share of $1.75, on net 
      sales of $434.5 million for the third quarter of 2013, compared to net 
      income of $10.1 million, or basic net income per share of $1.09, on net 
      sales of $419.9 million for the third quarter of 2012. The results for 
      the third quarter of 2013 included a $0.1 million decrease in income tax 
      expense due to the release of a valuation allowance for certain deferred 
      tax assets, $0.9 million of after-tax gains related to changes in 
      reserves for uncertain tax positions due to lapse of statute of 
      limitations, and a $2.3 million decrease in income tax expense due to 
      recent legislation requiring a change in the blended deferred state 
      income tax rate. The results for the third quarter of 2012 included $0.6 
      million of after-tax gains ($1.0 million on a pre-tax basis) due to 
      mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges and a $0.4 million 
      increase in income tax expense due to recording a valuation allowance 
      for certain deferred tax assets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a comparable basis, the Company earned $12.7 million in the third 
      quarter of 2013, or comparable basic net income per share of $1.38, 
      versus $9.8 million in the third quarter of 2012, or comparable basic 
      net income per share of $1.06.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The following table reconciles reported GAAP net income and basic net 
      income per share to comparable net income and basic net income per share 
      for the third quarters of 2013 and 2012:

			(a) This non-GAAP financial information is provided to allow 
      investors to more clearly evaluate operating performance and business 
      trends for the third quarters of 2013 and 2012. Management uses this 
      information to review results excluding items that are not necessarily 
      indicative of ongoing results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company earned $32.3 million, or basic net income per share of 
      $3.49, on net sales of $1,247.0 million for the first nine months of 
      2013, compared to net income of $25.4 million, or basic net income per 
      share of $2.75, on net sales of $1,227.7 million for the first nine 
      months of 2012. The results for the first nine months of 2013 included 
      $0.3 million of after-tax losses ($0.5 million on a pre-tax basis) due 
      to mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges, $0.9 million of 
      after-tax gains related to changes in reserves for uncertain tax 
      positions due to lapse of statute of limitations, a $0.4 million 
      decrease to tax expense due to certain favorable tax items associated 
      with the American Taxpayer Relief Act (H.R.8) enacted on January 2, 
      2013, and a $2.3 million decrease in income tax expense due to recent 
      legislation requiring a change in the blended deferred state income tax 
      rate. The results for the first nine months of 2012 included $0.6 
      million of after-tax gains ($1.0 million on a pre-tax basis) due to 
      mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges and a $1.7 million net 
      increase in income tax expense due to recording a valuation allowance 
      for certain deferred tax assets, changes in reserves for uncertain tax 
      positions and other income tax changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a comparable basis, the Company earned $28.8 million in the first 
      nine months of 2013, or comparable basic net income per share of $3.11, 
      versus $26.4 million in the first nine months of 2012, or comparable 
      basic net income per share of $2.87. The following table reconciles 
      reported GAAP net income and basic net income per share to comparable

			(a) This non-GAAP financial information is provided to allow 
      investors to more clearly evaluate operating performance and business 
      trends for the first nine months of 2013 and 2012. Management uses this 
      information to review results excluding items that are not necessarily 
      indicative of ongoing results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and CEO, said, &#8220;We are pleased to 
      report strong third quarter results driven by growth in both volume and 
      pricing. After a challenging first half of 2013, we saw a return of more 
      normal weather patterns during the third quarter which helped drive 
      revenue growth of 3.5% and earnings per share growth, on a comparable 
      basis, of 30% in the third quarter. The growth in earnings per share 
      continued to be driven by lower interest expense, a benefit of our 
      long-term debt reduction strategy. We are maintaining our long-term 
      focus on growing our business and investing in the brands we sell and 
      the communities we serve. Our work on acquiring new territory is 
      continuing and we are excited about the possibility of increasing the 
      opportunities for territory growth in our Coca-Cola franchise.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hank Flint, President and COO, added, &#8220;Our third quarter results reflect 
      a more favorable selling environment than we experienced during the 
      first half of 2013. The increase in revenue and favorable trends in 
      pricing on key raw materials drove stronger gross margin growth. The 
      gross margin growth, combined with an intense focus on controlling 
      operating costs, led to an increase in operating income of 10% over the 
      third quarter of 2012. We are focused on continuing to drive top-line 
      growth while driving efficiency throughout our operations to grow 
      earnings for the remainder of 2013. We are grateful to our employees for 
      their extraordinary efforts to deliver 2013 results while growing our 
      longer term business opportunities.&#8221;

      of 2013.

      bottlers in the Coca-Cola system); changes in legal contingencies; 
      legislative changes affecting our distribution and packaging; adoption

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are set to fine six global banks including Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and HSBC after an investigation into the rigging of benchmark euro zone interest rates, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The penalties, which will also target Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Credit Agricole and Societe Generale, represent the first punishments from Brussels as a result of its inquiry and are the latest costly payouts for an industry struggling to draw a line under past misdeeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes two years after the European Commission, the EU's antitrust authority, raided a number of banks for suspected fixing of Euribor, a benchmark used as the basis for pricing 250 trillion euros ($338 trillion) of financial contracts, ranging from Spanish mortgages to complex derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays, which alerted the European Commission to the suspected wrongdoing, will not be fined, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The penalties relate only to manipulation of Euribor. Banks suspected of rigging the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, could be fined next month when the Euribor penalties are announced, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the banks have agreed a settlement with the Commission that would bring a 10 percent reduction in their fines, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such settlements, which can prevent cases from dragging on for several years, typically involve companies admitting to wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of the banks will not be fined immediately because they are contesting the size of the proposed penalties. HSBC, Europe's largest bank, is one of those, two sources said. In these cases, the banks are likely to face formal charges next month, followed by fines next year, one of the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale, JPMorgan and HSBC declined to comment. Credit Agricole was not immediately available to comment. Commission spokesman for competition policy, Antoine Colombani, also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU can impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's global revenue for breaches of antitrust rules. In this case, the fines are likely to be towards the low end of the scale, the source said. However, since all the banks have revenues of at least 16 billion euros a year, even a 1 percent fine would result in hundreds of millions of euros in penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC generated revenue of $63.5 billion last year, while RBS's total was 25.8 billion pounds, Societe Generale's was 23.1 billion euros, Deutsche Bank's 33.5 billion euros and Credit Agricole's 16.3 billion euros. JP Morgan's revenue was $97 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COSTLY MISDEEDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost to banks could also mount if investors who believe they have lost money because of rate manipulation use the settlements to sue for damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Critchley, a senior associate at UK law firm Collyer Bristow, said that if banks admit liability as part of a settlement it could open them up to being sued. "They stand to lose more than just the fines," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An English court is already considering whether attempted manipulation of Libor can invalidate loans and other contracts or show that banks mis-sold products that were based on the rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities in the United States, Britain and elsewhere have so far fined five financial firms, including RBS and Barclays, $3.7 billion for manipulating Libor and its Euribor cousin. Seven individuals face criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, the cost to banks of cleaning up past misdeeds is expected to soar to about $125 billion if JPMorgan agrees a $13 billion deal with the U.S. Justice Department over its mortgage business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This earnings season, several banks set aside more money to cover the seemingly relentless rise in the cost of fines, lawsuits and compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank booked 1.2 billion euros in legal costs in the third quarter of 2013 alone, wiping out profit for that period and taking its total legal provisions to 4.1 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in April that he expected to issue decisions on the interest rates cases by the end of the year to help the market to regain confidence in the benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Euribor and Libor, the Commission is also investigating suspected rigging of interest rates linked to the yen (Tibor) and the Swiss franc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also carrying out an investigation into credit derivatives involving 13 top investment banks including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, financial data company Markit and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7402 euros)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Steve Slater and Kirstin Ridley in London, Thomas Atkins in Frankfurt, Matthias Blamont in Paris and David Henry in New York; Writing by Luke Baker and Carmel Crimmins; Editing by David Holmes and David Goodman)&lt;/p&gt;

      As part of Coca-Cola Consolidated&#8217;s ongoing commitment to health and

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola Consolidated is excited to have a partnership with South 
      Carolina hospitals to raise awareness and educate consumers around 
      beverage choice and the importance of physical activity,&#8221; said Alison 
      Patient, senior director of corporate affairs at Coca-Cola Consolidated. 
      &#8220;We are taking proactive steps to promote physical activity and ensure 
      hospital employees, patients and family members can make beverage 
      decisions that fit healthy lifestyles. We are pleased that the Medical 
      University of South Carolina (MUSC), the leader in health and wellness 
      in the state agreed to lead the initiative in South Carolina.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of a collaborative beverage strategy, Coca-Cola Consolidated is 
      introducing new messaging on beverage equipment in South Carolina 
      hospitals to inform consumers they have &#8216;Lots of Choices.

      regular and zero-calorie sports drinks, teas and purified water.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      hospitals,&#8221; said Dr. Susan Johnson, Director of Health Promotion at 
      MUSC.&#160;&#8220;It is important for all consumers, in the health care setting and 
      beyond to understand how each food and beverage they consume fits into a 
      healthy, balanced lifestyle. We don&#8217;t want to promote any particular 
      choice but rather educate consumers and provide incentives through 
      access, pricing and marketing to make the healthy choice the easy 
      choice.&#8221;

      &#8220;Obesity is a complex problem with many societal causes,&#8221; Patient said. 
      &#8220;As a society, we generally eat too much and don&#8217;t get enough exercise, 
      thus leading to weight gains that can cause health problems. At 
      Coca-Cola Consolidated, we are dedicated to educating our consumers and 
      offering beverages that fit in their lifestyles. All foods and beverages

&lt;p&gt;* Barclays won't be fined because was whistleblower-source&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Some banks agree to settle in exchange for lower fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Some banks including HSBC contest proposed penalties

 (Repeats with byline. No changes to text)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, Nov 5 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are set
to fine six global banks including Deutsche Bank,
JPMorgan and HSBC for suspected rigging of
benchmark euro zone interest rates, a person familiar with the
matter said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The penalties, which will also target Royal Bank of Scotland
, Credit Agricole and Societe Generale
, represent the first punishment meted out by Brussels
in a global probe and represent another costly payout for an
industry struggling to put past misdeeds behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes two years after the European Commission, the
EU's antitrust authority, raided a number of banks for suspected
fixing of Euribor, a benchmark used as the basis for pricing 250
trillion euros ($338 trillion) worth of financial contracts,
from Spanish mortgages to complex derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays, which alerted the European Commission to
the suspected wrongdoing, will not be fined, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The penalties only relate to alleged manipulation of
Euribor. Another group of banks suspected of rigging the London
interbank offered rate (Libor) could be fined next month, when
the Euribor penalties are announced, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the banks had agreed to settle with the Commission
in exchange for a 10 percent reduction in their fines, the
source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of the banks will not be fined immediately as they
are contesting the size of the proposed penalties. HSBC,
Europe's largest bank, is one of those, two sources said. In
these cases, the banks are likely to face formal charges next
month, followed by fines next year, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commission spokesman for competition policy, Antoine
Colombani, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU can impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's
global revenue for breaches of antitrust rules. In this case,
the fines are likely to be towards the low end of the scale, the
source said. However, since all the banks have revenues of at
least 16 billion euros a year, even a 1 percent fine would
result in hundreds of millions of euros in penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COSTLY MISDEEDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC generated revenue of $63.5 billion last year, while
RBS's total was 25.8 billion pounds, Societe Generale's was 23.1
billion euros, Deutsche Bank's 33.5 billion and Credit
Agricole's 16.3 billion euros. JP Morgan's revenue was $97
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale, JP Morgan and HSBC
declined to comment. Credit Agricole was not immediately
available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities in the United States, Britain and elsewhere have
so far fined five financial firms, including RBS and Barclays,
$3.7 billion for manipulating Libor and its Euribor cousin.
Seven individuals have been criminally charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, the cost to banks of cleaning up past misdeeds is
expected to soar to around $125 billion if JPMorgan agrees a $13
billion deal with the U.S. Justice Department over its mortgage
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This earnings season, several banks set aside more money to
cover the seemingly relentless rise in the cost of fines,
lawsuits and compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank booked 1.2 billion euros in legal costs in the
third quarter of 2013 alone, wiping out profit for that period
and taking its total legal provisions to 4.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in April he
expected to issue decisions on the interest rates cases by the
end of the year in order to help the market regain confidence in
the benchmarks. [ID:nL2N0CZ1IV}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Euribor and Libor, the Commission is also
investigating suspected rigging of interest rates linked to the
yen (Tibor) and the Swiss franc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also carrying out a probe into credit derivatives
involving 13 top investment banks including Citigroup,
Goldman Sachs, financial data company Markit and the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Commodity merchant Gunvor, long known in the industry as one of the key traders of Russian oil, is studying growing opportunities in North America resulting from the shale oil boom and is looking at select trading assets including parts of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s (JPM.N) business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the Reuters Global Commodities Summit on Tuesday, Gunvor chief executive and co-founder Torbjorn Tornqvist said the firm saw opportunities in North America and had been in contact with the Wall Street bank, which put its physical trading business up for sale this summer for around $3.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes we can confirm that we have contacted JPMorgan and we have been looking at some of their assets," Tornqvist said. "It is an important part of our business to always look at assets. Out of the 10 we are looking at maybe one or two will go all the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are obviously in the area of looking to expand our arbitrage assets. And that goes for all commodities, not only oil, we are looking in other commodities as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's assets include oil storage tanks in Canada and its Henry Bath global network of metal warehouses. The bank sent out its prospectus to several potential buyers last month as it decided to sell the unit due to tighter regulations and political scrutiny on banks active in commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, Switzerland-based Gunvor handled as much as 40 percent of Russia's seaborne crude oil exports via a number of long-term deals with Russian energy majors such as Rosneft (ROSN.MM), Surgut (SNGS.MM) and TNK-BP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has moved to diversify, opening offices across the world and beginning to trade other commodities while ceding some parts of its Russian trading book to rivals Vitol and Glencore (GLEN.L) after premiums at tenders of firms such as Rosneft spiked steeply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tornqvist said that shipping Russian crude now makes up less than a third of the firm's business, as it has moved into areas such as gasoline and diesel trading, refining, production and metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are a global diversified company whereby Russia plays an extremely important role," Tornqvist said, adding the firm was already involved in projects looking at exporting liquid petroleum gas (LPG) from the United States, a by-product of the shale oil boom that is not subject to the same export restrictions as crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GO WEST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tornqvist said the logistical bottlenecks that have sprung up in North America due to the shale oil revolution and growing output from Canada's oil sands had generally created attractive trading opportunities. The United States' emergence as a major exporter of refined products such as gasoline, diesel and natural gas liquids (NGLs) is another attractive area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously we see a lot of opportunity there, there are certain things that we have done... We are involved in LPG as a by-product of natural gas, and taking that out from the United States. And we look forward to being involved in similar projects in the future," Tornqvist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will also be blending opportunities between the heavy crude oils from Canada and the lighter U.S. crude oils," Tornqvist said. "There will be good opportunities in North America for many years to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has a collection of long-term leases on more than a quarter of the oil tanks in Hardisty, Alberta, the main storage and transportation hub for output from Canada's oil sands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank holds over 6 million barrels of storage space in tanks leased from pipeline company Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO), according to market sources. Crude traders in Canada's oil capital Calgary say they provide a powerful trading tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUIET CHANGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunvor has also diversified into commodity extraction in recent years, buying a $400 million stake in a troubled Montana coal mine in 2011. In the past year, Gunvor has hired metals specialists and started trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy still represents the lion's share of the business with refined products trading accounting around two thirds of the energy business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have changed our strategy quietly in Russia. We have made a lot of investments in oil terminals. We are working a little bit less with volume but we try to have more quality in our trading, rather than chasing volumes," said Tornqvist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he expected the firm's turnover in 2013 to remain near record levels seen in 2012 "with a slight bias to the upside". He also said the firm was working on its upstream strategy in oil but it was likely to remain a rare, opportunistic activity with trading still very much dominating the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunvor owns two refineries in Europe having snapped them up a low prices in 2012 after independent refiner Petroplus went bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had a good run on those refineries and even this year we have managed to keep them profitable," he said, but added: "I have no illusions about the difficulties that the European refinery sector will have to go through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next two years, U.S. plants as well as new refineries in China and the Middle East will take further market share away from Europe, prompting 5-10 plants in Europe to close down and reducing its refining capacity by a tenth or 1 million barrels per day, Tornqvist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Governments would like to be seen doing something. But the reality is there is not much they can do. This is a process which is necessary and it is long overdue," Tornqvist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For other news from the Reuters Global Commodities Summit, click here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits; Additional reporting by Lin Nouiehed, Ron Bousso, Claire Milhench, Simon Falush, Alex Lawler and Dmitry Zhdannikov in London; editing by Jason Neely)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine signed a $10 billion shale gas production-sharing agreement with U.S. Chevron (CVX.N) on Tuesday, another step in a drive for more energy independence from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal to develop its western Olesska field followed a similar shale gas agreement with Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) in January and boosts Ukraine's leadership at a time of fraught relations with Moscow over gas supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The agreements with Shell and Chevron ... will enable us to have full sufficiency in gas by 2020 and, under an optimistic scenario, even enable us to export energy," President Viktor Yanukovich told investors shortly before the signing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest end of expectations for Olesska's potential reserves would match around three years of European Union gas demand, but similarly sunny hopes for shale reserves in neighboring Poland have been very sharply downsized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shale development in Europe is far behind the booming U.S. sector and progress is patchy. Chevron pulled out of a shale exploration tender in Lithuania and has suspended work at a Romanian shale well after local protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine Energy Minister Eduart Stavytsky, who signed the deal with Chevron executive Derek Magness, set it in the context of a high price Ukraine pays Russia for its gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is one more step towards achieving full energy independence for the state. This will bring cheaper gas prices and the sort of just prices which exist (elsewhere) in the world," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine pays $400 per thousand cubic meters for Russian gas under a 2009 10-year agreement. Kiev has failed to re-negotiate its terms with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement with Chevron, to extend for 50 years, foresaw an initial investment of $350 million by the U.S. major in exploratory work over two or three years, Stavytsky said, aimed at establishing the commercial viability of shale reserves in the 5,260 square km (2,000 square miles) Olesska, part of a band of shale which stretches from the Baltic to the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier government figures set total investments, including extraction after exploratory drilling, at around $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRICTION WITH RUSSIA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stavytsky said the Ukrainian side hoped that exploratory work would yield more detailed information about reserves at Olesska in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was expected that Olesska would produce 5 billion cubic meters per year - and possibly as much as 8-10 billion cubic meters, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal with Shell, which is at a similar level of investment, is for exploration at Yuzivska in eastern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two shale projects could provide Ukraine with an additional 11 to 16 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas in five years' time, according to projections by the Kiev government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Ukraine also a transit route for Russian gas to Europe, rows in the past which have led to disruption for European consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two sides clashed over prices in the winters of 2006 and 2009, with Moscow halting deliveries not only to Ukraine but to the rest of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Russia angered over Ukraine's plans to sign a landmark agreement with the European Union which will mark a shift away from Russia's sphere of influence, the issue has flared again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last month, Russia's gas export monopoly Gazprom (GAZP.MM) demanded Ukraine pay a $882 million overdue gas bill urgently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stavytsky said on Tuesday that Ukraine had already begun to settle the outstanding bill but gave no details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said his company had recently received $9 million in payments from Naftogaz Ukraine. "It's just a drop in the ocean," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has since said he sees no reason for Moscow to cut gas supplies to Ukraine over the unpaid bill for now and has played down talk of an imminent "gas war" that might disrupt flows to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Denis Pinchuk in Moscow; Editing by William Hardy)&lt;/p&gt;

Chooses AIMS Innovation to Intelligently Monitor its Microsoft BizTalk Solution</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;On Land and Aboard Ships AIMS Innovations' Application Performance Monitoring Cuts IT Costs and Prevents Downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto, CA - November 5, 2013 - AIMS Innovation announced today that Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. has selected AIMS for BizTalk, to monitor its Microsoft&#174; BizTalk&#174; system, at the company's Florida headquarters and aboard 34 cruise ships sailing under the Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises brands. &#160;In this unique installation, Royal Caribbean will use the AIMS for BizTalk multi-tenant solution to monitor and manage the large bursts of traffic and information downloads that occurs when its cruise ships come into port. From its Florida "mission control", Royal Caribbean can check the status of each ship's BizTalk Solution, no matter where it is in the world. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"Our multi-tenant solution will help Royal Caribbean cut down on monitoring time across its 34 cruise ships. &#160;With one web-based log in, Royal Caribbean IT staff can spend less time sorting through warnings and more time doing higher-level service tasks that help meet the company's goals and make their work lives easier,"&#160;said Ivar Sagemo, CEO of AIMS Innovation.&#160;"Like every business, Royal Caribbean is looking for new ways to simplify monitoring and decrease downtime that gobbles up its IT budget and staff's time. AIMS for BizTalk is the first intelligent monitoring solution to dynamically determine monitoring thresholds and without human intervention proactively send "early warnings" before problems arise." &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"In order to deal with bursts of information across our system, we needed a more flexible, intuitive BizTalk monitoring solution that could help us anticipate problems and lead us quickly to the exact location of errors to fix them in a short timeframe," said Max Schmidt, vice president of IT Infrastructure, Operations and Information Security for Royal Caribbean. &#160;"We chose AIMS for BizTalk because it gives us an effective tool to quickly and accurately monitor our data without using extensive resources to manage it or paying for expensive software customization."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Key Ways Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Benefits from AIMS for BizTalk &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				&lt;p&gt;Decreases the cruise line's monitoring time. IT administrators only need to log into one environment to automatically get information from all the ships. Plus, administrators don't need to determine the operational threshold for each system. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
				&lt;p&gt;Prevents downtime. AIMS for BizTalk sends early warning alerts before downtime occurs and pinpoints the problem's exact location versus making IT staff guess which warnings are real. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
				&lt;p&gt;Learns and adapts to systems' behavior. &#160;AIMS for BizTalk modifies alerts over time dynamically &#160;"self learning" traffic patterns to make alerts more accurate over time. &#160;The dynamic nature of AIMS is critical to Royal Caribbean due to the varying loads during boarding and disembarkation which is considerably higher than normal operations. &#160;Other products gave us constant false alerts making our previous monitoring solutions unusable.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
				&lt;p&gt;Can easily and quickly be installed by any IT staff member. It takes 5 minutes without special training through Microsoft Azure cloud or a local install.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

			Mimecast launches cloud archiving service for Microsoft&#174; 
      Lync&#174;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Service solves growing compliance and archiving headache from Instant 
      Messaging
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mimecast 
      has launched Mimecast 
      Archiving for Microsoft Lync IM, a secure cloud-based archive for 
      all Microsoft 
      Lync Instant Messages (IM), as well as the files, presentations and 
      whiteboards that have been shared or transferred using Lync. The new 
      service ensures IM 
      conversations and files are archived securely on Mimecast&#8217;s cloud 
      service and available easily to the organization for search and export 
      in the event of an e-discovery or compliance requirement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Instant Messaging within organizations is growing in popularity and 
      according to Microsoft, 90 of the Fortune 100 currently use Microsoft 
      Lync IM. Organizations recognize the need to archive their email for 
      discovery and compliance purposes but often don&#8217;t think of IM in the 
      same way and many are failing to effectively archive this despite its 
      growing use and popularity with employees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mimecast Archiving for Microsoft Lync IM makes archiving this additional 
      data easy and secure without the need for more hardware and associated 
      cost on the network. Also, search and statistics are available to 
      administrators through their existing Mimecast online console reducing 
      e-discovery complexity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Engin Yilmaz, Product Manager, Mimecast says, &#8220;It&#8217;s great to see that 
      more organizations are using Lync for communication and to improve 
      end-user productivity. What is concerning though is that many of them do 
      so without recognizing they need to archive the IM conversation just as 
      they do other electronic conversations like email. Also some of those 
      that have actually considered archiving have chosen solutions that 
      create more work for their IT administrators, add yet more complexity to 
      their network, aren&#8217;t fully featured, are tough to use and add 
      unnecessary cost to their budget.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Lync service complements other Mimecast archiving products 
      for email and files, and uses the Mimecast Administration Console to 
      give administrators a unified interface for searches against all 
      electronic conversations, regardless of their format. Additionally the 
      Mimecast Synchronization Engine periodically checks for new messages and 
      sends them to the Mimecast archive automatically. These features keep 
      the overall cost of discovery down and reduce the risk and complexity 
      associated with searching across multiple data repositories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Pipeline Co (XOM.N) faces a fine of nearly $2.7 million for a pipeline spill of thousands of barrels of Canadian crude oil in an Arkansas suburb last spring, the U.S. pipeline safety office said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) found nine probable violations of safety rules in the rupture of the nearly 70-year old Pegasus pipeline that forced residents to evacuate their homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 95,000 barrel-per-day pipeline has been shut since March 29 after spilling about 5,000 barrels in Mayflower, Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, PHMSA said an original manufacturing defect by a now defunct Youngstown, Ohio steel pipe company appeared to have led to the accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the agency said Exxon did not adequately account for risks on the pipeline. "Specifically, the operator failed to include the susceptibility of its Youngstown, pre-1970 ... pipe seam to failures as a risk factor for the Pegasus Pipeline System in the implementation of its integrity management program," PHMSA said in a letter to Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat, praised the PHMSA's decision on Wednesday. "Exxon has caused undue harm to Arkansas families and must be held accountable," he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said it was disappointed by the decision but was cooperating with the pipeline safety office in its investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said it was still reviewing the government's notice and had not determined its course of action.

      ability to dramatically expand accessibility and ease of use &#8211; 
      particularly when collaborating with parties outside their own network 
      and across today&#8217;s highly dispersed organizations. However, the issue of 
      control and security is still paramount.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The goal for any security-oriented cloud services is to convey 
      confidence that sensitive data in the cloud is protected, confidence 
      that different tenants are strongly segregated and that control over 
      critical security assets such as cryptographic keys remains with the 
      customer. Recognizing this, Microsoft went beyond simply using HSMs in 
      the Windows Azure cloud to enhance the security of the RMS service by 
      enabling customers to &#8216;bring your own key&#8217; (BYOK). By using a Thales 
      nShield HSM on-premise an organization can generate and securely 
      transfer their critical Tenant Key (the customer&#8217;s master key) to Thales 
      HSMs in Windows Azure where it is used to underpin the security of their 
      RMS service. This gives organizations complete custody and visibility 
      over the use of their master key and the reassurance that they can use 
      the Microsoft service on their own terms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Dan Plastina, Partner Group Program Manager, Microsoft says:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Microsoft Rights Management service helps customer safeguard their 
      data, both inside and outside of the organization. As a result of our 
      collaboration with Thales, our customers can generate and upload their 
      own master keys to a cloud-based HSM and keep complete control over 
      their keys, giving them confidence that their data is protected.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Richard Moulds, vice president strategy at Thales e-Security says:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Windows Azure RMS service is a great example of where the unique 
      properties of the cloud can be exploited to transform the usability and 
      value of traditionally in-house security systems and therefore greatly 
      promote their adoption. Innovative capabilities such as the &#8216;bring your 
      own key&#8217; philosophy and the use of HSMs can protect both the consumer 
      and the cloud provider and build the confidence to trust the service 
      with an organization&#8217;s most valuable assets. As organizations focus on 
      moving their more sensitive data and applications to the cloud the issue 
      of retaining control takes center stage and sound key management is an 
      effective way of achieving that. The ability to release keys to cloud 
      providers on a &#8216;need to use basis&#8217; and to revoke them as necessary will 
      be an increasingly powerful tool.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Shares of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) jumped to their highest since mid-2000 on Wednesday, a day after Reuters reported that the world's largest software company is closing in on appointing a new chief executive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, an influential analyst suggested the appointment of an outsider as CEO could result in the sale of Microsoft's Bing and Xbox units, which would bring instant gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock jumped almost 4 percent to hit $38.08 in midday trading on Nasdaq, a level last seen in July 2000, when the tech stock bubble was deflating. The stock pared gains in early afternoon, trading at $37.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late on Tuesday, Reuters reported that Microsoft had narrowed its CEO shortlist to replace Steve Ballmer to about five external candidates, including Ford Motor Co (F.N) chief Alan Mulally, and three or more internal candidates. Microsoft declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer in August said he would step down within 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many investors favor an outside candidate such as Mulally as they believe he would bring radical change to Microsoft, which has struggled to adapt to the age of mobile computing led by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-connected Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund, who worked closely with Microsoft on its initial public offering in 1986, in a note to clients on Wednesday said it was "likely" that Mulally would be the new CEO by December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He theorized that an outside leader such as Mullally might quickly sell Microsoft's Bing search engine and Xbox game console businesses, which he said could yield a 30 cents to 40 cents per share benefit in fiscal 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with potential cost cuts and increased share buybacks, Sherlund said prospects for the stock were more attractive than many investors think. He raised his share price target to $45 to from $40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time that Microsoft stock traded as high as $45, split adjusted, was early 2000. It hit an all-time split-adjusted high of $59.97 near the peak of the tech stock bubble in late December 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Bottled Water Market to 2016: Danone, 
      Nestle, PepsiCo  Coca-Cola Dominate the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/xd7smc/global_bottled) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Bottled Water Market to 2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Bottled Water market to grow at a CAGR of 5.4 percent over 
      the period 2012-2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the main drivers in the market is the rising population 
      worldwide. The increasing population in India and in developing 
      countries in the Middle East has resulted in a rise in the demand for 
      bottled water as there is a huge scarcity of drinking water in these 
      countries. Therefore, consumers are increasingly purchasing bottled 
      water products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There are many regulations being made and implemented by different 
      countries regarding the manufacture of bottled water. As the popularity 
      of bottled water is increasing worldwide, it is necessary for 
      governments to impose some regulations, as consumption of water is a 
      critical issue for public health. For instance, in the US, the FDA 
      regulates bottled water through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
      Act. Under the Act, manufacturers are responsible for producing safe, 
      wholesome, and truthfully labeled food products, including bottled water 
      products. The FDA inspects the companies to check whether or not they 
      are processing, bottling, and transporting bottled water under sanitary 
      conditions. Hence, companies need to abide by and go through all the 
      procedures and regulations laid down by the FDA. Similar to this, there 
      are many countries where the government has started taking action to 
      ensure the safety of bottled water. Thus, this will enable them to 
      remove unethical companies and provide safer and purified water to 
      consumers. This trend is expected to exert both a positive and negative 
      influence on the Global Bottled Water market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the key challenges is the 
      increase in the number of private label brands creating parity between 
      branded water and private labels, which is forcing branded bottled water 
      companies to lower prices to remain competitive.

      imperative for organizations to have the proper business processes in 
      place to make more agile, informed business decisions that drive 
      performance. Perficient, 
      Inc. (NASDAQ: PRFT), a leading information technology consulting 
      firm serving Global 2000 and other large enterprise customers throughout 
      North America, today announced it received IBM&#8217;s 2013 Worldwide 
      Performance Management Business Partner Excellence Award. Perficient was 
      recognized for its ability to deliver performance management, financial 
      analytics and business intelligence solutions to its enterprise clients 
      on a global scale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Business analytics and performance management are not new concepts 
      fundamentally; they&#8217;re a part of everyday conversation as companies seek 
      competitive advantages, improved customer experiences and financial 
      growth. Yet today&#8217;s analytics solutions need to be faster, better, 
      cheaper and more accessible on a global scale than ever before,&#8221; said 
      John Jenkins, vice president of Perficient&#8217;s IBM Business Group. &#8220;With 
      its expanding global delivery center capabilities, Perficient&#8217;s IBM 
      Business Analytics team has seen significant growth and success 
      partnering with our enterprise customers to create a culture of 
      analytics, which helps foster performance management strategies that 
      lead to more accurate, timely and flexible planning and budgeting 
      cycles. This award is great recognition for the success we&#8217;ve 
      experienced in helping meet a key client need.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Recently, a global biopharmaceutical company was faced with many legacy 
      business processes that needed updating, including its business planning 
      process. The company, which has approximately 21,000 employees in 
      locations across the world, partnered with Perficient and IBM to 
      implement a performance management solution that could help address 
      these challenges. Perficient is deploying the IBM Cognos TM1 solution, 
      which gives the company the ability to plan price, volume and sales 
      margins for their business while accounting for complex currency and 
      comparability rules; provides a global forecasting model that includes 
      third-party data for market share and market comparison analytics; and 
      aligns the required business requirements for completing a global budget.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is a Fortune 200 company that has facilities located around the 
      world, but over time various business groups and regions instituted 
      different ways to conduct business planning activities on different 
      technical platforms,&#8221; said J-P Contreras, general manager of 
      Perficient&#8217;s IBM Business Analytics practice. &#8220;With its experience 
      deploying performance management and analytics solutions, and its 
      on-shore and global delivery center resources, the Perficient team is 
      working to help them implement a common business planning platform on a 
      global scale.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the worldwide performance management honor, Perficient 
      also was recognized with the Enterprise Content Management Business 
      Partner Award. This award recognizes Perficient and other business 
      partners who have demonstrated excellence in delivering business value 
      with enterprise content management (ECM) software. Perficient recently expanded 
      its portfolio of solution products and now delivers configurable ECM 
      and business process management (BPM) solution accelerators utilizing 
      IBM technologies like IBM FileNet P8 for its customers across a variety 
      of industries including financial services and energy and utilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Both the IBM 2013 Worldwide Performance Management Business Partner 
      Excellence Award and the Enterprise Content Management Business Partner 
      Award were announced at the IBM Information On Demand 2013 conference, 
      being held Nov. 3 &#8211; 7 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. At previous IOD 
      events, Perficient has been honored with awards including the 2012 
      Integration Excellence Award, 2011 Business Analytics Solution Provider 
      Achievement Award, the 2011 Information Management Solution Excellence 
      Award, and the Warehouse Pack Partner of the Year, Information Agenda 
      Partner of the Year, Best of Show 2010 for Retail Analytics awards and

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Research and Markets: Global Data Center Market to 2016: Cisco, Dell, 
      EMC, IBM, HP  NetApp Dominate the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/8hsg3r/global_data) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Data Center Market 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global Data Center market is expected to post a CAGR of 10.71 
      percent during the period 2012-2016.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major trends in the Global Data Center market is the growing 
      adoption of cloud computing and cloud-based services among enterprises 
      across the globe. As a result of the growing complexity of network 
      infrastructure, the services required by enterprises are being delivered 
      through the cloud, which is a less expensive option than in-house 
      hosting of applications and services. However, cloud computing service 
      providers require high-performance data center facilities to deliver 
      such services. Therefore, a number of data center facilities are being 
      established across the globe with high-performance computing equipment, 
      and this is expected to drive the Global Data Center market in the 
      coming years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, these days, enterprises across the globe are 
      witnessing an increasing number of restrictions and regulations being 
      introduced by authorities to ensure the implementation of green 
      computation methodologies in data centers. These restrictions are being 
      imposed to reduce the carbon footprint of these facilities and also to 
      monitor their utilization of resources. Therefore, modern equipment that 
      delivers high-performance computing services while simultaneously 
      reducing power consumption is increasingly being installed in data 
      centers. In fact, modern data centers cause lower heat emissions, which 
      is another factor leading to the growth of Global Data Center market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is the rise in real estate costs, which inevitably results in 
      high capital investment when establishing data centers. This in turn 
      leads to an increase in the prices of data center services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The major vendors which have a presence in the Global Data 
      Center market are:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Cisco Systems Inc
      
			
        Dell Inc.

      JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s commitment to military spouses is an expansion of the 
      company&#8217;s existing programs for veterans focused on employment, housing 
      and education. In 2011, JPMorgan Chase and ten other companies launched 
      the 100,000 Jobs Mission. In less than three years, the coalition has 
      hired 92,869 veterans and has grown to 123 companies that represent 
      almost every industry in the American economy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase and AlliedBarton Security Services, 
      AlliedBarton.com/HireOurHeroes, formed a Military Spouse Working Group 
      within the 100,000 Jobs Mission to leverage the collective knowledge of 
      the member-companies to expand employment and networking opportunities 
      for military spouses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since 2011, JPMorgan Chase has hired more than 6,000 veterans and later 
      this year will launch a comprehensive military spouse program. 
      Additionally, in 2011, Chase pledged to award 1,000 mortgage-free homes 
      to military families. Since then, the bank has provided more than 630 
      mortgage-free homes, amounting to more than $62 million, to military 
      families through its non-profit partners. Chase refurbishes each home to 
      meet the unique need of the veteran.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase also co-founded Syracuse University&#8217;s Institute for 
      Veterans and Military Families (IVMF). One of many programs offered by 
      IVMF is the Veterans Career Transition program (VCTP), a tuition-free 
      program for post-9/11 veterans to help with their transition from the 
      military back into a civilian career. As of this month, the VCTP is now 
      open to military spouses.

			Research and Markets: Global Metallocene Market 2012-2016 with BASF 
      SE, Chevron Phillips Co. LLC, and ExxonMobil Co Dominating
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/h3x7ws/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Metallocene Market 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Metallocene market to grow at a CAGR of 
      6.89 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key factors 
      contributing to this market growth is the increasing demand for polymers 
      with low molecular distribution, and other characteristics, which in 
      turn has led to an increased consumption of metallocene catalysts by 
      polymer manufacturing industries. The Global Metallocene market has also 
      been witnessing the increasing focus on bringing new, innovative 
      products and technology to the market place. However, the volatility of 
      the raw material prices, which, in turn results in the rise of finished 
      product prices could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this market space are Albemarle Corp., BASF 
      SE, Chevron Phillips Co. LLC, and ExxonMobil Co.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other vendors mentioned in the report are Clariant AG, Ineos 
      Technologies Ltd., LyondellBasell Industries N.V., Prime Polymer Co. 
      Ltd., and UnivationTechnologies LLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: Because the 
      Global Metallocene market is a highly competitive market, manufacturers 
      are creating new and innovative catalysts and exploring potential 
      markets to increase their revenue. The Global Metallocene market is 
      witnessing increased investment in RD teams for the development of 
      innovative products and services. In addition, leading vendors in the 
      market are entering into strategic partnerships to address issues 
      related to life cycle, selectivity, and recyclability of catalysts. 
      These manufacturers are increasingly dedicating large resources to 
      designing and developing new catalysts and related technologies. New 
      high-performing catalysts, which offer improved selectivity, longer 
      run-cycles, and other characteristics, are expected to be introduced in 
      the market soon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the Global Metallocene market is driven by 
      several factors. One of the major drivers of this market is the 
      increasing demand for polymers with low molecular distribution, and 
      other characteristics, which in turn has led to an increased consumption 
      of metallocene catalysts by polymer manufacturing industries.

			Sonus 
      Networks, Inc. (Nasdaq: SONS), a global 
      leader in SIP communications, today announced that the Sonus SBC 
      5210 and Sonus SBC 5110 Session Border Controllers have achieved

      Lync Enterprise Voice continues to gain market momentum, offering 
      companies a way to reduce costs and improve productivity. The SBC &#8211; 
      which Microsoft recommends be included in a Lync Enterprise Voice 
      deployment to ensure interoperability and functionality &#8211; is installed 
      at the border between the internal Lync Enterprise Voice network and 
      Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking services at the network 
      border, to enable a more seamless flow of SIP-based multi-vendor media 
      for Unified Communications (UC).

      Sonus SBCs serve a critical role in enabling and activating Microsoft 
      Lync within enterprise SIP networks.&#160;By integrating Sonus SBCs into Lync 
      deployments, these powerful network devices protect, secure, simplify 
      and standardize real-time, SIP-based multimedia communications &#8211; 
      including voice over IP (VoIP) and video &#8211; enabling enterprises' UC 
      vision to become a reality.

      A Nemertes Research report, &#8220;Microsoft Lync Reality Check,&#8221; 
      indicated that most enterprises are implementing an evolutionary 
      implementation strategy to Lync Enterprise Voice. Most enterprises are 
      starting small and either augmenting existing telephony systems or 
      gradually migrating those groups most well suited to a softphone-centric 
      working model. For this reason, it is critical that the SBC enables 
      interoperability between different network elements provided from a 
      variety of UC vendors. Sonus SBCs deliver built-in media transcoding, 
      network security (such as encryption, authentication and denial of 
      service (DoS) protection), robust SIP interworking, intelligent call 
      routing and multi-vendor interoperability.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Commodity merchant Gunvor, long known in the industry as one of the key traders of Russian oil, is studying growing opportunities in North America resulting from the shale oil boom and is looking at select trading assets including parts of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s (JPM.N) business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the Reuters Global Commodities Summit on Tuesday, Gunvor chief executive and co-founder Torbjorn Tornqvist said the firm saw opportunities in North America and had been in contact with the Wall Street bank, which put its physical trading business up for sale this summer for around $3.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes we can confirm that we have contacted JPMorgan and we have been looking at some of their assets," Tornqvist said. "It is an important part of our business to always look at assets. Out of the 10 we are looking at maybe one or two will go all the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are obviously in the area of looking to expand our arbitrage assets. And that goes for all commodities, not only oil, we are looking in other commodities as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's assets include oil storage tanks in Canada and its Henry Bath global network of metal warehouses. The bank sent out its prospectus to several potential buyers last month as it decided to sell the unit due to tighter regulations and political scrutiny on banks active in commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, Switzerland-based Gunvor handled as much as 40 percent of Russia's seaborne crude oil exports via a number of long-term deals with Russian energy majors such as Rosneft (ROSN.MM), Surgut (SNGS.MM) and TNK-BP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has moved to diversify, opening offices across the world and beginning to trade other commodities while ceding some parts of its Russian trading book to rivals Vitol and Glencore (GLEN.L) after premiums at tenders of firms such as Rosneft spiked steeply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tornqvist said that shipping Russian crude now makes up less than a third of the firm's business, as it has moved into areas such as gasoline and diesel trading, refining, production and metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are a global diversified company whereby Russia plays an extremely important role," Tornqvist said, adding the firm was already involved in projects looking at exporting liquid petroleum gas (LPG) from the United States, a by-product of the shale oil boom that is not subject to the same export restrictions as crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GO WEST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tornqvist said the logistical bottlenecks that have sprung up in North America due to the shale oil revolution and growing output from Canada's oil sands had generally created attractive trading opportunities. The United States' emergence as a major exporter of refined products such as gasoline, diesel and natural gas liquids (NGLs) is another attractive area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously we see a lot of opportunity there, there are certain things that we have done... We are involved in LPG as a by-product of natural gas, and taking that out from the United States. And we look forward to being involved in similar projects in the future," Tornqvist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will also be blending opportunities between the heavy crude oils from Canada and the lighter U.S. crude oils," Tornqvist said. "There will be good opportunities in North America for many years to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has a collection of long-term leases on more than a quarter of the oil tanks in Hardisty, Alberta, the main storage and transportation hub for output from Canada's oil sands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank holds over 6 million barrels of storage space in tanks leased from pipeline company Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO), according to market sources. Crude traders in Canada's oil capital Calgary say they provide a powerful trading tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUIET CHANGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunvor has also diversified into commodity extraction in recent years, buying a $400 million stake in a troubled Montana coal mine in 2011. In the past year, Gunvor has hired metals specialists and started trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy still represents the lion's share of the business with refined products trading accounting around two thirds of the energy business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have changed our strategy quietly in Russia. We have made a lot of investments in oil terminals. We are working a little bit less with volume but we try to have more quality in our trading, rather than chasing volumes," said Tornqvist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he expected the firm's turnover in 2013 to remain near record levels seen in 2012 "with a slight bias to the upside". He also said the firm was working on its upstream strategy in oil but it was likely to remain a rare, opportunistic activity with trading still very much dominating the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunvor owns two refineries in Europe having snapped them up a low prices in 2012 after independent refiner Petroplus went bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had a good run on those refineries and even this year we have managed to keep them profitable," he said, but added: "I have no illusions about the difficulties that the European refinery sector will have to go through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next two years, U.S. plants as well as new refineries in China and the Middle East will take further market share away from Europe, prompting 5-10 plants in Europe to close down and reducing its refining capacity by a tenth or 1 million barrels per day, Tornqvist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Governments would like to be seen doing something. But the reality is there is not much they can do. This is a process which is necessary and it is long overdue," Tornqvist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For other news from the Reuters Global Commodities Summit, click here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits; Additional reporting by Lin Nouiehed, Ron Bousso, Claire Milhench, Simon Falush, Alex Lawler and Dmitry Zhdannikov in London; editing by Jason Neely)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) said it will invest over $4 billion in China and build new plants between 2015 and 2017, to counter competition which is chipping away at its share of the country's 421 billion yuan ($69.12 billion) soft drinks market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment will add to the $4 billion that the world's largest drinks maker has earmarked for China in 2012-2014, said Asia-based spokeswoman Sharolyn Choy, confirming a Bloomberg report earlier on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beverage maker is also open to deals with local firms, Choy said. Analysts said this could help it play the trend in China toward more local-style herbal teas and healthier drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese consumers are increasingly opting for healthier alternatives in food and drink, which has hit growth for fast food chains such as McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The beverage market is quite competitive right now and Coke is going to have to do a lot more acquisitions rather than growing through organic growth," said Shaun Rein, Shanghai-based managing director of China Market Research Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is starting to compete against some really well-capitalized local players like JDB, which has a herbal tea called 'JDB Red Can' that out-sells Coke in many provinces in China and is double the price."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola is still the leading drinks maker in China. It held 16 percent market share by total volume in 2012, down from 16.6 percent five years ago, according to data from market research firm Euromonitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ting Hsin International Group, which owns food and beverage maker Tingyi Cayman Islands Holding Corp (0322.HK), is the second-largest drinks maker. It has increased its market share over the same period from 8.8 percent to close to 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola's global sales missed targets in the April-June quarter, with the company citing economic slowdown in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's economy is set to grow at its slackest pace in 23 years in 2013, at 7.5 percent, as its export sales falter on fragile global demand.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) reported a 12 gain in profit that beat Wall Street expectations, lifted by higher visitor spending at U.S. theme parks, increased consumer product sales and its summer animated movie hit "Monsters University."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media company on Thursday posted diluted earnings per share of 77 cents for the quarter ended in September, edging the 76 cents average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income for the quarter rose to $1.4 billion, a 12 percent gain a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney, which have gained nearly 35 percent this year, slipped 1.8 percent in after-hours trading to $65.94, down from their earlier $67.15 close on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors reacted negatively to a prediction from Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo, on a post-earnings conference call, that capital expenditures will increase by $1 billion over 2013, said Needham &amp; Co. analyst Laura Martin. Most of those funds will go toward increased investment in the Shanghai Disney Resort scheduled to open in late 2015, Rasulo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company had been saying that the capital expenditures were going down," said Martin, who rates Disney stock a "hold." "Markets look ahead," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the just-ended quarter, operating income at Disney's cable network unit, which includes its powerhouse ESPN sports channel, decreased by 7 percent to $1.3 billion in the quarter, the company said, citing the timing of some ESPN affiliate fee revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite taking an undisclosed writedown for its summer flop "The Lone Ranger," Disney's movie studio reported a 35 percent rise in earnings during the quarter, boosted by Pixar prequel "Monsters University." The film generated $743 million in worldwide ticket sales, according to the site Box Office Mojo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney also announced it will release the next installment in the blockbuster "Star Wars" film franchise on December 18, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating income grew 15 percent to $571 million at Disney's parks and resorts unit, as visitors increased spending at Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland Resort in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's Interactive unit turned around in the quarter, earning $16 million after losing $76 million a year ago, partially on sales of its new Disney Infinity console game. The company has sold more than 1 million Infinity starter packs, Chief Executive Bob Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All indications suggest the strong demand for Disney Infinity will continue," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the consumer products unit, operating income rose 30 percent to $347 million. The growth was driven by licensing of products tied to films such as "Monsters University" as well as products included after last year's acquisition of "Star Wars" producer Lucasfilm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said Disney was making progress in negotiations with Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) to carry the company's TV networks, though he said remaining issues "could take some time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now, the negotiation is more about issues related to technology," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger also said he was not preparing to sell the ABC television stations that Disney owns, as some news outlets have reported.

			Veris Group, LLC Completes IBM 3PAO Assessment 
      Resulting in FedRAMP JAB Provisional Authorization
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Veris Group, LLC recently concluded its services as the Third Party 
      Assessment Organization (3PAO) for the multinational technology and 
      consulting firm IBM. Veris Group performed the 3PAO security assessment 
      of IBM&#8217;s SmartCloud for Government (SCG) solution. IBM&#8217;s extensive cloud 
      service offerings must meet Federal Risk Authorization and Management 
      Program (FedRAMP) program requirements, which includes an independent 
      security assessment by a 3PAO, such as Veris Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The successful IBM assessment resulted in a FedRAMP provisional 
      Authorization to Operate (ATO) from the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) 
      for the IBM SCG solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FedRAMP &#8220;is a government-wide program that provides a standardized 
      approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous 
      monitoring for cloud products and services.&#8221; Veris Group, one of the 
      nine initial 3PAO service providers under FedRAMP, worked closely with 
      IBM stakeholders to ensure that all management, operational, and 
      technical security requirements were in adherence to FedRAMP standards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;IBM fully dedicated the resources and time to achieve their JAB 
      authorization by making it one of the organization&#8217;s highest 
      priorities,&#8221; noted Michael Carter, Veris Group Director, FedRAMP  
      Assessment Services. &#8220;This dedication allowed for the successful 
      completion of our comprehensive assessment within a condensed timeframe.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - IBM's (IBM.N) Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge is retiring at the end of the year after almost a decade on the job as the technology services provider struggles with declining revenue and weakness in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loughridge, who joined International Business Machines in 1977 as a development engineer, will be succeeded by Martin Schroeter, who was previously IBM's head of global finance, the company said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Loughridge will turn 60, IBM's traditional retirement age, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schroeter, 49, will take on his new role January 1, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, three sources with knowledge of discussions about management said originally Loughridge was set to leave in 2015 but that a number of factors had led to his earlier departure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, James Kavanaugh, vice president and controller at IBM, may take on a new role as well, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Schroeter and Kavanaugh gave presentations at a two-day strategic board meeting in September.

&lt;p&gt;By Nicola Leske and Nadia Damouni&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nov 7 (Reuters) - IBM's Chief Financial Officer Mark
Loughridge is retiring at the end of the year after almost a
decade on the job as the technology services provider struggles
with declining revenue and weakness in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge, who joined International Business Machines in
1977 as a development engineer, will be succeeded by Martin
Schroeter, who was previously IBM's head of global finance, the
company said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Loughridge will turn 60, IBM's traditional
retirement age, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schroeter, 49, will take on his new role Jan. 1, the company
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, three sources with knowledge of discussions about
management said originally Loughridge was set to leave in 2015
but that a number of factors had led to his earlier departure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, James Kavanaugh, vice president and controller
at IBM, may take on a new role as well, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Schroeter and Kavanaugh gave presentations at a two-day

IBM is rethinking its 2015 roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources asked to remain unnamed because the discussions
were not public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM aims to reach earnings per share of at least $20 in
2015; this year it is targeting at least $16.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York-based company declined to comment but a
spokesman pointed to a statement from Schroeter saying that he
looked forward to working to deliver the 2015 roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades 5 Classes of JPM 2006-LDP7
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded five classes and affirmed 14 classes of J. 
      P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., commercial 
      mortgage pass-through certificates series 2006-LDP7. A detailed list of 
      rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating downgrades are the result of increased loss expectations on 
      the specially serviced assets since Fitch's last rating action.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 9.2% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 10.7%, including $133.6 million (3.4% of 
      the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has 
      designated 55 loans (26.2%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 18 
      specially serviced assets (13.5%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the October 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 20.3% to $3.14 billion from $3.94 billion at 
      issuance. Per the servicer reporting, four loans (0.7% of the pool) are 
      defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes A-J 
      through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is the Westfield Centro 
      Portfolio loan (7.6% of the pool), which is secured by a portfolio of 
      four regional malls and one anchored retail center totaling 2.4 million 
      square feet (sf) (1.7 million sf of collateral) located in OH, CT, MO, 
      CA, and CO. The decline in performance historically is attributed to the 
      Midway Mall property located in Elyria, OH, which has struggled with low 
      occupancy in a weak market and is currently 68% occupied. Overall, the 
      portfolio is 71.6% occupied as of June 2013. Three of the remaining 
      properties continue to have occupancies in the mid 90's, and one is 77% 
      occupied. The trailing 12 month (TTM) June 2013, debt-service coverage 
      ratio (DSCR) for the portfolio is 1.05x compared to 1.09x last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is the 
      specially-serviced One  Two Prudential Plaza loan (1.2%), which is 
      secured by two connected properties in Chicago, IL. One Prudential Plaza 
      is a 1,202,772 sf office property and Two Prudential Plaza is a 990,749 
      sq ft office property. The properties have a combined occupancy of 69% 
      as of March 2013. The loan was modified in June 2013 whereby the A-1  
      A-2 notes were split into a $336 million set of A-Notes and $74 million 
      set of B-Notes. The interest rate on the new A-Notes was reduced to 
      3.0622% for a period of three years with excess cash flow from the 
      property going to the combined TI/LC/Cap Ex Reserve. The difference 
      between the reduced rate and the note rate is accrued, to be repaid upon 
      an equity event (either sale or refinance of the property). The B-Notes 
      accrue at contract rate. The borrower has options to extend the current 
      maturity date from June 1, 2016 for two one-year periods. The loan was 
      assumed, with new sponsors  guarantors, Michael Silberberg and Mark 
      Karasick. There are two new leases (Ryan Specialty Group, 18007 sf, 11 
      years, commences Dec. 11, 2013; University of Chicago, 23,199sf, seven 
      years, commences Dec. 1, 2016) and one renewal lease (Chicago Federation 
      of Labor - 7,682 sf, five years, commences Aug. 1, 2014), which have 
      been signed. The property reserve balance is currently $60,245,126.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is the 
      specially-serviced Shoreview Corporate Center asset (1.7%), which is 
      secured by a 552,927 sf office property (1.6%) located in Shoreview, MN, 
      approximately 12 miles north of the Minneapolis CBD. The collateral 
      consists of five buildings built in 1973 and renovated in 2005. The loan 
      was transferred to special servicing in October 2009 due to imminent 
      default resulting from the largest tenant, (41%) net rentable area 
      (NRA), vacating at lease expiration. The property became real estate 
      owned (REO) on March 28, 2012. CB Richard Ellis was retained as property 
      manager and leasing agent. Tenants Hill-Rom and a Land O Lakes have 
      renewed their leases and Questar has vacated. The property is 53.8% 
      occupied as of Sept. 2013. Per the special servicer, there is a 
      potential lease prospect for 64,000 square feet of space and they 
      continue to evaluate all possible disposition alternatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating Outlooks on classes A-3 through A-M remain Stable due to 
      increasing credit enhancement and continued paydown. The Rating Outlook 
      on class A-J remains Negative due to the large number of Fitch Loans of 
      Concern and the potential for future defaults as well as current 
      interest shortfalls to that class.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch downgrades the following classes and assigns or revises Recovery 
      Estimates (REs) as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$310.3 million class A-J to 'BBsf' from 'BBBsf'; Outlook Negative;

      --$39.4 million class E to 'Csf' from 'CCsf'; RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      --$5 million class A-3A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$394 million class A-M at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$39.4 million class F at 'Csf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$49.2 million class G at 'Csf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$39.4 million class H at 'Csf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$38.7 million class J at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class K at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class M at 'Dsf'; RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The class A-1 and A-2 certificates have paid in full. Fitch does not 
      rate the class N, P, Q and NR certificates. Fitch previously withdrew 
      the rating on the interest-only class X certificates.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Francis Dunleavy, who ran the JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) energy desk in Houston that was accused of manipulating the U.S. power market earlier this year, has retired from the bank after a career of more than 30 years, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunleavy, who headed up a division known as Principal Commodity Investment that used the bank's own capital to invest in energy-related assets, ran the business for six years after 25 years at Bear Stearns. He left on October 17, the JPMorgan spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His departure comes at a tumultuous time for the bank's commodity team, which months ago agreed to pay $410 million to settle allegations that it manipulated power markets in California and the Midwest between 2010 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)identified Dunleavy and two members of his team, Andrew Kittell and John Bartholomew, as instigating the alleged strategy, but it did not seek to fine them or press charges. Their lawyers have said they did nothing that broke the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunleavy, 57, could not be reached for comment. A former colleague said he had been planning to retire for some time. The person did not want to be named because the person was not authorized to speak to the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FERC deal came just days after JPMorgan announced plans to sell or spin off its physical commodity trading desk amid unprecedented regulatory and political scrutiny of U.S. banks' involvement in physical commodity trading - and a crackdown on the ownership of assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other banks are also seeing senior-level departures, with two of Goldman Sachs Inc's (GS.N) top commodity executives having left the bank in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunleavy's career spanned more than three decades after he joined Bear Stearns in 1982 and became partner in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was considered instrumental in building out the bank's energy business into a 220-person power and natural gas trading desk in Houston before JPMorgan acquired the bank in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying Bear Stearns helped transform JPMorgan into the biggest oil, power, gas and metals trader on Wall Street as big financial institutions expanded into lucrative physical commodity trading. But JPMorgan, as a regulated bank holding company, was never allowed to own power plants and other commodity assets in the way that Bear Stearns had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tighter regulation, high costs and lower price volatility have forced some U.S. banks to curb their activities in the capital-intensive business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On leaving last month, Dunleavy handed over the reins of the Principal Commodity Investment unit to John Anderson, who is also head of JPMorgan's power and gas trading, the JPMorgan spokesman said.

      Research and Markets: Global Personalized Medicine Market to 2016: 
      Abbott, AstraZeneca, F. Hoffman-La Roche, Novaris, Pfizer  Sanofi 
      Dominate the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/24c5v2/future_prospects) 
      has announced the addition of the "Future 
      Prospects of Global Personalized Medicine Market 2012-2016" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Personalized Medicine market 2012-2016 to grow at a CAGR of 
      12.07 percent over the period 2012-2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the key drivers in this market is the significant growth of the 
      Targeted Biologics segment. This segment is one of the significant 
      segments of personalized medicine and is expected to signify about 25 
      percent of the commercialized drugs during the forecast period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the years, the Global Personalized Medicine market has been 
      witnessing the emergence of various tools and technologies from the 
      reputed vendors. For instance, AssureRx Health Inc. launched GeneSightRx 
      ADHD in May 2012, a personalized medicine test for the growing number of 
      children and adults diagnosed with ADHD. Moreover, Bristol-Myers Squibb 
      Co. collaborated with MMRF in December 2012 for advanced personalized 
      medicine for multiple Myeloma. Further, Alacris Theranostics GmbH 
      entered into an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline plc in November 2012 to 
      use ModCell system for early stage cancer research. Further, AltheaDx 
      Inc. launched FLT3 Mutation Assay in October 2012. Agendia N.V. launched 
      ColoPrint microarray-based 18-gene expression signature in June 2012 for 
      predicting the risk of distant recurrence for stage II colon cancer 
      patients. The European Medicines Agency approved Zelboraf, manufactured 
      by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., in December 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is patients' 
      limited awareness about personalized medicines in developing countries. 
      Most of the patients in developing countries such as India and China are 
      not fully aware of the recent developments in personalized medicines.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 6 (Reuters) - The New York City police
department denied that its commissioner, Ray Kelly, was in talks
with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co about a senior role in security
at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and Kelly get along
well, a source told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Wednesday, both the New York Post and Reuters
citing unnamed sources, said the two men had been discussing a
job for Kelly at the New York-based bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Post reported the talks and said Kelly may
leave his job before Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio is sworn in to
replace Michael Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's head of security, Tom Higgins, recently left the
bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John McCarthy, deputy commissioner for public affairs and
chief spokesman for NYPD, told Reuters the New York Post story
was false and that Kelly was not in discussions with JP Morgan
for a job.&lt;/p&gt;

			Coca-Cola Releases 2012-2013 Global 
      Sustainability Report
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Report Highlights Progress on Comprehensive 2020 Sustainability 
      Goals with a Focus on Women, Water and Well-being
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company today released its tenth annual Sustainability 
      Report and third Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Report 
      highlighting the progress the Coca-Cola system made in 2012 and the new 
      2020 sustainability goals announced earlier this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At Coca-Cola, sustainability is a critical component of our business 
      strategy. It is about improving lives, creating jobs, increasing 
      opportunity, preserving resources and meeting needs for the communities 
      we proudly serve around the globe,&#8221; said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO, 
      The Coca-Cola Company. &#8220;There are no issues that will more shape or 
      define the 21st century than the global empowerment of women; 
      the management of the world&#8217;s precious water resources; and the well-being 
      of the world&#8217;s growing population.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is the first report to include both an update on existing 
      sustainability goals and the Company&#8217;s new 
      global 2020 goals. The report follows the Company&#8217;s sustainability 
      framework&#8212;&#8220;Me, We, World&#8221;&#8212;and is rooted in three leadership priorities:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Women: In our third year, we continue our journey to 
        economically empower 5 million women entrepreneurs across our value 
        chain by 2020 through our 5by20&#8482; 
        program. Specifically, this includes the small businesses that 
        work with the Company in more than 200 countries around the world. 
        This initiative aims to help women entrepreneurs, from fruit farmers 
        to artisans, overcome the barriers they face to succeed in business. 
        By the end of 2012, 5by20 programs had enabled 300,000 women in 22 
        countries&#8212;more than double the number of participants reached by the 
        end of 2011.
      
			
				Water: We are partnering around the world to meet our 2020 
        water use reduction and replenishment goals. This work has 
        improved our water efficiency by 21.4 percent since 2004 and supported 
        an estimated replenishment of approximately 52 percent of the water we 
        used in our finished beverage products through 2012. We also recently 
        announced progress in our partnership with DEKA RD and other partners 
        to deliver 500 million liters of safe drinking water to communities in 
        20 countries through Slingshot&#8482; water purification units and 
        EKOCENTER&#8482; kiosks by the end of 2015.
      
			
				Well-being: In advancing one of our global 
        commitments to help address obesity, we offer more than 800 low- 
        and no-calorie options worldwide&#8212;nearly 25 percent of our global 
        portfolio. In 2012, we introduced more than 500 new products globally, 
        including portion-controlled options for regular calorie products, and 
        more than 100 new low- or no-calorie options. Since 2000, our average 
        number of calories per serving has decreased by 9 percent globally. In 
        2012, we supported more than 290 active healthy living programs in 118 
        countries.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report also updates other areas of progress. Through The Coca-Cola 
      Foundation, the Company&#8217;s global philanthropic arm, we invested $101.6 
      million (1 percent of our operating income) in grants to support 
      sustainable community initiatives in 2012. We continue applying our 
      supply chain and logistics expertise to help deliver essential medicines 
      to communities that need them through Project Last Mile, and 98 percent 
      of our Company-owned facilities achieved compliance with our Workplace 
      Rights Policy for the second consecutive year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We have reaffirmed our long-held policy of not marketing to children. 
      Under climate protection, we established an ambitious new goal to reduce 
      the carbon footprint of &#8220;the drink in your hand&#8221; by 25 percent by 2020 
      against baseline year of 2010. On packaging, we have distributed about 
      14 billion fully recyclable PlantBottle&#8482; packages across 24 countries 
      through 2012. We also set an ambitious new goal to sustainably source 
      key agricultural ingredients by 2020.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The global challenges we are facing and addressing through our value 
      chain require collaborative action across the golden triangle of 
      business, government and civil society,&#8221; said Bea Perez, Chief 
      Sustainability Officer at The Coca-Cola Company. &#8220;Our comprehensive 2020 
      goals are ambitious, but we are making tangible progress. The collective 
      expertise of our partners motivates and enables us to do more than we 
      could alone.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 2012-2013 
      Sustainability Report
			demonstrates The Coca-Cola 
      Company&#8217;s commitment to continuous improvement, increased disclosure, 
      risk assessment and expanded stakeholder engagement. The report is 
      available on the Company&#8217;s website, Coca-Cola Journey, and features 
      social and multimedia capabilities. This year, the Company has 
      self-declared an application level of B+ per the GRI G3.1 guidelines 
      reporting against 35 Key Performance Indicators. Ernst  Young LLP, a 
      registered public accounting firm, provided external assurance on 
      several sustainability indicators including water use ratio, 
      PlantBottle&#8482; packaging, lost-time incident rate and front-of-pack 
      labeling.

&lt;p&gt;NAIROBI Nov 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said its
affiliates in Madagascar have obtained extensions to their
production-sharing licences, allowing exploration activities to
resume four years after the company declared force majeure
following a coup on the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's return will be a boon for the cash-starved Indian
Ocean nation and comes as the Malagasy people await the outcome
of a presidential election many hope will end a political crisis
and rebuild investor confidence in the crippled economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The affiliates intend to resume exploration work and
environmental assessments for shore-based and offshore
operations in preparation for deepwater drilling," Exxon said in
a statement late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The declaration of force majeure in 2009 by Exxon, the
world's largest publicly traded oil company, was a blow for
coup-leader-turned-president Andry Rajoelina, whose power grab 
triggered a slump in foreign direct investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajoelina signed the extensions in July, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon holds three production-sharing contract licenses in
Madagascar, which has no proven offshore hydrocarbon reserves
but shares a maritime boundary with Mozambique where huge
deposits of natural gas have been found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another oil firm, AIM-listed Madagascar Oil,
estimates its two principal onshore fields, Tsimiroro and
Bemolanga, have multi-billion-barrel resource volumes in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile goalkeeper Johnny Herrera will miss this month's friendly against Brazil in Toronto after Canada denied him a visa, the Andean country's FA (ANFP) said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile will meet the World Cup hosts on November 19, four days after playing England at Wembley, as part of their preparations for the 2014 finals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ANFP (www.anfp.com.cl) did not provide a reason for why the Canadian authorities declined to grant a visa for Herrera, first choice goalkeeper Claudio Bravo's understudy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local media said it could be due to the Universidad de Chile goalkeeper having been found guilty of killing a 22-year-old woman while he was speeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herrera had his driving license revoked for two years in June when a judge ordered him to report to police for a year for slamming into student Macarena Casassus in Santiago in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulo Garces, who plays for O'Higgins, will join the Chile squad for the Brazil friendly in Canada with Herrera returning home after the England game, the ANFP said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian officials were not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Rex Gowar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades 6 Classes of JP Morgan 2006-LDP9
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings downgrades six classes of JP Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2006-LDP9. A detailed listing of 
      rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERSThe downgrades reflect an increase in Fitch 
      modeled losses primarily due to the lower valuations on the specially 
      serviced assets. Fitch modeled losses of 21.1% of the remaining pool; 
      expected losses on the original pool balance total 20.1%, including 
      losses already incurred to date. Fitch has identified 69 loans (52.6%) 
      as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 23 specially serviced assets 
      (25.4%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the October 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 22.3% to $3.8 billion from $4.89 billion at 
      issuance. Five loans (2% of the pool) are defeased. Interest shortfalls 
      are currently affecting classes A-J through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITYThe ratings on the investment grade classes are 
      expected to remain stable due to sufficient credit enhancement and 
      continued paydown. The distressed classes (rated below 'B') may be 
      subject to further rating actions as losses are realized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to losses (9.9% of the pool) is a loan secured 
      by a 215-unit residential rental property located in the Upper West Side 
      neighborhood of New York City. In addition to the residential rentals, 
      the property also includes 60,514 square feet (sf) of retail space. The 
      property consists of both rent controlled/stabilized units and market 
      rent units. At issuance, the borrower estimated that units would be 
      converted from rent controlled/stabilized to market rents, benefiting 
      from the upside in revenue. However, such conversion plan never 
      materialized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loan transferred to the special servicer in June 2011 for imminent 
      default. A loan modification was closed in March 2013 and the loan 
      maturity date has been extended to November 2018. Based on the 
      modification terms, the borrower has provided new equity to fund future 
      capital expenses. The loan is performing according to the modification 
      agreement. The servicer-reported occupancy rate was 95% as of May 2013. 
      The servicer-reported debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 0.86x as of 
      March 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to losses (5.1%) is a loan secured by a 
      portfolio of four cold storage warehouse/distribution facilities 
      totaling 3,328,621 sf (51,654,912 cubic feet) located across four 
      states. The properties are located in Carthage, MO (66% of portfolio 
      NRA); Fort Worth, TX (14.3% of portfolio NRA); West Point, MS (10.3% of 
      portfolio NRA) and Garden City, KS (9.5% of portfolio NRA). The 
      servicer-reported DSCR for YE 2012 and issuance was 0.66x and 1.85x, 
      respectively. The DSCR has remained around 0.6x since 2010. The drop in 
      DSCR is attributed to the loss of a major tenant, Sarah Lee, which has 
      ceased renting space in the Fort Worth property. This Fort Worth 
      property has since been closed in an effort to reduce operating 
      expenses. As of year-end 2012 (YE12), the weighted average portfolio 
      occupancy was 69.7%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to losses (6.1%) is a loan secured by a 
      portfolio of three class A office properties totaling 1.43 million 
      square feet (SF) located in Dallas, TX. YE 2012 occupancy decreased to 
      81% from 90% at YE2012, primarily due to a large tenant which occupied 
      108,031 sf (8% NRA) vacating upon their lease expiration. As of 1Q2013, 
      the DSCR was reported at 1.26x with 78% occupancy rate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has downgraded and assigned Recovery Ratings to the following 
      classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$1.652 billion class A-3 to 'Asf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$124.5 
      million class A-3SFL 'Asf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$11.2 
      million class A-3SFX to 'Asf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$665.4 
      million class A-1A to 'Asf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$364 
      million class A-M to 'CCCsf' from 'Bsf'; RE 90%;--$121.4 million 
      class A-MS to 'CCCsf' from 'Bsf'; RE 90%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has affirmed the following classes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$63.2 million class A-2 at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$318.5 
      million class A-J at 'CCsf'; RE0%;--$106.3 million class A-JS at 
      'CCsf'; RE0%;--$72.8 million class B at 'Csf'; RE 0%;--$24.3 
      million class B-S at 'Csf'; RE 0%;--$22.8 million class C at 
      'Csf'; RE 0%;--$7.6 million class C-S at 'Csf'; RE 0%;--$50 
      million class D at 'Csf'; RE 0%;--$16.7 million class D-S at 
      'Csf'; RE 0%;--$40.9 million class E at 'Csf'; RE 0%;--$13.7 
      million class E- Sat 'Csf'; RE 0%;--$40.9 million class F at 
      'Csf'; RE 0%;--$13.7 million class F-S at 'Csf'; RE 0%;--$36.4 
      million class G at 'Csf'; RE 0%;--$12.1 million class G-S at 
      'Csf'; RE 0%;--$11.9 million class H at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;--$4 
      million class H-S at 'Dsf'; RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Classes J through P have been depleted due to realized losses and remain 
      at 'Dsf' RE 0%. Classes A-1, A-1S, A-2S, A-2SFL, A-2SFX have paid in 
      full. Class NR is not rated by Fitch. Fitch has previously withdrawn the 
      ratings of the interest only class X.

      One of the major concerns for enterprises and end-users to adopt cloud 
      computing and its applications is the reliability and affordability of 
      the solution. There are concerns over the security of data in the cloud 
      servers as end-users are unaware of the location of the data stored. To 
      address these concerns, the cloud service providers are incorporating 
      disaster recovery measures where a backup of the data and applications 
      are stored in a backup server. In case of a disaster, the data is 
      recovered and restored back. Further, there are many measures being 
      taken to reduce the costs associated with cloud computing such as the 
      incorporation of high-performance computing equipment and virtualized 
      infrastructures which reduces the capital expenditure of the cloud 
      service provider, thereby reducing the cost of the services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers is the need for the 
      faster provisioning of enterprise applications. Cloud-based service 
      providers are able to cater to the application requirements of the 
      enterprises at a faster rate compared to internal provisioning. The 
      cloud-based applications do not require huge capital investments for 
      their adoption which is driving enterprises to increase their adoption.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is the 
      increasing adoption of virtualized servers by the service vendors, which 
      is reducing the demand for physical servers across cloud computing 
      networks. To provide a cheaper service and reduce the physical 
      infrastructure the cloud service providers are procuring virtualized 
      infrastructures.

      Research and Markets: Global SMB IT Spending Market to 2016: Cisco, 
      Dell, HP  IBM Dominate the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/nndcvd/global_smb_it) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      SMB IT Spending Market to 2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Small and Medium Businesses (SMB) IT Spending market to grow 
      at a CAGR of 5.5 percent over the period 2012-2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The SMB IT Spending market has many growth drivers; one of which is the 
      increased usage of mobile devices by employees in workplaces. Employees 
      working in various organizations are carrying their own devices to their 
      workplace and are connecting them to the company networks. This poses a 
      tremendous challenge to companies as security of company data is at 
      stake. Therefore, SMBs are formulating their BYOD policies to provide a 
      seamless digital experience to their employees without fearing to lose 
      confidential information from their company networks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mobility is one area where we expect to see a lot of traction. Mobile 
      devices, applications, and services are dramatically reshaping SMBs' 
      business strategies, revenue models, and how employees interact with 
      partners, customers, and other employees. More SMB owners and decision 
      makers are now adopting telecommuting policies to help their employees 
      remain connected even on the go. The explosion of smartphones and 
      tablets is fuelling this adoption. These mobile devices provide great 
      operational and productivity benefits to organizations by allowing them 
      to empower their employees and spread out beyond traditional work 
      environment. Applications on these devices benefit organizations to 
      rapidly address customer demands and hence differentiate from their 
      competitors. Many of these applications are targeted toward specific 
      markets and a strong growth of apps is expected to be seen in the areas 
      of mobile payments, time management, and customer service. Therefore, 
      SMBs are gradually embracing mobility solutions to enhance customer 
      service, reduce costs through BYOD initiatives, and reduce rigidity with 
      regard to work styles through the effective application of mobile 
      solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is the cost involved in buying and implementing IT systems. SMBs 
      are characterized by being resource constrained and hence any 
      substantial expenditure is a matter of concern for SMBs. Thus, they are 
      over cautious while spending a substantial amount of money.

      Research and Markets: Global Telecom CRM Market to 2016: Avaya, 
      Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce  SAP Dominate the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/6j6jkz/global_telecom) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Telecom CRM Market to 2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Telecom Customer Relationship Management (CRM) market to grow 
      at a CAGR of 5.58 percent over the period 2012-2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers in the market is the increasing demand from 
      SMEs in the Telecom sector. CRM software for SMEs is a contemporary way 
      to increase revenue, improve customer service, and satisfaction, and to 
      reduce the cost of acquiring customers. With these significant benefits 
      associated with it, an increasing number of SMEs are adopting CRM 
      software. Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: There 
      is a growing demand for customized telecom CRM solutions among telecom 
      operators.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The reason for this increasing demand is the need to integrate CRM 
      solutions with the business process. A customized telecom CRM solution 
      offers many benefits as it is developed according to the specific needs 
      of an individual telecom operator. Also, it offers ease of integration 
      with the existing IT infrastructure. Commercial CRM software offers 
      several features that are not required by customers, however, customized 
      CRM solutions features the necessary requirements and facilitate the 
      reduction of the software cost significantly. Hence, the telecom 
      operators are adopting customized telecom CRM solutions. Thus, the 
      increasing demand for customized CRM solutions is an emerging trend that 
      will boost the growth of the Global Telecom CRM market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of such challenge is the complexity 
      involved in tools and workflows of telecom CRM software. Recently, CRM 
      software has been developed to include deal tracking, territories, 
      opportunities, and sales pipeline. This increase in the scope of CRM 
      software has led to an increase in the complexity of tools and workflows.

			Walton Signs First Agreement forWestphalia Town Center 
      with NVR, Inc.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			HOMEBUILDER TO BUILD 144 OF 348 TOWNHOMES DURING PHASE I
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walton Group of Companies (Walton), a family-owned, real estate 
      investment, planning, and development group in Maryland and Virginia, 
      with U.S. headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, announced today that it 
      has entered into an agreement with NVR, Inc. to build townhomes at 
      Westphalia Town Center in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is the first agreement Walton has made with a builder for 
      Westphalia Town Center. Under the agreement, NVR, Inc. has purchased 148 
      out of 348 townhome lots planned for Phase I of the master planned, 
      mixed-use community.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 479-acre Westphalia Town Center is Walton&#8217;s first development in 
      Maryland and one of the largest commercial real estate developments in 
      Prince George&#8217;s County to date. Upon completion, Westphalia is expected 
      to offer diverse residential options, including single-family homes, 
      townhomes, and apartments. The development also will feature an 
      elementary school, fire and rescue facility, shopping and restaurants, 
      commercial office space, as well as a hotel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Walton is committed to offering a variety of residential properties at 
      Westphalia Town Center, and we&#8217;re excited that NVR has chosen to partner 
      with us,&#8221; said John Vick, President of Walton Development  Management, 
      Eastern USA. &#8220;We look forward to announcing additional partnerships in 
      the near future as we work with Prince George&#8217;s County to create a 
      vibrant community at Westphalia.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Construction at Westphalia began earlier this summer following a 
      groundbreaking ceremony with Lt. Governor Anthony Brown and County 
      Executive Rushern L. Baker III. Phase I work, including the townhome 
      lots that NVR will develop, is projected to be completed in early 2014. 
      Westphalia Town Center is expected to deliver a significant economic 
      boost to the region, with a projected 15,000 permanent office and retail 
      jobs, as well as $21 million in county taxes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton manages approximately 3,500 acres of land in Maryland, including 
      2,900 acres in Prince George&#8217;s County. Construction-related spending to 
      completely develop Walton&#8217;s Prince George&#8217;s County holdings is estimated 
      to be more than $1.3 billion and is estimated to directly support an 
      annual average of more than 900 jobs during the construction period.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) expects to complete its previously announced plan to eliminate 4,000 jobs from its consumer business by year-end, 12 months ahead of schedule, a bank executive said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is increasingly using electronic tools, such as mobile deposits, online accounts and advanced teller machines, to handle basic consumer transactions and reduce the need for staff in its 5,652 branches, said Gordon Smith, chief executive of the company's Chase Consumer &amp; Community Banking unit, which accounts for roughly half of JPMorgan's revenue and profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith, speaking at a conference of institutional investors in Boston, said the company also will have reduced 11,000 positions from its mortgage operations by year-end, compared with its plan to bring down headcount by 13,000 to 15,000 by the end of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith's entire unit, which includes branches, mortgage lending and credit cards, employed 156,000 people at the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, like other banks, is under increased pressure from investors to cut expenses because revenue is down due to low interest rates, weak loan demand and tighter regulations on fees. The need for mortgage staff has fallen sharply with this year's drop in refinancing and with workouts of loans that went bad when house prices fell a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith vowed, however, that the company will continue to invest in upgrading its branches and attracting more deposits in anticipation of a time when interest rates rise and a stronger economy encourages more borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer banking operating expenses, aside from those for mortgages, should rise this year by 2.5 percent, less than the 3 percent target, Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Gerald E.

			Pfizer Announces Top-Line Results Of Phase 3B/4 Study Of RAPAMUNE&#174; 
      (sirolimus) In Renal Transplant Recipients
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today top-line results from a Phase 
      3B/4 study of RAPAMUNE&#174; (sirolimus) evaluating kidney transplant 
      patients who transitioned from tacrolimus-based therapy (TAC) to 
      RAPAMUNE&#174; 3 to 5 months after transplant. The primary endpoint of the 
      study was not achieved as there was not a statistically significant 
      difference in renal function improvement between patients who continued 
      receiving TAC and those who switched to RAPAMUNE&#174;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For patients who were switched to RAPAMUNE&#174;, 33.7% of patients achieved 
      the primary endpoint of a &#8805; 5 ml/min/1.73m2 renal function improvement 
      based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from randomization to 24 
      months post-transplantation and 42.3% of patients continuing to take TAC 
      achieved the primary endpoint (p=0.239).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The study was an open-label, randomized, comparative, multi-center, 
      multi-national study conducted in Europe, Latin America, North America, 
      and the Pacific Region. There were 256 subjects randomized at 3 to 5 
      months after transplant, with two subjects not receiving any medication. 
      Group I included 131 subjects receiving RAPAMUNE&#174;; the dose was adjusted 
      to sirolimus blood levels of 7-15 ng/mL during the first year 
      post-transplantation and 5-15 ng/mL thereafter. Group II, the control 
      group, included 123 subjects who continued receiving the same TAC-based 
      treatment that was being administered prior to randomization. Subjects 
      in both groups were evaluated at a pre-randomization visit, at the day 
      of randomization, 4-weeks after randomization, and 6-, 12-, 18- and 
      24-months post transplantation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The study also evaluated the safety of RAPAMUNE&#174; and the adverse events 
      observed in the study were consistent with the known safety profile of 
      RAPAMUNE&#174;. The results of this study are expected to be submitted for 
      presentation at upcoming scientific congresses and for publication in 
      peer-reviewed medical journals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the United States, RAPAMUNE&#174; is indicated for the prevention of organ 
      transplant rejection in kidney transplant patients aged 13 years and 
      older.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important RAPAMUNE&#174; Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			There is an increased risk of developing infections or certain 
      cancers, especially lymphoma and skin cancers.
			RAPAMUNE&#174; has not 
      been shown to be safe and effective in people who have had liver or lung 
      transplants.
			Serious complications and death may happen in people 
      who take RAPAMUNE&#174; after a liver or lung transplant. You should not take 
      RAPAMUNE&#174; if you have had a liver or lung transplant without talking 
      with your doctor.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Do not take RAPAMUNE&#174; if you know you are allergic to sirolimus or any 
      of the other ingredients in RAPAMUNE&#174;. Symptoms of an allergic reaction 
      include swelling of your face, eyes, or mouth; trouble breathing or 
      wheezing; throat tightness; chest pain or tightness; feeling dizzy or 
      faint; and rash or peeling of your skin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Before taking RAPAMUNE&#174;, tell your doctor if you have liver problems, 
      skin cancer or it runs in your family, high cholesterol or 
      triglycerides, are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, and are pregnant 
      or plan to become pregnant. Women of childbearing potential should use 
      effective birth control before therapy, during therapy, and for 12 weeks 
      after RAPAMUNE&#174; therapy has been stopped. RAPAMUNE&#174; may interact with 
      other medicines. Make sure that your doctor is aware of all prescription 
      and over-the-counter drugs that you are taking, including vitamins, 
      herbs, and nutritional supplements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RAPAMUNE&#174; may cause swelling in your hands, feet, and in various tissues 
      of your body. Call your doctor if you have trouble breathing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RAPAMUNE&#174; may cause your wounds to heal slowly or not heal well 
      resulting in redness, drainage, or opening of the wound.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RAPAMUNE&#174; may increase the levels of cholesterol and triglycerides 
      (lipids or fat) in your blood. Your doctor should do blood tests to 
      check your lipids during treatment with RAPAMUNE&#174;. Your doctor may 
      recommend treatment if your lipid levels become too high. Your lipid 
      levels may remain high even if you follow your prescribed treatment plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In patients taking RAPAMUNE&#174; with cyclosporine, decreased kidney 
      function has been observed. Your doctor will regularly check your kidney 
      function.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RAPAMUNE&#174; may increase protein in your urine. Your doctor may monitor 
      you for abnormal protein in your urine from time to time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RAPAMUNE&#174; may increase your risk for viral infections. Certain viruses 
      can live in your body and cause active infections when your immune 
      system is weak. One of these viruses, BK virus, can affect how your 
      kidney works and cause your transplanted kidney to fail. A certain virus 
      can cause a rare serious brain infection called Progressive Multifocal 
      Leukoencephalopathy causing death or severe disability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RAPAMUNE&#174; may cause potentially life-threatening lung or breathing 
      problems. Symptoms may include coughing, shortness of breath, or 
      difficulty breathing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      When RAPAMUNE&#174; is taken with cyclosporine or tacrolimus, you may develop 
      a blood clotting problem resulting in unexplained bleeding or bruising.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Common side effects associated with RAPAMUNE&#174; include high blood 
      pressure, pain (including stomach and joint pain), diarrhea, headache, 
      fever, urinary tract infection, low red blood cell count (anemia), 
      nausea, and low platelet count (cells that help blood to clot). If you 
      experience any side effects, contact your doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			RAPAMUNE&#174; Indications and Usage
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RAPAMUNE&#174; (sirolimus) is indicated for the prevention of organ rejection 
      in kidney transplant patients aged 13 years or older. Blood levels of 
      sirolimus should be checked in all patients taking RAPAMUNE&#174;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In patients at low to moderate risk of acute rejection, it is 
      recommended that RAPAMUNE&#174; be used initially in combination with 
      cyclosporine and corticosteroids; cyclosporine should be withdrawn 
      approximately 3 months after transplantation. Cyclosporine withdrawal 
      has not been studied in patients who have had severe acute rejection 
      prior to cyclosporine withdrawal, those who require dialysis or have a 
      high serum creatinine, Black patients, patients receiving a repeat 
      kidney transplant, patients receiving other transplanted organs besides 
      the kidney transplant, or patients with antibodies that may be directed 
      against the kidney transplant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In patients at high risk of acute rejection (defined as Black 
      patients and/or patients receiving a repeat kidney transplant who lost a 
      previous kidney transplant from rejection and/or patients with high 
      levels of antibodies that may be directed against the kidney 
      transplant), it is recommended that RAPAMUNE&#174; be used in combination 
      with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for the first year following 
      transplantation. The safety and efficacy of this combination in 
      high-risk patients have not been studied beyond one year; therefore, 
      after the first year, adjustments to the immunosuppressive regimen may 
      be considered by your doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In pediatric patients, the safety and efficacy of RAPAMUNE&#174; have 
      not been established in kidney transplant patients less than 13 years 
      old, or in patients less than 18 years old who are considered at high 
      risk of acute rejection.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The safety and efficacy of RAPAMUNE&#174; without cyclosporine in newly 
      transplanted kidney patients have not been established.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The safety and efficacy of changing from either cyclosporine or 
      tacrolimus to RAPAMUNE&#174; in maintenance kidney transplant patients have 
      not been established.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tech services giant Infosys Ltd (INFY.NS) agreed on Wednesday to pay $34 million to end a U.S. investigation related to the widespread practice by Indian firms of flying workers to client sites in the United States on temporary visas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, which the U.S. Justice Department said was the largest in a case of alleged civil fraud over visas, was filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infosys, India's second-largest IT services exporter, agreed in the settlement that it committed civil violations of U.S. employment law, but it was not required to admit and did not admit widespread further wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage or immigration abuse. Those claims are untrue and are assertions that remain unproven," Infosys said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company emphasized that the allegations were not criminal, and that there would be no limitations on its eligibility for U.S. federal contracts or access to U.S. visa programs as a result of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department had alleged in court papers that Infosys knowingly and unlawfully sent people to work without proper visas, that there were widespread failures in the company's record-keeping and that the company tried to deceive U.S. consular officials with false "invitation letters", which tell the government the purpose of travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One invitation letter from May 2010 for someone identified in court papers as "AR" said the person "would be involved in meetings and business discussions," but the real purpose of the trip was for computer coding and programming, the Justice Department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason the Justice Department decided to settle its allegations rather than try to prove them at trial was that Infosys took steps to fix irregularities and agree to outside monitoring, said U.S. Attorney John Bales of the Eastern District of Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bales said the Justice Department had anecdotal evidence that problems with I-9 forms - used to verify employment eligibility - and visa forms were common in the tech services industry. While he would not confirm that there are other open cases, he said others should pay attention to the Infosys settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They do acknowledge that there are problems with their I-9 process, and that however it happened - unintentional or not - their visa practice had some irregularities," Bales told Reuters in a phone interview. "They have pledged to be more accurate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've learned a lot in the case, and we're going to use that knowledge," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers are considering legislation that would make it more difficult and costly for Indian IT firms to send workers to the United States on temporary, restricted visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infosys employs roughly 15,000 people in the United States. As of March 31, about 10,800 of those were on H-1B visas, which allow an employee to stay and work in the United States up to six years, and 1,600 were on temporary L-1 visas, a company filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. investigation focused on the use of B-1 business visas and I-9 forms, Infosys has said. A person on a B-1 visa in the United States can participate in meetings but is not allowed to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is likely to add more fuel to the ongoing debate around visa reforms," Chirajeet Sengupta, practice director in Gurgaon, near New Delhi, at Everest Group, which advises clients on technology vendors, said on Tuesday after reports that a settlement was imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These reforms, if executed, have the potential to impact Indian service providers' landed resource model that is largely driven by access to H-1B visas in large numbers," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its statement, Infosys said only .02 percent of the days that Infosys staff worked on U.S. projects last year were performed by people on B-1 visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Company's use of B-1 visas was for legitimate business purposes and not in any way intended to circumvent the requirements of the H-1B program," the Bangalore-based company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infosys has secured roughly one B-1 visa for every 10 H-1B visas, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities had been looking into Infosys' use of visas since 2011. This month, Infosys set aside a reserve of $35 million, including legal fees, as it worked towards a resolution of the U.S. investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is "an important event in the annals of Indian IT industry," Sundararaman Viswanathan, a consultant in Bangalore with Zinnov, which advises U.S. corporations on sending outsourcing work to India, said ahead of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a common issue amongst all the Indian service providers - just that Infosys had to deal with it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though the Indian service providers do not intend to flout the visa regulations, there was definitely a lack of regard for certain norms and procedures. This will be fixed. There will be an increase in onsite hiring," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The story corrects the location of Everest Group consultant in 15th paragraph as Gurgaon, not Mumbai)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Tony Munroe; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Company had reserved $35 million for settlement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Infosys says no limit on eligibility for U.S. federal
contracts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Harichandan Arakali  and David Ingram&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE/WASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Tech services giant
Infosys Ltd agreed on Wednesday to pay $34 million to
end a U.S. investigation related to the widespread practice by
Indian firms of flying workers to client sites in the United

Infosys knowingly and unlawfully sent people to work without
proper visas, that there were widespread failures in the
company's record-keeping and that the company tried to deceive
U.S. consular officials with false "invitation letters", which
tell the government the purpose of travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One invitation letter from May 2010 for someone identified
in court papers as "AR" said the person "would be involved in

allegations rather than try to prove them at trial was that
Infosys took steps to fix irregularities and agree to outside
monitoring, said U.S. Attorney John Bales of the Eastern
District of Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bales said the Justice Department had anecdotal evidence
that problems with I-9 forms - used to verify employment
eligibility - and visa forms were common in the tech services
industry. While he would not confirm that there are other open
cases, he said others should pay attention to the Infosys
settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They do acknowledge that there are problems with their I-9
process, and that however it happened - unintentional or not -
their visa practice had some irregularities," Bales told Reuters
in a phone interview. "They have pledged to be more accurate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've learned a lot in the case, and we're going to use
that knowledge," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers are considering legislation that would make
it more difficult and costly for Indian IT firms to send workers
to the United States on temporary, restricted visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infosys employs roughly 15,000 people in the United States.
As of March 31, about 10,800 of those were on H-1B visas, which
allow an employee to stay and work in the United States up to
six years, and 1,600 were on temporary L-1 visas, a company
filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. investigation focused on the use of B-1 business
visas and I-9 forms, Infosys has said. A person on a B-1 visa in
the United States can participate in meetings but is not allowed
to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is likely to add more fuel to the ongoing debate around
visa reforms," Chirajeet Sengupta, practice director in Gurgaon,
near New Delhi, at Everest Group, which advises clients on
technology vendors, said on Tuesday after reports that a
settlement was imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These reforms, if executed, have the potential to impact
Indian service providers' landed resource model that is largely
driven by access to H-1B visas in large numbers," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its statement, Infosys said only .02 percent of the days
that Infosys staff worked on U.S. projects last year were
performed by people on B-1 visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Company's use of B-1 visas was for legitimate business
purposes and not in any way intended to circumvent the
requirements of the H-1B program," the Bangalore-based company
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infosys has secured roughly one B-1 visa for every 10 H-1B
visas, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter
who declined to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities had been looking into Infosys' use of visas
since 2011. This month, Infosys set aside a reserve of $35
million, including legal fees, as it worked towards a resolution
of the U.S. investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is "an important event in the annals of Indian IT
industry," Sundararaman Viswanathan, a consultant in Bangalore
with Zinnov, which advises U.S. corporations on sending
outsourcing work to India, said ahead of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a common issue amongst all the Indian service
providers - just that Infosys had to deal with it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though the Indian service providers do not intend to flout
the visa regulations, there was definitely a lack of regard for
certain norms and procedures. This will be fixed. There will be
an increase in onsite hiring," he said.

			WEX Announces Plans to Acquire ExxonMobil&#8217;s European Commercial Fuel 
      Card Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			WEX 
      Inc. (NYSE: WEX), a leading provider of corporate payment solutions, 
      today announced that it plans to acquire the assets of ExxonMobil&#8217;s 
      European commercial fuel card (&#8220;Esso Card&#8221;) program through a majority 
      owned joint venture, WEX Europe Services Limited. The anticipated 
      transaction is subject to completion of the employee information and 
      consultation processes, and obtaining of competition authority 
      approvals, as appropriate. Upon completion of the employee information 
      and consultation process, WEX expects to enter into a definitive 
      purchase and sale agreement related to the proposed acquisition with 
      ExxonMobil. In addition, both parties plan to enter into a long term 
      supply agreement to serve the current and future Esso Card customers and 
      to grow the business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement represents a significant milestone for WEX, as 
      building our on-the-ground presence in the European market has been a 
      key element to our international expansion strategy. The addition of the 
      Esso Card program to our offering will establish our presence in the 
      European fuel card market. Once completed, we expect that it will allow 
      WEX to leverage an existing infrastructure, creating a substantial and 
      profitable European footprint to develop and grow our European fleet 
      card business,&#8221; said Michael E. Dubyak, WEX chairman and chief executive 
      officer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the terms of the proposed transaction, WEX will purchase 
      ExxonMobil&#8217;s commercial fleet fuel card program which includes 
      operations, funding, pricing, and sales and marketing in nine countries 
      in Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In anticipation of an expected closing in late fourth quarter 2014 or 
      first quarter 2015, WEX will make investments relating to the 
      integration of operations and systems. It is anticipated that these 
      investments will occur over a two year period, and are expected to 
      impact 2014 earnings by ten to thirteen million dollars after taxes. 
      Upon completion of the deal, WEX estimates this portfolio will 
      contribute approximately $35 million in annual revenue.

&lt;p&gt;MADRID (Reuters) - A Spanish court postponed Friday's hearing with an ex-JPMorgan Chase employee at the heart of the bank's "London Whale" trading scandal, delaying proceedings over a U.S. extradition request because of a scheduling conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka on Friday denied refusing visas to a delegation from an international human rights group ahead of a Commonwealth summit in Colombo, saying its permission had not been sought for the overseas visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka hosts the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting next week and human rights groups have urged a boycott by leaders to put pressure on the government, which faces allegations of extra-judicial killings, harassment of minorities and the detention of politicians and journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI) accused Sri Lanka of denying entry to its delegation, including the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka's external affairs ministry said the country's Bar Association, which invited the delegation, had not followed the necessary procedure of securing the ministry's agreement for a conference involving international participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBAHRI claim was a "gross misrepresentation of facts and an attempt to sully the image of Sri Lanka," the ministry said in its statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upul Jayasuriya, head of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, said it had followed procedure and obtained the visas from the immigration department before the ministry revoked them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a violation and restriction of the constitutional rights granted for the freedom of expression and association," Jayasuriya told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bar Association cannot fight the move "when the government is acting like a bull in a china shop," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delegation and the bar council had been due to discuss the rule of law and independence of the legal profession ahead of the summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western nations, including the United States, Canada and Britain, along with neighboring India, have criticized Sri Lanka's human rights record and have demanded that President Mahinda Rajapaksa's government investigate war crimes in the final phase of a three-decade war that ended in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the war, Sri Lanka has rejected claims of human rights allegations, including murdering thousands of ethnic minority Tamil civilians in the rebel area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka has also rejected a demand by the West for an international probe of war crimes. Instead Rajapaksa appointed a domestic panel to look into the accusations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian police clashed with foreign workers in a poor district of Riyadh on Saturday, nearly a week into a visa crackdown in which thousands have been detained and one man killed by police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security forces in riot gear fired into the air and used truncheons to disperse large crowds as scores of men ran through the streets, some throwing stones and other missiles at cars and police, according to Reuters witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not clear if many people had been injured in the disturbances in the Manfuhah neighborhood of southern Riyadh, but there were ambulances among the emergency vehicles at one location. Most of the foreign workers involved in the clashes appeared to be Africans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities this year said they would no longer turn a blind eye to foreign workers breaking visa rules by working for companies that had not sponsored their entry into the world's top oil exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intention is to end a black market for cheap imported workers, cut the foreign labor force, reduce the flow of remittances to other countries and make more private sector jobs available for Saudi citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A seven-month amnesty for foreigners to rectify their visa status without penalty or leave the country - which prompted an exodus of hundreds of thousands of foreigners - expired on Monday, prompting the start of the crackdown. Thousands have been arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A police statement carried on state media did not refer directly to Saturday's clashes, or say how many had been injured or detained, but said that in light of "what has happened", the authorities had assigned a location for people to surrender voluntarily. A government spokesman said another statement would be issued later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, an Ethiopian was killed in a raid after he tried to grab a policeman's weapon, the Arab News English-language daily reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of those caught in raids on shops, marketplaces, businesses and low-income residential areas are likely to be deported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many expatriate workers say they were unable to take advantage of the amnesty because of bureaucratic difficulties or disputes with their original sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some streets in Manfuhah, men in Saudi dress had also gathered in small groups, some of them carrying knives and iron bars, saying they were protecting their property. Other people watched from rooftops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Angus McDowall; Editing by Kevin Liffey)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security forces in riot gear fired into the air and used truncheons to disperse large crowds as scores of men ran through the streets, some throwing stones and other objects at cars and police, according to Reuters witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people were killed of which one was a Saudi while the other one was unidentified, the Saudi police said in a statement late on Saturday after it detained 561 people involved in the disturbances in the Manfuhah neighborhood of southern Riyadh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police added that 68 people were injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the foreign workers involved in the clashes appeared to be Africans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous statement, the police did not refer directly to Saturday's clashes, or say how many had been injured or detained, but said that in light of "what has happened", the authorities had designated a location for people to surrender voluntarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities this year said they would no longer turn a blind eye to foreign workers breaking visa rules by working for companies that had not sponsored their entry into the world's top oil exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intention is to end a black market for cheap imported workers, cut the foreign labor force, reduce the flow of remittances to other countries and make more private sector jobs available for Saudi citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A seven-month amnesty for foreigners to rectify their visa status without penalty or leave the country - which prompted an exodus of hundreds of thousands of foreigners - expired on Monday, prompting the start of the crackdown. Thousands have been arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, an Ethiopian was killed in a raid after he tried to grab a policeman's weapon, the Arab News English-language daily reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of those caught in raids on shops, marketplaces, businesses and low-income residential areas are likely to be deported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many expatriate workers say they were unable to take advantage of the amnesty because of bureaucratic difficulties or disputes with their original sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some streets in Manfuhah, men in Saudi dress had also gathered in small groups, some of them carrying knives and iron bars, saying they were protecting their property. Other people watched from rooftops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Angus McDowall; Editing by Kevin Liffey)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Lisa Richwine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Nov 11 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said
on Monday it has consolidated the video games and online
businesses in its interactive unit and that co-President John
Pleasants has left his post to become a consultant for the
division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group's other co-president, Jimmy Pitaro, will lead the
merged unit, Disney said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger appointed the two men as
co-presidents in October 2010 to turn around the money-losing
unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The division reported a $16 million profit for the quarter
that ended in September, after losing $76 million a year ago,
partially on sales of its ambitious new Disney Infinity console
game. The company said it has sold more than 1 million Infinity
starter packs worldwide since the game was released in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interactive unit is Disney's smallest, accounting for
less than 4 percent of revenue in the September quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Monday, Iger said the unit had recorded
"three years of consistent operating improvement" and was now
"in a position to fulfill our original objective to consolidate
our Interactive business under one Los Angeles-based leader."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pleasants lives in San Francisco and had been commuting
frequently to Los Angeles. In an interview, Pleasants said he
wanted to stay in San Francisco and felt it was the right time
to leave the division under Pitaro's leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did inherit a business that was losing $300 million a
year," Pleasants said. "We put up two profitable quarters. We
have a lot of momentum going into the holiday. We have very good
plans for the coming fiscal year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pleasants was formerly head of the social games maker
Playdom, which Disney acquired in 2010 for $563 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares slipped 0.3 percent to $68.39 in afternoon
trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Nov 12 (Reuters) - Oriental DreamWorks, a joint
venture between DreamWorks Animation SKG, China Media
Capital, Shanghai Media Group and Shanghai Alliance Investment
Ltd, has appointed former Walt Disney Co executive
Guenther Hake as its chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai-based joint venture said in a statement on

Greater China consumer products division, was appointed based on
his "deep understanding" of Chinese culture and "global brand
experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up in 2012, Oriental DreamWorks appointed Hake to manage
its animated and live action films and TV, licensing, consumer
products and intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai Alliance Investment Ltd, one of Oriental
DreamWorks' backers, is run by Jian Mianheng, the son of former

previous chief executive and current chairman, was president of

			Amedisys Executive Vice President of Operations Patrick Thompson 
      Presented Smarter Care Transitions at the 2013 IBM Information on Demand 
      Conference
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Amedisys, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMED), one of the nation&#8217;s leading health care 
      at home companies, announced today that executive vice president of 
      operations, Patrick Thompson, presented at the 2013 IBM Information on 
      Demand Conference on &#8220;Enabling Smarter Care Transitions for Improved 
      Care and Reduced Costs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which includes a 
      heightened focus on reducing avoidable readmissions, more hospitals, 
      health systems and accountable care organizations are looking for ways 
      to help their patients return safely home and avoid unnecessary and 
      costly trips to the emergency room or get readmitted to the hospital. 
      Many of them understand a safe transition home from the hospital is a 
      key element to achieving their readmissions reduction goal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Amedisys has leveraged its nationwide network of care transitions 
      clinicians to help people safely transition back home after a hospital 
      stay. The network of care transitions coordinators is connected to the 
      Amedisys care team, the hospitals and the patients&#8217; primary care 
      physicians through a proprietary information technology platform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I believe we have the best caregivers at Amedisys,&#8221; stated Patrick 
      Thompson, executive vice president of operations for Amedisys. 
      &#8220;Supported by our collaborative technology platform, our caregiving team 
      becomes the most efficient and effective post-acute care network in the 
      nation. And we are proud to be working with IBM to design and build our 
      next generation of information management capabilities,&#8221; he concluded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Amedisys care teams are supported by Amedisys point-of-care tablets, 
      wireless connectivity and a physician portal. The company is developing 
      a patient and caregiver portal as well to provide patients and their 
      loved ones with access to their plan of care and health records.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Research and Markets: Global Hosted Virtual Desktop Market Report, 2016: 
      Citrix Systems, Microsoft, Oracle  VMware Dominate the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/8xhjjr/global_hosted) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Hosted Virtual Desktop Market Report, 2016" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Hosted Virtual Desktop market to grow at a CAGR of 65.7% over 
      the period 2012-2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the main trends witnessed in the Global Hosted Virtual Desktop 
      market is the evolution of cloud computing and cloud-based services. A 
      positive trend in the Global Hosted Virtual Desktop market is the rapid 
      evolution of the cloud computing and cloud-based services being adopted 
      by enterprises across the globe. Enterprises are looking for solutions 
      which can reduce their capital and operational expenditure and reduce 
      their burden of infrastructure management. Cloud-based service providers 
      are delivering the services over the internet, which is cheaper than 
      internal provisioning of the services. Cloud computing also supports a 
      wider range of applications, which is another factor encouraging 
      enterprises to procure solutions over the cloud infrastructure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the main factors driving the market is the increased need to 
      reduce desktop infrastructure costs. Enterprises across the globe are 
      witnessing increased costs associated with desktop provisioning for 
      their employees. The procurement of operating systems and the supporting 
      software is increasing the capital and operational expenditure 
      associated with the systems. Enterprises are opting for hosting their 
      infrastructure at a centralized location from which access to the 
      systems is provided to end-users.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the main challenges is the need 
      for high initial investment. Enterprises need to procure server 
      infrastructure, a virtualization server, and the required software and 
      high bandwidth support for enabling hosted virtual desktop solutions. 
      Some of the early adopters of hosted virtual desktop solutions on a 
      trial basis are facing certain operational challenges which are 
      preventing them from expanding their adoption.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JP Morgan (JPM.N) and HSBC (HSBA.L) topped the list of the world's top 29 banks that must hold extra capital from 2016 because of their size and reach, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSB is the regulatory taskforce for the 20 biggest economies, whose leaders agreed in 2011 on extra capital requirements to keep top lenders stable in rocky markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim is to shield taxpayers from having to bail out banks as they did in the 2007-2009 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra capital requirements range from 1 to 3.5 percent spread over five "buckets", with full compliance by 2019. They come on top of the 7 percent minimum capital holdings all banks across the world must have by 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FSB was publishing an annual update of its list of globally systemic banks with still no bank occupying the top "bucket" with a 3.5 percent extra capital buffer requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many banks on the list already comply or exceed its total capital requirements due to supervisory and market pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second Chinese bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), has been added to the list, increasing the number of big banks by one to 29 compared with last year's update.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Research and Markets: Global Document Management Systems Market to 2016 
      with EMC, IBM, Microsoft  OpenText Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/pfgn26/global_document) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Document Management Systems Market 2012-2016" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Document Management Systems market to grow at a CAGR of 13.98 
      percent over the period 2012-2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers of the market is the need for effective 
      management of corporate information. DMS enables the storage of business 
      documents and is continually transforming to streamline the business 
      process and to meet the demands of a growing number of enterprises for 
      which the management of documents is becoming a complex and a difficult 
      task.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earlier, SMEs had limited options when adopting a system that would 
      ensure optimal business performance. This was mainly because they did 
      not require, or could not afford, all the features of enterprise-class 
      software systems. Their options were limited to freeware and low-end or 
      open-source solutions that mainly focused on server or network 
      monitoring. In the last few years, SMEs have become increasingly aware 
      of the significance of complete visibility of their operational 
      performance and its impact on their businesses. This trend has created 
      an opportunity for DMS software vendors to develop new versions of their 
      products and attract SMEs, thus improving their presence in this market. 
      Also, with growing operations, SMEs need to find a solution for their 
      document management, storage, and other features. These needs are 
      leading SMEs to shift toward DMS solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that concern about data security is one of 
      the major challenges confronting the market. Enterprises are always 
      concerned about data security and related issues when using DMS 
      solutions. This concern is greater when the tool is installed using 
      SaaS-based solutions. During the deployment of SaaS-based DMS solutions, 
      the data resides in the cloud servers of vendors, increasing security 
      concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 11 (Reuters) - JP Morgan and HSBC
 topped the list of the world's top 29 banks that must
hold extra capital from 2016 because of their size and reach,
the Financial Stability Board said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two banks are in the top "bucket" and will have to hold
an extra 2.5 percent of risk-weighted core capital on top of the
7 percent minimum all banks across the world must hold by 2019

			Sprint Cloud Optimizer Keeps Employees Connected to Microsoft Office 
      365 While Saving on Bandwidth Usage
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			First-in-market offer enables offline use of SharePoint Online and 
      lightens the cloud for small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs), helping 
      them use their network more efficiently and enhance productivity for 
      employees
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Businesses can now optimize their network bandwidth and offer even more 
      productivity and convenience to employees with a new, first-to-market 
      offer, Sprint Cloud Optimizer, now available with Microsoft&#8217;s cloud 
      productivity solution Office 
      365 offered by Sprint (NYSE: S). It features caching technology that 
      lets users enjoy the collaboration functionality of Office 365 and 
      SharePoint Online as well as read access to customer-selected public 
      websites from virtually anywhere, even if they have limited or no 
      Internet access.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sprint Cloud Optimizer is initially available for PCs and laptops and 
      can benefit a wide variety of work scenarios, including keeping 
      employees connected while in transit between meetings, providing an 
      option when employees have only high-cost connectivity available to them 
      while traveling, and supporting remote employees and those working in 
      areas where an optimal connection may not be available. It also frees up 
      bandwidth for other cloud-based and business applications that share the 
      same bandwidth, allowing businesses to better manage network capacity 
      challenges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With Sprint Cloud Optimizer, Office 365 users gain these key benefits:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Continuous and seamless offline access to SharePoint Online sites and 
        documents. As a result, when users are offline or experiencing 
        bandwidth constraints they can still read and edit SharePoint forms 
        and pages, as well as Microsoft Office documents. The feature also 
        allows offline reading of non-password-protected Web pages, so users 
        can take their favorite Web content with them, whether connected or 
        not. Offline optimization offers service interruption protection by 
        ensuring an &#8220;always-on&#8221; experience for all users, allowing them to be 
        productive no matter where they wish to work.
      
			
        Bandwidth optimization reduces network traffic associated with Office 
        365 and other public websites, enabling more efficient use of a WAN.
      
			
        When online, users can enjoy accelerated Web browsing as cache 
        technology reduces the downloaded content. Pages and documents may 
        load faster so users are more productive.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Sprint Cloud Optimizer offers yet another valuable capability that 
      helps companies enjoy even greater productivity, while also reducing the 
      impact of customer network congestion and other remote-working 
      challenges,&#8221; said Wayne Ward, vice president of business and product 
      development, Sprint. &#8220;Employees can work virtually anywhere and have all 
      the benefits of remote cloud-based access to Office 365 plus enjoy Web 
      content when offline, while their company can save from more efficient 
      bandwidth utilization.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SMBs can be more efficient and productive with Office 365 offered by 
      Sprint
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sprint Cloud Optimizer is the latest of several enhancements introduced 
      by Sprint in 2013 for the cloud productivity solution, Office 365. These 
      new plans and services make it easier for SMBs to collaborate and 
      communicate from virtually anywhere they are, whether in the office or 
      on the go.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The 
      variety of plans available from Sprint offers choice and 
      flexibility, and several new a la carte options also are available, all 
      supported by Sprint&#8217;s unique Carefree Cloud migration and onboarding 
      assistance. As with previous plans, businesses enjoy predictable monthly 
      costs with no up-front infrastructure expenses, pay-as-you-go plans and 
      savings by bundling all of the necessary tools, all with a single bill 
      and single point of contact.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Office 365 offered by Sprint includes unique Carefree Cloud &#8220;white 
      glove&#8221; migration and onboarding assistance, 24x7 support, online 
      resources and a user-friendly portal to manage the services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Carefree Cloud is available with all Office 365 plans offered by Sprint 
      at no additional charge (the onboarding and migration services portion 
      of Carefree Cloud is provided at no additional charge when used within 
      the first 90 days of purchase) to all employees within a business so 
      companies have the flexibility to receive the level of migration and 
      ongoing support they need.

			Frost  Sullivan recently recognized strong value of Office 365 
      offered by Sprint
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sprint received the 2012 North American Customer Value Enhancement Award 
      in Mobile Communications and Collaboration from Frost 
      and Sullivan for its Office 365 offer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to an annual survey conducted by Frost  Sullivan of mobile 
      and wireless decision-makers in North America, smaller business 
      respondents cite the cost of doing business, post-sale service and 
      support capability, and professional services capabilities as the top 
      factors they consider when selecting potential mobility partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sprint offers a wide variety of cloud-based solutions in addition to 
      Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with Office 365 including 
      Unified-Communications-as-a-Service (UCaaS) with Sprint 
      Complete Collaboration and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) with Sprint 
      CloudCompute. Sprint also delivers an innovative private-label

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said on Tuesday that he regrets
collateralized debt obligation trades the Wall Street bank made
in the run-up to the financial crisis that later caused a
firestorm of public criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) are pools of bonds
that are bundled, sliced up according to credit risk, and sold
to investors. As the mortgage market heated up leading into
2007, investment banks began selling more exotic varieties
linked to mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrong-way bets on CDOs led to billions of dollars' in losses
for many investors and some investment banks, including Merrill
Lynch. But unlike its Wall Street peers, Goldman Sachs profited
by using CDOs to bet that the mortgage market would collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the trades were profitable at the time - to the tune
of $13 billion, according to a congressional committee - Goldman
suffered tremendous reputational fallout in the years after the
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wish the organization hadn't done complex CDOs circa '06
and '07," Blankfein said at an industry conference in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And, post-crisis, I wish I had gotten off - a little
quicker off the mark in describing who we were and what we did
as a firm and how we looked to the world before everybody
defined us for us," he continued. "We were competing against an
existing narrative - it's very hard to get out of (that)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC brought civil fraud charges against Goldman in 2010
related to a CDO called "Abacus," arguing that the bank
defrauded clients who took long positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman settled for $550 million without admitting to or
denying wrongdoing, but the reputational damage it suffered from
that lawsuit - as well as a damning congressional report - has
taken years to repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On stage at the conference, hosted by the industry trade
group SIFMA, Blankfein said Goldman's work is not yet done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to a question about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's
 recent legal and regulatory challenges, Blankfein said
that although senior Goldman executives are back to spending the
majority of their time dealing with ordinary business issues,
they still have to worry about the consequences of actions the
firm took years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You say the spotlight's off - it's not completely off,"
Blankfein said. "We're still dealing with legacy issues."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is bringing its enormous resources to bear in a court case in New York in which it has accused a U.S. lawyer of using fraud to win a $19 billion environmental judgment against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment was made by an Ecuadorean court to a group of affected villagers in 2011. Chevron has asked the U.S. District Court in Manhattan to prevent the villagers and the U.S. lawyer who helped them, Steven Donziger, from collecting the award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger has denied using fraud to obtain the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, which rested its case on Tuesday, has brought a series of expert witnesses from the fields of linguistics, psychology and computer science to testify in the case over the past four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The star witness was Alberto Guerra, a former Ecuadorean judge who said he was paid by lawyers for the villagers to ghostwrite rulings for the judge in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger was aware of the arrangement, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Donziger thanked me for the work that I was going to do," Guerra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Donziger said Guerra's testimony cannot be credited because Chevron paid to relocate his family and has covered his living and housing expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge who made the award, Nicolas Zambrano, also appeared as a witness for Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zambrano said he authored every word of the 188-page opinion on his own. But Chevron, with a small army of lawyers from top law firm Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher, raised several apparent inconsistencies in his testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how he was able to cite both French and English case law in his 188-page decision, despite speaking neither language, Zambrano said an assistant found the citations online for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other witnesses included experts who said that Zambrano's opinion contained material from Donziger's files and that Zambrano could not possibly have reviewed hundreds of thousands of documents in the case in the time frame he claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a U.S. lawyer who worked on the Ecuador case, Jeffrey Shinder, testified that he pulled out of the case after only a few days when he learned that an expert's report on Chevron's liability was ghostwritten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger's much smaller defense team began putting on his case on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first witness, Donald Moncayo, who worked for the plaintiffs, said on Tuesday morning that he saw Chevron lawyers in Ecuador meet in private with judges, in an apparent effort to show that Chevron did not act properly during the Ecuadorean case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other scheduled defense witnesses include Zambrano's assistant, Evelyn Calva, who has said she took dictation and observed him coming up with the decision entirely on his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger, who was not present in court on Tuesday, is also expected to testify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case stems from pollution between 1964 and 1992 at an oil field operated by Texaco, which was acquired by Chevron in 2001. Zambrano awarded $18 billion to residents of Lago Agrio in 2011, and the amount was later increased to $19 billion to cover fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Chevron no longer has assets in Ecuador, the villagers have tried to seek enforcement of the judgment outside the country, resulting in the action by Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defense lawyers have complained that U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is presiding over the trial without a jury, is biased against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron will call one more witness out of order on Thursday because of scheduling issues. The witness, Joshua Lipton, is the president of Stratus Consulting, which Chevron has accused of ghostwriting the report to which Shinder referred in his testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 12 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp is
bringing its enormous resources to bear in a court case in New
York in which it has accused a U.S. lawyer of using fraud to win
a $19 billion environmental judgment against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment was made by an Ecuadorean court to a group of

series of expert witnesses from the fields of linguistics,
psychology and computer science to testify in the case over the
past four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The star witness was Alberto Guerra, a former Ecuadorean
judge who said he was paid by lawyers for the villagers to
ghostwrite rulings for the judge in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger was aware of the arrangement, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Donziger thanked me for the work that I was going to
do," Guerra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Donziger said Guerra's testimony cannot be
credited because Chevron paid to relocate his family and has
covered his living and housing expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge who made the award, Nicolas Zambrano, also

language, Zambrano said an assistant found the citations online
for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other witnesses included experts who said that Zambrano's
opinion contained material from Donziger's files and that
Zambrano could not possibly have reviewed hundreds of thousands
of documents in the case in the time frame he claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a U.S. lawyer who worked on the Ecuador case, Jeffrey
Shinder, testified that he pulled out of the case after only a
few days when he learned that an expert's report on Chevron's
liability was ghostwritten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger's much smaller defense team began putting on his
case on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first witness, Donald Moncayo, who worked for the
plaintiffs, said on Tuesday morning that he saw Chevron lawyers
in Ecuador meet in private with judges, in an apparent effort to
show that Chevron did not act properly during the Ecuadorean
case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other scheduled defense witnesses include Zambrano's
assistant, Evelyn Calva, who has said she took dictation and
observed him coming up with the decision entirely on his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger, who was not present in court on Tuesday, is also 
expected to testify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case stems from pollution between 1964 and 1992 at an

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO, Calif., Nov. 12, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - Visage Imaging Inc. ("Visage"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Pro Medicus Ltd. (ASX: PME), announced today an exciting set of new features for the Visage&#174; 7 Enterprise Imaging Platform to be demonstrated at the upcoming 2013 Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) conference, Booth #4765, December 1-5 in Chicago, Illinois. Visage 7 enables enterprise imaging with amazingly fast, thin-client, server-side processing technology, as well as simple mobile access to imaging results via Visage Ease*.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Visage 7 is resetting expectations moving beyond the stagnancy of legacy PACS limitations, enabling even the most expansive imaging organizations and delivery networks to dramatically advance enterprise imaging. The breakthrough platform is the essence of sophistication and simplicity, harnessing a myriad of capabilities and delivered as an ultrafast, multi-dimensional, single enterprise viewer. Visage 7 is the server-side platform that streamlines complexity, enabling leading organizations to stay ahead of the curve delivering unparalleled value and differentiation in a highly competitive market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	At RSNA 2013, Visage 7.1.4 will be demonstrated, as well as a number of new, work-in-progress capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
			
		Showcased at a dual-5 MP breast imaging workstation, as well as throughout the booth, Visage will feature innovative enhancements to existing multi-modality breast imaging workflows, including: multiple concurrent magnifiers, quadrant navigation, optimized mammography text overlays, and additional useful navigation and tools for digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) interpretation. DBT layouts now include display of the 3D MIP, side-by-side with CC and MLO views.
			
		A natively multi-dimensional imaging platform, Visage 7 allows users to automatically hang and manipulate multi-dimensional volumes of current and prior imaging data. Improved, sophisticated linking of multi-dimensional volumes will be demonstrated with a streamlined, single intuitive linking tool. Once the linking tool has been activated, users select the 2D and 3D data volumes they would like to link, and then they can easily scroll all of the selected volumes simultaneously.
			
		In addition to simplified linking, Visage will be demonstrating new refinements for split-screen, current/prior hanging protocols and study layouts. These new capabilities allow the user to define a hanging protocol per display, which is particularly useful for multi-modality current/prior presentations (e.g., CT current, with MR prior).
			
		Adding to their impressive cardiology capabilities, Visage will be demonstrating new hanging protocols and layouts supporting Multi-Cine Cardiac MR.
			
		For Visage Ease, a mobility component of the Visage 7 platform that does not require separate servers, the latest version will be demonstrated with an optimized user interface for iOS 7, multi-planar reconstruction, as well as new usability features.
		&lt;p&gt;
	"While competing vendors scramble to re-message their tired stacks of legacy technologies, Visage has focused, strengthening our foothold across the emerging frontier of enterprise imaging," said Dr. Sam Hupert, Chief Executive Officer, Visage Imaging and Pro Medicus. "At RSNA, we look forward to not only sharing our latest innovations, but more importantly, we are excited to demonstrate how Visage can deliver immediate value today, powering the next generation of leading imaging organizations that are rapidly taking shape in today's challenging healthcare environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Dish Network Corp is closer to reaching a large-scale programming deal with Disney that would help the satellite TV provider avoid a possible blackout of popular networks such as ABC and ESPN, Chairman Charlie Ergen said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that he is keeping the company's options open with regards to possible alliances for use of billions of dollars worth of wireless spectrum the company has amassed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares rose more than 5 percent after the No. 2 U.S. satellite TV company reported better-than-expected subscriber numbers and revenue in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney and Dish's programming agreement expired at the end of September, but they have been in discussions and have so far averted a blackout of Disney's top networks such as ABC and ESPN for the satellite provider's 14 million customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ergen said that Disney is seeking a long-term contract lasting several years and "both sides are trying to look at where the technology is going...and what the world might look like in several years," echoing comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dish may be trying to get more flexibility out of Disney in a new contract that would include better digital rights and the ability to put channels on different tiers, said ISI analyst Vijay Jayant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WIRELESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ergen also said it was too soon to finalize Dish's strategy regarding the wireless spectrum the company has spent billions amassing. He analysts he would likely know more early next year after upcoming auctions of spectrum controlled by the government and bankrupt communications firm LightSquared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ergen noted that anti-collusion rules will force a pause in any negotiations between applicants in the government auction starting from November 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executive, who founded Dish 33 years ago, said he would look for ways to use wireless spectrum to enhance its video offerings rather than on areas such as voice, data and texting services which traditional wireless operators already "do pretty well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to make our video ubiquitous so that's our focus," he said. "It doesn't mean that we would do other things but ideally it would be video-centric."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise Ergen said that he is keeping all options open, from the possibility for a purchase of No. 4 U.S. mobile operator T-Mobile US, to forging a partnership, building a wireless network or even selling Dish's spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ergen also said that the news today that US Airways and AMR had reached a government antitrust settlement on their merger could bode well for a deal one day with DirecTV because it means the government is willing to "negotiate things." The two satellite companies attempted a merger that was blocked by regulators in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's obviously a business case that makes a lot of sense for consolidation in the satellite industry," Ergen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dish added a surprise 35,000 video customers in the quarter. Wall Street analysts, on average, had looked for Dish to lose 39,000 subscribers, according to market research firm StreetAccount. Revenue also topped analysts' estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gains underlined how satellite services are gaining customers by undercutting cable rivals on price. DirecTV also added more customers than expected in the quarter, while cable providers Time Warner Cable Inc, Comcast Corp and Charter Communications Inc all lost video subscribers. Dish also got a bit of a boost from Time Warner Cable's protracted fight with CBS Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dish's Q3 operating results were surprisingly good, as were DirecTV's, boosted perhaps by the travails at Time Warner Cable, which got smoked in its programming dispute with CBS," said Craig Moffett, a research analyst at MoffettNathanson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue generated per subscriber rose to $81.05 from $76.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dish reported net income of $315 million, or 68 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a net loss of $158 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2 percent to $3.60 billion, compared with expectations of $3.58 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jennifer Saba in New York and Chandni Doulatramani in Bangalore; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Jeffrey Benkoe and David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds comments from conference call, new analyst comments)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Liana B. Baker and Sinead Carew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nov 12 (Reuters) - Dish Network Corp is closer to

averted a blackout of Disney's top networks such as ABC and ESPN
for the satellite provider's 14 million customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ergen said that Disney is seeking a long-term contract
lasting several years and "both sides are trying to look at
where the technology is going...and what the world might look
like in several years," echoing comments from Disney CEO Bob
Iger last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dish may be trying to get more flexibility out of Disney in
a new contract that would include better digital rights and the
ability to put channels on different tiers, said ISI analyst

39,000 subscribers, according to market research firm
StreetAccount. Revenue also topped analysts' estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gains underlined how satellite services are gaining
customers by undercutting cable rivals on price. DirecTV 
also added more customers than expected in the quarter, while
cable providers Time Warner Cable Inc, Comcast Corp
 and Charter Communications Inc all lost video
subscribers. Dish also got a bit of a boost from Time Warner
Cable's protracted fight with CBS Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dish's Q3 operating results were surprisingly good, as were
DirecTV's, boosted perhaps by the travails at Time Warner Cable,
which got smoked in its programming dispute with CBS," said
Craig Moffett, a research analyst at MoffettNathanson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue generated per subscriber rose to $81.05 from $76.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dish reported net income of $315 million, or 68 cents per
share, in the quarter, compared with a net loss of $158 million,
or 35 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2 percent to
$3.60 billion, compared with expectations of $3.58 billion,
according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 12 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil has been
granted a 90-day extension to submit a plan to repair its
70-year-old Pegasus oil pipeline that ruptured in Arkansas in
March this year, guaranteeing the line will be closed until at
least January, according to a filing from the Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 90,000 barrel-per-day Pegasus pipeline, which runs from
Illinois to Texas, spilled 5,000 barrels of Canadian crude into
the town of Mayflower, a few miles north of Little Rock, causing
the evacuation of dozens of homes in the community. The line has
since been shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the extension, granted by PHMSA in October, Exxon now
has until January 6 to conduct tests on the pipeline and submit
its plan for needed repairs on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, PHMSA said it has found nine probable violations
of safety rules in the rupture of the Pegasus line, which sent
crude spilling into a local creek that fed into Lake Conway, a
popular fishing area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHMSA said Exxon failed to recognize the risks associated
with the old piping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has 30 days to contest the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Exxon completed a three-year project to reverse the
Pegasus line to run north to south and increase its capacity by
50,000 bpd. The company did not increase the diameter of the
line, but raised the pressure of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
can cut pay dramatically and maintain staff when times are tough
because it pays so well in good times, Chief Executive Lloyd
Blankfein said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our people know the contract goes both ways," Blankfein
said at a Bank of America-Merrill Lynch financial services
conference in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has moved more of its staff to low-cost locations
like Bangalore, India; Salt Lake City and Dallas, where 25
percent of its staffers are now located, compared with 10
percent in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein also said that Wall Street's relationship with
regulators and lawmakers has improved dramatically over the past
five years. Rulemakers have been "quite receptive" to the
industry's comments about upcoming laws such as the Volcker
rule, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Deepwater startup adds new production from Chevron&#8217;s growth queue
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) confirmed today that its Brazilian 
      subsidiary and Petrobras have started crude oil production from 
      Papa-Terra&#8217;s floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) 
      offshore Brazil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The startup of Papa-Terra is another important step toward meeting the 
      growth target we&#8217;ve set for 2017,&#8221; said George Kirkland, Chevron&#8217;s vice 
      chairman and executive vice president, Upstream.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The successful development of Papa-Terra is the result of a robust 
      partnership between Chevron and Petrobras that integrates the unique 
      skills and expertise of both companies to deliver challenging projects 
      and new energy production,&#8221; said Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron 
      Africa and Latin America Exploration and Production Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron holds a 37.5 percent interest in the Papa-Terra field, while 
      Petrobras, the project operator, has the remaining 62.5 percent. Located 
      approximately 70 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Rio de Janeiro at a 
      water depth of approximately 3,900 feet (1,190 meters), Papa-Terra is a 
      heavy oil development within Block BC-20 of the southern Campos basin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Discovered in 2003, the Papa-Terra field development features the FPSO 
      and the first tension leg wellhead platform in Brazil, which is expected 
      to start production in 2014. Papa-Terra has installed capacity to 
      produce 140,000 barrels of crude per day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      through November 7th, where sessions centered around Big 
      Data, business intelligence, analytics, information management, and 
      mobile computing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dusty Rivers, principal technical architect at GT Software and IBM 
      Information Champion, reported: &#8220;Many of the sessions validated the 
      critical importance that legacy data and system integration contributed 
      to bringing together disparate systems and business-essential 
      information needed to create truly valuable analytics and business

      frequent presenter at SHARE and other technology conferences around the 
      world.

      Mr. Rivers adds: &#8220;As we spoke with mainframe users across a wide range 
      of industry sectors, including banking, insurance, consumer goods, 
      government and the military, many cited that the products that provide 
      capabilities to achieve modernization goals relatively quickly and 
      easily are in demand.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As testament to the various technologies feeding corporate big data 
      system, he noted a strong increase in interest for GT Software&#8217;s display 
      of both proven and patented technologies that enable mainframe users to

&lt;p&gt;Nov 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission has asked Goldman Sachs Group Inc to disclose
the salary and bonus of a former bank vice president who was
found liable of securities fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury found Fabrice Tourre guilty in August of six of the
seven civil charges he faced over transactions the SEC said
caused $1 billion of investor losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre has asked a federal judge to dismiss the case against
him or set a new trial. The request for salary information,
which could reveal the scope of the penalties the SEC will seek
from Tourre, was disclosed in a Wednesday night filing in the
U.S. District Court in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have become aware that the SEC recently submitted a
request to Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. for certain information regarding
Mr. Tourre," Pamela Rogers Chepiga, Tourre's lawyer, wrote in
the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC is expected to make its request for monetary relief
from Tourre by mid December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chepiga told the court she learned of the request for
Tourre's base salary and bonus broken out by year from 2005 to
the present, along with all documents related to the bonus he
received in 2007, from Goldman's attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre told jurors during the July trial that he earned $1.7
million in salary and bonus in 2007. That year he worked on the
synthetic collateralized debt obligation Abacus 2007-AC1. He was
found to have misled investors by concealing how hedge fund
billionaire John Paulson helped construct the transaction and
bet it would fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre is now pursuing a doctorate in economics at the
University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 13 (Reuters) - Sean Coffey, a New York
attorney who represented investors in litigation over WorldCom
Inc's collapse and defended former Goldman Sachs trader Fabrice
Tourre at trial, is joining the law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis &amp;
Frankel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffey, who was also a one-time candidate for New York
attorney general, said Wednesday that he will be joining as a
partner and chairman of its complex litigation group effective
Dec. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffey is a rarity in the legal sector, where lawyers are
often entrenched at big law firms representing either plaintiffs
or defendants and rarely move between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't consider myself a plaintiffs' lawyer or defense
lawyer, I consider myself an advocate who likes to try cases,"
Coffey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffey, 57, was co-lead counsel at trial for Tourre, a
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc vice president who the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused of misleading
investors in a mortgage investment called Abacus 2007-AC1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal jury in New York found Tourre liable on six of the
seven charges against him in August. His lawyers have asked for
a new trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffey, a former federal prosecutor, joined the Tourre case
shortly after the closure of a company he had co-founded in 2011
called BlackRobe Capital Partners that had aimed to provide
financing for complex litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to setting up BlackRobe, Coffey had run unsuccessfully
as a candidate in the 2010 Democratic primary race to succeed
then-New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He joined the race after leaving the New York plaintiffs law
firm Bernstein Litowitz Berger &amp; Grossmann in 2009. He made his
mark at the firm obtaining $6.1 billion in settlements for
investors in WorldCom Inc, which filed for bankruptcy in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Fabrice Tourre trial this summer reminded people I like
to try complicated cases, and a bunch of firms reached out,"
Coffey said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barry Berke, co-chairman of Kramer Levin's litigation group,
said Coffey's arrival will expand the firm's ability to file
lawsuits for institutional clients, who he said are increasingly
interested in bringing cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berke added, though, that the 375-lawyer firm is not going

&lt;p&gt;Nov 13 (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Riverbed
Technology Inc is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 to consider options including a sale of the company,
Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riverbed - under pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott
Management Corp - has attracted informal interest from
private-equity firms for a leveraged buyout, the report said. ()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliott Management, known for publicly agitating for a sale
or a board shakeup in the companies in which it invests, had
said Riverbed should conduct a strategic review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund had also said it had economic exposure and
voting power of about 10.4 percent in Riverbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riverbed had said it was focused on creating value for its
shareholders and would continue to maintain an open dialogue
with shareholders, including Elliott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company and Goldman Sachs were not immediately available
for comments on Wednesday's report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had managed Riverbed's initial public offering
in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riverbed, whose products boost data speeds on wide-area
networks by up to 100 times, has been viewed by analysts as an
underperformer after it bought Opnet Technologies in a $1
billion deal last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares closed up 8 percent at $19.04 on the
Nasdaq on Wednesday. They had jumped 15 percent on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador's highest court upheld a verdict that U.S. oil company Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is responsible for pollution in an Amazon rainforest, but halved the fine imposed in a previous trial to $9.5 billion, a decision the company dismissed as illegitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron took the case to the National Court of Justice after a lower court deemed in 2011 that Chevron was responsible for pollution caused by U.S. oil company Texaco, which operated there between 1964 and 1992, and whose assets Chevron bought in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge in the 2011 ruling ordered the company to pay $9.5 billion plus an additional $9.5 billion for refusing to publicly apologize for the pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Court of Justice on Tuesday determined there had been no legal basis to sanction Chevron for not apologizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Villagers in the Lago Agrio region say the pollution has harmed their health.

		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades are a result of Fitch's downgrade of class A-3 in JPMCC 
      2006-LDP9. The downgrade of class A-3 to 'A' from 'AA' reflects an 
      increase in Fitch modeled losses primarily due to the lower valuations 
      on the specially serviced assets. Fitch modeled losses of 21.1% of the 
      remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool balance total 
      20.1%, including losses already incurred to date. Fitch has identified 
      69 loans (52.6%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 23 specially 
      serviced assets (25.4%). See Fitch's release, 'Fitch Downgrades 6 
      Classes of JP Morgan 2006-LDP9', dated Nov. 8, 2013 for more information.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are the result of affirmations to the remaining ratings 
      or shadow ratings of the underlying collateral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirmed the underlying A-4 bond in Cobalt Commercial Mortgage 
      Trust 2006-C1 on Sept. 13, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Re-REMIC transaction's two other underlying bonds, Wachovia Bank 
      Commercial Mortgage Trust, series 2007-C33 class A-4 and Bear Stearns 
      Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2007-PWR15 class A-4, are not rated 
      by Fitch. Fitch reviewed the underlying collateral and performed loan 
      level stressed analysis, reflecting cash flow and value declines under 
      the criteria described in 'U.S. Fixed-Rate Multiborrower CMBS 
      Surveillance and Re-REMIC Criteria' dated Dec. 18, 2012. Due to concerns 
      with deteriorating performance and increasing interest shortfalls, Fitch 
      revised the Outlooks on the shadow ratings to Negative from Stable in 
      April 2013.

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Stable Outlooks reflect that no rating changes are anticipated as 
      each of the underlying bonds has a Stable Outlook or implied credit 
      enhancement of approximately 50%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Negative Outlooks on classes WBCMT-C33 B, B-1, and B-2, and BSCMS B, 
      B-1 and B-2, each of which is a direct pass-through to the underlying 
      bonds, reflect concerns with continued deterioration of the performance 
      of the pools, including lower values on specially serviced loans, as 
      well as underperformance of many loans in the transactions' top 15. The 
      BSCMS 2007-PWR15 contains many larger assets in secondary and tertiary 
      markets. In addition, both transactions have increasing interest 
      shortfalls, mostly due to appraisal reductions, which many impact the 
      underlying bonds in the future. Downgrades to these Re-REMIC classes are 
      possible if Fitch expected losses on the underlying transactions 
      continue to increase, or interest shortfalls impact the underlying bonds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RBSCF 2009-RR2 Re-REMIC Trust is a resecuritization of the ownership 
      interest in four commercial mortgage-backed certificates which total 
      $368.6 million. The transaction consists of four re-REMIC bond groups 
      backed by four underlying bonds. Principal and interest from the 
      underlying commercial mortgage-backed certificates pass through to the 
      respective senior and junior re-REMIC bonds in sequential order. Losses 
      will be applied in reverse sequential order.

			Procter  Gamble Announces Organizational 
      Changes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Procter  Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) today announced that Dimitri 
      Panayotopoulos, Vice Chairman and Advisor to the Chairman and Chief 
      Executive Officer, will retire from the Company, effective January 2, 
      2014, after 37 years of service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Panayotopoulos joined PG in 1977. He served in sales and general 
      management roles spanning Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, 
      eventually overseeing all PG brands as Vice Chair &#8211; Global Business 
      Units. As previously announced, he was elected to his current role as 
      advisor to the CEO effective July 1, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We appreciate Dimitri&#8217;s considerable contributions over his long and 
      successful career, building leading positions for the Company in Egypt 
      and then the Middle East, China, Central and Eastern Europe, and 
      Africa,&#8221; said A.G. Lafley, PG Chairman of the Board, President and 
      Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;He concluded his distinguished career by 
      leading our global business units through challenging times.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG also announced that Bruce Brown, Chief Technology Officer, 
      will retire on August 31, 2014, after more than 34 years of service. 
      Until that time, effective February 1, 2014, Mr. Brown has been named 
      Officer on Special Assignment. Kathleen B. Fish, currently Vice 
      President&#8211;Research  Development, Global Fabric Care, has been elected 
      Chief Technology Officer, succeeding Mr. Brown, effective February 1, 
      2014. Ms. Fish will report to A.G. Lafley.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Robert L. Fregolle, Jr., Global Customer Business Development Officer, 
      will retire on June 30, 2014, after more than 36 years of service. Until 
      that time, effective February 1, 2014, Mr. Fregolle has been named 
      Officer on Special Assignment. Carolyn M. Tastad, currently Vice 
      President&#8211;Global Market Strategy  Planning and One Go-to-Market 
      Optimization, has been elected Global Customer Business Development 
      Officer, succeeding Mr. Fregolle, effective February 1, 2014. Ms. Tastad 
      will report to Werner Geissler, Vice Chairman&#8211;Global Operations, and Mr. 
      Lafley.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These changes demonstrate the depth and strength of PG&#8217;s leadership 
      bench,&#8221; said Mr. Lafley. &#8220;Dimitri, Bruce and Bob have each served PG 
      for more than 34 years and have made a lasting, positive impact on the 
      Company. Kathy and Carolyn are experienced PG leaders who will continue 
      to strengthen our innovation and go-to-market capabilities going 
      forward.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Brown began his PG career in 1980, and served in Research  
      Development roles his entire career, culminating in his election to the 
      position of Chief Technology Officer in 2008. At PG, the Chief 
      Technology Officer is responsible for the Company&#8217;s innovation 
      capabilities and global RD organization. During his nearly six years in 
      this role, Mr. Brown has launched several important innovations and 
      established the key technology platforms that will drive PG&#8217;s 
      innovation programs in the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ms. Fish joined PG in 1979 and has led RD teams in most of PG&#8217;s 
      leading core categories over her 34-year career, including Baby Care, 
      Hair Care and Fabric Care. Most recently, she led the RD team behind 
      the launch of Tide Pods and Downy Unstopables.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Fregolle joined PG in 1979. He spent the majority of his PG sales 
      career outside of the U.S., in leadership roles across Central and 
      Eastern Europe and Asia, before returning to the U.S. to lead PG&#8217;s 
      Global Customer Business Development organization in 2009. During his 
      36-year career, he strengthened customer relationships across developed 
      and developing markets and significantly increased the reach of PG&#8217;s 
      distribution around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ms. Tastad began her PG career in 1983. She has deep experience leading 
      sales and market development organizations for PG businesses in the 
      U.S., Canada, Europe and globally, and has worked in a range of 
      businesses including deep experience in Health and Beauty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, PG announced that Kirk Perry, currently President&#8211;Global 
      Family Care, will leave PG effective December 2, 2013, to pursue other 
      interests. Steven D. Bishop, currently Group President&#8211;Global Feminine 
      Care, will be named Group President&#8211;Global Feminine and Family Care. Mr. 
      Bishop will continue to report to Martin Riant, Group President&#8211;Global

      Research and Markets: Global Retail Banking IT Market to 2016: Dell, HP, 
      IBM  Microsoft Dominate this Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/7qph99/global_retail) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Retail Banking IT Market to 2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Retail Banking IT market to grow at a 
      CAGR of 4.1 percent over the period 2012-2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the main growth drivers of the Global Retail Banking IT Spending 
      market is the growing need for customer satisfaction. Therefore, newly 
      developed channels such as mobile and internet are becoming an important 
      component of retail banking. The number of customers that are using the 
      internet and mobile devices for banking is also increasing at a 
      tremendous rate. Thus, banks are always on the lookout for innovative 
      technologies that would help them serve their customers to manage their 
      financial affairs regardless of time and location.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The use of mobiles for banking services has now become extremely common. 
      Customers are readily shifting from PCs and laptops to mobiles to manage 
      their finances and bank accounts. The availability of affordable mobile 
      devices has made this possible. Moreover, these devices are quite 
      powerful and are efficient enough to perform the work of PCs and 
      laptops. The technology makes it convenient for customers to get in 
      touch with the bank avoiding visits to the branch. In 2012, several 
      banks globally invested in IT initiatives to develop the online 
      experience of their customers. Banks are also able to better manage 
      customers at a lower cost through mobile banking. More spending 
      initiatives are expected to follow in the next couple of years till 
      2016. Banks will need to figure out the mix of digital channels that 
      will help them gain maximum returns in the years to come.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in the 
      market is meeting the diverse needs of customers. Advancements in the 
      technology and the adoption of these updated technologies by customers 
      are forcing banks to quickly adopt best fit technology to remain in the 
      competition.

&lt;p&gt;QUITO Nov 13 (Reuters) - Ecuador's highest court upheld a
verdict condemning U.S. oil company Chevron of pollution
in an Amazon rainforest region, but halved the fine imposed in a
previous judgment to $9.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron took the case to the National Court of Justice after
a lower provincial court in the Amazon region, where Texaco
operated between 1964 and 1992, deemed Chevron was responsible
for the pollution that plaintiffs say has harmed the health of
communities living in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge in that ruling imposed a $19 billion fine on the
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron bought Texaco's operations in the region in 2001,
inheriting legal responsibility for the pollution, Ecuador says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron spokesman James Craig said the decision against the
company, ratified by the National Court of Justice late on
Tuesday, was "illegitimate and inapplicable".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only decision that the Court of Justice could have
taken .. was to declare the trial null and void and leave this
illegitimate sentence without effect," he said in a statement on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is fighting across various international tribunals
to nullify the multi-billion decision. It is pursuing a case
against the U.S. lawyer representing Ecuador who it says
resorted to fraud to obtain a judgment against
it.

      Presented by Guernsey's Auctioneers  Brokers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Finest (www.thefinest.com), 
      a sophisticated online Marketplace for fine art and rare memorabilia, 
      will provide live online bidding for an exquisite collection of posters 
      from the collection of Dr. Hans Sachs. The live auction, presented by 
      Guernsey&#8217;s Auctioneers  Brokers, will take place November 22-24 at the 
      Bohemian National Hall in New York, NY, daily at 1:00 pm and 6:00 pm 
      Eastern with a live auction webcast via The Finest taking place 
      at those times. Online bidding in all sessions is already available by 
      visiting www.thefinest.com/guernseys.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is the most important poster collection of our time,&#8221; said Arlan 
      Ettinger President of Guernsey&#8217;s Auctioneers  Brokers. &#8220;Through our 
      partnership with The Finest, we&#8217;re able to share this once-in-a-lifetime 
      opportunity with buyers from across the globe. These posters are 
      extremely rare, and the provenance makes them all the more valuable. 
      This collection is not to be missed.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Dr. Hans Sachs Poster Collection is known as one of the most 
      significant of its type in existence. Dr. Sachs began his collection as 
      a young student, growing the collection to more than 5,000 pieces that 
      covered the worlds of art, propaganda and politics, entertainment, 
      travel, film, sports, consumer products and scenes of war. In 1938, the 
      Gestapo seized the collection and sent Dr. Sachs to a concentration 
      camp. Dr. Sachs was released and fled to the United States, and believed 
      the Nazis had destroyed his collection.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Several years ago, Dr. Sachs&#8217; son began researching the collection and 
      found it still existed in the vaults of a German National Museum located 
      in what was once East Berlin. After a long court battle, the Sachs 
      Family was able to recover the collection, which is said to be the very 
      finest collection of its type. Now, the beautiful pieces from this 
      collection will be available to buyers form across the globe, including 
      the following featured items:

      They have performed across the country and have also served the United 
      States in military action. They are the 82nd Airborne 
      Division &#8220;All-American&#8221; Chorus and they will be at Coca-Cola 
      Headquarters this week to honor service members for Veterans Day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Every year Coca-Cola associates pause to honor the veterans and members 
      of the U.S. military who sacrifice to serve their country and protect 
      our freedoms. This year the Company will host a ceremony to pay tribute 
      to these men and women, including more than 3,000 veterans employed by 
      Coca-Cola. On Thursday, November 14, Retired First Class Sergeant 
      Michael Schlitz will provide a keynote address. Sergeant Schlitz will 
      share his inspiring story of survival and courage following a terrible 
      accident during a military campaign in Iraq.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This event provides the opportunity to recognize co-workers who have 
      served or are serving in the military,&#8221; said Steve Cahillane, President, 
      Coca-Cola Americas. &#8220;On this special day, we also remember the families 
      of those serving, for their sacrifices are often deep and long as they 
      wait patiently for the safe return of their loved ones.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the week-long Veterans Day observance, the Company will also 
      host its annual USO Care package stuffing party on November 13. Hundreds 
      of Coca-Cola associates will &#8220;stuff&#8221; more than 10,000 care packages for 
      the USO. The packages include items such as batteries, Odwalla bars, 
      phone cards and personal letters of thanks from Coca-Cola associates. 
      These packages will be distributed to boost the morale of troops 
      worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Coca-Cola Company has a proud history of standing behind America&#8217;s 
      men and women in uniform, which dates back more than 70 years,&#8221; 
      continued Cahillane. &#8220;We continue that tradition today by partnering 
      with organizations like the USO, bringing veterans into the Coca-Cola 
      workforce and refreshing the members of the extended U.S. military 
      family millions of times around the world each day.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola began its support of U.S. military troops in 1941 during World 
      War II when former Company President Robert Woodruff committed &#8220;to see 
      that every man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for five cents, 
      wherever he is and whatever it costs the Company.&#8221; That same decade, the 
      Company began a more than 70-year partnership with the USO. Today, the 
      Coca-Cola system provides more than 2.5 million beverage servings per 
      day to active-duty members of the armed forces, reservists, retirees and 
      their families. In addition, throughout the year, many marketing 
      programs pay tribute to and reward veterans for their service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Finally, The World of Coca-Cola is making a special offer to members of 
      the Armed Forces (Active duty, Reserves and Retired) and their families 
      starting Saturday, November 9
			through Sunday, November 17, 
      2013, in recognition of Veteran&#8217;s Day. The museum offers complimentary 
      admission to members of the Armed Forces on an ongoing basis. During 
      this special promotional period, members may purchase up to four 
      half-price general admission tickets for their friends and family.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To take advantage of this special promotion, military members and 
      retirees should simply present their valid Armed Forces ID cards at the 
      World of Coca-Cola ticket windows.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - A Chevron Corp. pipeline exploded near a tiny Texas town south of Dallas on Thursday, shooting flames high in the air and prompting evacuations from nearby homes and a school district, but no injuries were reported, the company and emergency officials said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosion south of Milford, Texas, was caused by a construction crew that accidentally drilled into a 10-inch liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) line, Tom Hemrick, director of Hill County Emergency Management, told KTVT-TV in Dallas.

The 700 residents of Milford have been asked to evacuate their homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it had stopped the flow on a 14-inch LPG line that runs a few feet from the one that blew up and was preparing to empty the product from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The flow of product in the pipeline has been shut off and residual burn continues," the company said of the burning pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A state regulator said the line was part of the West Texas LPG Pipeline Limited Partnership, a 2,295-mile common-carrier pipeline system that transports natural gas liquids from New Mexico and Texas to Mont Belvieu, Texas, for processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron owns 80 percent of the pipeline system and Atlas Pipeline Partners has a 20-percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milford's volunteer fire chief, Mark Jackson, told Dallas' WFAA-TV that about 200 students in the town's school district were evacuated, and officials closed off numerous roads around the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A local CBS-TV affiliate broadcast footage of big flames rising from a field and engulfing what appeared to be a drilling rig or other large piece of equipment.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds history of Moody's action, details on ratings, background
on financial crisis)
    By David Henry
    NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service cut
the debt ratings for four big bank holding companies, including
Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, citing
its increasing confidence that the U.S. government will not bail
out the companies if they fail.   
    The cuts may increase banks' borrowing costs and force them
to post more collateral in derivatives trades, weighing on their
profits. The downgrades also underscore how regulators are
successfully convincing at least some parts of the bond markets
that in a crisis, investors in the bank holding companies will
likely have to take losses. 
    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp has hosted dozens of
meetings with bond investors, analysts, and other stakeholders
since last year to explain how this scenario would play out.
 In a statement on Thursday, Moody's Managing
Director Robert Young said that the U.S. government's bank
regulators have created a credible plan. 
    With the banks expected to receive less government support,
Moody's said it was cutting its ratings for holding companies
for Bank of New York Mellon Corp, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc,, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley by one notch. 
    Moody's confirmed senior holding company ratings for Bank of
America Corp, Citigroup Inc, State Street Corp
 and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. Representatives of Bank of
New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment.
A Morgan Stanley spokesman had no immediate comment.
    Under the plan created by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC,
the FDIC would take over a failing bank holding company, wiping
out the bank's shareholders and hitting some bondholders with
losses. The steps would keep the operating subsidiaries, such as
the deposit-taking banks, alive.
    Bond investors and bank executives are watching to see how
the liquidation plans might change how banks fund themselves -in
particular, how much debt banks might issue from their holding
companies, and how much their operating subsidiaries might
issue. David Fanger, a Moody's senior vice president, said in an
interview that debt from the subsidiaries has become more
creditworthy as the government has developed liquidation plans
to focus on the holding companies.
    The Fed plans to issue a proposal to require the largest
banks to issue minimum amounts of long-term, unsecured debt from
their holding companies to absorb losses in a liquidation.
    The federal government was forced to bail out a number of
major banking and insurance companies starting in 2008, as the
world's financial system stood at the brink of disaster. That
prompted demands for rules that would prevent a repetition of
any situation in which a company would be deemed "too big to
fail." 
    Downgrades often increase a company's borrowing costs over
time, but given that banks have so many subsidiaries that can
issue debt, the impact of a holding company downgrade may not
always be dramatic. 
    Banks also often have to post more collateral to support
derivatives trades when they are downgraded. But because many
banks trade the instruments in operating subsidiaries instead of
their holding companies, these downgrades may not force big
collateral postings.     

    'AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT GOALS'
    At a Senate confirmation hearing today, Federal Reserve
chairman nominee Janet Yellen said that "addressing too-big-to-
fail has to be among the most important goals of the post-crisis
period." 
    Regulators have acknowledged that one issue with the
liquidation plans replacing too-big-to-fail bailouts is how to
coordinate actions with authorities abroad when troubled banks
have operations in multiple countries. Another issue is, how to
liquidate banks if they all fail at the same time and there are
few buyers for assets, which can happen during a crisis. 
    Bank of America and Citigroup holding company ratings were
not changed because their underlying strength improved enough to
offset Moody's lower expectation of government support.  Bank of
America's capital strength is better, its risk of major losses
is down and its expenses are declining, Moody's said.
    Citigroup's balance sheet is stronger and it is more
reliably profitable, the ratings agency said.
    But Moody's lifted the long-term deposit ratings for both
Bank of America and Citigroup's bank subsidiary units. 
    Moody's telegraphed the likelihood of its cutting bank
holding company ratings in August. 
    With the cut, the holding company for Morgan Stanley is now
rated the same as Bank of America's and Citigroup's holding
companies: Baa2, or two steps above junk status. Goldman was cut
to a level three steps above junk, while Wells Fargo remains
five steps above. BNY Mellon is six steps above.
     
   Below are the ratings for long-term senior unsecured debt for
the bank holding companies.  
 Bank Holding Company          New Rating  Old Rating
 Bank of America Corp          Baa2        Baa2
 Bank of New York Mellon Corp  A1          Aa3

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Thursday disclosed a new $3.45 billion stake in Exxon Mobil Corp, after buying 40.1 million shares in the world's largest publicly traded oil company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the investment represents just 0.9 percent of Houston-based Exxon's shares, analysts said it reflects strong support by the second-richest American of one of the world's largest and most profitable companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When Warren Buffett gives his seal of approval to any company, that is never a bad thing," said Pavel Molchanov, energy analyst at Raymond James &amp; Associates, who rates Exxon shares a "strong buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon shares rose 84 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $94.06 in after-hours trading following Berkshire's disclosure of its stake in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that listed most of its equity investments as of September 30. The shares had risen 63 cents during regular trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He likes buying big, established global brand names, and Exxon is a good flight-to-quality stock," said Fadel Gheit, senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co, referring to Buffett. "The stock has also lagged the market in the last three and five years. That makes it a typical Warren Buffett holding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gheit has a "perform" rating on Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire already has energy and utilities businesses, including MidAmerican Energy, which is spending $5.6 billion to buy Nevada utility NV Energy Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window into their strategies for buying and selling stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett sometimes gets SEC permission to delay disclosures so that he can buy stocks without having investors copy him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did this for the second quarter of 2013, and revealed on Thursday that Exxon purchases took place during that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We appreciate the confidence investors have in ExxonMobil when they decide to invest in the company," Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire last reported owning Exxon shares in late 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debbie Bosanek, an assistant to Buffett, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONOCO STAKE DECLINES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett typically makes Berkshire's largest investments, while other investments are made by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Berkshire's quarterly filings do not reveal who buys or sells what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company ended September with $104.9 billion of equities. Its four top holdings - American Express Co, Coca-Cola Co, International Business Machines Corp and Wells Fargo &amp; Co - totaled $58.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the quarter, Berkshire also reduced by 44 percent its share stake in oil company ConocoPhillips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Thursday, ConocoPhillips' stock was up 27.1 percent in 2013, while Exxon rose just 7.7 percent. The Energy Selector Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund was up 22.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Buffett is a classic value investor, and Exxon has been an underloved stock in a bull market," Molchanov said. "Exxon is an amazing cash generating machine, which should generate $16 billion of free cash flow this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire also reported higher stakes in Bank of New York Mellon Corp, dialysis clinic operator DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc, satellite TV provider DIRECTV, Suncor Energy Co, US Bancorp and Verisign Inc, which assigns Internet protocol addresses. Its stake in drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire also owns more than 80 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, utilities, chemicals and food.

			Update on Chevron West Texas LPG Pipeline Incident
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron is continuing to depressurize the West Texas LPG pipeline that 
      ruptured and subsequently ignited today at approximately 9:30 AM CST. 
      The fire continues to decrease in size as residual product is flared and 
      burned-off. Chevron continues to monitor the nearby 14-inch LPG pipeline 
      and is in the process of mobilizing resources to remove product from it 
      and depressurize the line.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron continues to work with the appropriate local, state agencies and 
      emergency response organizations to assess and respond to the incident.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Local unified command has established a 1.5 mile evacuation zone at the 
      site, and approximately 700 people in the town of Milford have been 
      asked to evacuate. The local Red Cross has mobilized to assist those 
      impacted in the region. Chevron has also established a toll-free claims 
      hotline for affected residents: (855) 276-1272.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron would like to express our sincere regret to those impacted by 
      this incident. Our priority continues to be the safety and wellbeing of 
      the community and our employees and responders.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember the spate of fraud cases by the National Credit Union Administration in federal court in Manhattan earlier this fall? Perhaps emboldened by its quiet success in settling claims that failed credit unions were duped into buying fraudulently depicted mortgage-backed securities, NCUA filed complaints against nine banks that sold more than $2 billion of MBS to two credit unions that subsequently went under. The suits, which name Morgan Stanley, Barclays, JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse, RBS, UBS, Ally, Wachovia and Goldman Sachs, have all been transferred to U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who has been notoriously tough on the same defendants (and others) in MBS fraud suits brought by the Federal Housing Finance Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCUAs MBS litigation tends to be overshadowed by FHFAs, given the much bigger losses suffered by FHFAs wards, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the huge settlements FHFA has won from JPMorgan Chase and UBS. In the NCUAs New York cases, in particular, bank defense counsel and the credit union groups lawyers at Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans  Figel; Patterson Belknap Webb  Tyler; and Korein Tillery will be making a lot of arguments Judge Cote has already heard in the FHFA suits. In MBS litigation  as you can see from the timeliness and risk disclosure defenses that Morgan Stanleys lawyers from Davis Polk  Wardwell serve up in their new motion to dismiss the lead case in NCUAs New York MBS campaign  theres no longer much new under the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thats why I was tickled by a motion filed Wednesday by Sullivan  Cromwell, which is defending Goldman in NCUAs case: Goldman wants to compel arbitration of claims stemming from Southwest Corporates purchase of $40 million of MBS. According to the motion, the failed credit union bought those mortgage-backed securities through its longstanding brokerage account with Goldman. And under the terms of Southwests umbrella account agreement with the bank, Goldman maintains, NCUA, as the credit unions liquidating agent, is required to arbitrate any dispute over the investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When litigation over auction-rate securities was all the rage, purchasers often ended up in front of arbitration panels rather than judges and juries. But before Goldman filed its motion Wednesday, I hadnt noticed any MBS defendant attempting to compel arbitration. Nor does Goldmans brief cite any previous ruling that forced an MBS claimant out of court and into arbitration. When I checked with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which oversees arbitration between brokerages and their clients, I found out that some disputes over collateralized debt obligations that reference mortgage-backed securities have been arbitrated, but theres not enough MBS-related arbitration to warrant a separate category in FINRAs database. Even though Goldmans motion to compel arbitration involves claims on only $40 million of MBS, if Cote grants the motion, she will raise MBS arbitration from obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCUA does have defenses against Goldmans motion, which it laid out in a letter to the bank on Oct. 17. NCUA argues that the 1992 contract between Southwest Corporate and Goldman doesnt govern NCUAs claims because, as an initial matter, it was not in the credit unions files and may have been repudiated by other missing agreements. More substantively, as Goldman explained in the brief it filed Wednesday, NCUA asserts that the statute that created the agency permits it to sidestep or otherwise repudiate Southwest Corporates agreement because it hinders the resolution of the credit unions affairs. Goldman doesnt think much of NCUAs arguments, but Im sure the agencys positions will be presented more forcefully when it responds to the banks brief. NCUA counsel David Frederick of Kellogg Huber declined to comment, via email. Goldman counsel Richard Klapper of SC didnt respond to my phone message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note that arbitration isnt always a boon to defendants. A FINRA panel in 2009, for instance, socked Credit Suisse for an award of more than $400 million for the sale of auction-rate securities to its onetime client STMicroelectronics. Credit Suisse subsequently challenged the award in federal court, but its extremely difficult to reverse arbitration results and the banks effort failed. In fact, as my Reuters colleague Nate Raymond reported last spring, in the late stages of ARS litigation, plaintiffs often ended up opposing bank efforts to keep disputes in court rather than going to arbitration. Perhaps Goldman should be careful what its wishing for in NCUAs Southwest Corporate case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moody's cut long-term debt ratings by one notch for the banks, which also included Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service confirmed senior holding company ratings for Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), State Street Corp (STT.N) and Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. bank regulators have made substantive progress in creating credible plans to end taxpayer bailouts of too-big-to-fail banks, Moody's Managing Director Robert Young said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rating service said creditors of bank holding companies are now more likely to suffer losses and shoulder much of the burden of salvaging a failing bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives of Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment. A Morgan Stanley spokesman had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry; Editing by Gary Hill and James Dalgleish)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - A Chevron Corp pipeline exploded near a tiny Texas town south of Dallas on Thursday, shooting flames high in the air and prompting evacuations from nearby homes and a school district, but no injuries were reported, the company and emergency officials said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosion south of Milford, Texas, was caused by a construction crew that accidentally drilled into a 10-inch liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) line, Tom Hemrick, director of Hill County Emergency Management, told KTVT-TV in Dallas. He said all workers were accounted for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fire is definitely getting smaller," Hemrick said of the conflagration in an open field near Milford, a town of 700 people some 50 miles south of Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another 14-inch LPG line runs a few feet from the one that blew up and product was still flowing because stopping it would increase the risk of a secondary explosion, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is still flowing because the flow cools the line," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mid-afternoon Chevron confirmed Hemrick's version of events, identifying the line as a Chevron-operated West Texas LPG system near Milford.

			Update on Chevron Texas Pipeline Incident
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At approximately 9.30 a.m. (CST) today there was an incident at the 
      Chevron-operated West Texas LPG system near Milford, Texas. A crew was 
      performing excavation activities at the site when a rupture in the line 
      was reported. Five workers at the site were immediately evacuated. All 
      employees are accounted for and there are no reported injuries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron has initiated its emergency response procedures and is working 
      with the appropriate local, state agencies and emergency response 
      organizations to assess the current situation and respond to the 
      incident.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The flow of product in the pipeline has been shut-off and residual burn 
      continues. There is an adjacent Chevron owned 14&#8221; LPG pipeline that the 
      company is currently monitoring. Chevron and emergency response 
      organizations are actively monitoring the incident and taking every 
      precaution to contain and ultimately extinguish the fire.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron's primary concern is to ensure the safety of the surrounding 
      community and our employees. Chevron will continue working with the 
      community and its leaders to identify and respond to their needs.

&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Washington (Reuters) - The maker of the most popular computer operating system in the world is launching a new strategy against criminal hackers by bringing together security engineers, digital forensics experts and lawyers trained in fighting software pirates under one roof at its new Cybercrime Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp's expanded Digital Crimes Unit inside the 16,800-square foot, high-security facility combines a wide array of tactics that have worked the best: massive data gathering and analysis, gumshoe detective work, high-level diplomacy and creative lawyering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new approach, to be launched on Thursday, is the latest attempt to close the gap created in the past decade as criminal hackers innovated in technology and business methods to stay ahead of adversaries mired in the slow-moving world of international law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, many of the biggest victories against organized online criminals have come when private companies have worked together to seize control of the networks of hacked computers, called botnets, that carry out criminal operations. Though it is at times derided for the security shortfalls in its own products, Microsoft has led more of those seizures than any other company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cybercrime is getting worse," Digital Crimes Unit chief David Finn told Reuters during an exclusive visit to the Redmond, Washington, campus building this week. But Finn hopes that by mixing specialists from various professional arenas, Microsoft can get better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The center features a lab for dissecting malicious software samples that is accessible only with fingerprint authorization. In another room, a monitor tracks the countries and Internet service providers with the greatest number of machines belonging to some of the worst botnets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next to a situation room with a wall-sized, touch-screen monitor sit rows of empty offices for visiting police, Microsoft customers or other allies expected to join specific missions for days or weeks at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds or thousands of botnets, and Microsoft is trying to get only the biggest or most damaging, or else to pursue fights that would establish key precedents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few years "at least half of the major, significant takedowns have been driven by Microsoft," said Steve Santorelli, a former Microsoft investigator and Scotland Yard cybercrime detective who now works at a security nonprofit group called Team Cymru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has tangled with a Mexican mafia family that proudly put brand labels on pirated Xbox game CDs, a ring that took online payments via a parking garage in Malaga, Spain, and a Russian virus writer paid with a paper bag full of cash -- by a 12-year-old boy on a bike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside security experts praised the cross-pollination of fraud, security and software specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That kind of integration is only for the better. The financial sector has been thinking along those lines as well," said Greg Garcia, a former cybersecurity official at the Department of Homeland Security and at Bank of America who now advises the banking industry's main cybersecurity coordination group, known as FS-ISAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crimes unit doesn't tackle government spying, where Microsoft is among the major Internet companies that have turned over large amounts of data on users to the U.S. National Security Agency (it is suing for the right to disclose how much). And another unit within Microsoft is in charge of making the company's products less susceptible to hacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PIRACY SQUAD PROTECTS WINDOWS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 80 of the crime unit's 100 staffers have focused on the piracy of Microsoft products, with far fewer devoted to deconstructing the methods of criminals attacking Microsoft users and stopping them when possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But time and again, the piracy squad has found counterfeiters who were using botnets that also sent spam or attacked websites with denial-of-service attacks, or who slipped malicious software into copied Microsoft wares, or who had other ties to broader security issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one test, undercover Microsoft employees bought 20 new computers in China the way average consumers would. All had pirated versions of Windows, and all had at least traces of malicious software. An expanded pool of 169 machines included 18 percent ready to receive electronic commands as part of a botnet called Nitol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More critically, the piracy people bring experience with unusually powerful U.S. copyright laws. With a strong preliminary showing in court that their goods are being misrepresented, copyright owners can win orders allowing them to seize the offending property without prior notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an innovative and aggressive twist, Microsoft has been using that law to seize website addresses, including those used by criminals to control botnets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft really has done a very positive job in a couple of areas, and one of those is construction of legal frameworks that create precedents that allow future actions," said Jeff Williams, head of security strategy at Dell Inc's SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nitol case was remarkable in that it and other botnets were connecting to 70,000 addresses at a Chinese web domain-name seller called 3322.org. Microsoft won the right to filter all connections to those addresses and blocked more than 7 million attempts in 16 days. The owner of 3322 agreed to settle Microsoft's lawsuit and to drop other bad addresses identified by Microsoft or Chinese Internet security officials in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also felled a botnet called Rustock, once one of the biggest sources of spam on the planet. More recently, it teamed with banks to seriously hurt two operations that sell do-it-yourself kits for crafting smaller botnets that have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from online accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takedowns are often dramatic, with armed raids on multiple locations where servers are housed.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. investment banks JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Citi saw their share of investment banking revenue increase more than any of their peers in the first nine months of the year, new research showed on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the 13 investment banks tracked by research firm Tricumen, JP Morgan and Citi each saw their share of operating revenue rise 0.7 percentage points over the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tricumen partner Darko Kapor said JPMorgan's performance stemmed from continued strength in equity and debt capital markets, which are among its biggest businesses, as well as a strong third quarter in interest rates, foreign exchange, credit and equity derivatives trading, where it outpaced most peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year-to-date, JPMorgan earned the most from capital markets, making operating revenue of $19.5 billion, ahead of Goldman Sachs and Citi, which made $17.9 billion and $15 billion respectively, a Tricumen ranking showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report will be welcome news to JPMorgan, which last month posted its first quarterly loss under Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, and faces over a dozen legal probes globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tricumen said Citi's gains stemmed from the resilience of its fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) trading revenues, an area where many of its competitors saw revenues battered in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain-based Tricumen tracks data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale and UBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French bank Societe Generale also saw its share of revenue increase by 0.7 percentage points, though it remains a much smaller player than its peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapor said SocGen has been increasing its revenue share throughout the year through its activities in debt capital markets, where it seems to have found a way to increase or at least maintain margin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was among the biggest losers, seeing its share of revenue drop by 0.7 percentage points after a tough third quarter, according to Tricumen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from FICC trading for clients, one of Goldman's biggest businesses, tumbled 47 percent in the quarter, Goldman reported in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switzerland's UBS, however, was the worst performer. Its share of revenue slipped 1.1 percentage points due its pull back from FICC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately on Thursday, research by analytics firm Coalition forecast revenue at the top 10 global investment banks to decline by 5 percent to $151.7 billion in 2013 due to weak returns from FICC activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FICC revenues are expected to fall 20 percent year-on-year to $73.6 billion after a decline in institutional client activity, the absence of another European Central Bank long-term refinancing operation (LTRO) and bankers holding off trading in anticipation of interest rates rises, Coalition said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equities, however, are forecast to deliver their best return since 2010, with revenues up 22 percent year-on-year at $40.9 billion, while investment banking will see revenues rise 10 percent to $37.2 billion, Coalition's report showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coalition includes data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Clare Hutchison; Editing by Mark Potter)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co paid $1.8 million over two years to a small consulting firm run by the daughter of former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, The New York Times reported on Thursday, a relationship that is part of a wider U.S. probe into the Wall Street bank's hiring practices in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing documents, public filings and interviews, the newspaper said JPMorgan had a $75,000 a month contract with the consulting firm run by Lily Chang, which appeared to have only one other employee. The paper said Chang is the alias of Wen Ruchun, the only daughter of Wen Jiabao, who as premier had oversight of financial institutions at the time of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are investigating whether JPMorgan improperly gave jobs to well connected people in Asia to win business. The probe has spurred several JPMorgan executives to hire lawyers in the United States, a source told Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks globally have a long history of hiring people whose connections can be professionally useful. Investment banks in China often hired well-connected people starting in the early-2000s, when the firms were looking to underwrite stock offerings for the country's big state-owned enterprises, a practice known as "elephant hunting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a bank hires unqualified applicants to help win business from the employees' relatives it may be construed as a bribe under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is now reviewing all of its Asia hires and deals to see whether any deals the bank landed can be directly linked to "Sons and Daughters" hires. So far no smoking gun has been found and the bank's internal investigation is continuing, the source said. The New York Times reported that the U.S. government's investigation could take years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people familiar with the matter said the government's investigation was focusing on how the bank hired politically connected people for its two-year analyst program, which trains junior employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About seven years ago, JPMorgan decided to limit the number of "connected employees" in its analyst program to about a dozen, the sources said. Top JPMorgan managers created a spreadsheet to keep track of bankers assigned to mentor the connected employees, and which deals those mentors were working on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal was to prevent the mentors from working on deals directly related to their mentees' families, said the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak for the bank on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's anti-bribery unit is leading the government's JPMorgan probe, a person familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. The Department of Justice is also involved, as are authorities in other jurisdictions, the bank said in a November regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, The New York Times reported two of JPMorgan's hires under investigation were the son of the head of a Chinese state-run financial conglomerate, and the daughter of a former railway official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for JPMorgan in Hong Kong said on Thursday that the bank was "cooperating fully with regulators". She declined to comment further and referred to the bank's November 1 quarterly regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EVERBRIGHT, RAILWAY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan at one point hired Tang Xiaoning, the son of Tang Shuangning, chairman of state-controlled financial conglomerate China Everbright Group, and a former banking regulator, The New York Times reported in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the younger Tang joined JPMorgan, the bank won several important assignments from Everbright, including advising a subsidiary on a stock offering, the newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC is also probing JPMorgan's hiring of Zhang Xixi, the daughter of a now-disgraced Chinese railway official. The bank went on to help advise the official's company, which builds railways for the government, on its plans to go public, The New York Times reported in its August article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the newspaper's latest article, there is no indication from documents seen by The New York Times that Wen brokered any deals or investments between JPMorgan and companies affiliated with her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters could not immediately reach Wen Ruchun for comment.

throughout the year through its activities in debt capital

of revenue drop by 0.7 percentage points after a tough third
quarter, according to Tricumen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from FICC trading for clients, one of Goldman's
biggest businesses, tumbled 47 percent in the quarter, Goldman

			Research Report Highlights Viscount - Microsoft Rev Share Agreement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SoundView Research, a leading independent research firm, recently 
      published an updated report&#160;on Viscount Systems, Inc. (OTCQB:VSYS), a 
      developer and manufacturer of IT-based solutions for physical security 
      systems.&#160;The report is entitled, &#8220;Microsoft Partnership Deepens.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The research report states, "Microsoft has formalized their strategic 
      technology partnership with Viscount to include revenue sharing when new 
      end-user business comes in from the marketing programs and support 
      provided by Microsoft Global Security. The revenue share agreement with 
      Microsoft is a major milestone for Viscount. It significantly 
      strengthens the company position in the market going forward and 
      provides a platform for lead generation for Viscount&#8217;s IP-based 
      "Freedom" access control security system. Over the past year, Microsoft 
      has been testing and using Viscount&#8217;s Freedom security system at one of 
      the main buildings associated with its Global Security Operations Center 
      (GSOC) on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, WA. This announcement comes 
      on the heels of Viscount becoming a technology partner to Microsoft 
      Global Security earlier this year." (http://www.msgsoc.com/p_viscount.html)
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The SoundView report goes on to comment, "In previous research reports, 
      we have noted there is a major trend underway to migrate access control 
      technology into the cloud as way to increase security, enhance 
      functionality, and keep a lid on costs. In October 2011, Viscount 
      announced that its Freedom access control technology was the first 
      access control solution to run on Microsoft&#8217;s Azure cloud platform. For 
      Viscount, Microsoft brings a wealth of credibility in both the 
      enterprise and government segments &#8211; core markets for Viscount. 
      Potential customers seeking to migrate their security to the cloud will 
      no doubt to take note of Viscount&#8217;s status as a best-of-breed access 
      control security vendor by Microsoft. With Viscount&#8217;s Freedom security 
      system, Microsoft offers clients a best-of-breed access control solution 
      that yields enhanced functionality over conventional systems and at 
      significantly reduced cost. That&#8217;s a value proposition that is difficult 
      to beat in any market."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report concludes, "Our current intrinsic value (IV) estimate for 
      VSYS is $0.38 per share for 2014, suggesting there is a great deal of 
      value creation potential ahead for Viscount in the year ahead. The 
      revenue share agreement with Microsoft is a key milestone that puts the 
      company in a potential to experience a break out year in 2014. It will 
      take a few months to ramp up and begin to harvest the fruits of the 
      Microsoft partnership, but management is confident in its ability to 
      execute and deliver the goods in the year ahead."

      Viscount Systems Inc., designs unified software platforms for building 
      security and emergency planning. The Company's&#160;Freedom Encryption Bridge 
      is the first and only access control system that allows entry devices 
      (ID cards, RFID readers, biometrics etc.) to be connected to standard 
      building IT networks without requiring expensive control panels that are 
      programmed from a PC. Freedom changes the paradigm of IT friendly access 
      control. It eliminates up to 80% of the cost of traditional systems that 
      require the installation of control panels. And, it utilizes existing 
      logical IT security software (LDAP) to replace both the control panel 
      component and the software component of traditional systems. Freedom 
      drastically reduces system costs while providing a much more secure 
      software solution. Recent awards include the Microsoft 2012 "Be What's

			Pfizer Subsidiary, Wyeth LLC, To Redeem 5.500% Notes Due February 1, 
      2014
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that Wyeth LLC, its wholly owned 
      subsidiary, has notified The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee under 
      the applicable indenture, of its election to fully redeem all of its 
      outstanding 5.500% Notes due February 1, 2014 (CUSIP No. 983024AE0) (the 
      &#8220;Notes&#8221;). The aggregate principal amount of Notes currently outstanding 
      is $1.75 billion. The redemption date for the Notes will be December 16, 
      2013 (the &#8220;Redemption Date&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The redemption price (&#8220;Redemption Price&#8221;) for the Notes will be a price 
      equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, 
      or (ii) the sum, as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined in the 
      Global Note, the form of which was filed with the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission as part of Exhibit 4.6 to Wyeth&#8217;s Annual Report on 
      Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 (File No. 
      001-01225) (the &#8220;Global Note&#8221;)), of the present value of the principal 
      amount of the Notes and the remaining scheduled payments of interest on 
      the Notes from the Redemption Date to the maturity date of the Notes, 
      exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date, discounted from 
      their respective scheduled payment dates to the Redemption Date on a 
      semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) at 
      the Treasury Rate (as defined in the Global Note) plus 25 basis points, 
      plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed 
      to (but excluding) the Redemption Date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On and after the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price will become due 
      and payable in respect of the Notes, and interest on the Notes will 
      cease to accrue on and after such date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Notice of the redemption of the Notes (the &#8220;Notice of Redemption&#8221;) is 
      expected to be mailed on November 14, 2013. The redemption will be 
      effected in accordance with the applicable terms of the indenture under 
      which the Notes were issued.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The paying agent for the redemption is The Bank of New York Mellon. The 
      relevant contact information for The Bank of New York Mellon will be set 
      forth in the Notice of Redemption.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Washington Nov 14 (Reuters) - The maker of the
most popular computer operating system in the world is launching
a new strategy against criminal hackers by bringing together
security engineers, digital forensics experts and lawyers
trained in fighting software pirates under one roof at its new
Cybercrime Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp's expanded Digital Crimes Unit
inside the 16,800-square foot, high-security facility combines a
wide array of tactics that have worked the best: massive data
gathering and analysis, gumshoe detective work, high-level
diplomacy and creative lawyering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new approach, to be launched on Thursday, is the latest
attempt to close the gap created in the past decade as criminal
hackers innovated in technology and business methods to stay
ahead of adversaries mired in the slow-moving world of
international law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, many of the biggest victories against organized
online criminals have come when private companies have worked
together to seize control of the networks of hacked computers,
called botnets, that carry out criminal operations. Though it is
at times derided for the security shortfalls in its own
products, Microsoft has led more of those seizures than any
other company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cybercrime is getting worse," Digital Crimes Unit chief
David Finn told Reuters during an exclusive visit to the
Redmond, Washington, campus building this week. But Finn hopes
that by mixing specialists from various professional arenas,
Microsoft can get better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The center features a lab for dissecting malicious software
samples that is accessible only with fingerprint authorization.
In another room, a monitor tracks the countries and Internet
service providers with the greatest number of machines belonging
to some of the worst botnets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next to a situation room with a wall-sized, touch-screen
monitor sit rows of empty offices for visiting police, Microsoft
customers or other allies expected to join specific missions for
days or weeks at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds or thousands of botnets, and Microsoft is
trying to get only the biggest or most damaging, or else to
pursue fights that would establish key precedents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few years "at least half of the major,
significant takedowns have been driven by Microsoft," said Steve
Santorelli, a former Microsoft investigator and Scotland Yard
cybercrime detective who now works at a security nonprofit group
called Team Cymru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has tangled with a Mexican mafia family that
proudly put brand labels on pirated Xbox game CDs, a ring that
took online payments via a parking garage in Malaga, Spain, and
a Russian virus writer paid with a paper bag full of cash -- by
a 12-year-old boy on a bike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside security experts praised the cross-pollination of
fraud, security and software specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That kind of integration is only for the better. The
financial sector has been thinking along those lines as well,"
said Greg Garcia, a former cybersecurity official at the
Department of Homeland Security and at Bank of America who now
advises the banking industry's main cybersecurity coordination
group, known as FS-ISAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crimes unit doesn't tackle government spying, where
Microsoft is among the major Internet companies that have turned
over large amounts of data on users to the U.S. National
Security Agency (it is suing for the right to disclose how
much). And another unit within Microsoft is in charge of making
the company's products less susceptible to hacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PIRACY SQUAD PROTECTS WINDOWS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 80 of the crime unit's 100 staffers have focused on
the piracy of Microsoft products, with far fewer devoted to
deconstructing the methods of criminals attacking Microsoft
users and stopping them when possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But time and again, the piracy squad has found
counterfeiters who were using botnets that also sent spam or
attacked websites with denial-of-service attacks, or who slipped
malicious software into copied Microsoft wares, or who had other
ties to broader security issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one test, undercover Microsoft employees bought 20 new
computers in China the way average consumers would. All had
pirated versions of Windows, and all had at least traces of
malicious software. An expanded pool of 169 machines included 18
percent ready to receive electronic commands as part of a botnet
called Nitol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More critically, the piracy people bring experience with
unusually powerful U.S. copyright laws. With a strong
preliminary showing in court that their goods are being
misrepresented, copyright owners can win orders allowing them to
seize the offending property without prior notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an innovative and aggressive twist, Microsoft has been
using that law to seize website addresses, including those used
by criminals to control botnets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft really has done a very positive job in a couple
of areas, and one of those is construction of legal frameworks
that create precedents that allow future actions," said Jeff
Williams, head of security strategy at Dell Inc's SecureWorks
Counter Threat Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nitol case was remarkable in that it and other botnets
were connecting to 70,000 addresses at a Chinese web domain-name
seller called 3322.org. Microsoft won the right to filter all
connections to those addresses and blocked more than 7 million
attempts in 16 days. The owner of 3322 agreed to settle
Microsoft's lawsuit and to drop other bad addresses identified
by Microsoft or Chinese Internet security officials in the
future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also felled a botnet called Rustock, once one of
the biggest sources of spam on the planet. More recently, it
teamed with banks to seriously hurt two operations that sell
do-it-yourself kits for crafting smaller botnets that have
stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from online accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takedowns are often dramatic, with armed raids on
multiple locations where servers are housed. If there are many
control computers and they don't get disconnected within minutes
of one another, the surviving machines can issue new commands
and recreate the entire network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During one raid in Pennsylvania, an executive at the bad web
page's hosting company was cooperating when the site's owner
realized what was happening and changed his password from afar,
locking out the official. The Microsoft team pulled out the
cables to save the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finn and Microsoft crime expert Richard Boscovich, a fellow
former federal prosecutor, said they are working on new means to
take down even more sophisticated botnets, which are controlled
through a peer-to-peer mechanism instead of through centralized
servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You'll be seeing some interesting stuff in the near
future," Boscovich promised. "This is an area where what is good
for the business is good for society."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) paid $1.8 million over two years to a small consulting firm run by the daughter of former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, The New York Times reported on Thursday, a relationship that is part of a wider U.S. probe into the Wall Street bank's hiring practices in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing documents, public filings and interviews, the newspaper said JPMorgan had a $75,000 a month contract with a consultancy run by Lily Chang, which appeared to have only one other employee. The paper said Chang is the alias of Wen Ruchun, the only daughter of Wen Jiabao, who as premier had oversight of financial institutions at the time of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are investigating JPMorgan's hiring practices in China as part of a wider bribery probe into whether the bank traded contracts and jobs in order to win business. Investment banks globally have a long history of hiring people with key connections who can help win advisory roles on important and lucrative deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice was widespread in China from the early-2000s, when investment banks engaged in so-called 'elephant hunting' - chasing mandates to manage the multi-billion dollar stock offerings of the country's big state-owned enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction between hiring a relative of a foreign official who may be well connected, and employing such a person with the express hope of winning specific business, is key to proving violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) anti-bribery unit is leading the JPMorgan probe, a person familiar with the matter previously told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANK FILING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 7, JPMorgan disclosed in a regulatory filing that it had a request from U.S. regulators regarding employees in Hong Kong, but did not elaborate. The New York Times followed with a report detailing the nature of the probe, later confirmed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its August report, The New York Times said two of JPMorgan's hires under investigation were of the son of the head of a Chinese state-run financial conglomerate, and the daughter of a former railway official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing people with knowledge of the matter, Bloomberg News reported in late-August that JPMorgan had an internal spreadsheet that linked appointments to specific deals pursued by the bank. It said JPMorgan, in response to the SEC probe, started an internal investigation in Hong Kong, which was later expanded across Asia, covering interns as well as full-time staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In The New York Times report on Thursday, the paper said Wen Ruchun's firm, Fullmark Consultants, was paid a total of $1.8 million by JPMorgan in 2006-08.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for JPMorgan in Hong Kong said on Thursday that the bank was "cooperating fully with regulators". She declined to comment further and referred to the bank's November 1 quarterly filing in which it gave further information about the probe, disclosing that, in addition to the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice and agencies from other jurisdictions were investigating hiring practices in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters could not immediately reach Wen Ruchun for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A visit to the Beijing office cited by The New York Times as Fullmark's headquarters revealed no company of that name, suggesting the business has either closed or moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EVERBRIGHT, RAILWAY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan at one point hired Tang Xiaoning, the son of Tang Shuangning, chairman of state-controlled financial conglomerate China Everbright Group, and a former banking regulator, The New York Times reported in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the younger Tang joined JPMorgan, the bank won several important assignments from Everbright, including advising a subsidiary on a stock offering, the newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC is also probing JPMorgan's hiring of Zhang Xixi, the daughter of a now-disgraced Chinese railway official. The bank went on to help advise the official's company, which builds railways for the government, on its plans to go public, The New York Times reported in its August article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the newspaper's latest article, there is no indication from documents seen by The New York Times that Wen brokered any deals or investments between JPMorgan and companies affiliated with her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Flaherty, with additional reporting by Lawrence White and Ben Blanchard; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Nov 14 (Reuters) - An investigation by U.S.
authorities into JPMorgan's hiring practices in China
involves a business relationship between the Wall Street bank
and a consultancy firm run by the daughter of China's former
premier, The New York Times reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing documents, public filings and interviews, the
newspaper said JPMorgan had a contract with a consultancy run by
Lily Chang, and which appeared to have only one other employee,
and paid the firm $75,000 a month. The paper said Chang is the
alias of Wen Ruchun, the only daughter of Wen Jiabao, who was
China's premier, with oversight of financial institutions, at
the time the contract was agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's ties to Wen's daughter are part of a wider
bribery investigation by U.S. authorities into whether the bank
swapped contracts and jobs in order to win business deals, the
paper said. News of that probe into JPMorgan's hiring in China
first broke in August. The New York Times was first to report
the nature of the investigation, later confirmed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its August report, The New York Times said two of the
bank's hires under investigation were of the son of the head of
a state-run financial conglomerate, and the daughter of a former
Chinese railway official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its report on Thursday, the paper said Wen Ruchun's
consulting firm, Fullmark Consultants, earned $1.8 million from
JPMorgan between 2006-08.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for JPMorgan in Hong Kong said on Thursday
that the bank is "cooperating fully with regulators". She
declined to comment further, but referred to the bank's
quarterly regulatory filing in which it disclosed that the
Securities and Exchange Commission had asked the bank for
information about Hong Kong employees and their business
relationships with certain clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters was not immediately able to reach Wen Ruchun for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co said on Friday it agreed to pay $4.5 billion to settle claims by investors who lost money on mortgage-backed securities before the collapse of the U.S. housing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank reached the agreement with 21 institutional investors in 330 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued by JPMorgan and Bear Stearns, which it took over during the financial crisis, according to the bank and lawyers for the investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal still has to be accepted by seven trustees overseeing the securities holdings, the parties said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement does not include trusts issued by Washington Mutual, which JPMorgan also acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is separate from the preliminary $13 billion settlement JPMorgan has reached with the U.S. government that would resolve a raft of actions over residential mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This settlement is another important step in J.P. Morgan's efforts to resolve legacy related RMBS matters," the bank said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it believes reserves it has built will cover the expense of "this and any remaining" mortgage securities litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 21 investors include BlackRock Inc, Metlife Inc, Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Company, the TCW Group and Bayerische Landesbank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, the trustees have until January 15 to accept the offer, which may be extended for another 60 days, according to JPMorgan and Gibbs &amp; Bruns, the Houston law firm that represented the institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathy Patrick of Gibbs &amp; Bruns called the deal "an important milestone" in a three-year effort by the group of 21 bondholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven trustees over the bonds include Bank of New York Mellon Corp.

, the TCW Group and Bayerische Landesbank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, trustees have until Jan. 15 to accept
the offer, which may be extended for another 60 days, according
to JPMorgan and Gibbs &amp; Bruns, the Houston law firm that
represented the institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathy Patrick of Gibbs &amp; Bruns called the deal "an important
milestone" in a three-year effort by the group of 21
bondholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven trustees over the bonds include Bank of New York
Mellon Corp. Kevin Heine, a spokesman for the Bank of New
York Mellon, said the bank would "evaluate the proposed
settlement along with the other trustees."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If accepted, the deal would resolve claims that JPMorgan and
Bear Stearns misrepresented the mortgages underlying the
securities, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement also would resolve servicing claims on all
trusts issued by the bank and Bear Stearns between 2005 and
2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the third bank to strike a deal with investors
over shoddy mortgage-backed securities issued in the run-up to
the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp struck an $8.5 billion settlement in
June 2011 with 22 institutional investors. That deal is still
awaiting court approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, bondholders in trusts issued by Ally Financial's
bankrupt former mortgage lending arm, Residential Capital, won
an agreement to bring an $8.7 billion claim, although that was
later reduced to $7.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibbs &amp; Bruns has represented investors in all three
settlements. In 2011, the law firm said its investor clients had
instructed trustees overseeing $95 billion of securities issued
by JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual to investigate
whether the bonds were backed by ineligible mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual is not included in the deal because of
ongoing litigation between the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
and JPMorgan over who is responsible for losses at the former
mortgage lender, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The separate tentative $13 billion settlement between
JPMorgan and the U.S. government also has been complicated by
that dispute, according to other sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has vowed to resolve legal and
regulatory issues that have been weighing heavily on the company
since May 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, JPMorgan reported its first quarterly loss under
Dimon as it recorded more than $9 billion of expenses to build
its litigation reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Karen Freifeld&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 15 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
said on Friday it has agreed to pay $4.5 billion to settle
claims by investors who lost money on mortgage-backed securities
before the collapse of the U.S. housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank reached the agreement with 21 institutional
investors in 330 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts
issued by JPMorgan and Bear Stearns, which it took over during
the financial crisis, according to the bank and lawyers for the
investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal still has to be accepted by trustees for the trusts

would resolve a raft of actions over mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This settlement is another imoprtant step in J.P. Morgan's

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Steven Donziger, the lawyer accused by Chevron Corp of using bribery to secure a $19 billion judgment over pollution in Ecuador, has never been shy about his opinion of U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What he's doing is not judging," Donziger said of Kaplan, who is presiding over a non-jury trial on Chevron's claims in a federal court in New York. "He's prosecuting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger, who spoke to reporters on Friday, is expected to take the stand on Monday to testify in his own defense. The trial is entering its sixth week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His appearance will be a dramatic moment in the years-long legal battle that has pitted the vast resources of a global oil company against Donziger and the group of villagers in northeastern Ecuador that he advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a draft of his testimony provided to the press, Donziger accused Kaplan of bias while criticizing Chevron for "the most well-funded corporate retaliation campaign in history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I challenge at the most fundamental level the legitimacy of this proceeding," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A court spokeswoman said Kaplan would have no comment. In 2011, Kaplan rejected Donziger's request that the judge recuse himself for partiality. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later upheld his decision on appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case centers on contamination between 1964 and 1992 from an oil field operated by Texaco, which was later acquired by Chevron. In 2011 an Ecuadorean judge, Nicolas Zambrano, issued an $18 billion judgment - later increased to $19 billion - against Chevron in favor of a group of villagers who lived nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuador's highest court upheld the decision this week but slashed the amount to $9.5 billion. Chevron claims that Texaco cleaned up the site after ceasing Ecuadorean operations in 1992 and handing the field over to state-controlled Petroecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The villagers have sought to enforce the judgment in courts in Canada, Brazil and Argentina, since Chevron no longer has assets in Ecuador. If Chevron wins at trial, it would likely use the ruling to bolster its case against enforcing the judgment in foreign courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRIBERY ALLEGATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the trial, a former Ecuadorean judge, Alberto Guerra, testified that he was paid to ghostwrite Zambrano's opinion and that Donziger was aware of the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron has no evidence that I had any involvement in bribing any judge apart from Guerra's thoroughly false and corrupt testimony," Donziger said in his written testimony. He said Guerra openly asked for a bribe at one point, which Donziger refused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zambrano said on the witness stand that he wrote the opinion on his own and did not accept any payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a Chevron spokesman called Donziger's draft testimony "nothing more than 60 pages of distraction, distortion, fabrication and irrelevance." He also said it did nothing to refute the evidence Chevron has presented at trial, including experts who said Zambrano could not have written the opinion alone and in the time frame he claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger also claimed Chevron acted improperly during the Ecuadorean case, meeting with judges without opposing counsel present and using "back channels" to pressure government officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As both sides have done with previous witness statements, Chevron is expected to ask Kaplan to strike portions of Donziger's submission as inadmissible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger said in his testimony that he held secret meetings with an expert who prepared a report on Chevron's liability in Ecuador and that his team paid the expert, but he said he believed that those actions were in keeping with Ecuadorean law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday afternoon, Donziger spoke with reporters for 90 minutes in a crowded loft apartment where 14 lawyers, activists and volunteers on his team have been sleeping during the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and one of his lawyers, Zoe Littlepage, said they fully expect Kaplan to rule against them and are already contemplating the basis for an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides their claim that Kaplan is biased, they said they would argue that Chevron's lawsuit improperly seeks to use the federal racketeering statute to stay enforcement of a foreign judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v.

			JPMorgan Chase Reaches an Agreement with 21 Institutional Investors 
      to Resolve Repurchase and Servicing Claims
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. has reached a $4.5 billion agreement with 21 major 
      institutional investors, represented by Gibbs  Bruns LLP, to make a 
      binding offer to the trustees of 330 residential mortgage-backed 
      securities (RMBS) trusts issued by J.P. Morgan, Chase, and Bear Stearns.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This settlement is another important step in J.P. Morgan&#8217;s efforts to 
      resolve legacy related RMBS matters. The firm believes it is 
      appropriately reserved for this and any remaining RMBS litigation 
      matters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As agreed in today&#8217;s settlement, the institutional investors have 
      committed to support the settlement and have requested that the trustees 
      accept the settlement offer. The offer, which the trustees may seek 
      court approval for, would resolve all representation and warranty claims 
      as well as servicing claims on all trusts issued by J.P. Morgan, Chase 
      and Bear Stearns between 2005 and 2008. While this agreement would 
      resolve representation and warranty claims as well as servicing claims 
      facing the firm with respect to J.P. Morgan, Chase and Bear Stearns 
      trusts, it does not resolve claims on trusts issued by Washington Mutual.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The offer will remain open until January 15, 2014, but may be extended 
      pursuant to its terms for an additional sixty days. It includes the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and the S 500 hit new highs on Friday for a sixth straight week of gains, as investors continued to take cues from Federal Reserve Chair nominee Janet Yellen, who told a Senate Committee it was too early to end the central bank's stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;

highs on Friday for a sixth straight week of gains, as investors
continued to take cues from Federal Reserve Chair nominee Janet
Yellen, who told a Senate Committee it was too early to end the
central bank's stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp led the blue chip Dow
index higher. They rose 2.2 percent to $95.27 a day after Warren
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc  disclosed a
new $3.45 billion stake in the second-largest U.S. company by
market value, behind only Apple Inc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the S and Dow capped a fourth straight day of gains

that's providing a fair amount of support."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the year, fund managers who are trailing

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - A Chevron Corp worker was killed in a fire that broke out early Friday morning at a cracking unit at the U.S. oil company's 330,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Research and Markets: Global SAN Market Report 2012-2016 with Dell, EMC, 
      HP. IBM  NetApp Dominating the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/swggm9/global_san_market) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      SAN Market 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global Storage Area Networks (SAN) market to grow at a CAGR of 
      8.42 percent over the period 2012-2016.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The main factor which is driving the Global SAN market is its improved 
      scalability. With SAN, there is no restriction or limitation on the 
      volume of data that can be stored as is the case with other forms of 
      storage such as disk storage. SAN is highly scalable and can be expanded 
      to a considerable extent. SANs are also highly efficient and their 
      performance is not affected by Ethernet traffic or local disk throughput 
      blockages. Data transferred from a SAN and to a SAN are on two separate 
      networks, leading to reduced network clogging or congestion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A major trend being witnessed in the Global SAN market is the increased 
      adoption of FCoE SAN technology. This technology is gaining added 
      popularity in the data storage environments. FCoE has many advantages 
      over the Ethernet network. The major change is that FCoE offers far more 
      intelligence and capabilities in terms of access and routing decisions. 
      Hence, the FC equipments are more involved in network than the basic 
      Ethernet equipment. Hence, many end-users are adopting the device for 
      the better management of network data traffic and storage across 
      organizational networks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the main challenge faced by the market 
      is high cost of FC SAN. FC SAN solution, the most dominant and efficient 
      of all technologies currently available in the SAN, is expensive to 
      implement. SAN requires the purchase of a FC HBA to assist each host 
      that is attached to the SAN. It also requires prohibitively high 
      investment from startups and SMEs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Gaming Console Market Analysis to 2016 
      Featuring Microsoft, Nintendo  Sony Dominating the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/hsjmpf/global_gaming) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Gaming Console Market 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Gaming Console market to grow at a CAGR of 3.93 percent over 
      the period 2012-2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main drivers in this market is the 
      innovations in audiovisual devices. With the availability of high-end 
      displays and sound systems, consumers can now enjoy a good gaming 
      experience. Moreover, HDTVs with in-built wireless connectivity and HDMI 
      ports, which have the capability to support external hard disks, provide 
      consumers with an enriched gaming experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The availability of multi-functional gaming consoles is the latest trend 
      emerging in the Global Gaming Console market. Multi-functional gaming 
      consoles not only support games but also enable gamers to watch videos, 
      listen to music, browse the internet, and download videos. Hence, this 
      console functions as a gaming and an entertainment console with its 
      multi-utility features. Recently, Nintendo launched Wii U, which allows 
      users to operate the device as a handheld console and use the same 
      console to browse the internet, draw sketches, and post them on social 
      media websites. This trend of vendors manufacturing multi-utility

      Further, the report states that one of the main challenges in this 
      market is the shifting of consumers to alternative gaming platforms such 
      as mobile games and online games. Moreover, these games are available at 
      a lower cost than console gaming. As a result, there has been a drastic 
      decline in the sales of gaming consoles.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - A Chevron Corp worker was killed in a fire that broke out early Friday morning at a cracking unit at the major U.S. oil company's 330,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant's emergency teams put out the fire, which started at 2 a.m. CST, Chevron and officials from Jackson County and Pascagoula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire broke out at a furnace in a gasoline-making unit known as the "Cracking II area," Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cash gasoline prices on the U.S. Gulf Coast spiked briefly on news of the conflagration before retreating, traders said after the latest in a string of accidents in the U.S. energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire came the day after a Chevron pipeline unrelated to the refinery exploded in rural Milford, Texas, shooting flames high into the air and prompting evacuations but causing no injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gulf Coast refinery network has started to emerge from seasonal work that drained stockpiles after plants cranked up runs, bingeing on cheap domestic feedstock to ship products abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of September, distillate stockpiles in the region have fallen by 3.5 million barrels to 38.5 million barrels, nearly 2.8 million barrels below the five-year seasonal average. Gasoline inventories are off 5.2 million barrels over the past nine weeks, but at nearly 73 million barrels are 1.1 million barrels above the five-year average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's Pascagoula refinery appeared to have been undergoing some maintenance work before the fire, according to energy intelligence group Genscape, which reported on Thursday that a unit had shut down and then had begun restarting with another unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genscape, which monitors activities at refineries by camera, said on Friday that the restart of the 55,000-bpd catalytic reformer, which turns naphtha into gasoline components, was halted at the time of the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the restart of a 29,000-bpd hydrocracker, which uses hydrogen to break down molecules into other refined products, had been completed and that all other units were online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron did not reply to a request for comment on the Genscape reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The refinery, which began operating in 1963, is the largest of three in Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plant can process and treat low-grade heavier, sour, foreign crude oil. It produces about 130,000 bpd of motor gasoline, 50,000 bpd of jet fuel and 68,000 bpd of diesel fuel, according to Chevron's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April of this year, a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed Chevron's board had trimmed cash bonuses for some managers in a bid to hold them accountable for "operational incidents" in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donnie Carlson, Pascagoula's deputy fire chief, said the city's crews were put on standby in a staging area but did not fight the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fire's out," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Chevron were up 3 cents at $119.59 in morning trading on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by NR Sethuraman in Bangalore; Sabina Zawadzki, Scott DiSavino, and Matthew Robinson in New York, and Erwin Seba in Houston; Writing by Terry Wade; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

to fresh highs on Friday in the wake of reassuring remarks by
Federal Reserve chair nominee Janet Yellen that the central
bank's accommodative policies would continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the advance was limited, with both indexes on track
for a sixth consecutive week of gains and the S 500 just five
points away from 1,800, its next level of potential resistance.
The Nasdaq 100 index was near a 13-year high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market is starting to price in improved economic
growth, improved earnings and slowly getting over worries about
the what the Fed might do," said Tim Ghriskey, who helps manage
more than $1.5 billion as chief investment officer of Solaris
Asset Management LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp led the blue chip Dow
index higher. The stock rose 1.2 percent to $94.35 a day after

publicly traded oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.C. Penney Co shares rose 6.2 percent to $9.23

Jana Partners and Farallon Capital Management Group took
positions in the ailing department store operator, and Glenview
Capital, already a big owner, added to its holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FedEx Corp shares added 2 percent to $139.12 after
regulatory filings showed funds including Daniel Loeb's Third
Point LLC, George Soros' Soros Fund Management LLC and John
Paulson's hedge fund, Paulson &amp; Co all took stakes in the
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A divergence continued between large-cap and mid- and
small-cap stocks, which are seen as riskier because they exhibit
greater sensitivity to macroeconomic factors. The Russell 2000
index of small- and mid-cap stocks was flat at 1,111.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Going forward, I'm keeping an eye on the 1,120 area on the
Russell 2000, as small-cap leadership would be a good sign for
risk appetite," said Bryan Sapp, senior trading analyst at
Schaefer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average was up 50.66 points,
or 0.32 percent, at 15,926.88. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index 
 was up 3.56 points, or 0.20 percent, at 1,794.18. The
Nasdaq Composite Index was up 6.64 points, or 0.17
percent, at 3,979.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Twitter 's trading debut on the New York
Stock Exchange on Nov. 7, options market makers began pricing
and trading contracts Friday to buy or sell Twitter shares at
various prices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data showed New York state's manufacturing sector
unexpectedly shrank this month while U.S. industrial production
fell in October as output at power plants and mines
declined.  The market barely
reacted to the reports.&lt;/p&gt;

			Coca-Cola Contributes More Than US$2.5 Million 
      in Typhoon Relief Aid
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company announced today that the Coca-Cola system is 
      donating more than US$2.5 million in cash and in-kind contributions to 
      support disaster relief and recovery efforts in the Philippines 
      following the devastation from Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We would like to express our deepest sympathies to those affected by 
      this tragic disaster in the Philippines,&#8221; said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and 
      CEO, The Coca-Cola Company. &#8220;Our dedicated associates are on the ground 
      offering assistance, and we are committed to helping the communities 
      rebuild.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Coca-Cola Philippines and our bottling partner, Coca-Cola FEMSA 
      Philippines, through The Coca-Cola Foundation Philippines, began 
      donating water for relief efforts immediately after the storm to the 
      Philippine Red Cross, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the 
      Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We wish to express our heartfelt solidarity to all Filipinos in these 
      difficult times,&#8221; said Carlos Salazar Lomel&#237;n, Chief Executive Officer 
      of Coca-Cola FEMSA, the bottling company of the country. &#8220;It is in times 
      like these when the Philippines sets an example of resilience and good 
      spirit, and where our values of supporting ourselves as a team come at 
      its best.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Philippines is providing US$1 million for additional relief 
      initiatives, community rehabilitation, and to assist small independent 
      customers with reconstruction. The Coca-Cola Foundation in Atlanta has 
      contributed US$1 million to the American National Red Cross for 
      humanitarian aid to the Philippines. By the end of this week, the 
      Coca-Cola system will have donated 129,000 cases of water to the 
      affected communities, representing an in-kind contribution valued at 
      $590,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;From day one, we have mobilized our system to provide water and 
      resources to the survivors of the super typhoon. Immediately after the 
      disaster, we worked with our partners, the Philippine Red Cross, the 
      DSWD, and the AFP to be able to provide water to the affected areas,&#8221; 
      said Guillermo Aponte, President and General Manager of Coca-Cola, 
      Philippines. &#8220;Our business is deeply rooted in these communities, 
      therefore we will provide assistance during this time of need.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have a long-standing commitment to extend aid to our affected 
      associates and their families, as well as for our communities locally,&#8221; 
      said Juan Ramon Felix, Asia Division Director, Coca-Cola FEMSA, &#8220;and 
      with our unique capacity to lend a helping hand to these communities, we 
      will ensure that we will continue to provide support through this 
      difficult time.&#8221;

			MD Buyline Pioneers Improved Healthcare Decision Making with Big Data 
      Solution Powered by IBM Watson
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			A new era of cognitive computing will help healthcare providers 
      make more informed, intelligent decisions and inspire healthier 
      organizations and patients
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MD Buyline, Inc. and IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced today a partnership 
      utilizing the IBM Watson cognitive computing system to help improve 
      decision-making processes in hospitals to enable better patient care and 
      outcomes. MD Buyline and IBM will showcase a prototype of the Big Data 
      solution Hippocrates powered by IBM Watson during the IBM Watson Summit 
      2013 in Austin, Texas. Leveraging Watson&#8217;s cognitive abilities, 
      Hippocrates acts as a decision adviser, uncovering the data-driven 
      evidence that health systems and healthcare professionals need to make 
      important decisions in real time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MD Buyline is a key partner within a new ecosystem of businesses that 
      will create apps infused with IBM Watson&#8217;s cognitive computing 
      intelligence. In line with today&#8217;s announcement, IBM is launching the Watson 
      Developers Cloud, where software application providers &#8212; ranging 
      from start-ups to established technology leaders, such as MD Buyline &#8212; 
      can collaborate with IBM to create Watson-powered apps. The cloud will 
      feature a &#8220;sandbox&#8221; for app creation, as well as a developer toolkit, 
      educational materials and access to IBM Watson's application programming 
      interface (API).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Starting with innovative businesses, such as MD Buyline, each partner in 
      IBM's new Watson-fueled ecosystem will have the tools, talent and 
      expertise to execute on its vision, and in turn, bring to market a new 
      class of cognitive innovations that transform how their users do 
      business, make decisions and improve lives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Healthcare providers currently make decisions about patient care, 
      reimbursement and purchases based on vast amounts of decentralized, 
      unstructured data (including but not limited to electronic medical 
      records (EMR), spend data, claims, cost data, outcomes, quality, 
      clinical trials and medical journals). This Big Data is valuable and 
      necessary to the decisions hospitals and healthcare professionals make 
      every day. But finding comprehensive, unbiased evidence is challenging 
      and time-consuming.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In developing the Hippocrates solution, MD Buyline and IBM are training 
      IBM Watson to extract, learn, assign context and understand information 
      from various credible sources of Big Data. Hippocrates will be designed 
      in a way that&#8217;s easy to use. When asked a question, Hippocrates calls 
      upon Watson&#8217;s ability to understand natural language and human speech, 
      and then use hypotheses and evidence-based learning to generate a 
      confidence-weighted answer. Users can then share Hippocrates&#8217; responses 
      to collaborate with their peers and learn from first-hand experiences.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Several areas of hospitals can benefit from the IBM Watson cognitive 
      computing platform, including clinical and financial decision support, 
      quality improvement, supply chain and C-suite,&#8221; said Satin Mirchandani, 
      CEO of MD Buyline. &#8220;As the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) model of 
      value-based payments converges with outcomes-based purchasing, the new 
      Hippocrates platform presents hospitals with an opportunity to evaluate 
      and improve quality, value, outcomes and patient satisfaction.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With more than 30 years of industry experience and 3,300 member 
      hospitals and healthcare systems nationwide, MD Buyline has accumulated 
      an unparalleled amount of quality, objective and evidence-based data 
      that provides hospitals with clinical and financial insight. MD 
      Buyline&#8217;s clinical analysts have a deep understanding of existing and 
      emerging technologies, price benchmarks, clinical effectiveness and much 
      more, as well as deep-seated relationships within health systems. &#8220;With 
      Hippocrates powered by IBM Watson, MD Buyline can enable a new era of 
      efficiently providing hospitals with relevant evidence that enlightens 
      and empowers users to support healthier decisions, hospitals and, 
      ultimately, patients,&#8221; said Mirchandani.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			IBM Watson: Then and Now
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM&#8217;s mission to spark a new generation of Watson-powered apps is the 
      latest milestone in the company&#8217;s initiative to develop cognitive system 
      offerings that help its clients and partners succeed, in a range of 
      industries including healthcare, financial services and retail.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Two years after its triumph on the television quiz show Jeopardy!, IBM 
      Watson has evolved from a first-of-a-kind status, to a commercial 
      cognitive computing system. Watson has gained a 240 percent improvement 
      in system performance, and a reduction of 75 percent in the physical 
      requirements needed to run the system which can now operate from a 
      single Power 750 server with Linux and from a cloud computing 
      environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Named after IBM founder Thomas J. Watson, IBM's transformational 
      cognitive technology was developed in IBM&#8217;s Research Labs. Using 
      advances in natural language processing and analytics, Watson can 
      process information similar to the way people think, representing a 
      significant shift in the ability for organizations to quickly analyze, 
      understand and respond to vast amounts of Big Data. The ability to use 
      Watson to answer complex questions posed in natural language with speed, 
      accuracy and confidence has enormous potential to improve decision 
      making across a variety of industries from healthcare to retail, 
      telecommunications and financial services.

&lt;p&gt;LISBON/MADRID (Reuters) - When Edward Hu bought a holiday home in Portugal's most popular tourist spot in September, the Chinese agricultural entrepreneur got a Europe-wide family travel permit thrown in for as long as he owns it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's one of the biggest advantages of investing in Portugal," says Hu, 33, from Chengdu in southwest China, who paid 560,000 euros ($750,700) for a semi-detached property near the beach in the southern Algarve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beaches were once enough to lure buyers to southern Europe. A shattering economic crisis later, Spain and Portugal are trying to resurrect their moribund property markets by offering "golden" residence permits to home buyers from outside the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buyers from China, Russia, the Middle East or elsewhere who spend at least 500,000 euros on real estate in either country get a permit that lets them travel freely within Europe's 26-country Schengen zone without restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incentives, along with depressed housing prices, are showing the first signs of nibbling at the huge market glut of 3 million empty homes on the Iberian peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Portuguese government said last week that 318 permits had been issued since the program began a year ago, bringing in 200 million euros in investment - most of it in residential property in the last few months - and expected it to reach more than 300 million euros by December. That would exceed an estimated 250 million euros invested in all real estate in Portugal last year according to Cushman consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a growing interest in the golden visa program, and a lot more of it materializing in actual deals than before," said Maria Empis, a consultant at Jones Lang LaSalle real estate firm. Last month it sold a large commercial property in downtown Lisbon to a private Chinese investor seeking the permit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pine Cliffs Resort in the Algarve offers beachside apartments from 780,000 euros, stretching to villas for over 4.5 million. Sales director Karin Van Den Hemel says the number of inquiries about properties has increased substantially, particularly from those seeking a golden visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain, where the property market was bloated by a pre-2008 construction boom that turned to a 35 percent price crash, introduced a scheme similar to Portugal's last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The prime areas are Barcelona, as the city appeals to business people, and resorts like Marbella," says Christian de Meillac, who is in charge of Iberia for real estate agents Knight Frank. "What's also promising is that quite a few are buying above the minimum limit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greece has also followed Portugal's example this year, offering similar visas on 250,000 euros in property purchases, while Malta offers citizenship with investment of 650,000 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINESE, RUSSIANS TARGETED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most eager customers, real estate agents and lawyers say, are Chinese and Russians, who have been flocking to Europe for their holidays for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Spain, adverts for homes and other tourist attractions are being translated for Russian and Chinese property portals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Websites in China and Russia offering properties from 80,000 euro flats to 15 million euro villas tout Spain's and Portugal's beaches, bars and restaurants, cultural attractions and universities, plus close air links to European capitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Spaniards are very interested in selling to the Chinese. The reality is that right now in Spain they're interested in selling to whoever," said Araceli Morales from company Vender A Chinos (Sell to the Chinese), which translates adverts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese buyers are attracted by city and holiday property outside their own overpriced market, where they cannot hold land rights indefinitely, as a means to diversify their assets. They are also taking advantage of the yuan's strength against the euro, according to the Hispanic-Chinese Business Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a good choice to safeguard my investment because of the currency fluctuations," said buyer Hu. He expects the residence permit for him, his wife and his son to come before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, he plans to travel to Portugal once a year for two weeks, mostly for holidays, but hopes to start doing business in Europe, which would require more frequent trips. After six years, during which he has to spend just seven days annually in Portugal, he will be eligible for Portuguese citizenship, which Hu says is an attractive option to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have to spend a minimum of seven days in Portugal a year to qualify for permit extensions. In Spain there is no such limit, but one annual visit is compulsory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real estate agents say many Russians are interested in holiday homes to own or to rent out, while others seek peace of mind about visa-free travel or have an eye to leaving their country eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Sychov, 37, an advertising manager in Moscow, says he wants to have the chance to move to Europe should relations between the West and Russia deteriorate. He is buying a 510,000-euro beach apartment with some help from his in-laws. "One had better have a back-up plan ready," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vyacheslav Eshanu, head of PortugalEstate, a firm with offices in three Russian cities and in the Algarve, has so far struck five golden visa deals and says there is a steady demand for bargains from the Russian middle class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The golden visa seekers mostly buy just at the 500,000 euro limit. In fact, a 350,000 limit would be better," said Eshanu, adding that stories of Russians buying villas for millions in cash may be a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the golden visa law, the purchase money has to be transferred to a local bank and its origin explained to the Bank of Portugal to prevent money-laundering. Residence permits are only extended as long as property of the same value remains in the hands of the same person. Buyers also face normal local property taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAX INCENTIVES FOR PENSIONERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portugal has another trick up its sleeve to lure foreign buyers, mostly from northern Europe - tax exemptions to pensioners coming to live in Portugal, as long as their pensions are paid from a foreign source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically, it means that pensions are not taxed either in their country or here, so it's a huge benefit," said Luis Filipe Sousa, manager at PwC consultants. The firm touts Portugal's taxation for foreigners as "Europe's best-kept secret" in a brochure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the government has been shy to advertise lower taxes for foreigners while it is applying huge tax hikes and cuts in pay and pensions for its own people under the terms of its EU/IMF bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But one has to see the overall benefits; we are talking about foreigners of some means who otherwise would not come here to buy property, cars, consume, create jobs," Sousa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tax rule was formally introduced by law in 2009, but was plagued by glitches and a lack of coordination that prevented it from working properly until this year. It also offers a low 20 percent flat income tax rate to foreigners living in Portugal for up to 10 years - a similar rule to Spain's so-called "Beckham Law".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are already more than a thousand people registered under these rules in Portugal - mostly retirees from Scandinavia, France, Germany and Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it has the potential to draw thousands more," Sousa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Andrei Khalip; Editing by Alessandra Galloni and Will Waterman)&lt;/p&gt;

percent flat income tax rate to foreigners living in Portugal
for up to 10 years - a similar rule to Spain's so-called
"Beckham Law".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are already more than a thousand people registered

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Steven Donziger, the U.S. attorney accused of using bribery to secure a multibillion-dollar pollution judgment against Chevron Corp (CVX.N) in Ecuador, took the witness stand for the first time on Monday and was immediately challenged on his claim that he was not in charge of the Ecuadorean case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of pointed questions, Chevron attorney Randy Mastro sought to undermine Donziger's claim that he did not lead the legal team in Ecuador but merely offered his advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Isn't it a fact that you've described yourself as the lead lawyer?" Mastro asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At times I have, yes," Donziger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court in 2011 claiming that Donziger used fraud to obtain an $18 billion judgment - later increased to $19 billion - for a group of villagers over the contamination of an oil field in northeastern Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Ecuador's highest court cut the amount to $9.5 billion. Donziger has denied the bribery allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The start of Donziger's testimony marked the most anticipated moment since the trial began last month, with more than 70 people in a packed courtroom looking on - including the musician Sting, who with his wife, Trudie Styler, has offered support for the villagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of his defense, Donziger has downplayed his role in leading the Ecuadorean litigation. In a witness statement filed with the court, Donziger emphasized that another lawyer in Ecuador, Pablo Ferjado, was the lead attorney and that Donziger served at the pleasure of the plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I work for them; they do not work for me," Donziger testified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During 90 minutes of questioning, Mastro sought to undermine that claim, focusing on the fees Donziger stands to collect if the judgment is enforced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He asked Donziger about invoices that showed he was earning approximately $150,000 a year, while Ferjado was paid closer to $24,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But you say you work for him," Mastro said. "He doesn't work for you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes," Donziger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He must be a very generous boss," Mastro said sarcastically, earning a rebuke from the judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastro also pointed to Donziger's 2011 retainer agreement, which called for him to receive nearly one-third of any contingency fee. Even with the award slashed in half last week, his portion would still be worth $600 million, Mastro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He quoted Donziger in various documents referring to himself as the "lead lawyer," saying he had an "integral role" in shaping strategy and giving instructions to the rest of the legal team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferjado himself referred to Donziger as "cabeza," the Spanish word for head, and as "commander," though Donziger insisted the latter was a joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadorean judgment was based on contamination between 1964 and 1992 at an oil field operated by Texaco, later acquired by Chevron. Chevron claims that Texaco cleaned the site after ceasing operations and handing control of the field over to state-controlled Petroecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2011, the villagers have sought to enforce the judgment against Chevron entities in Canada, Brazil and Argentina, since Chevron no longer holds any assets in Ecuador. The company hopes a victory before Kaplan would give it ammunition to fight such efforts in foreign courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former Ecuadorean judge testified during the trial that he was paid to ghost-write orders for the judge who issued the judgment and that Donziger was aware of the scheme. The judge who released the decision, Nicolas Zambrano, denied taking bribes in his testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger is expected to continue testifying on Tuesday. Chevron previously asked Kaplan to strike large portions of Donziger's witness statement as irrelevant, a decision Kaplan has not yet made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v.

      Popeyes&#174; Louisiana Kitchen, a division of AFC Enterprises, Inc. 
      (NASDAQ:AFCE), and Coca-Cola&#174; are partnering again this holiday season 
      to introduce three NEW one-of-a-kind collector cup designs depicting 
      scenes inspired by Popeyes New Orleans-rich heritage. Coca-Cola artists 
      created custom Popeyes designs for the holiday limited edition collector 
      cups, featuring the Haddon Sundblom Santa or the gift loaded holiday 
      shopper. All three Popeyes holiday collector cups are free with any 32 
      oz. purchase and will be available through December 31, at participating 
      restaurants while supplies last.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first New-Orleans inspired design depicts Popeyes rich heritage as 
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s Sundblom Santa leads a Mardi Gras parade. The second 
      illustration features Coca-Cola&#8217;s Sundblom Santa beside a steamboat and 
      the third cup displays a holiday shopper loaded with presents within a 
      Popeyes restaurant setting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The response to last year&#8217;s holiday collector cups was overwhelmingly 
      positive and we are pleased to again partner with Coca-Cola for this 
      unique offer,&#8221; said Melanie Barichivich, Popeyes beverage brand manager. 
      &#8220;We look forward to seeing Popeyes rich New Orleans heritage paired with 
      Coca-Cola to once again spread holiday cheer this holiday season.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Popeyes holiday collector cups are made from an injected molded, 
      high-quality heavy plastic, to extend use and are dishwasher safe (top 
      rack).
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Popeyes holiday collector cups are filling kitchen cupboards nationwide 
      and are available at participating Popeyes restaurant locations while 
      supplies last. To find the Popeyes closest to you, visit us at www.popeyes.com.

      Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) has approved the supplemental New Drug Application 
      (sNDA) for XELJANZ&#174; (tofacitinib citrate) to include 
      additional Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) data in the label. These 
      additional data show improvement in patients receiving XELJANZ based on 
      health-related outcome measures reported by patients, including 
      vitality, role emotional, physical function, bodily pain, social 
      function, mental health, role physical and general health, which are the 
      eight domains of the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form (36-Item) Health 
      Survey (SF-36).&#160;XELJANZ 5 mg twice-daily (BID) was approved by the FDA 
      in November 2012 for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely 
      active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response or 
      intolerance to methotrexate (MTX), and is the first approved RA 
      treatment in the U.S. in a new class of medicines known as Janus kinase 
      (JAK) inhibitors. In the U.S., XELJANZ may be used as monotherapy or in 
      combination with MTX or other nonbiologic disease-modifying 
      antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). XELJANZ should not be used in combination 
      with biologic DMARDs or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine 
      and cyclosporine.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The patient-reported outcomes data show the impact that XELJANZ can 
      have on the daily lives of patients with RA, based on physical, mental 
      and emotional measures,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Romano, senior vice president 
      and the head of the Medicines Development Group for Pfizer Specialty 
      Care. &#8220;Following the FDA approval of XELJANZ in November 2012, we are 
      pleased with the agency&#8217;s decision to approve this sNDA and add to the 
      growing body of knowledge about XELJANZ as an additional treatment 
      option for patients with RA.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The approval of the PRO sNDA expands the U.S. label to include the 
      results of health-related outcome measures from three Phase 3 studies in 
      the XELJANZ clinical development program (ORAL Solo, Scan and Step, also 
      identified as Studies I, IV and V, respectively, in the XELJANZ label), 
      as assessed by SF-36. The expanded U.S. label now includes results 
      showing that, at three months, patients receiving XELJANZ 5 mg BID or 
      XELJANZ 10 mg BID in these studies demonstrated greater improvement from 
      baseline compared to placebo in all eight domains of the SF-36, as well 
      as the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary 
      (MCS) scores. This expands upon data already included in the U.S. label 
      at the time of FDA approval that showed XELJANZ improved physical 
      function as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability 
      Index (HAQ-DI). The U.S. label specifies that 5 mg BID is the 
      recommended dose. The 10 mg BID dose is not approved.

			About XELJANZ
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XELJANZ is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) 
      inhibitor. XELJANZ is used to treat adults with moderately to severely 
      active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not work well.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in people with 
        Hepatitis B or C.
      
			
        XELJANZ is not for people with severe liver problems.
      
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in children.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				XELJANZ can lower the ability of the immune system to fight 
        infections. Some people have serious infections while taking XELJANZ, 
        including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, 
        or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died 
        from these infections. Healthcare providers should test patients for 
        TB before starting XELJANZ, and monitor them closely for signs and 
        symptoms of TB and other infections during treatment. People should 
        not start taking XELJANZ if they have any kind of infection unless 
        their healthcare provider tells them it is okay.
			
			
				XELJANZ may increase the risk of certain cancers by changing the 
        way the immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancer can happen in 
        patients taking XELJANZ.
			
			
        Some people taking XELJANZ get tears in their stomach or intestines. 
        Patients should tell their healthcare provider right away if they have 
        fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away, or a change in 
        bowel habits.
      
			
        XELJANZ can cause changes in certain lab test results including low 
        blood cell counts, increases in certain liver tests, and increases in 
        cholesterol levels. Healthcare providers should do blood tests before 
        starting patients on XELJANZ and while they are taking XELJANZ, to 
        check for these side effects. Normal cholesterol levels are important 
        to good heart health. Healthcare providers may stop XELJANZ treatment 
        because of changes in blood cell counts or liver test results.
      
			
        Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to become 
        pregnant or are pregnant.It is not known if XELJANZ will 
        harm an unborn baby. To monitor the outcomes of pregnant women exposed 
        to XELJANZ, a registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged 
        to register patients and pregnant women are encouraged to register 
        themselves by calling 1-877-311-8972.
      
		
		
			
				&lt;p&gt;
          Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to 
          breastfeed or are breastfeeding. Patients and their healthcare 
          provider should decide if they will take XELJANZ or breastfeed. They 
          should not do both.
        &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
        In carriers of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the 
        liver), the virus may become active while using XELJANZ. Healthcare 
        providers may do blood tests for hepatitis before and during treatment 
        with XELJANZ.
      
			
        Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common 
        cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, and nasal congestion, 
        sore throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis).

			About Rheumatoid Arthritis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that 
      typically affects the hands and feet, although any joint lined by a 
      synovial membrane may be affected. RA affects approximately 1.6 million 
      Americans1,2 and 23.7 million people worldwide.3 
      Although multiple treatments are available, many patients do not 
      adequately respond. Specifically, up to one-third of patients do not 
      adequately respond, and about half stop responding to any particular 
      DMARD within five years.4,5,6,7,8,9 As a result, there 
      remains a need for additional options.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Web search giants Google and Microsoft said on Monday they will block online searches for child abuse images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's two largest search engine operators, in a rare display of unity, said as many as 100,000 search terms will now fail to produce results and trigger warnings that child abuse imagery is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child porn crackdown announced during a Internet safety summit in London came after Prime Minister David Cameron in July urged Internet firms to do more to stop access to illegal images in the wake of two high-profile child sex murders in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron said Britain's newly-established National Crime Agency is joining forces with the United States' FBI in a task force to track down these pedophiles and arrest them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He described the progress to block illegal content as "significant" but said more needed to be done to track down pedophiles using the so-called "dark web" of encrypted networks that lets people anonymously share images of child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were told that cleaning up searches couldn't be done and shouldn't be done. We're now being told by the industry that it can be done and will be done," Cameron said in a statement after the summit at his Downing Street offices, adding that Britain would hold an international summit next year to follow-up on the agreement reached on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Google and Microsoft have introduced new algorithms to prevent searches for child abuse imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt said these changes would be introduced in Britain initially and then rolled out to another 158 countries in the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said deploying technology improvements to identify and eliminate Internet content that portrays child sexual abuse was a team effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies also agreed to use their technological expertise to help in identification of abuse images and give technical support to Britain's Internet Watch Foundation and the U.S.'s National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some anti-child porn campaigners, however, argued the proposals did not go far enough and called for greater funding to wipe out sharing of child porn through peer-to-peer networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every illegal image is a crime scene but law enforcement agencies do not have the resources to identify, locate and protect every victim, nor to identify, and charge every abuser," said Martyn Thomas, chairman of the Institution of Engineering and Technology IT policy panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Belinda Goldsmith, editing by William Hardy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Nov. 18, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Computer History Museum, the world's leading institution exploring the history of computing and its ongoing impact on society, announced today the opening of its latest visitor experience: the IBM 1401 Demo Lab (Demo Lab). The Demo Lab opens to the public on Wednesday, November 20.
			
	The Demo Lab features the machine that transformed data processing and became one of the most popular computers of all time, the IBM 1401 Data Processing System (IBM 1401). Visitors to the Demo Lab will travel back in time to 1959 and experience the sights and sounds of a business computer center of the era. This exhibit accurately re-creates a working medium-scale computer operation from the 1960s, including working keypunches, printers, card readers, sorters and tape drives. 
			
	IBM 1401 was introduced in 1959, a time when the post-war population was booming and institutions and businesses from every corner of society were expanding rapidly. Traditional methods, based on punched cards and the mechanical equipment that processed them, were not keeping pace with the sheer volume and complexity of this growing world.&#160;&#160; The IBM 1401 was the perfect solution and its impact was dramatic: by 1965, nearly half of all computers in the world were IBM 1401 systems. 
			
	Two complete IBM 1401 systems, 45 and 48 years old respectively, were brought back to life by a team of 20 Museum volunteers of mostly retired IBM engineers who had earlier supported IBM 1401s in design, manufacturing, and at customer sites. The successful restoration highlights the strength of the 1401's design and the outstanding reliability of its mechanical and solid state components.&#160; The restoration team logged over 20,000 hours in 500 work sessions over 10 years.
			
	A preview opening of the Demo Lab will be held this evening for Museum trustees, volunteers, private donors and IBM executives. Live demonstrations will be staged throughout the evening and guests will hear the story of the restoration from IBM Restoration Project Lead, Robert Garner and IBM 1401 Program Manager, Chuck Branscomb, who led the IBM 1401's original development beginning in 1957. 
			
	Weekly demonstrations of the historic restored machines will be held on Wednesdays at 3 p.m.
			
	"The Demo Lab ties the past to the future by vividly illustrating how a landmark system worked in the 1960s and how far we've come as a society in 50 years of hyper-progress in computing," said John Hollar, Museum President and CEO.&#160; "We're delighted to bring this vintage, hands-on experience to the public and to use it as a jumping-off point for our extended exploration of computing's history and impact."
			
	Other demonstrated and restored projects- the DEC PDP-1 Lab, Babbage Difference Engine No. 2 and IBM Ramac Machine, are all available for demonstration at the Museum. 
			
	Funding for the IBM 1401 restoration project and Demo Lab was provided by various major donors including Gardner Hendrie and Karen Johansen, Dorrit and Grant Saviers, IBM Corporation,&#160; Robin Beresford and Robert Garner, Donna Dubinsky and Len Shustek, Jack and Casey Carsten, David E. Liddle and Ruthann Quindlen, John and Sheree Shoch, Ronald C. Crane, Bernard L. Peuto and Anne Bertaud-Peuto, Mike Cheponis, Allen and Barbara Palmer, Ron Williams, Steve Wozniak, Charles E. Branscomb and Robert and Roxanne Brubaker.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) plans to resume talks with parties interested in buying its metals warehousing business now that new exchange rules have been released, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks with potential buyers, which are largely firms based outside the United States, are not part of a formal sales process, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metro International Trading Services, which stores aluminum and other metals as part of the London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouse system, has been at the center of a controversy around Wall Street's ownership of physical commodity assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That controversy heated up after the bank was accused of boosting wait times and prices for metals consumers including makers of drink cans and cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen parties have expressed an interest in buying the business, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the talks earlier on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper said several of the potential buyers were Chinese firms, including Chinese insurer Ping An and China Minmetals.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON Nov 18 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs 
plans to resume talks with parties interested in buying its
metals warehousing business now that new exchange rules have
been released, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks with potential buyers, which are largely firms
based outside the United States, are not part of a formal sales
process, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metro International Trading Services, which stores aluminium
and other metals as part of the London Metal Exchange (LME)
warehouse system, has been at the center of a controversy around
Wall Street's ownership of physical commodity assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That controversy heated up after the bank was accused of
boosting wait times and prices for metals consumers including
makers of drink cans and cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen parties have expressed an interest in
buying the business, according to the Financial Times, which
first reported the talks earlier on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper said several of the potential buyers were Chinese
firms, including Chinese insurer Ping An and China Minmetals.
Brazilian bank Grupo BTG Pactual SA is also actively
looking at warehouse assets, trade and industry sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman looked at a possible sale of Metro earlier this year
 but put those efforts on hold while the LME
reviewed the rules governing warehouses. The exchange earlier
this month proposed new rules to crack down on the wait times
for metals delivery, providing more clarity for warehouse
owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve announced a review of Wall Street's role
in physical commodities trading in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has recently insisted it remains committed to its
commodities businesses even as rivals, including JPMorgan
, have announced they are selling assets and exiting
physical trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fed Vice Chairman Janet Yellen, speaking last week at a
Senate hearing on her nomination to become chairman of the
central bank, said for the first time that the Fed may create
new rules as part of its review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory and legal experts say the most likely target is
the banks' direct ownership of warehouses, power plants, oil
storage tanks and other infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has said that Metro was bought under a "private
equity exemption" that would allow the bank to own the business
for up to 10 years as long as it operates at arm's length from
its commodities traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fed-regulated banks are generally barred from owning
physical assets such as warehouses and pipelines, but Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley have said they have the right to
retain businesses they operated prior to converting to
commercial banks at the peak of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank bought Metro in 2010 for around $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Changes in Britain first, then global rollout&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* UK Prime Minister Cameron urges action on "dark web"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* FBI and British police to work together&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Belinda Goldsmith&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Web search giants Google and
Microsoft said on Monday they will block online searches for
child abuse images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's two largest search engine operators, in a rare
display of unity, said as many as 100,000 search terms will now
fail to produce results and trigger warnings that child abuse
imagery is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child porn crackdown announced during a Internet safety
summit in London came after Prime Minister David Cameron in July
urged Internet firms to do more to stop access to illegal images
in the wake of two high-profile child sex murders in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron said Britain's newly-established National Crime
Agency is joining forces with the United States' FBI in a task
force to track down these paedophiles and arrest them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He described the progress to block illegal content as
"significant" but said more needed to be done to track down
paedophiles using the so-called "dark web" of encrypted networks
that lets people anonymously share images of child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were told that cleaning up searches couldn't be done and
shouldn't be done. We're now being told by the industry that it
can be done and will be done," Cameron said in a statement after
the summit at his Downing Street offices, adding that Britain
would hold an international summit next year to follow-up on the
agreement reached on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Google and Microsoft have introduced
new algorithms to prevent searches for child abuse imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt said these changes
would be introduced in Britain initially and then rolled out to
another 158 countries in the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said deploying
technology improvements to identify and eliminate Internet
content that portrays child sexual abuse was a team effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies also agreed to use their technological
expertise to help in identification of abuse images and give
technical support to Britain's Internet Watch Foundation and the
U.S.'s National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some anti-child porn campaigners, however, argued the
proposals did not go far enough and called for greater funding
to wipe out sharing of child porn through peer-to-peer networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every illegal image is a crime scene but law enforcement
agencies do not have the resources to identify, locate and
protect every victim, nor to identify, and charge every abuser,"
said Martyn Thomas, chairman of the Institution of Engineering
and Technology IT policy panel.&lt;/p&gt;

			Self Service Approach Leverages Office 365 and SQL for 
      Line-of-Business Data Analysis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MPS Partners is excited to announce the first solution accelerator for 
      Microsoft Power BI for Office 365. MPS Partners leveraged their deep 
      functional and technical expertise in ERP and CRM to create reusable 
      templates to quickly and easily deploy solutions for Spend Analytics and 
      Daily Sales. These new solutions leverage the SQL Server Tabular model 
      and Power BI for Office 365 features to provide self-service analytics 
      with the familiarity of Microsoft Office and the power of the cloud for 
      on-premises line-of-business data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Until now our clients have had limited options deploying true business 
      intelligence and analytics solutions when running Office 365. Power BI 
      offers Office 365 customers a tremendous step forward,&#8221; said Naresh 
      Koka, Vice President at MPS Partners. &#8220;The way users are consuming and 
      collaborating on data is changing and it&#8217;s setting new expectations. Not 
      only do our accelerators offer organizations to extend their existing 
      on-premise data warehouses and operational systems to the cloud but also 
      delivers HTML5 options that enable delivery of self-service analytics to 
      any device anywhere.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the last 24 months Microsoft has continued to push the envelope for 
      business intelligence and analytics starting with the SQL Server 2012 
      release, Power View, Power Query and Power Map. Adding to this trend is 
      the recent release of the Power BI preview.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MPS Partners has a strong history with the Microsoft reporting and 
      analytics solution options and is committed to expanding current 
      templates and other core business functions to further support customer 
      needs in Spend Analytics and Daily Sales reporting.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields could surge to nearly 4 percent next year once the Federal Reserve scales back asset purchases although that should not stifle economic recovery, Goldman Sachs Asset Management says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are a bit bearish on Treasuries ... We would expect to see 10-year Treasuries probably to be about 100 bps higher a year from now," Andrew Wilson, Chief Executive of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in London on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such an increase was "not priced in" to market consensus and exceeds levels in futures markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten-year yields, currently trading at around 2.7 percent, could even hit 4 percent, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed is buying bonds at a pace of $85 billion per month while promising to hold interest rates near zero, at least until unemployment hits a threshold of 6.5 percent, providing the outlook for inflation stays below 2.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, officials have signaled they would like to start scaling back asset purchases, also called quantitative easing, when this is warranted by stronger data on growth and hiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has raised concerns of a knock-on impact on other markets around the world, particularly in some developing markets where asset price rises have been bolstered by extra liquidity provided by the U.S. stimulus program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson, however, said that while retail investors appear to be pulling money out of emerging markets and repatriating it to take advantage of higher U.S. yields, institutional investors were putting money back in emerging markets that have close economic links to the United States such as Mexico that will benefit from U.S. economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we've seen is institutional inflow into emerging markets. Six months ago institutional investors were very interested in emerging markets but were still wary," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been less interest in emerging markets exposed to languid European economies such as Turkey, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' asset management arm had seen institutional investors pour up to $4 billion into emerging markets fixed income funds in the last six months, according to Wilson, who is also co-head of fixed income at the asset manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO DEFLATION IN EUROPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth in Europe was likely to remain "anemic" for some time to come, Wilson said, so monetary policy from the European Central Bank would remain accommodative and at odds with the tightening currently on the agenda in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The European recovery looks very fragile, maybe around 1 percent growth in 2014. Given that environment the European Central Bank ideally needs to keep rates low," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson played down fears of Japanese-style deflation in Europe, despite falling inflation rates in markets such as Spain where consumer prices are rising at their slowest rate in four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't think deflation is necessarily likely but we'll see disinflation with inflation rates remaining at very, very low levels," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For more summit stories, see ID:nL5N0J32AE]) (For other news from Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit, click here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Susan Fenton)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Companies Tap GPU-Enabled Supercomputing to Analyze Enterprise Data on the Fly&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;DENVER, CO--(Marketwired - Nov 18, 2013) -  SC13 -&#160;NVIDIA and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced plans to collaborate on GPU-accelerated versions of IBM's wide portfolio of enterprise software applications on IBM Power Systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move marks the first time that GPU accelerator technology will move beyond the realm of supercomputing and into the heart of enterprise-scale data centers. The collaboration aims to enable IBM customers to more rapidly process, secure and analyze massive volumes of streaming data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Companies are looking for new and more efficient ways to drive business value from Big Data and analytics," said Tom Rosamilia, senior vice president, IBM Systems  Technology Group and Integrated Supply Chain. "The combination of IBM and NVIDIA processor technologies can provide clients with an advanced and efficient foundation to achieve this goal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies to Integrate POWER Processor, Tesla GPUs
				NVIDIA and IBM also plan to integrate the joint-processing capabilities of NVIDIA&#174; Tesla&#174; GPUs with IBM POWER processors. The move makes it easier and more efficient for a wider range of companies to employ a style of supercomputing hardware used primarily by the scientific and technical communities for computing tasks like space exploration, decoding the human genome and speeding new products to market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining IBM POWER8 CPUs with the world's highest-performance and most energy-efficient GPU accelerators, the companies aim to deliver a new class of technology that maximizes performance and efficiency for all types of scientific, engineering, big data analytics and other high performance computing (HPC) workloads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This partnership will bring supercomputer performance to the corporate data center, expanding the use of GPU accelerators well beyond the traditional supercomputing and technical computing markets," said Ian Buck, vice president of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. "It will also provide existing supercomputing and high performance computing customers with new choices and technologies to build powerful, energy-efficient systems that drive innovation and scientific discovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM Power Systems will fully support existing scientific, engineering and visualization applications developed with the NVIDIA CUDA&#174; programming model, allowing supercomputing centers and HPC customers to immediately take advantage of groundbreaking performance advantages. IBM also plans to make its Rational brand of enterprise software development tools available to supercomputing developers, making it easier for programmers to develop cutting-edge applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership between NVIDIA and IBM builds on the August announcement of the OpenPOWER Consortium, in which IBM, NVIDIA, Google, Mellanox and Tyan aim to establish an open ecosystem based on IBM's POWER architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About NVIDIA Tesla GPU Accelerators
				NVIDIA Tesla GPUs are massively parallel accelerators based on the NVIDIA CUDA parallel computing platform and programming model. Tesla GPUs are designed from the ground up for power-efficient, high performance computing, computational science and supercomputing, delivering dramatically higher application acceleration for a range of scientific and commercial applications than a CPU-only approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about CUDA or download the latest version, visit the CUDA website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Keep Current on NVIDIA: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			AppZero Collaborates with Microsoft to Support Windows Server 
      Modernization
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Collaboration helps enterprises adopt and realize the benefits of 
      Windows Server 2012 and Windows Azure
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AppZero, a fast, more flexible way to move server applications, 
      announced today a collaboration with Microsoft in which Microsoft is 
      recommending AppZero for moving a variety of applications from Windows 
      Server 2003, which reaches the end of extended support in July, 2015, to 
      Microsoft&#8217;s newer operating systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The collaboration will help educate Systems Integrators and enterprises 
      about the benefits of Windows Server 2012, Windows Server Hyper-V, and 
      Windows Azure. AppZero extracts existing applications, leaving the 
      operating system behind, and migrates the applications to a new machine. 
      Many applications can be moved without code changes from older operating 
      systems to Windows Server 2012 and Windows Azure with AppZero&#8217;s 
      enterprise migration tool. AppZero will be providing support for Windows 
      Server 2012 R2 by the end of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Windows Server 2012 and Windows Azure deliver a consistent platform 
      across on-premises, service provider clouds, and the public cloud,&#8221; said 
      Brian Hillger, Director of Product Marketing, Microsoft. &#8220;We are pleased 
      to work with AppZero to help our customers take advantage of the 
      advanced capabilities of Windows Server 2012 across virtualization, 
      networking, and storage, as well as the openness, scalability, and 
      flexibility provided by Windows Azure.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As Windows Server 2003 approaches the end of extended support, many 
      enterprises will want to move to a newer version of the Windows Server 
      operating system (Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2012). Some 
      enterprises may seek to modernize and move to Windows Azure at the same 
      time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are uniquely positioned to help Microsoft customers migrate to a 
      newer operating system because our technology separates the application 
      from the operating system and moves only the application and its data,&#8221; 
      said Greg O&#8217;Connor, AppZero CEO. &#8220;Other approaches move the whole 
      machine, which won&#8217;t work if you&#8217;re moving to a newer OS.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			AppZero 
      is the fast, flexible way to move server applications to and across any 
      cloud or datacenter, without code change or lock-in. Encapsulating 
      Windows applications in VM/OS-free packages; AppZero&#8217;s patented software 
      moves complex server applications with ease. AppZero lets you modernize 
      your infrastructure, moving from an old OS to a newer one with the click 
      of a button - modernize and move to the cloud in one step. For more

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 18 (Reuters) - Google and Microsoft unveiled
measures to block online searches for child sex abuse images on
Monday as part of a bid by British authorities to crackdown on
Internet paedophiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies said as many as 100,000 search terms will now
fail to produce results and trigger warnings that child abuse
imagery is illegal while offering advice on where to get help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's two largest search engine operators' move was a
rare display of unity ahead of an Internet safety summit on
Monday hosted by Prime Minister David Cameron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron welcomed the progress to block illegal content but
said far more still needed to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If more isn't done to stop illegal child abuse content
being found, we will do what is necessary to protect our
children," he tweeted ahead of the summit that will announce a
new trans-Atlantic task force to tackle online child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summit comes after Cameron this summer called on
Internet firms to do more to stop access to illegal images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now both companies have introduced new algorithms that will
prevent searches for child abuse imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt wrote in
Britain's Daily Mail newspaper that these changes had cleaned up
the results for over 100,000 queries that might be related to
the sexual abuse of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As important, we will soon roll out these changes in more
than 150 languages, so the impact will be truly global," he
wrote, adding the restrictions would be launched in Britain
first then expanded to other languages in the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Google and Microsoft, who were due to join
other Internet companies at the summit on Monday, have also
agreed to use their technological expertise to help in the
identification of abuse images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schmidt said Google planned to provide engineers to give
technical support to the Internet Watch Foundation in Britain
and the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,
and to fund internships for engineers at these organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative parliamentarian Claire Perry, who is Cameron's
adviser on childhood, said British and U.S. law enforcement
agencies would back up this effort by tracking paedophiles using
the "hidden Internet" or so-called "dark web" of encrypted
networks to distribute images of child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;SPYRUS WorkSafe Transforms Almost Any BYOD PC Into a Trustworthy Workspace&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwired - Nov 18, 2013) -  SPYRUS today announced the availability of the SPYRUS WorkSafe and WorkSafe Pro portable SSD live drives for Windows To Go built using the Windows 8.1 update. WorkSafe transforms almost any PC into trustworthy workspaces. SPYRUS live drives embed hardware smart cards to provide tamper-proof digital certificates for authentication and encryption. These highly secure bootable devices defend the operating system, documents, and identity credentials from tampering and theft with layered hardware and software encryption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WorkSafe live drives provide a true, American-made, trusted end point for secure network access and simultaneously protect enterprise networks with multi-factor authentication using smart card digital certificates. Enterprises can leverage their investment in public key and smart card infrastructures, extending their trusted foundation for smart card login, VPN access, secure email, and authenticated online collaboration. A SPYRUS ToughBoot&#8482; loader digitally signed by Microsoft mitigates against hacking attacks during the boot sequence when using UEFI Secure Boot available on newer computers. If any tampering or malfunction of hardware or firmware is detected, the boot process will not continue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Users can enjoy the enterprise benefits of Windows 8.1 and the freedom of a pocket-sized device with the SPYRUS secure Microsoft certified Windows To Go drives," said Stella Chernyak, senior director, Windows product marketing, Microsoft Corp.&#160;"The new multifactor authentication built into the SPYRUS WorkSafe live drives makes it ideal for secure, authenticated access to corporate networks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SPYRUS Rosetta smart card designed into the WorkSafe product line provides additional security services for strong encryption with authentication, non-repudiation, and auditing capabilities. Enhanced algorithm support for the future includes elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), making the WorkSafe drive an economical protected desktop for enterprise customers. WorkSafe live drives support ECC using high-strength P-256, P-384, and P-521 curves and the EC Diffie-Hellman key establishment schemes in accordance with NIST SP 800-56 Key Establishment Guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WorkSafe PKI feature uses the latest approaches to random number and key generation. A true hardware-based random-number generator (RNG) is extensively filtered and tested, and then used to seed an approved high-strength, hash-based algorithm. RSA keys are generated in accordance with the latest X9.31 specification, as required for FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certification. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WorkSafe PKI feature, with the SPYRUS Minidriver to manage digital signatures, allows the enterprise to perform standard smart card security functions such as encrypted email, multi-factor authentication, smart card logon, and VPN access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of the Microsoft public key, smart card-enabled echo system, and SPYRUS security applications provides for a true end-to-end security approach for extending the enterprise smart card and PKI infrastructure to mobile users. The SEMS device management system allows enterprise administrators to register, block/unblock, revoke, set policies, audit, and "kill" the SPYRUS WorkSafe products from a central location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Technical leadership, hardware security, onboard FIPS 140-2 Level 3 PKI capabilities, ultra-high performance, and the new features of Windows 8.1 make the SPYRUS WorkSafe live drives the choice for a Windows To Go platform," said Tom Dickens, COO SPYRUS. "By using WorkSafe drives, corporations may finally realize significant cost savings by repurposing employee owned or corporate legacy computers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPYRUS WorkSafe live drives and other Secured by SPYRUS&#8482; USB encryption drives can be ordered immediately from SPYRUS and its resellers.

			JPMorgan Chase Reaches an Agreement with 21 Institutional Investors 
      to Resolve Repurchase and Servicing Claims
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. has reached a $4.5 billion agreement with 21 major 
      institutional investors, represented by Gibbs  Bruns LLP, to make a 
      binding offer to the trustees of 330 residential mortgage-backed 
      securities (RMBS) trusts issued by J.P. Morgan, Chase, and Bear Stearns.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This settlement is another important step in J.P. Morgan&#8217;s efforts to 
      resolve legacy related RMBS matters. The firm believes it is 
      appropriately reserved for this and any remaining RMBS litigation 
      matters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As agreed in today&#8217;s settlement, the institutional investors have 
      committed to support the settlement and have requested that the trustees 
      accept the settlement offer. The offer, which the trustees may seek 
      court approval for, would resolve all representation and warranty claims 
      as well as servicing claims on all trusts issued by J.P. Morgan, Chase 
      and Bear Stearns between 2005 and 2008. While this agreement would 
      resolve representation and warranty claims as well as servicing claims 
      facing the firm with respect to J.P. Morgan, Chase and Bear Stearns 
      trusts, it does not resolve claims on trusts issued by Washington Mutual.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The offer will remain open until January 15, 2014, but may be extended 
      pursuant to its terms for an additional sixty days. It includes the 
      following key terms:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Andrei Khalip and Clare Kane&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LISBON/MADRID Nov 17 (Reuters) - When Edward Hu bought a
holiday home in Portugal's most popular tourist spot in
September, the Chinese agricultural entrepreneur got a
Europe-wide family travel permit thrown in for as long as he
owns it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's one of the biggest advantages of investing in
Portugal," says Hu, 33, from Chengdu in southwest China, who
paid 560,000 euros ($750,700) for a semi-detached property near
the beach in the southern Algarve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beaches were once enough to lure buyers to southern
Europe. A shattering economic crisis later, Spain and Portugal
are trying to resurrect their moribund property markets by
offering "golden" residence permits to home buyers from outside
the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buyers from China, Russia, the Middle East or elsewhere who
spend at least 500,000 euros on real estate in either country
get a permit that lets them travel freely within Europe's
26-country Schengen zone without restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incentives, along with depressed housing prices, are
showing the first signs of nibbling at the huge market glut of 3
million empty homes on the Iberian peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Portuguese government said last week that 318 permits
had been issued since the programme began a year ago, bringing
in 200 million euros in investment - most of it in residential
property in the last few months - and expected it to reach more
than 300 million euros by December. That would exceed an
estimated 250 million euros invested in all real estate in
Portugal last year according to Cushman consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a growing interest in the golden visa programme,
and a lot more of it materialising in actual deals than before,"
said Maria Empis, a consultant at Jones Lang LaSalle real estate
firm. Last month it sold a large commercial property in downtown
Lisbon to a private Chinese investor seeking the permit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pine Cliffs Resort in the Algarve offers beachside
apartments from 780,000 euros, stretching to villas for over 4.5
million. Sales director Karin Van Den Hemel says the number of
inquiries about properties has increased substantially,
particularly from those seeking a golden visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain, where the property market was bloated by a pre-2008
construction boom that turned to a 35 percent price crash,
introduced a scheme similar to Portugal's last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The prime areas are Barcelona, as the city appeals to
business people, and resorts like Marbella," says Christian de
Meillac, who is in charge of Iberia for real estate agents
Knight Frank. "What's also promising is that quite a few are
buying above the minimum limit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greece has also followed Portugal's example this year,
offering similar visas on 250,000 euros in property purchases,
while Malta offers citizenship with investment of 650,000 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINESE, RUSSIANS TARGETED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most eager customers, real estate agents and lawyers
say, are Chinese and Russians, who have been flocking to Europe
for their holidays for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Spain, adverts for homes and other tourist attractions
are being translated for Russian and Chinese property portals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Websites in China and Russia offering properties from 80,000
euro flats to 15 million euro villas tout Spain's and Portugal's
beaches, bars and restaurants, cultural attractions and
universities, plus close air links to European capitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Spaniards are very interested in selling to the Chinese.
The reality is that right now in Spain they're interested in
selling to whoever," said Araceli Morales from company Vender A
Chinos (Sell to the Chinese), which translates adverts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese buyers are attracted by city and holiday property
outside their own overpriced market, where they cannot hold land
rights indefinitely, as a means to diversify their assets. They
are also taking advantage of the yuan's strength against the
euro, according to the Hispanic-Chinese Business Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a good choice to safeguard my investment because of
the currency fluctuations," said buyer Hu. He expects the
residence permit for him, his wife and his son to come before
the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, he plans to travel to Portugal once a year for two
weeks, mostly for holidays, but hopes to start doing business in
Europe, which would require more frequent trips. After six
years, during which he has to spend just seven days annually in
Portugal, he will be eligible for Portuguese citizenship, which
Hu says is an attractive option to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have to spend a minimum of seven days in Portugal
a year to qualify for permit extensions. In Spain there is no
such limit, but one annual visit is compulsory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real estate agents say many Russians are interested in
holiday homes to own or to rent out, while others seek peace of
mind about visa-free travel or have an eye to leaving their
country eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Sychov, 37, an advertising manager in Moscow, says
he wants to have the chance to move to Europe should relations
between the West and Russia deteriorate. He is buying a
510,000-euro beach apartment with some help from his in-laws.
"One had better have a back-up plan ready," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vyacheslav Eshanu, head of PortugalEstate, a firm with
offices in three Russian cities and in the Algarve, has so far
struck five golden visa deals and says there is a steady demand
for bargains from the Russian middle class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The golden visa seekers mostly buy just at the 500,000 euro
limit. In fact, a 350,000 limit would be better," said Eshanu,
adding that stories of Russians buying villas for millions in
cash may be a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the golden visa law, the purchase money has to be
transferred to a local bank and its origin explained to the Bank
of Portugal to prevent money-laundering. Residence permits are
only extended as long as property of the same value remains in
the hands of the same person. Buyers also face normal local
property taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAX INCENTIVES FOR PENSIONERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portugal has another trick up its sleeve to lure foreign
buyers, mostly from northern Europe - tax exemptions to
pensioners coming to live in Portugal, as long as their pensions
are paid from a foreign source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically, it means that pensions are not taxed either in
their country or here, so it's a huge benefit," said Luis Filipe
Sousa, manager at PwC consultants. The firm touts Portugal's
taxation for foreigners as "Europe's best-kept secret" in a
brochure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the government has been shy to advertise lower taxes
for foreigners while it is applying huge tax hikes and cuts in
pay and pensions for its own people under the terms of its
EU/IMF bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But one has to see the overall benefits; we are talking
about foreigners of some means who otherwise would not come here
to buy property, cars, consume, create jobs," Sousa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tax rule was formally introduced by law in 2009, but was
plagued by glitches and a lack of coordination that prevented it
from working properly until this year. It also offers a low 20
percent flat income tax rate to foreigners living in Portugal
for up to 10 years - a similar rule to Spain's so-called
"Beckham Law".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are already more than a thousand people registered
under these rules in Portugal - mostly retirees from
Scandinavia, France, Germany and Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it has the potential to draw thousands more," Sousa
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In late September, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon walked into the office of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're willing to take our lumps," he said, according to a person briefed on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't think there were serious mistakes made," he added, in a meeting he had requested with Holder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan finally took its punishment on Tuesday, agreeing to a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government to settle charges that the bank overstated the quality of mortgages it was selling to investors in the run-up to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice trumpeted its settlement as a big step toward holding banks accountable for their behavior before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavior that the largest U.S. bank admitted to, authorities said, is at the heart of what inflated the housing bubble: lenders making bad mortgages and selling them to investors who thought they were relatively safe. When the loans started turning bad, investors lost faith in the banking system, and a housing crisis turned into a financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department said in its statement that JPMorgan acknowledged it had regularly and knowingly sold mortgages to investors that should have never been sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But JPMorgan's Chief Financial Officer, speaking on a conference call, said the bank had not admitted to violating any laws. CFO Marianne Lake added that the facts the bank admitted to did not leave it vulnerable in other litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the bank and the government did not agree about what they had agreed to in the settlement, capping weeks of squabbling over the terms of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At issue in Tuesday's settlement was the long chain of companies between lenders giving mortgages to consumers during the mortgage bubble and the investors that ultimately forked over the money to fund the loans. Often smaller lenders would make subprime mortgage loans, and sell them to a bank, which would package loans into bonds, and in turn sell them to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many middlemen, investors had poor information about what they were buying, and capital flowed to loans that arguably should never have been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the air hissed out of the U.S. mortgage market, investors said they were gulled, and that the mortgages they bought were not good enough in the first place to have been sold. Banks for their part have said that mortgages failed not because they failed to meet investors' stated standards, but because the housing market as a whole headed south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it has set aside the funds it needs to cover the settlement, meaning the deal will have no impact on its future earnings. The deal resolves most of its mortgage issues with federal authorities, the bank said. JPMorgan's shares rose 0.7 percent to close at $56.15 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The civil settlement marks the end of weeks of tense negotiations between JPMorgan Chase, which is looking to move past the legal issues that have plagued it for more than a year, and the U.S. government, which is under pressure to hold banks accountable for behavior that led to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even after the settlement, the bank faces at least nine other government probes, covering everything from its hiring practices in China to whether it manipulated the Libor benchmark interest rate. It may still also face criminal charges linked to mortgage matters. Dimon avoided the worst pitfalls of the financial crisis, but now is discovering he did not avoid all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BREAKING IT DOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government called the settlement the largest in U.S. history, but the deal is really several rolled into one. It includes a $4 billion consumer relief package, and a $4 billion settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees government mortgage financing companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the $4 billion consumer relief package, at least $1.5 billion will go toward loans the bank is forgiving. As much as $500 million will go to change the terms of loans to lower monthly payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining $2 billion will be for assorted purposes, including new loans for low- and moderate-income borrowers in areas that have been hard-hit by the housing crisis and for demolition of abandoned homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the $13 billion settlement, $4 billion is for the consumer relief package, $4 billion is for the FHFA deal, and $5 billion is for a civil penalty to the Justice Department and claims from other state and federal government entities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After taxes, the settlement should cost JPMorgan about $9 billion, because about $11 billion of the settlement is tax deductible, said Gregg Polsky, a law professor at the University of North Carolina. The bank said last month it had set aside $23 billion to cover litigation expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE COMING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan admitted that it told investors the loans it was selling them met particular standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside firms that reviewed some of the loans for JPMorgan in 2006 and 2007 told bank employees that 27 percent of the mortgages did not meet underwriting guidelines. One employee expressed concerns about loans to another employee, the bank said in its statement of facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank and the Justice Department differed regarding how to interpret the statement of facts that the parties had agreed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person involved in the JPMorgan negotiations said that the pattern of bad mortgages being packaged and sold to investors was spread throughout the banking industry. He noted that the bad deals in question were created not only by JPMorgan, but also by two failed banks it took over during the financial crisis, namely Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now, the banks all are holding their breath," said James D. Cox, a law professor at Duke University who specializes in corporate and securities law. "They understand it means a big number for them as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a call with analysts, when asked why the Department of Justice acted first on JPMorgan, Dimon said: "You've got to ask them ... It could have been somebody else. There was going to be a first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and government agencies reached a tentative agreement in mid-October and have been hammering out details since then. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was also involved in discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's negotiations with the Justice Department began in earnest last spring, after Justice Department lawyers in California preliminarily concluded that the bank had violated U.S. civil laws. The Justice Department had looked into mortgage bonds the bank sold from 2005 through 2007, the company said in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks went sour, and government lawyers prepared to file a lawsuit against JPMorgan in September and scheduled a news conference to announce it. But they canceled it at the last minute as JPMorgan reached out to government officials to discuss a settlement. That effort to restart talks resulted in JPMorgan's Dimon meeting U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiations were difficult, people involved in the matter said.

&lt;p&gt;* Relates to charges the bank overstated mortgage quality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan says did not admit to violating any laws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Funds already set aside; share price rises&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Karen Freifeld, Aruna Viswanatha and David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - In late September,
JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon walked into the office of
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're willing to take our lumps," he said, according to a
person briefed on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't think there were serious mistakes made," he added,
in a meeting he had requested with Holder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan finally took its punishment on Tuesday, agreeing to
a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government to settle
charges that the bank overstated the quality of mortgages it was
selling to investors in the run-up to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice trumpeted its settlement as a big
step toward holding banks accountable for their behavior before
the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavior that the largest U.S. bank admitted to,
authorities said, is at the heart of what inflated the housing
bubble: lenders making bad mortgages and selling them to
investors who thought they were relatively safe. When the loans
started turning bad, investors lost faith in the banking system,
and a housing crisis turned into a financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department said in its statement that JPMorgan
acknowledged it had regularly and knowingly sold mortgages to
investors that should have never been sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But JPMorgan's Chief Financial Officer, speaking on a
conference call, said the bank had not admitted to violating any
laws. CFO Marianne Lake added that the facts the bank admitted
to did not leave it vulnerable in other litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the bank and the government did not agree
about what they had agreed to in the settlement, capping weeks
of squabbling over the terms of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At issue in Tuesday's settlement was the long chain of
companies between lenders giving mortgages to consumers during
the mortgage bubble and the investors that ultimately forked
over the money to fund the loans. Often smaller lenders would
make subprime mortgage loans, and sell them to a bank, which
would package loans into bonds, and in turn sell them to
investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many middlemen, investors had poor information about
what they were buying, and capital flowed to loans that arguably
should never have been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the air hissed out of the U.S. mortgage market,
investors said they were gulled, and that the mortgages they
bought were not good enough in the first place to have been
sold. Banks for their part have said that mortgages failed not
because they failed to meet investors' stated standards, but
because the housing market as a whole headed south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it has set aside the funds it needs to cover
the settlement, meaning the deal will have no impact on its
future earnings. The deal resolves most of its mortgage issues
with federal authorities, the bank said. JPMorgan's shares rose
0.7 percent to close at $56.15 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The civil settlement marks the end of weeks of tense
negotiations between JPMorgan Chase, which is looking to move
past the legal issues that have plagued it for more than a year,
and the U.S. government, which is under pressure to hold banks
accountable for behavior that led to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even after the settlement, the bank faces at least nine
other government probes, covering everything from its hiring
practices in China to whether it manipulated the Libor benchmark
interest rate. It may still also face criminal charges linked to
mortgage matters. Dimon avoided the worst pitfalls of the
financial crisis, but now is discovering he did not avoid all of
them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BREAKING IT DOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government called the settlement the largest in U.S.
history, but the deal is really several rolled into one. It
includes a $4 billion consumer relief package, and a $4 billion
settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which
oversees government mortgage financing companies Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the $4 billion consumer relief package, at least $1.5
billion will go toward loans the bank is forgiving. As much as
$500 million will go to change the terms of loans to lower
monthly payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining $2 billion will be for assorted purposes,
including new loans for low- and moderate-income borrowers in
areas that have been hard-hit by the housing crisis and for
demolition of abandoned homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the $13 billion settlement, $4 billion is for the
consumer relief package, $4 billion is for the FHFA deal, and $5
billion is for a civil penalty to the Justice Department and
claims from other state and federal government entities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After taxes, the settlement should cost JPMorgan about $9
billion, because about $11 billion of the settlement is tax
deductible, said Gregg Polsky, a law professor at the University
of North Carolina. The bank said last month it had set aside $23
billion to cover litigation expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE COMING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan admitted that it told investors the loans it was
selling them met particular standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside firms that reviewed some of the loans for JPMorgan
in 2006 and 2007 told bank employees that 27 percent of the
mortgages did not meet underwriting guidelines. One employee
expressed concerns about loans to another employee, the bank
said in its statement of facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank and the Justice Department differed regarding how
to interpret the statement of facts that the parties had agreed
to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person involved in the JPMorgan negotiations said that the
pattern of bad mortgages being packaged and sold to investors
was spread throughout the banking industry. He noted that the
bad deals in question were created not only by JPMorgan, but
also by two failed banks it took over during the financial
crisis, namely Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now, the banks all are holding their breath," said
James D. Cox, a law professor at Duke University  who
specializes in corporate and securities law. "They understand it
means a big number for them as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a call with analysts, when asked why the Department of
Justice acted first on JPMorgan, Dimon said: "You've got to ask
them ... It could have been somebody else. There was going to be
a first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and government agencies reached a tentative
agreement in mid-October and have been hammering out details
since then. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was also
involved in discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's negotiations with the Justice Department began in
earnest last spring, after Justice Department lawyers in
California preliminarily concluded that the bank had violated
U.S. civil laws. The Justice Department had looked into mortgage
bonds the bank sold from 2005 through 2007, the company said in
August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks went sour, and government lawyers prepared to file
a lawsuit against JPMorgan in September and scheduled a news
conference to announce it. But they canceled it at the last
minute as JPMorgan reached out to government officials to
discuss a settlement. That effort to restart talks resulted in
JPMorgan's Dimon meeting U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiations were difficult, people involved in the matter
said. Parties joined the talks, then dropped out. In recent
weeks, they stopped, only to restart. Details of the deal were
being worked out hours before it was announced on Tuesday, said
two people involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's general counsel, Stephen Cutler, and Associate
Attorney General Tony West were critical in negotiating the
deal, sources said. Cutler was previously director of
enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement is the most significant action to come out of
a task force the Obama administration created in January 2012,
years after the height of the financial crisis, to probe the
packaging and sale of shoddy home loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers and others have been critical of the
administration's failure to hold Wall Street banks, executives,
and other parties accountable for the excesses that resulted in
the housing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task force included representatives from the Justice
Department, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the
New York State Attorney General, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's settlement was with the Department of Justice,
several state Attorneys General, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp, the National Credit Union Administration, and the FHFA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Nov 19 (Reuters) - Diane Disney Miller,
philanthropist and daughter of cartoon and theme park pioneer
Walt Disney, died on Tuesday in California. She was 79.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller died in the northern California wine town of Napa
from injuries sustained in a fall, the Walt Disney Family Museum
in San Francisco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said
the entertainment group founded by brothers Walt and Roy Disney
in 1923 was "deeply saddened by the loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the beloved daughter of Walt Disney and one of his
inspirations for creating Disneyland, she holds a special place
in the history of the Walt Disney Company and in the hearts of
fans everywhere," Iger said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Miller was born in 1933 and married professional
football player Ron Miller in 1954. He went on to serve as the
company's president in 1978 and chief executive a few years
later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ron Miller was ousted from the company in 1984, paving the
way for the new executive team of Michael Eisner, Jeffrey
Katzenberg and Frank Wells, who helped transform a sleepy theme
park and animation company into a entertainment powerhouse with
hit movies, TV shows and new theme park attractions in Orlando,
Florida, and Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple purchased a vineyard in Napa Valley in 1976 and
have operated a collection of vineyards under the name Silverado
Vineyards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was also instrumental in the construction of the Walt
Disney Concert Hall, the musical venue designed by architect
Frank Gehry in downtown Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller's adopted sister, Sharon Mae Disney, died in 1993. 
In addition to her husband, she is survived by seven children,
13 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.&lt;/p&gt;

			NAFCU Commends NCUA&#8217;s Record Recovery of $1.4 Billion in JPMorgan 
      Settlement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      National Association of Federal Credit Unions (NAFCU) President and CEO 
      Dan Berger today hailed the National Credit Union Administration&#8217;s 
      (NCUA) announcement today that the agency will receive $1.417 billion 
      from JPMorgan Chase in recompense for losses to corporate credit unions. 
      Berger said this comes close to covering all remaining corporate 
      stabilization costs and if possible, NCUA should halt stabilization 
      assessments on insured credit unions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We applaud NCUA&#8217;s persistence in seeking recoveries on the sale of 
      faulty securities that led to the downfall of five corporate credit 
      unions,&#8221; said Berger. &#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement by NCUA is a momentous one, 
      representing the first significant financial relief for credit unions 
      that have been operating under the weight of corporate stabilization 
      since 2009. We appreciate NCUA&#8217;s dogged pursuit of the recoveries it has 
      made thus far, and we strongly encourage the agency to take a close look 
      at these recoveries and consider returning any excess received to 
      insured credit unions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      He added, &#8220;This will be an enormous boost for many Main Street credit 
      unions that were struggling under the continuing burden of corporate 
      stabilization assessments. When credit unions can continue to serve 
      their members with low-cost, low-fee products and services, we all win.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      NCUA is receiving the funds as part of a settlement involving JPMorgan 
      Chase for a wide range of activities undertaken during the housing 
      downturn, including the sale to corporate credit unions of faulty MBS by 
      Washington Mutual, which JPMorgan Chase acquired in 2008.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Before today, NCUA had recovered $335 million from parties that sold bad 
      MBS to the corporates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The National Association of Federal Credit Unions is the only national 
      organization that focuses exclusively on federal issues affecting credit 
      unions, representing its members before the federal government and the 
      public.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. consumers who suffered through the mortgage crisis - and even those who experienced losses from Superstorm Sandy - could benefit from the record $13 billion settlement with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. But they should not expect a windfall, consumer advocates say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Consumers will not see relief in the ways they traditionally do when companies settle complaints about wrongdoing," said John Breyault, vice president of public policy, telecommunications and fraud at the National Consumers League. "Consumer relief from this settlement will instead include principal forgiveness, loan modifications and efforts to reduce blight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers of JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual prior to January 1, 2009 could be eligible for a reduction to the principal of their mortgage loans or receive refinancing opportunities for which they might not otherwise have qualified. And those who are facing foreclosure could get some much-needed opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement calls for a minimum of $1.2 billion in mortgage principal reduction. In addition, customers in low- to moderate-income areas and those who lived in a federal disaster area between October 1, 2012 and November 19 will qualify for up to $10,000 in credits toward purchase loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An independent monitor will be appointed to oversee the distribution of the settlement. Breyault said it is vital that the monitor has authority to see the money is properly spent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers who received or had mortgages serviced by JPMorgan and the related firms should talk to the bank, a housing counselor or federal regulators to see whether they could be beneficiaries of this settlement, said Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't wait for the bank to do something," Rheingold said. "You should be aggressive and proactive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, Rheingold notes, other settlements related to the housing crisis have made additional consumer assistance available. "If you feel like you're under water and you need help, you should pursue it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least $4 billion in funds from the settlement are earmarked to provide assistance in areas that were hardest hit during the foreclosure crisis, such as Detroit.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 19 (Reuters) - U.S. consumers who suffered through the
mortgage crisis - and even those who experienced losses from
Superstorm Sandy - could benefit from the record $13 billion
settlement with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. But they should not
expect a windfall, consumer advocates say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Consumers will not see relief in the ways they
traditionally do when companies settle complaints about
wrongdoing," said John Breyault, vice president of public
policy, telecommunications and fraud at the National Consumers
League. "Consumer relief from this settlement will instead
include principal forgiveness, loan modifications and efforts to
reduce blight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers of JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual
prior to Jan. 1, 2009 could be eligible for a reduction to the
principal of their mortgage loans or receive refinancing
opportunities for which they might not otherwise have qualified.
And those who are facing foreclosure could get some much-needed
opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement calls for a minimum of $1.2 billion in
mortgage principal reduction. In addition, customers in low- to
moderate-income areas and those who lived in a federal disaster
area between Oct. 1, 2012 and Nov. 19 will qualify for up to
$10,000 in credits toward purchase loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An independent monitor will be appointed to oversee the
distribution of the settlement. Breyault said it is vital that
the monitor has authority to see the money is properly spent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers who received or had mortgages serviced by JPMorgan
and the related firms should talk to the bank, a housing
counselor or federal regulators to see whether they could be
beneficiaries of this settlement, said Ira Rheingold, executive
director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't wait for the bank to do something," Rheingold said.
"You should be aggressive and proactive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, Rheingold notes, other settlements related to the
housing crisis have made additional consumer assistance
available. "If you feel like you're under water and you need
help, you should pursue it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least $4 billion in funds from the settlement are
earmarked to provide assistance in areas that were hardest hit
during the foreclosure crisis, such as Detroit. Those funds
could be used to acquire abandoned properties and find
alternative uses for the land, reducing blight and helping to
prop up other urban homeowners, Rheingold said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's sort of a recognition of the economic devastation they
left in the wake of their bad practices - and they have to pay
for it," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, cash will be available to help fund new loans
and pay for services in areas that have been hurt most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan to deploy settlement money in certain states is
more defined. New York, one of five states that also settled
with JPMorgan, will receive about $1 billion. Of that, $613
million will be used to provide housing counseling and legal
services for New York residents who were impacted by Sandy,  New
York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other states, including Illinois and California, will
receive shares of the settlement to offset losses suffered by
their state pension funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co said it routinely overstated the quality of mortgages it was selling to investors, and it agreed to pay $13 billion to settle related charges with the U.S. government, federal officials said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavior that the largest U.S. bank admitted to, authorities said, is at the heart of what inflated the housing bubble: lenders making bad mortgages and selling them to investors who thought they were safe. When the loans started turning bad, investors lost faith in the banking system, and a housing crisis turned into a financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The civil settlement marks the end of weeks of tense negotiations between JPMorgan Chase, which is looking to move past the legal issues that have plagued it for more than a year, and the U.S. government, which is under pressure to hold banks accountable for behavior that led to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it has set aside all the funds it needs to cover the settlement, meaning the deal will have no impact on its earnings. The deal resolves most of its mortgage issues with federal authorities, the bank said. JPMorgan's shares rose 0.7 percent to close at $56.15 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even after the settlement, the bank faces at least nine other government probes, covering everything from its hiring practices in China to whether it manipulated the Libor benchmark interest rate. It may still also face criminal charges linked to mortgage matters. The bank said last month it had set aside $23 billion to cover litigation expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At issue in Tuesday's settlement was the long chain of parties between the original mortgage lender and the ultimate investor in the loan. Often smaller lenders would make a mortgage loan, and sell it to a bank, which would package loans into bonds, and in turn sell them to investors. This chain allowed capital to flow to loans that arguably should never have been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without a doubt, the conduct uncovered in this investigation helped sow the seeds of the mortgage meltdown," said U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investors that bought these mortgage bonds demanded that the loans be of a particular quality. JPMorgan said the loans met the guidelines, but one of its employees said they did not, the bank admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due diligence firms that reviewed some of those loans for JPMorgan in 2006 and 2007 said that 27 percent of them did not meet underwriting guidelines, but the bank still packaged at least half of those into mortgage securities, the government said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government called the settlement the largest in U.S. history, but the deal is really several rolled into one. It includes a $4 billion relief package with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and a $4 billion settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees government mortgage financing companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the $4 billion settlement with HUD, at least $1.5 billion will go toward loans the bank is forgiving. As much as $500 million will go to change the terms of loans to lower monthly payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining $2 billion will be for assorted purposes, including new loans for low- and moderate-income borrowers in areas that have been hard-hit by the housing crisis and for demolition of abandoned homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH NEGOTIATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and government agencies led by the Justice Department reached a tentative agreement in mid-October and have been hammering out details since then. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was also involved in discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's negotiations with the Justice Department began in earnest last spring, after Justice Department lawyers in California preliminarily concluded that the bank had violated U.S. civil laws. The Justice Department had looked into mortgage bonds the bank sold from 2005 through 2007, the company said in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks went sour, and government lawyers prepared to file a lawsuit against JPMorgan in September and scheduled a news conference to announce it. But they canceled it at the last minute as JPMorgan reached out to government officials to discuss a settlement. JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon met U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder later that month to talk about a deal on mortgage probes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiations were difficult, people involved in the matter said. Parties joined the talks, then dropped out. In recent weeks, they stopped, only to restart. Details of the deal were being worked out hours before it was announced on Tuesday, said one person involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OBAMA'S TASK FORCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement is the most significant action to come out of a task force the Obama administration created in January 2012, years after the height of the financial crisis, to probe the packaging and sale of shoddy home loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers and others have been critical of the administration's failure to hold Wall Street banks, executives, and other parties accountable for the excesses that resulted in the housing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task force included representatives from the Justice Department, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the New York State Attorney General, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agencies worked together unusually closely on the lawsuits.

			CalSTRS to Recover Its Investment With JP Morgan Chase in Federal 
      Settlement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The California State Teachers&#8217; Retirement System (CalSTRS) can expect to 
      receive approximately $19.5 million plus interest from JP Morgan Chase  
      Co. as part of a landmark $13 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice 
      Department over the bank&#8217;s misrepresentation of residential 
      mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CalSTRS Chief Executive Officer Jack Ehnes issued the following 
      statement:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is welcome news to CalSTRS and the educators of California, as we 
      stand to recoup our investment and hopefully help us move forward from 
      this traumatic economic collapse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;We thank the California Attorney General and the U.S. Justice 
      Department for their efforts through the Mortgage Fraud Strike Force at

      necessary moves to ensure the trust and to secure the financial future 
      of our members.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The California 
      State Teachers&#8217; Retirement System, with a portfolio valued at $176 
      billion as of October 31, 2013, is the largest educator-only pension 
      fund in the world. CalSTRS administers a hybrid retirement system, 
      consisting of traditional defined benefit, cash balance and voluntary 
      defined contribution plans. CalSTRS also provides disability and

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 19 (Reuters) - A fire caused Exxon Mobil to
shut its gas processing plant in Kingsville, Texas, the company
said on Tuesday, but no injuries were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fire, which began in the early hours of Monday morning
at the King Ranch plant, was "considerably reduced" and has been
left to burn out, an Exxon spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plant, which can process up to 500 million cubic feet
per day of natural gas and associated liquids, remains shut in
the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. next day gas prices were unmoved by the news, rising
slightly on Monday on warmer weather but falling at most points
on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said it will investigate the cause of the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Short-seller Jim Chanos said he was bearish on oil companies like Exxon Mobil Corp. and said the U.S. stock market was becoming riskier, while Aaron Cowen, of hedge fund Suvretta Capital Management, said the market has yet to reach a peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colin Teichholtz, co-head of fixed income trading at hedge fund firm Pine River Capital Management, said the selloff in certain Puerto Rican municipal bonds has created opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those were some of the highlights from Day 2 of the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit, where investors shared their best ideas on topics such as this year's record rally in U.S. stocks and the impact of the Federal Reserve's monthly bond-buying program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JIM CHANOS, president and founder of Kynikos Associates:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chanos, who is known for having anticipated the collapse of Enron, said he was bearish on oil companies like Exxon Mobil, which he called a "value trap" because its return on capital is declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cost of finding oil has really, really risen dramatically, and thus hurting returns," Chanos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chanos said the record highs in the U.S. stock market this year resemble historical periods of downward pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're the typical investor, it's probably time to be a little bit more cautious," Chanos said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this timing merely a coincidence? On Friday, JPMorgan Chase and the Houston law firm Gibbs  Bruns announced that they had reached a $4.5 billion settlement to resolve allegations that the bank breached representations and warranties to private investors in 330 JPMorgan and Bear Stearns mortgage-backed securities trusts. Gibbs  Bruns negotiated the JPMorgan settlement on behalf of 21 major institutional investors, including BlackRock, Pimco, Goldman Sachs and MetLife. Two days after the JPMorgan announcement, Kathy Patrick of Gibbs appeared in New York State Supreme Court to make her closing argument in support of her clients previous deal, an $8.5 billion settlement with Bank of America that has been held up for 2-1/2 years by a small group of Countrywide MBS investors who object to the deal. Will Patrick be back in court in 2016 to defend the JPMorgan settlement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She could well be, but there are important differences between the JPMorgan and BofA put-back settlements, some structural and some a matter of circumstance, that should reduce the friction for JPMorgan. Gibbs  Bruns, which is slated to receive $85 million , or 1 percent, in fees if the BofA settlement is approved, is in line for $66 million, or 1.47 percent, in fees from the JPMorgan deal, according to the JPMorgan settlement agreement. That extra share will be worth it to JPMorgan if Gibbs  Bruns used its bruising experience with Countrywide MBS objectors to improve the new deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets look first at tweaks to the settlement structure. Bank of Americas settlement was actually filed by Bank of New York Mellon, the lone MBS trustee for all of the 430 Countrywide trusts whose breach-of-contract claims would be resolved in the proposed $8.5 billion deal. BNY Mellon asked for a judicial determination, through a special New York state-court trust proceeding known as Article 77, that it was acting within its discretion when it accepted BofAs global settlement offer. BofA, BNY Mellon and the Gibbs  Bruns group believed that to obtain approval of the settlement under the broad latitude trustees enjoy under New York law, BNY Mellon would simply have to show that it did not abuse its power or act in conflict with the trusts interests. Objectors, led by AIG, have since howled that (among other things) BNY Mellon made no distinction between Countrywide MBS trusts when it agreed to a global settlement. As the lone trustee, it accepted BofAs offer on behalf of all of the 430 Countrywide trusts in the deal. BofA, BNY Mellon and the investor group, meanwhile, have stood by the one-for-all nature of the global settlement. If the court finds that BNY Mellon did not properly execute its trustee duties, they contend, the entire $8.5 billion settlement collapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan settlement, by contrast, involves seven different MBS trustees and seems to anticipate that not all of the trustees will participate in the settlement on behalf of all the JPMorgan and Bear trusts they oversee. The agreement between the bank and the Gibbs  Bruns group, remember, is meaningless unless the MBS trustees enter the deal, since only the trustees have the power to settle the trusts claim. The investors in the Gibbs group have a large enough stake to direct the decisions of the trustees in many of the trusts (though the settlement agreement does not specify how many). Trustees overseeing trusts that arent controlled by Gibbs investors will have to make their own determination about whether to enter the settlement. Trustees will also have to decide whether to ask courts to approve their settlement decisions. The agreement between Gibbs  Bruns and JPMorgan does not refer explicitly to trustees obtaining court approval through New Yorks Article 77 or any other trust proceeding, and trustees could theoretically enter the settlement without approval from certificate holders or a court. Chances are, though, that if the trustees agree to settle, they will ask a judge to bless that decision in order to insulate themselves from potential liability to MBS certificate holders in the trusts they oversee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unlike BofA, JPMorgan seems to be willing to proceed with the settlement even if some of the 330 trusts reject the deal. The agreement with Gibbs  Bruns includes a provision on non-settling trusts that envisions a few such scenarios: A trustee may decline to enter the settlement for any or all of the trusts its in charge of, or a court may refuse to approve a trustees decision to settle. In any of those events, the non-settling trusts share of the $4.5 billion would revert to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That provision, which seems akin to an opt-out in a class action settlement, could save JPMorgan a lot of grief. In some JPMorgan or Bear trusts, investors outside of the Gibbs  Bruns group hold enough voting rights to direct the actions of the trustee; some of the trusts in this deal  unlike the BofA deal  are backed by bond insurers, who typically call the shots for offerings theyve insured. If controlling investors or bond insurers dont like the proposed JPMorgan settlement, they can presumably instruct the trustee to reject it. JPMorgan has a walk-away provision in the agreement with Gibbs  Bruns, in the event that a lot of trusts refuse to enter the settlement. But if its only a few, the bank will still be able to resolve most of its put-back liability to private investors through the Gibbs settlement and can settle separately with the opt-outs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan agreement also gives trustees 60 days to evaluate the settlement, and more time if they request it and the bank agrees. In the BofA deal, objectors have hammered BNY Mellon for agreeing to BofAs $8.5 billion offer without examining underlying mortgage loan files for breaches of representations and warranties. The JPMorgan settlement seems to anticipate that trustees will want to see such documentation; the bank pledges in the agreement to expedite document production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor can the trustees be accused of colluding with JPMorgan to reach the settlement  as BNY Mellon has been in the BofA case  because they werent part of the negotiations of the deal. Theyre tasked with deciding simply whether the settlement is fair to the trusts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these changes seem designed to blunt the power of potential objectors, who cant leverage their influence to try and tank the entire deal and (depending on how trustees opt to evaluate the settlement proposal) cant make some of the most persuasive points AIG and its fellow objectors have made about BNY Mellon and BofA in the Countrywide deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thats not to say there wont be objectors. Unlike Bank of America, which was facing put-back claims by only one private Countrywide MBS investor at the time it reached its proposed global settlement, JPMorgan and Bear are already defending several breach-of-contract suits by trustees acting at the direction of certificate holders in various trusts. The furthest-along case involves claims by the Boston hedge fund Baupost in Chancery Court in Delaware, where Ropes  Grays summary judgment motion for Baupost is pending. There are also put-back cases under way in New York state court by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan and Labaton Sucharow. And, of course, there are well-developed breach-of-contract cases against JPMorgan and Bear by bond insurers, in both state and federal court. Lead lawyers in those cases either declined to comment or didnt return my calls, but clearly, the monolines and certificate holders who have already instructed trustees to file put-back claims may not be thrilled with a settlement they didnt negotiate, especially since their lawyers have already sunk time and money into the litigation. It will be particularly interesting to see if the Gibbs  Bruns group also has a big stake in any of the trusts with pending suits against JPMorgan and Bear, and how that impacts the litigation. Trustees may be stuck, for instance, between Gibbs investors that support the settlement and bond insurers that dont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If existing put-back suits increase the likelihood that the JPMorgan settlement will face opposition, the statute of limitations may have an opposite effect. When Bank of America proposed its global settlement in June 2011, investors were still within the six-year time limit for breach-of-contract claims under New York law for most MBS. Since then, two state-court trial judges overseeing MBS put-back litigation have reached different conclusions about when the clock starts ticking. The intermediate state appeals court will hear the issue next month. If it sides with the trial judges who said time runs out six years after the MBS offering date, then investors who havent already sued JPMorgan will have little hope of recovery outside of the global settlement (assuming, of course, that they havent signed tolling agreements with the bank). That could be a very important consideration for trustees evaluating whether to enter the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan lawyers have had their hands full in finalizing the Justice Department settlement, but if I were them, Id get serious now about settling with the private investors and bond insurers that have filed put-back claims. Settling in the next 60 days will minimize the odds that trustees will reject the Gibbs  Bruns deal. I should point out, of course, that litigation over the BofA global put-back deal went in directions I sure didnt foresee (and I wasnt the only one!). Strange things happen when this much money is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. lawyer on Tuesday denied using bribery to win a multibillion-dollar judgment against Chevron Corp (CVX.N) in Ecuador, even as the oil company's lawyer raised tough questions about evidence that he said suggested the payments were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has claimed that the lawyer, Steven Donziger, used fraud to obtain the $18.5 billion judgment for villagers to compensate them for contamination at an oil field in northeastern Ecuador. The judgment was reduced to $9.5 billion by Ecuador's highest court last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron hopes that a verdict in its favor from U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is presiding over the non-jury trial in New York, will help it defend against attempts to enforce the judgment around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judgment in Ecuador concerned pollution between 1964 and 1992 at an oil field operated by Texaco, which was later acquired by Chevron. Chevron claims Texaco remediated the site after ceasing operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Ecuadorean judge Alberto Guerra had testified earlier that he was paid $1,000 a month to ghostwrite orders for the judge overseeing the Ecuadorean case, Nicolas Zambrano. Guerra said that the Donziger was aware of the arrangement and the U.S. lawyer had thanked him at a restaurant meeting in Quito, Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger denied that claim, testifying that Guerra asked for $500,000 at that meeting and that Donziger turned him down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would never do that," Donziger said. "Whatever money we had, it would not be used to bribe a judge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Chevron, Randy Mastro, said bank records showed that a woman working for an organization affiliated with Donziger deposited $1,000 into Guerra's account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastro asked about emails sent from an Ecuadorean lawyer on the case to Donziger that referred to a "puppeteer" and a "puppet." In one email, the lawyer said the puppeteer would not move the puppet unless the "audience pays him something."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Mastro's suggestion that those were codenames for Guerra and Zambrano, Donziger said he did not believe the emails were referring to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastro also questioned Donziger about a report submitted by a court-appointed expert, Richard Cabrera, in Ecuador that found Chevron liable for billions of dollars in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger acknowledged that a consulting firm working with his team had drafted the executive summary as well as other portions of the report, a fact that had been kept hidden. In a news release Donziger drafted in 2008, he called Chevron's claim that Cabrera had cooperated with the plaintiffs "completely false."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were times when I wasn't fully accurate about that relationship," he said on Tuesday.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates Coca-Cola Femsa's Proposed USD2B Issuance 'A(exp)'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A(exp)' rating to Coca-Cola Femsa S.A.B. 
      de C.V.'s (KOF) proposed multi-tranche issuance of up to USD2 billion 
      between five to 30 years. The proceeds of the issuance are expected to 
      be used to refinance current indebtedness and general corporate 
      purposes. A complete list of ratings is provided at the end of this 
      release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF's ratings continue to reflect the company's substantial free cash 
      flow (FCF) generation, solid financial position, ample financial 
      flexibility and strong business profile. The ratings also reflect the 
      company's strategic relationship with The Coca-Cola Company (KO; rated 
      'A+'/Outlook Stable) and the explicit and implicit financial support KOF 
      has received from KO. In addition, the ratings consider the geographical 
      diversification of the EBITDA generated outside of Mexico, as well as 
      its strong credit profile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Expected Deleverage
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch incorporates that leverage will gradually decline in the following 
      years approaching historical levels after the recent acquisitions in 
      Brazil of Companhia Fluminense de Refrigerantes, S.A. (Fluminese) and 
      Spaipa S.A. Industria Brasileira de Bebidas (Spaipa). On a pro forma 
      basis, including the effect of these acquisitions, Fitch estimates that 
      KOF's total debt to EBITDA and net debt to EBITDA, will increase to 
      approximately 2.0x and 1.6x, respectively, by the year-end 2013. Fitch 
      expects that KOF's gross leverage and net leverage will strengthen in 
      the following two years to levels around 1.5x and 1.3x, respectively, 
      through higher EBITDA generation or debt reduction. For the last 12 
      months as of Sept. 30, 2013, the company's total debt to EBITDA was 
      1.6x, while net debt to EBITDA was 0.7x.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ample Liquidity
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF's liquidity position is ample. As of Sept. 30, 2013, the company had 
      MXN23.8 billion of cash and marketable securities, which included around 
      USD500 million from a loan related to Spaipa's acquisition, and short 
      term debt maturities of MXN8.5 billion. In addition, in October 2013 the 
      company obtained USD1.5 billion loan to complete the acquisition 
      financing of Spaipa. With the proceeds expected to obtain from the 
      proposed issuance, the company's management plans to refinance a portion 
      of its total debt, improving its debt maturity profile and liquidity 
      risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Strong FCF Generation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects KOF's FCF generation to remain strong over the long term. 
      During the last five years, the company's FCF estimated by Fitch after 
      covering capital expenditures and dividends has averaged annually 
      approximately MXN5.5 billion. Fitch believes that KOF's FCF generation 
      provides financial flexibility across the ups and downs of economic 
      cycles to maintain a conservative capital structure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Stable Operating Performance
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first nine months ended Sept. 30, 2013, net sales increased 
      3% to MXN109.7 million, while total volume increased 4% to 2,323 million 
      unit cases, when compared to the same period of last year. On a 
      comparable basis, excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, KOF's 
      revenues and volume growth was 1%, reflecting a slight decline of volume 
      in the territories of Mexico and Brazil and the effect of devaluation of 
      currencies from its South American operations. Consolidated EBITDA 
      margin has been relatively stable at levels around 18%. Higher 
      profitability in Mexico and Central America has compensated the decrease 
      in operating margins from South America.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Excise Tax Manageable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects that KOF's sales volume growth should be negatively 
      affected in 2014 following the MXN1 per liter excise tax on beverages 
      with sugar content approved by the Mexican Congress. The effect of this 
      tax is expected to be transferred to consumers resulting in an increase 
      in average sales prices of close to 15%. Fitch considers that the 
      company's price initiatives, productivity efficiencies and flexible 
      portfolio should contribute to maintain relatively stable their 
      profitability and financial position.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Downgrade pressures in the ratings could be triggered if KOF's leverage 
      ratios in the following 18 to 24 months are above Fitch's expectation or 
      by a change in the company's long term capital structure that materially 
      deviates from its historical levels. After the recent acquisitions, 
      Fitch does not foresee any positive rating action over the medium term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch currently rates KOF as follow:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
MONTERREY, November 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an
'A(exp)' rating to 
Coca-Cola Femsa S.A.B. de C.V.'s (KOF) proposed multi-tranche
issuance of up to 
USD2 billion between five to 30 years. The proceeds of the
issuance are expected 
to be used to refinance current indebtedness and general
corporate purposes. A 
complete list of ratings is provided at the end of this release.
KEY RATING DRIVERS:
KOF's ratings continue to reflect the company's substantial free
cash flow (FCF) 
generation, solid financial position, ample financial
flexibility and strong 
business profile. The ratings also reflect the company's
strategic relationship 
with The Coca-Cola Company (KO; rated 'A+'/Outlook Stable) and
the explicit and 
implicit financial support KOF has received from KO. In
addition, the ratings 
consider the geographical diversification of the EBITDA
generated outside of 
Mexico, as well as its strong credit profile.
Expected Deleverage
Fitch incorporates that leverage will gradually decline in the
following years 
approaching historical levels after the recent acquisitions in
Brazil of 
Companhia Fluminense de Refrigerantes, S.A. (Fluminese) and
Spaipa S.A. 
Industria Brasileira de Bebidas (Spaipa). On a pro forma basis,
including the 
effect of these acquisitions, Fitch estimates that KOF's total
debt to EBITDA 
and net debt to EBITDA, will increase to approximately 2.0x and
1.6x, 
respectively, by the year-end 2013. Fitch expects that KOF's
gross leverage and 
net leverage will strengthen in the following two years to
levels around 1.5x 
and 1.3x, respectively, through higher EBITDA generation or debt
reduction. For 
the last 12 months as of Sept. 30, 2013, the company's total
debt to EBITDA was 
1.6x, while net debt to EBITDA was 0.7x.
Ample Liquidity
KOF's liquidity position is ample. As of Sept. 30, 2013, the
company had MXN23.8 
billion of cash and marketable securities, which included around
USD500 million 
from a loan related to Spaipa's acquisition, and short term debt
maturities of 
MXN8.5 billion. In addition, in October 2013 the company
obtained USD1.5 billion 
loan to complete the acquisition financing of Spaipa. With the
proceeds expected 
to obtain from the proposed issuance, the company's management
plans to 
refinance a portion of its total debt, improving its debt
maturity profile and 
liquidity risk.
Strong FCF Generation 
Fitch expects KOF's FCF generation to remain strong over the
long term. During 
the last five years, the company's FCF estimated by Fitch after
covering capital 
expenditures and dividends has averaged annually approximately
MXN5.5 billion. 
Fitch believes that KOF's FCF generation provides financial
flexibility across 
the ups and downs of economic cycles to maintain a conservative
capital 
structure. 
Stable Operating Performance
During the first nine months ended Sept. 30, 2013, net sales
increased 3% to 
MXN109.7 million, while total volume increased 4% to 2,323
million unit cases, 
when compared to the same period of last year. On a comparable
basis, excluding 
the effect of recent acquisitions, KOF's revenues and volume
growth was 1%, 
reflecting a slight decline of volume in the territories of
Mexico and Brazil 
and the effect of devaluation of currencies from its South
American operations. 
Consolidated EBITDA margin has been relatively stable at levels
around 18%. 
Higher profitability in Mexico and Central America has
compensated the decrease 
in operating margins from South America.
Excise Tax Manageable
Fitch expects that KOF's sales volume growth should be
negatively affected in 
2014 following the MXN1 per liter excise tax on beverages with
sugar content 
approved by the Mexican Congress. The effect of this tax is
expected to be 
transferred to consumers resulting in an increase in average
sales prices of 
close to 15%. Fitch considers that the company's price
initiatives, productivity 
efficiencies and flexible portfolio should contribute to
maintain relatively 
stable their profitability and financial position.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Downgrade pressures in the ratings could be triggered if KOF's
leverage ratios 
in the following 18 to 24 months are above Fitch's expectation
or by a change in 
the company's long term capital structure that materially
deviates from its 
historical levels. After the recent acquisitions, Fitch does not
foresee any 
positive rating action over the medium term.
Fitch currently rates KOF as follow: 
--Foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A';
--Local currency IDR 'A';
--National scale long-term rating 'AAA(mex)';
--National scale short-term rating 'F1+(mex)';
--Senior notes for USD500 million due 2020 'A';
--Certificados Bursatiles for MXN7,500 million due 2023
'AAA(mex)'.
The Rating Outlook is Stable.

			JPMorgan Chase Reaches Settlement with the President&#8217;s Task Force on 
      Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Company to host conference call with investors to detail agreement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. announced today that it has reached a $13 billion 
      settlement in principle negotiated by the President&#8217;s RMBS Working Group 
      of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force. Today&#8217;s settlement 
      resolves actual and potential civil claims by the Department of Justice 
      (DoJ), several State Attorneys General (State AGs), the Federal Deposit 
      Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration 
      (NCUA) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) relating to 
      residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) activities by JPMorgan 
      Chase, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the settlement, JPMorgan Chase will pay a total of $9 billion in 
      cash and provide $4 billion in borrower relief. The cash portion 
      consists of a $2 billion civil monetary penalty and $7 billion in 
      compensatory payments, including a previously announced $4 billion 
      payment to resolve FHFA&#8217;s litigation claims. Borrower relief will be in 
      the form of principal reduction, forbearance and other direct benefits 
      from various relief programs.&#160;JPMorgan Chase has committed to complete 
      delivery of the promised relief to borrowers before the end of 2017.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase is fully reserved for this settlement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon commented:&#160;&#8220;We are pleased to have 
      concluded this extensive agreement with the President&#8217;s RMBS Working 
      Group and to have resolved the civil claims of the Department of Justice 
      and others. Today&#8217;s settlement covers a very significant portion of 
      legacy mortgage-backed securities-related issues for JPMorgan Chase, as 
      well as Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The settlement concludes and terminates all pending civil enforcement 
      investigations, including those by the Department of Justice and the 
      State AGs from California, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts and New 
      York, relating to RMBS activities by JPMorgan Chase, Bear Stearns and 
      Washington Mutual.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The settlement also concludes and terminates all civil litigation claims 
      brought by FDIC, FHFA and NCUA relating to securitizations of 
      residential mortgage loans by JPMorgan Chase, Bear Stearns and 
      Washington Mutual.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of this settlement and the proposed settlement of 
      representation and warranty claims announced on Friday, November 15, the 
      company has resolved a significant portion of the RMBS-related civil 
      litigation claims being defended by the company, and substantially all 
      of the claims brought by federally insured and federally controlled 
      entities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase continues to cooperate with the ongoing criminal 
      investigation by the Department of Justice.

      Research and Markets: Global Electrical Equipment Market to 2016: 
      Alstom, General Electric, Schneider Electric  Siemens Dominate the 
      Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/gslxjp/global_electrical) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Electrical Equipment Market 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Electrical Equipment market to grow at a CAGR of 4.92 percent 
      over the period 2012-2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major growth drivers in the market is the increasing demand 
      for electrical equipment from the Power industry. The Power industry in 
      the APAC region is trying to increase its capacity, which in turn has 
      made them invest in electrical equipment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Due to increasing ecological concerns and stringent government 
      regulations for air pollution, government and private power-generating 
      companies are exploring new opportunities for clean energy generation. 
      Power-generating companies are looking for alternative options such as 
      wind energy, solar energy, and tidal energy for power generation. This 
      has led to an increase in demand for electrical equipment such as 
      turbines, power cables, and generator and sets. In 2012, 66 percent of 
      the Global Electrical Equipment market share was held by turbines, power 
      cables, and generators and sets, generating revenue of US$189,486 
      million. Developed countries such as the US, the UK, and Germany are 
      increasing their investment in clean energy production.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is 
      fluctuations in the price of raw materials. Prices of metals and other 
      raw materials are volatile and they tend to keep increasing 
      year-on-year, resulting in a negative impact on the revenue of vendors.

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects to show answered questions, not asked them in third
paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BELLEVUE, Wash. Nov 19 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
Chairman Bill Gates said on Tuesday he was pleased with the
software company's progress in finding a new chief executive and
that the search committee had spoken to a number of candidates,
but did not give a date by which he expected a new leader to
replace the retiring Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at Microsoft's annual shareholder meeting in
Bellevue, Washington, Gates paused briefly and choked up with
emotion as he thanked Ballmer for his work at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates then left the stage and sat in the front row of an
audience of around 400 people, alongside other members of the
board. That was a departure from previous years when he remained
onstage and occasionally answered questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not shed much light on its CEO search, but
sources close to the process have told Reuters the company has
narrowed its shortlist of candidates to just a handful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those sources have said the candidates include Ford Motor Co
 chief Alan Mulally and former Nokia CEO Stephen
Elop, as well as former Skype CEO and internal candidate Tony
Bates, now responsible for Microsoft's business development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft remains highly profitable and last month beat Wall
Street's quarterly profit and revenue forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company has come under criticism for missing some of
the largest technology shifts in the past few years from
Internet search to social networking, and Apple Inc and
Google Inc are now at the vanguard of a mobile
computing revolution that's eroding its core PC-based business.

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia shareholders approved the 5.4 billion euros ($7.4 billion) sale of the company's mobile phone business to Microsoft, deciding the deal's financial benefits outweighed any objections to the loss of a Finnish national asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors holding more than 99 percent of Nokia voting rights supported the deal, according to a final tally at Tuesday's shareholders meeting in Helsinki. The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of next year after regulatory clearances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia had in September agreed to sell its devices and services business and license its patents to Microsoft after failing to recover from a late start in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's a fair price if you think about the situation right now," said Matti Pirkola, a 58-year-old shareholder as he arrived for the meeting in Helsinki's Ice Hall arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pirkola had been a Nokia shareholder since the early 1980s, when he worked for the company for a few years. "I think Nokia could have chosen another option a few years ago, but now there are no other alternatives," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale is set to boost Nokia's net cash position to nearly 8 billion euros from around 2 billion in the third quarter - a windfall likely to help it regain investment-grade status from credit rating agencies and allow it to return cash to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia earlier this year suspended its annual dividend for the first time in its 148-year recorded history in an attempt to preserve cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billionaire and activist investor Daniel Loeb said in October he had taken a position in Nokia and expected a "meaningful portion of the excess" cash from the Microsoft deal to be returned to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the loss-making handset business, the remaining company will derive more than 90 percent of its sales from telecom equipment unit Nokia Services and Networks. It will also include a navigation software unit and a trove of patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINNISH CORNERSTONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the Microsoft deal was announced, Nokia shares have doubled, closing at 5.82 euros on Tuesday. They had slumped spectacularly from a 2000 peak of 65 euros and last year fell as low as 1.33 euros on worries the mobile phone business would burn through cash before it could catch up with rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co and Apple Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the shareholder vote showed most believed the Microsoft deal to be the best option, many of the 5,300 attendees at Tuesday's meeting vented their frustration at Nokia's management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of the mobile phones business, Finland's biggest brand and at one point worth 4 percent of national GDP, came as a shock to many Finns. The company's success helped to transform Finland from a backwater economy under the shadow of the Soviet Union into a high-tech powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nokia has been one of the cornerstones for Finnish society. We are losing part of that," said Sirkka-Liisa Vikman, who said it was her first and likely last attendance at a Nokia shareholders' meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risto Siilasmaa, the Nokia board chairman who is acting as interim CEO, asked shareholders to look to the future, saying the deal marked a transition for Nokia which has reinvented itself numerous times, starting out as a paper mill and making everything from rubber boots to television sets over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nokia has faced major changes on several occasions in its nearly 150 years' history and overcome them," Siilasmaa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia phones will become part of Microsoft's efforts to expand in consumer devices, although some analysts say it will have a tough time catching leaders Apple and Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many shareholders have also been critical of former CEO Stephen Elop's strategy, particularly his 2011 decision to adopt Microsoft's Windows Phone software over Nokia's own Symbian or Google Inc's Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TROJAN HORSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In deciding to drop Symbian, Elop had told employees in an email that Nokia needed to jump from a "burning platform". But some critics said Elop was reckless in betting on the untested Windows Phone system and should have opted for Android, or at least phased out Symbian more gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Symbian sales collapsed and Nokia faced competition from Asian rivals at the lower end of the market, the company's share of the global handset market fell to around 14 percent in the third quarter from a peak of 40 percent in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop stood down when he announced the deal with Microsoft, his former employer. He is due to return to the Redmond, Washington company when the deal closes, and sources say he is on a shortlist to replace CEO Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Finnish tabloids have called Elop a "Trojan horse," criticizing his 18.8 million euro leaving payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olavi Savola, a 74-year-old shareholder who had owned Nokia shares for around 15 years, said he was voting in favor of the deal but was still critical of Elop. "When the Canadian came, I knew it that he would take it along with him," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some shareholders were sympathetic to Elop, saying there were few good options by the time he was hired in late 2010. And many say Nokia, once undisputed leader in the global handset industry, grew complacent and failed to realize the market's transformation following Apple's launch of the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know there are other opinions in Finland, but I think he did a good job," said shareholder Pirkola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by David Goodman and David Holmes)&lt;/p&gt;

Stephen Elop's strategy, particularly his 2011 decision to adopt
Microsoft's Windows Phone software over Nokia's own Symbian or
Google Inc's Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TROJAN HORSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In deciding to drop Symbian, Elop had told employees in an 
email that Nokia needed to jump from a "burning platform". But
some critics said Elop was reckless in betting on the untested
Windows Phone system and should have opted for Android, or at
least phased out Symbian more gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Symbian sales collapsed and Nokia faced competition from
Asian rivals at the lower end of the market, the company's share
of the global handset market fell to around 14 percent in the
third quarter from a peak of 40 percent in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop stood down when he announced the deal with Microsoft,
his former employer. He is due to return to the Redmond,
Washington company when the deal closes, and sources say he is
on a shortlist to replace CEO Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Finnish tabloids have called Elop a "Trojan horse,"
criticising his 18.8 million euro leaving payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olavi Savola, a 74-year-old shareholder who had owned Nokia
shares for around 15 years, said he was voting in favour of the
deal but was still critical of Elop. "When the Canadian came, I
knew it that he would take it along with him," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some shareholders were sympathetic to Elop, saying there
were few good options by the time he was hired in late 2010. And
many say Nokia, once undisputed leader in the global handset
industry, grew complacent and failed to realise the market's
transformation following Apple's launch of the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know there are other opinions in Finland, but I think he
did a good job," said shareholder Pirkola.

attention and resources of our senior management and others within the company
potentially diverting their attention from other aspects of our business; 6)
disruption and dissatisfaction among employees caused by the plans and
implementation of the Sale of the DS Business reducing focus and productivity
in areas of our business; 7) the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges
related to or triggered by the Sale of the DS Business; 8) any impairments or
charges to carrying values of assets or liabilities related to or triggered by

      Internet Sensation Kurt Hugo Schneider is Ready to Rock the Coca-Cola 
      Red Carpet LIVE! Digital Pre-Show with a Performance of Official Track 
      Co-Created with Fans
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Digital Pre-Show hosted by Lance Bass, Jordin Sparks, Zendaya, Jenna 
      Ushkowitz, Rosie Pierri, Colbie Caillat  Jake Owen Will Broadcast Live 
      from the 2013 American Music Awards at The NOKIA Theatre L.A. Live with 
      a Special Dance Performance by Jabbawockeez
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Roll out the red carpet! Musician and online filmmaker Kurt Hugo 
      Schneider is ready to debut the official track produced, with input from 
      fans, for the Coca-Cola Red Carpet LIVE! Digital Pre-Show at the 2013 
      American Music Awards. The LIVE stream will begin on Sunday, November 24 
      at 2 p.m. PST / 5 p.m. EST online at www.TheAMAs.com, 
      Yahoo.com, and ABC.com. The pre-show will bring three hours of 
      entertaining celebrity interviews and exclusive behind-the-scenes 
      content hosted by Lance Bass, Jordin Sparks, Zendaya, Jenna Ushkowitz, 
      Rosie Pierri, Colbie Caillat and Jake Owen. Additionally, the pre-show 
      will include a never-before-seen dance performance by Jabbawockeez and 
      additional live performances from Jesse McCartney, Fifth Harmony and 
      Aloe Blacc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It is an awesome new experience for me to get to share the song I 
      created in collaboration with my fans at the Coca-Cola Red Carpet LIVE! 
      Digital Pre-Show,&#8221; said Kurt. &#8220;The whole process has been pretty 
      amazing. I can&#8217;t wait to hit the stage at the digital pre-show and give 
      everyone a first look at this one-of-a-kind song that I&#8217;m performing 
      live in front of viewers and celebrities on the red carpet.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola AHH Studio digital experience allowed teens to interact 
      with Kurt to help create the original soundtrack for the pre-show. Each 
      week, teens across the country were able to listen to three different 
      musical options and choose the one they liked best. After six weeks and 
      six opportunities for fans to weigh in, Kurt used all of the elements 
      chosen by fans to create the official soundtrack. Fans can tune in to 
      the pre-show for all of the action live from the red carpet as the 
      Coca-Cola AHH Studio digital experience program culminates with Kurt&#8217;s 
      performance of the official track.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fans will be able to view several areas live during the pre-show, such 
      as the Coca-Cola Interview Lounge, the first stop for celebrity 
      interviews on the red carpet. Celebrity hosts from all sectors of the 
      music and entertainment world will get the latest Hollywood scoop from 
      the stars themselves as they make their way to one of music&#8217;s most 
      celebrated nights.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a fun experience to be the one interviewing other celebrities and 
      it&#8217;s great to be back again as one of the hosts for the Coca-Cola Red 
      Carpet LIVE! Digital Pre-Show,&#8221; said Lance Bass. &#8220;All of the fun and 
      unique content from the digital pre-show does a great job of enhancing 
      the AMA&#8217;s red carpet leading up to one of music&#8217;s most anticipated award 
      shows.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A live dance performance by the Jabbawockeez will add to the 
      entertainment presented during the pre-show. Inspiring people to &#8216;move 
      for the movement&#8217; and show support for (RED) and the fight to end AIDS, 
      the famed dance crew will perform a routine and rally viewer excitement 
      for the DANCE (RED) SAVE LIVES events taking place around the world this 
      coming World AIDS Day weekend, Nov. 30 - Dec. 1.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to tuning in online, fans watching the pre-show have another 
      opportunity to get in on the action through a special sweepstakes via 
      SMS promotion. By texting in during the pre-show, two viewers will be 
      selected during the pre-show to receive a trip for two to visit Los 
      Angeles for the World AIDS Day weekend. The winners and their guests &#8211; 
      ages 21 and up &#8211; will attend a dance party on Nov. 30 to celebrate the 
      release of (RED)&#8217;s 2013 compilation album, DANCE (RED), SAVE LIVES2. 
      This album and dance party will help raise money and awareness around 
      the AIDS fight. To learn more, viewers can go to www.theamas.com/coke.

		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The official soundtrack created by Kurt and the fans for the Coca-Cola 
      Red Carpet LIVE! Digital Pre-Show has come together in a great way and 
      will surely be adding to the entertainment value of the American Music 
      Awards red carpet,&#8221; said Andy McMillin, VP Coca-Cola Trademark. &#8220;From 
      musical acts, various celebrity hosts and a special dance performance by 
      the Jabbawockeez, the red carpet at the digital pre-show will be 
      jam-packed with unique content that fans everywhere can enjoy.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Red Carpet LIVE! Digital Pre-Show will kick off at 2 p.m. 
      PST / 5 p.m. EST live from Los Angeles, Calif. on Nov. 24. When asked 
      about the company&#8217;s rich history with dick clark productions, Sharon 
      Byers, SVP Sports, Entertainment and Community Marketing commented, 
      &#8220;Coca-Cola is a proud partner of the American Music Awards and I think 
      this year&#8217;s activation is a great example of how music and charitable 
      causes can come together in a big, meaningful way.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;BELLEVUE, Wash. Nov 19 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
Chairman Bill Gates said on Tuesday he was pleased with the
software company's progress in finding a new chief executive and
the search committee had spoken to a number of candidates, but
he did not give a date by which he expected a new leader to
replace the retiring Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;

Bellevue, Washington, Gates paused briefly and choked up with
emotion as he thanked Ballmer for his work at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Parks Associates Finds Sony Poised to Top Microsoft in Game-Console Sales This Holiday Season&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Research Firm Finds More U.S. Consumers Plan to Purchase Sony PlayStation 4 Over Microsoft Xbox One in the 2013 Holiday Shopping Season&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;DALLAS, TX--(Marketwired - Nov 19, 2013) - &#160;Parks Associates research shows many U.S. holiday shoppers have already picked the game-console brand they plan to buy this season, including Black Friday, with 36% of console shoppers planning to purchase a Sony gaming console and 27% planning to buy a Microsoft product. Both companies are releasing next-generation consoles this year, and Sony reports sales of PlayStation 4 exceeded 1 million consoles in the first 24 hours after release. Microsoft is releasing Xbox One this week. Nintendo is third among console shoppers, and Ouya, a relatively inexpensive ($99) Android-powered game console, is the fourth most-desired brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tablets are overall the most-popular CE device this holiday season, but new consoles from Sony and Microsoft, along with a new, less-expensive option in Ouya, will reinvigorate gaming this year," said John Barrett, director, Consumer Analytics, Parks Associates. "These new models will also help get shoppers into the stores, as console shoppers prefer to shop at retail stores versus purchasing online. Almost 50% of console shoppers plan to shop in-person, at a retail store, while 48% of tablet shoppers plan to shop for that device online."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parks Associates reports 56% of U.S. broadband households plan to purchase at least one CE device in the 2013 holiday season and 40% of these households intend to acquire a game console. These households plan to purchase, on average, four devices and spend over $1,000 on CE purchases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Roughly 15% of all U.S. broadband households plan to purchase both a tablet and a game console, which could create some tension between the categories," Barrett said. "These households plan to purchase on average almost eight different CE devices this holiday season, so once they factor in household budget limitations, shoppers may have to trim their lists and ultimately decide between devices."&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Shoppers planning to purchase both a tablet and a game console plan to spend roughly $1,400 this holiday season, enough to afford both devices but likely not enough for all the products they plan to purchase this year.
            
				Shoppers who intend to purchase a tablet but not a game console plan to spend $1,133 this season. Those who plan to buy a game console but not a tablet plan to spend $989.
			&lt;p&gt;2013 Holiday CE Purchase Intentions features consumer research from a nationwide survey of 2,500 U.S. broadband households fielded in 4Q 2013. Data on other CE devices are also available.

		&lt;h1&gt;SkyKick Launches Public Folder Migration Automation to Help Partners With Microsoft Office 365 Business&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;SkyKick Also Releases Project Management Application; Both New Products Save Partners Time, Make Migrations Even Easier&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, WA--(Marketwired - Nov 19, 2013) -  SkyKick (www.skykick.com), the easiest way to Office 365, today announced the release of Microsoft Exchange Public Folder migration automation for Office 365, and a new Project Management Application, both included as part of the SkyKick Application Suite. The SkyKick Application Suite is the only solution designed to automate and manage a Microsoft Office 365 migration project. It is available exclusively to help partners move their SMB customers, and has helped hundreds of IT partners move thousands of businesses to the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Folder migrations have been a painstaking manual process for partners because they often involve large data sets, complex folder structures and varying levels of user permissions. To date, there have been no third party tools to help automate the process. With SkyKick's new Public Folder migration product, moving Public Folders to Office 365 is automated, reducing the effort and complexity, while improving the quality and making it easy for partners to include Public Folders as part of their migration projects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, SkyKick's new Project Management Application gives partners the ability to quickly manage numerous facets of the migration project, get real-time alerts about the status of migrations and automate previously manual tasks, all with a simpler and more powerful experience. The Project Management Application is part of SkyKick's newly redesigned partner portal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm amazed at how SkyKick innovates so quickly to deliver upon the needs of its partners," said Jamison West, CEO at SkyKick customer Arterian -- an IT services business and Microsoft NW Area Partner of the Year.&#160;"Automating Public Folder migrations is just awesome -- it will save us hours of effort. Plus the new Project Management Application will further simplify our migration projects, and save us time and money in migrating our customers. They asked us what we needed, and they delivered. I'm excited to see what they do next."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By providing more controls and additional automated functionality with the new SkyKick products, IT partners save time and free up resources to take on more cloud migrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our mission is to simplify the migration experience for our partners -- to help them sell more and deliver the highest quality migration experience while reducing overall costs," said SkyKick Co-CEO Todd Schwartz. "Adding Public Folder migration to the SkyKick Application Suite while streamlining management of the migration project even further with the release of the Project Management Application is a big leap forward in simplifying migration projects for our partners. We look forward to continuing to drive innovation in automating migration projects for partners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SkyKick Application Suite helps IT Consultants, System Integrators, Managed Service Providers, Value-Added Resellers and other IT partners automate an entire Office 365 migration project from initial sales to project completion for SMBs. This enables partners to improve sales velocity, reduce project risk and complexity, and simplify the management of the migration project, while providing a high-quality migration for their customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About SkyKick
				SkyKick is a new kind of migration application that makes it fast, safe and easy for IT partners to move small and medium-sized businesses to Office 365. The company's Application Suite helps partners manage all the steps of a migration project including the sales, planning, migration and on-site phases of their customer's move to Office 365. SkyKick is a 2013 Microsoft Partner of the Year and is headquartered in Seattle. For more information visit www.skykick.com.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SCOTTS VALLEY, CA--(Marketwired - Nov 19, 2013) - Catbird&#174;, the leader in security and compliance for virtualized and private cloud data centers, announced Catbird vSecurity&#174; for Microsoft&#174; Hyper-V, with availability in December 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security and compliance through Catbird vSecurity provides clients with an automated method to measure against compliance standards and mitigate risk, greatly reducing audit preparation costs and the inherent complexities that come with managing compliance regulations. Catbird vSecurity includes comprehensive network security controls such as IDS/IPS, Firewall Orchestration and Vulnerability Management. It captures and analyzes security and hypervisor events, automatically mapping to various compliance frameworks including PCI, HIPAA, FISMA, and COBIT among others, presenting users with a visual one-to-one mapping of the current compliance state of their cloud-based infrastructure. It also automates the quarantine of assets upon compliance policy violations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catbird vSecurity for Microsoft Hyper-V is the ideal solution for a wide variety of virtualized data centers, including VMware vSphere users looking to add Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2012, companies currently using Hyper-V that want to secure and enforce compliance, and those firms that are already running a hybrid datacenter with both Hyper-V and vSphere and need a single security and compliance tool for the whole of their environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"vSecurity delivers the security controls and automated mitigation necessary to achieve continuous compliance. In addition, we now give IT staff the ability to consolidate security and compliance for multiple hypervisors into a single enterprise-wide function," said Randal Asay, CTO of Catbird. "At the heart of our solution is active compliance for virtualization, a proactive approach that enables proof of compliance in real time, instead of a manual process that exposes firms to security risks and higher audit and related fees. Hyper-V will play a critical role in markets where its users require compliance against standards like HIPAA and PCI." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyper-V is gaining market share in the virtualization software market, especially popular in markets sensitive to cost, such as higher education.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ritsuko Ando&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI Nov 19 (Reuters) - Nokia shareholders
are expected to approve the sale of its mobile phone business to
Microsoft on Tuesday, with the deal's financial
benefits likely to outweigh resistance from a minority of
investors upset over the sale of a Finnish national icon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia agreed in September to sell its devices and services
business and license its patents to Microsoft for 5.44 billion
euros ($7.36 billion) after failing to recover from a late start
in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale, which is expected to close in the first quarter of
next year after regulatory approvals, is set to boost Nokia's
net cash position to nearly 8 billion euros from around 2
billion in the third quarter and allow it to return cash to
shareholders, possibly through a special dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the loss-making handset business, the remaining
company will earn over 90 percent of sales from telecom
equipment unit Nokia Services and Networks (NSN) and will also
include a navigation software business and a trove of patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the Microsoft deal was announced, Nokia shares have
doubled, closing at 6.00 euros on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, they fell as far as 1.33 euros, a level not seen
since 1994, on worries the mobile phone business would burn
through cash before it could ever catch up with rivals such as
Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billionaire and activist investor Daniel Loeb said in
October that he had taken a position in Nokia and that he
expects a "meaningful portion of the excess" cash from the
Microsoft deal to be returned to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While approval from shareholders is considered a done deal,
Tuesday's meeting, which starts at 2:00 p.m. (1200 GMT) in
Helsinki's Ice Hall arena, will also be a chance for some
shareholders to vent their dissatisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of the mobile phones business, Finland's biggest
brand and at one point worth 4 percent of national GDP, came as
a shock to many Finns. The company's success helped to transform
Finland from a backwater economy in the shadow of the Soviet
Union into a high-tech powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Nokia's last regular shareholders' meeting, many
shareholders took to the microphone to question CEO Stephen
Elop's strategy, particularly his 2011 decision to adopt
Microsoft's Windows Phone software over Nokia's own Symbian or
Google's widely popular Android operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop stepped down when he announced the agreement with
Microsoft, his former employer, and is due to return to the
Redmond, Washington company when the deal closes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finnish tabloids have called him a "Trojan horse", although
most analysts have been sympathetic, saying there were few good
options for the company by the time he was hired in late 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Finnish businessman and former Nokia manager had set up
a group called Nokita, translated as "bet higher" in Finnish, in
an attempt to outbid Microsoft. He said on Monday that he failed
to find enough investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course there was a bit of a patriotic idea behind my
plan, but there was also the calculation," said Juhani Parda,
who believed Nokia's devices business could be worth around 23
billion euros in three years by adopting Android in addition to
Windows Phone. "I think 5.44 billion is definitely good for
Microsoft. I'm not sure it's the best deal for shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects story that ran on Monday to change title of Andrew
Wilson to EMEA Chief Executive, not Chief Executive)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Chris Vellacott&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 18 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields could surge
to nearly 4 percent next year once the Federal Reserve scales
back asset purchases although that should not stifle economic
recovery, Goldman Sachs Asset Management says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are a bit bearish on Treasuries ... We would expect to
see 10-year Treasuries probably to be about 100 bps higher a
year from now," Andrew Wilson, Chief Executive for Europe,
Middle East and Africa at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, told
the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in London on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such an increase was "not priced in" to market consensus and
exceeds levels in futures markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten-year yields, currently trading at around 2.7 percent
, could even hit 4 percent, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed is buying bonds at a pace of $85 billion per month
while promising to hold interest rates near zero, at least until
unemployment hits a threshold of 6.5 percent, providing the
outlook for inflation stays below 2.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, officials have signalled they would like to start
scaling back asset purchases, also called quantitative easing,
when this is warranted by stronger data on growth and hiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has raised concerns of a knock-on impact on other
markets around the world, particularly in some developing
markets where asset price rises have been bolstered by extra
liquidity provided by the U.S. stimulus programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson, however, said that while retail investors appear to
be pulling money out of emerging markets and repatriating it to
take advantage of higher U.S. yields, institutional investors
were putting money back in emerging markets that have close
economic links to the United States such as Mexico that will
benefit from U.S. economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we've seen is institutional inflow into emerging
markets. Six months ago institutional investors were very
interested in emerging markets but were still wary," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been less interest in emerging markets exposed to
languid European economies such as Turkey, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' asset management arm had seen institutional
investors pour up to $4 billion into emerging markets fixed
income funds in the last six months, according to Wilson, who is
also co-head of fixed income at the asset manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO DEFLATION IN EUROPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth in Europe was likely to remain "anaemic" for some
time to come, Wilson said, so monetary policy from the European
Central Bank would remain accommodative and at odds with the
tightening currently on the agenda in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The European recovery looks very fragile, maybe around 1
percent growth in 2014. Given that environment the European
Central Bank ideally needs to keep rates low," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson played down fears of Japanese-style deflation in
Europe, despite falling inflation rates in markets such as Spain
where consumer prices are rising at their slowest rate in four
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't think deflation is necessarily likely but we'll
see disinflation with inflation rates remaining at very, very
low levels," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For more summit stories, see ID:nL5N0J32AE])&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For other

&lt;p&gt;* Exxon sells to CLP and China Southern Power Grid (CSG)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Deal marks state-ownded CSG's first overseas investment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* CLP to use internal cash and bank loan to fund the deal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* CLP bought stake from Exxon through two years of
negotiation-CEO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Denny Thomas and Charlie Zhu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has
agreed to sell its 60 percent stake in a Hong Kong utility and a
power storage firm for a combined $3.4 billion, helping the U.S.
oil major raise funds to plough back into its core operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many integrated global oil companies have struggled to boost
production, spending heavily on new projects in recent years. In
the first nine months of this year, Exxon, the world's biggest
oil firm by market value, spent $33 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are also keen to put cash in the pockets of investors
through asset sales, share buybacks or dividends as analysts
grumble about lagging stock prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, CLP Holdings will assume control
of Castle Peak Co Ltd, one of Hong Kong's two electricity
providers, lifting its stake to 70 percent by buying half of
Exxon's holding for HK$12 billion ($1.6 billion). CLP also plans
to buy Exxon's 51 percent stake in Hong Kong Pumped Storage
Development Co for HK$2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State-owned China Southern Power Grid (CSG) will buy the
other 30 percent held by Exxon, making it its first offshore
investment. CSG did not disclose financial terms. But, Betty
Yuen, a senior executive at CLP, told reporters that CSG also
paid HK$12 billion for the 30 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP, which is backed by the wealthy Kadoorie family and has
been providing electricity to Hong Kong for over 100 years, said
the deal will help it better manage and coordinate its Hong Kong
power generation and distribution business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By partnering up with CSG in the acquisition, CLP would have
more options in terms of importing electricity generated by
clean fuels in mainland China to Hong Kong via CSG's grids, CLP
CEO Richard Lancaster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP, like many power producers around the world, is under
pressure to cut emission. Lancaster said CLP will use more
natural gas for generation in the next couple of years.
Currently, coal accounts for about 45 percent of CLP's power
generation, while nuclear makes up 35 percent and the rest comes
from natural gas from central Asia and a field in the South
China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castle Peak Power Co Ltd owns three power stations in Hong
Kong with a total power generation capacity of 6,908 megawatts,
including a 4,108-MW coal-fired plant called Castle Peak and the
2,500-MW gas-fired Black Point power station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of the stake from Exxon came from two years of
"bilateral discussion" with the U.S. oil major instead of an
auction, Lancaster told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People familiar with the matter had told Reuters that Exxon
ran an auction to find a buyer for half its stake earlier this
year. While the sale process elicited some interest from

added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP and Power Assets Holdings Ltd, Hong Kong's
other power supplier, garner an annual return of 9.99 percent on

announced plans to spin off its Hong Kong electricity business
through a Hong Kong IPO, which could raise up to $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP is increasing investment in Hong Kong because of growing
population and power demand, Lancaster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP will use internal resources and a HK$10 billion bridge
loan facility from HSBC Plc  to fund the
acquisition, which CLP executives say should be completed around
mid-2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have plenty of firepower to complete the acquisition,"
said chief financial officer Mark Takahashi, adding that CLP
already has HK$16 billion undrawn loan facilities and HK$3
billion cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP will look at "a range of funding sources from loans to
bonds to possible hybrid securities and even possibly equities"
to replace the bridge loans when they expire, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castle Peak's profit rose 2.7 percent to HK$3.1 billion for

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects company name in lead paragraph to China Southern
Power Grid)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Denny Thomas and Charlie Zhu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Nov 19 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has
agreed to sell its Hong Kong power business for $3.4 billion to
CLP Holdings and state-owned China Southern Power
Grid, helping the U.S. oil major to raise funds to plough back
money into its core operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many integrated global oil companies are keen to control
spending and to put cash in the pockets of investors through
asset sales, share buybacks or dividends as analysts grumble
about lagging stock prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have also struggled to boost production and in recent
years have spent heavily on new projects. In the first nine
months of this year, Exxon alone spent $33 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP, backed by Hong Kong's wealthy Kadoorie family, agreed
to buy half of Exxon's 60 percent stake in Hong Kong utility
Castle Peak Co Ltd for HK$12 billion ($1.6 billion), with CSG
agreeing to buy the other 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CSG confirmed the planned purchase in a separate statement,
but did not disclose how much it plans to pay for the stake. A
person close to the transaction told Reuters that CSG will also
pay HK$12 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world's biggest oil company by market value, is
also selling its 51 percent stake in Hong Kong Pumped Storage
Development Co for HK$2 billion to CLP.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) has agreed to sell its majority stakes in a Hong Kong utility and a power storage firm for a combined $3.4 billion, helping the U.S. oil major raise funds to plough back into its core operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many integrated global oil companies have struggled to boost production, spending heavily on new projects in recent years. In the first nine months of this year, Exxon, the world's biggest oil firm by market value, spent $33 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are also keen to put cash in the pockets of investors through asset sales, share buybacks or dividends as analysts grumble about lagging stock prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, CLP Holdings (0002.HK) will assume control of Castle Peak Co Ltd, one of Hong Kong's main electricity providers, lifting its stake to 70 percent by buying half of Exxon's holding for HK$12 billion ($1.6 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State-owned China Southern Grid will buy the other 30 percent held by Exxon but it did not disclose financial terms. A person close to the transaction told Reuters that CSG will also pay HK$12 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP, which is backed by the wealthy Kadoorie family and has been providing electricity to Hong Kong for over 100 years, said the deal will help it better manage and coordinate its Hong Kong power generation and distribution business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also plans to buy Exxon's 51 percent stake in Hong Kong Pumped Storage Development Co for HK$2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castle Peak Power Co Ltd owns three power stations in Hong Kong with a total power generation capacity of 6,908 megawatts, including a 4,108-MW coal-fired plant called Castle Peak and the 2,500-MW gas-fired Black Point power station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of stake comes after Exxon ran an auction to find a buyer for half its stake earlier this year. While the sale process elicited some interest from Japanese and Southeast Asian bidders, CLP was seen as the natural buyer given its 40 percent existing shareholding, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP and Power Assets Holdings Ltd (0006.HK), Hong Kong's other power supplier that is controlled by tycoon Li Ka-Shing, garner an annual return of 9.99 percent on net fixed assets until 2018 under a government program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power Assets has announced plans to spin off its Hong Kong electricity business through an Hong Kong IPO, which could raise up to $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP will use internal resources and a HK$10 billion loan facility from HSBC Plc (0005.HK) (HSBA.L) to fund the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castle Peak's profit rose 2.7 percent to HK$3.1 billion for year ended December 31, 2012, when it had net assets of HK$540 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP said it was advised by Evercore Partners and HSBC while CSG said it was advised by Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and China International Capital Corp.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Florida congressman Henry "Trey" Radel plans to take a leave of absence and donate his salary to charity, he said on Wednesday night after earlier pleading guilty in D.C. Superior Court to a misdemeanor charge of possession of cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radel, 37, a Republican who was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives last year with the backing of the conservative Tea Party movement, was sentenced to one year of probation on a charge of buying 3.5 grams of cocaine in Washington's Dupont Circle neighborhood on October 29 in the presence of an undercover agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have no excuse for what I have done," he told reporters late Wednesday at his office in Cape Coral, near Fort Myers on Florida's west coast. "I'm owning up to my actions," he added, saying he hoped to be "a better man for southwest Florida" as he struggles to overcome "this disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an earlier statement, Radel said his "struggles with alcoholism" had led him to make an "extremely irresponsible choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am so sorry to be here. I know I have let my constituents down, my country down and, most importantly, my family, including my wife and my 2-year-old, who doesn't know it yet," Radel told Judge Robert Tignor on Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radel said that he would enter an "intensive" in-patient drug treatment program in Florida during his leave of absence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not say how long he planned to be absent, nor which charity would receive his salary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radel appeared to have no plans to resign from the House of Representatives, saying his staff will handle his affairs in his absence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case against Radel stemmed from an investigation by Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration agents into cocaine trafficking in the Washington area, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nihar Mohanty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's guilty plea emerges from a broader narcotics investigation that brought to light information that a sitting member of Congress was routinely using and buying cocaine," U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen Jr. said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court papers indicate that Radel, a former TV broadcaster and radio show host who has described himself on Twitter as a "hip-hop conservative," met an acquaintance and the undercover officer at a Dupont Circle restaurant at 10 p.m. on October 29. Radel told the pair that he had cocaine in his apartment, the court documents say, and he invited them to the apartment to share the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They declined, and the undercover agent offered to sell Radel more cocaine, the papers say. Radel agreed and gave them $260. After they retrieved the cocaine from the acquaintance's vehicle, Radel was approached by officers and dropped the cocaine on the ground. He then invited them to his apartment and surrendered another vial of cocaine, the court papers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radel's attorney, David Schertler, asked for six months of probation for Radel, who under Washington, D.C., law faced up to 180 days in prison and a fine of up to $1,000. Tignor ordered him to pay a $250 fine and serve one year of probation, a typical sentence for a first offender in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Radel had been caught in his home state of Florida buying an equal amount of cocaine he could have faced felony charges that could have resulted in a prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, first-time offenders like Radel "are generally allowed to participate in a Drug Court, where they receive outpatient treatment for a year and then the charges are dismissed," said David Weinstein, a former Florida state prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schertler said that Radel had been in out-patient treatment in Washington, and would enter an in-patient facility in Naples, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Collier County, Florida, which Radel represents in Congress, Democrats called for Radel's resignation and accused him of hypocrisy for, among other things, opposing the legalization of medical marijuana and advocating drug testing for welfare recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Congressman Trey Radel's conduct is an embarrassment to his district and to the state of Florida," Scott Arceneaux, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenny Curry, chairman of Florida's Republican Party, said, "I'm deeply disappointed in Congressman Radel's choices. I am glad that he is seeking help."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Adams and Kevin Gray in Miami; Editing by David Lindsey, Vicki Allen and Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Nov 20, 2013) - Canoe Financial LP, one of the fastest growing mutual fund companies in Canada, announced today it has teamed up with JPMorgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc. to introduce two new mutual funds, continuing the expansion of Canoe's offering to investors.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The new funds are Canoe U.S. Equity Income Class and Canoe Global Equity Income Class. JPMorgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc. is sub-advisor to both funds and is advised by J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. of New York*.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"These new funds reinforce Canoe's reputation for serving Canadian investors by bringing together outstanding portfolio managers and top-tier financial advisors," said W.

			&lt;p&gt;Michael Henderson, executive director and head of sub-advisory relationships for JPMorgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc. said: "Canoe Financial is a logical choice for us as we expand our presence in Canada.

			&lt;p&gt;About the New Canoe Funds: &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Canoe U.S. Equity Income Class&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The fund offers diversification by investing in high-quality, dividend paying companies around the world, but with an emphasis on developed market economies. Its active management approach has the same goals of long-term returns and mitigating risk as the Canoe U.S. Equity Income Fund, but invests at least 40% of its assets outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The J.P. Morgan Investment Management portfolio managers are Gerd Woort-Menker CFA, managing director, and James Davidson CFA, managing director, who manage similar funds for J.P. Morgan's Global Equities Team.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"Both of these new funds are managed by experienced teams supported by more than 200 research analysts around the world. They look for companies that are under-valued, well-managed, financially strong and capable of paying sustainable above-average dividend yields," said Nevin G. Markwart, CFA, president and chief executive officer of Canoe Financial. "Their research-driven approach offers investors the opportunity to diversify and participate in growing sectors and countries through managers with deep knowledge and a commitment to analyzing and minimizing risk.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Florida Congressman Henry "Trey" Radel pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of possession of cocaine in D.C. Superior Court on Wednesday and was sentenced to one year of probation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radel, 37, a Republican who was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives last year with the backing of the conservative Tea Party movement, was charged after buying 3.5 grams of cocaine in Washington's Dupont Circle neighborhood on October 29 in the presence of an undercover agent, the government said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your honor, I apologize for what I've done," Radel told Judge Robert Tignor during the sentencing hearing. In an earlier statement, Radel said his "struggles with alcoholism" had led him to make an "extremely irresponsible choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am so sorry to be here. I know I have let my constituents down, my country down and, most importantly, my family, including my wife and my 2-year-old, who doesn't know it yet," Radel told Tignor in court. Radel added that he would enter a drug treatment program in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his court appearance, Radel did not respond to reporters' shouted questions about whether he intended to resign from the House of Representatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case against Radel stemmed from an investigation by Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration agents into cocaine trafficking in the Washington area, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nihar Mohanty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's guilty plea emerges from a broader narcotics investigation that brought to light information that a sitting member of Congress was routinely using and buying cocaine," U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen Jr. said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court papers indicate that Radel, who has described himself on Twitter as a "hip-hop conservative," met an acquaintance and the undercover officer at a Dupont Circle restaurant at 10 p.m. on October 29. Radel told the pair that he had cocaine in his apartment, the court documents say, and he invited them to the apartment to share the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They declined, and the undercover agent offered to sell Radel more cocaine, the papers say. Radel agreed and gave them $260. After they retrieved the cocaine from the acquaintance's vehicle, Radel was approached by officers and dropped the cocaine on the ground. He then invited them to his apartment and surrendered another vial of cocaine, the court papers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radel's attorney, David Schertler, asked for six months of probation for Radel, who under Washington, D.C., law faced up to 180 days in prison and a fine of up to $1,000.

&lt;p&gt;(The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Alison Frankel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Is this timing merely a coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, JPMorgan Chase and the Houston law firm Gibbs &amp; Bruns announced that they had reached a $4.5 billion settlement to resolve allegations that the bank breached representations and warranties to private investors in 330 JPMorgan and Bear Stearns mortgage-backed securities trusts. Gibbs &amp; Bruns negotiated the JPMorgan settlement on behalf of 21 major institutional investors, including BlackRock, Pimco, Goldman Sachs and MetLife. Two days after the JPMorgan announcement, Kathy Patrick of Gibbs appeared in New York State Supreme Court to make her closing argument in support of her clients' previous deal, an $8.5 billion settlement with Bank of America that has been held up for 2-1/2 years by a small group of Countrywide MBS investors who object to the deal. Will Patrick be back in court in 2016 to defend the JPMorgan settlement?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She could well be, but there are important differences between the JPMorgan and BofA put-back settlements, some structural and some a matter of circumstance, that should reduce the friction for JPMorgan. Gibbs &amp; Bruns, which is slated to receive $85 million , or 1 percent, in fees if the BofA settlement is approved, is in line for $66 million, or 1.47 percent, in fees from the JPMorgan deal, according to the JPMorgan settlement agreement. That extra share will be worth it to JPMorgan if Gibbs &amp; Bruns used its bruising experience with Countrywide MBS objectors to improve the new deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARTICLE 77&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's look first at tweaks to the settlement structure. Bank of America's settlement was actually filed by Bank of New York Mellon, the lone MBS trustee for all of the 430 Countrywide trusts whose breach-of-contract claims would be resolved in the proposed $8.5 billion deal. BNY Mellon asked for a judicial determination, through a special New York state-court trust proceeding known as Article 77, that it was acting within its discretion when it accepted BofA's global settlement offer. BofA, BNY Mellon and the Gibbs &amp; Bruns group believed that to obtain approval of the settlement under the broad latitude trustees enjoy under New York law, BNY Mellon would simply have to show that it did not abuse its power or act in conflict with the trusts' interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectors, led by AIG, have since howled that (among other things) BNY Mellon made no distinction between Countrywide MBS trusts when it agreed to a global settlement. As the lone trustee, it accepted BofA's offer on behalf of all of the 430 Countrywide trusts in the deal. BofA, BNY Mellon and the investor group, meanwhile, have stood by the one-for-all nature of the global settlement. If the court finds that BNY Mellon did not properly execute its trustee duties, they contend, the entire $8.5 billion settlement collapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan settlement, by contrast, involves seven different MBS trustees and seems to anticipate that not all of the trustees will participate in the settlement on behalf of all the JPMorgan and Bear trusts they oversee. The agreement between the bank and the Gibbs &amp; Bruns group, remember, is meaningless unless the MBS trustees enter the deal, since only the trustees have the power to settle the trusts' claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investors in the Gibbs group have a large enough stake to direct the decisions of the trustees in many of the trusts (though the settlement agreement does not specify how many). Trustees overseeing trusts that aren't controlled by Gibbs investors will have to make their own determination about whether to enter the settlement. Trustees will also have to decide whether to ask courts to approve their settlement decisions. The agreement between Gibbs &amp; Bruns and JPMorgan does not refer explicitly to trustees obtaining court approval through New York's Article 77 or any other trust proceeding, and trustees could theoretically enter the settlement without approval from certificate holders or a court. Chances are, though, that if the trustees agree to settle, they will ask a judge to bless that decision in order to insulate themselves from potential liability to MBS certificate holders in the trusts they oversee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPM'S WALKAWAY PROVISION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike BofA, JPMorgan seems to be willing to proceed with the settlement even if some of the 330 trusts reject the deal. The agreement with Gibbs &amp; Bruns includes a provision on "non-settling trusts" that envisions a few such scenarios: A trustee may decline to enter the settlement for any or all of the trusts it's in charge of, or a court may refuse to approve a trustee's decision to settle. In any of those events, the non-settling trust's share of the $4.5 billion would revert to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That provision, which seems akin to an opt-out in a class action settlement, could save JPMorgan a lot of grief. In some JPMorgan or Bear trusts, investors outside of the Gibbs &amp; Bruns group hold enough voting rights to direct the actions of the trustee; some of the trusts in this deal - unlike the BofA deal - are backed by bond insurers, who typically call the shots for offerings they've insured. If controlling investors or bond insurers don't like the proposed JPMorgan settlement, they can presumably instruct the trustee to reject it. JPMorgan has a walk-away provision in the agreement with Gibbs &amp; Bruns, in the event that a lot of trusts refuse to enter the settlement. But if it's only a few, the bank will still be able to resolve most of its put-back liability to private investors through the Gibbs settlement and can settle separately with the opt-outs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan agreement also gives trustees 60 days to evaluate the settlement, and more time if they request it and the bank agrees. In the BofA deal, objectors have hammered BNY Mellon for agreeing to BofA's $8.5 billion offer without examining underlying mortgage loan files for breaches of representations and warranties. The JPMorgan settlement seems to anticipate that trustees will want to see such documentation; the bank pledges in the agreement to expedite document production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor can the trustees be accused of colluding with JPMorgan to reach the settlement - as BNY Mellon has been in the BofA case - because they weren't part of the negotiations of the deal. They're tasked with deciding simply whether the settlement is fair to the trusts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE BAUPOST CASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these changes seem designed to blunt the power of potential objectors, who can't leverage their influence to try and tank the entire deal and (depending on how trustees opt to evaluate the settlement proposal) can't make some of the most persuasive points AIG and its fellow objectors have made about BNY Mellon and BofA in the Countrywide deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not to say there won't be objectors. Unlike Bank of America, which was facing put-back claims by only one private Countrywide MBS investor at the time it reached its proposed global settlement, JPMorgan and Bear are already defending several breach-of-contract suits by trustees acting at the direction of certificate holders in various trusts. The furthest-along case involves claims by the Boston hedge fund Baupost in Chancery Court in Delaware, where Ropes &amp; Gray's summary judgment motion for Baupost is pending. There are also put-back cases under way in New York state court by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan and Labaton Sucharow. And, of course, there are well-developed breach-of-contract cases against JPMorgan and Bear by bond insurers, in both state and federal court. Lead lawyers in those cases either declined to comment or didn't return my calls, but clearly, the monolines and certificate holders who have already instructed trustees to file put-back claims may not be thrilled with a settlement they didn't negotiate, especially since their lawyers have already sunk time and money into the litigation. It will be particularly interesting to see if the Gibbs &amp; Bruns group also has a big stake in any of the trusts with pending suits against JPMorgan and Bear, and how that impacts the litigation. Trustees may be stuck, for instance, between Gibbs investors that support the settlement and bond insurers that don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If existing put-back suits increase the likelihood that the JPMorgan settlement will face opposition, the statute of limitations may have an opposite effect. When Bank of America proposed its global settlement in June 2011, investors were still within the six-year time limit for breach-of-contract claims under New York law for most MBS. Since then, two state-court trial judges overseeing MBS put-back litigation have reached different conclusions about when the clock starts ticking. The intermediate state appeals court will hear the issue next month. If it sides with the trial judges who said time runs out six years after the MBS offering date, then investors who haven't already sued JPMorgan will have little hope of recovery outside of the global settlement (assuming, of course, that they haven't signed tolling agreements with the bank). That could be a very important consideration for trustees evaluating whether to enter the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan lawyers have had their hands full in finalizing the Justice Department settlement, but if I were them, I'd get serious now about settling with the private investors and bond insurers that have filed put-back claims. Settling in the next 60 days will minimize the odds that trustees will reject the Gibbs &amp; Bruns deal. I should point out, of course, that litigation over the BofA global put-back deal went in directions I sure didn't foresee (and I wasn't the only one!). Strange things happen when this much money is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alison Frankel; Editing by Ted Botha)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;4th Generation Scale-Out All-Flash Array Also Achieves Outstanding Price-Performance&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;NEWTON, MA--(Marketwired - Nov 20, 2013) - Kaminario, the leading scale-out all-flash array provider, today announced that it has broken the Storage Performance Council's SPC-2 MBPS world record for processing throughput and SPC-2 price performance, with its fourth-generation K2 (K2 v4) array performing at an average data throughput of 33,477.03 SPC-2 MBPS [A]. At nearly twice the speed of the previous world record [B], the K2 v4 was also able to provide one of the top 10 [C] SPC-2 price-performance results at $29.79, allowing organizations to lower their total cost of ownership without sacrificing the overall performance of their storage system. This achievement marks the second SPC world-record achieved by the K2 v4 in just five weeks, as it set the new world record for the SPC-1 benchmark performing at 1,239,898.00 SPC-1 IOPS [D] in mid-October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To set the new SPC-2 benchmark, Kaminario used the same off-the-shelf 86 TB system with SanDisk's Optimus SAS SSD used last month to break the SPC-1 world record in performance [D]. This real-world configuration makes real-time analytics much easier and less costly, while providing the best possible performance in the industry. Companies can now purchase a single all-flash array for online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP), drastically reducing the time, overall cost and complexity required to analyze big data in real-time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In setting this new world record, we have proven once again that our fourth-generation scale-out architecture simplifies what has otherwise become a time-consuming and expensive process to analyze big data in real-time," said Dani Golan, CEO of Kaminario. "Customers can get up and running in no time with zero tuning for both their OLTP and OLAP applications, ensuring constant high performance at the lowest TCO on market." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;K2's record-breaking performance was the direct result of its unique scale-out architecture, allowing the array to fully harness the power of today's flash media. With the ability to support all workloads in physical and virtual environments Kaminario delivers not only unsurpassed performance but the industry's lowest latency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*The Full Disclosure Report for the Kaminario K2 SPC-2 Results can be downloaded at:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A] http://www.storageperformance.org/results/benchmark_results_spc2#b00068&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[B]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPC-2 MBPS&#160;--------&#160;Audit ID&#160;---------&#160;TSC Name

&lt;p&gt;Lack of trust in employers has often led Chinese workers to balk at takeovers they fear will worsen employment conditions, and the confrontation in the industrial city of Dongguan marked the latest incident in a wave of industrial unrest at Chinese affiliates of foreign manufacturing firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers outside the factory gates said they were battling to change new contracts offering them worse employment terms that they said they had been forced to sign after the September deal between the U.S. software giant and the Finnish handset maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will definitely continue to fight until we get what's fair," said Zhang, a young male worker who gave only his surname.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riot police beat up four workers on Wednesday morning and took them away, several witnesses told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in emailed comments to Reuters, Nokia said interaction between protesters and police had been "restrained (and) peaceful", adding it was continuing to talk to the protesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 30 police officers kept watch as workers clad in white Nokia uniforms held up banners with the slogans "Legally protect our rights" and "Demand fair compensation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our manufacturing operations in Dongguan continue," it said.

&lt;p&gt;By James Pomfret&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONGGUAN, China Nov 20 (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers
massed outside a Nokia factory in southern China on
Wednesday to protest against what they called unfair treatment
following the sale of the company's mobile phones business to
Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of trust in employers has often led Chinese workers to
balk at takeovers they fear will worsen employment conditions,
and the confrontation in the industrial city of Dongguan marked
the latest incident in a wave of industrial unrest at Chinese
affiliates of foreign manufacturing firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers outside the factory gates said they were battling to
change new contracts offering them worse employment terms that
they said they had been forced to sign after the September deal
between the U.S. software giant and the Finnish handset maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will definitely continue to fight until we get what's
fair," said Zhang, a young male worker who gave only his
surname.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riot police beat up four workers on Wednesday morning and
took them away, several witnesses told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in emailed comments to Reuters, Nokia said interaction
between protesters and police had been "restrained (and)
peaceful", adding it was continuing to talk to the protesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 30 police officers kept watch as workers clad in white
Nokia uniforms held up banners with the slogans "Legally protect
our rights" and "Demand fair compensation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our manufacturing operations in Dongguan continue," it
said. "To accommodate the temporary situation, we have also
adjusted our operations in other manufacturing facilities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six protesters interviewed by Reuters said they had not
heard from management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They won't do anything until things reach a critical

said he had worked at the factory for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DENIALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The precise nature of the employees' grievances was not
immediately clear, but an industry source with direct knowledge
of the protest said Nokia had balked at what it saw as a demand
for severance packages to workers who would retain their jobs
under Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source, who declined to be named, said he did not expect
lay-offs at the 5,000-worker plant as a result of the deal with
Microsoft, and denied claims from factory workers interviewed by
Reuters that the Microsoft deal affected the pay of thousands of
employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia, which declined to elaborate on its statement, agreed
in September to sell its devices and services business and
license its patents to Microsoft after failing to recover from a
late start in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale is due to close in the first quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, workers at a joint venture of U.S.-based Cooper
Tire &amp; Rubber Co and state-owned tyremaker Chengshan
Group went on strike after Cooper agreed to be bought by an
Indian firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters said they doubted the ability of Indian tyremaker
Apollo Tyres Ltd. to bail out Cooper's debts, and
Chengshan eventually asked to dissolve the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, an American factory boss was held hostage in a
Beijing plant for days by dozens of employees demanding
severance packages.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, CA--(Marketwired - Nov 20, 2013) -  PaperG, the ad technology company that automatically creates and distributes digital display ads across platforms, welcomes Marc McDonald, Microsoft's first employee, to its fast-growing engineering team in Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the first employee at Microsoft, Marc brings a seasoned perspective and expertise to the PaperG team. He invented the FAT File System for Standalone Basic, which was the file system for the MS-DOS operating system and Microsoft Windows.

"One of the exciting and intriguing aspects of PaperG is that the technology gathers content from the web, uses a set of design templates, and automatically builds and distributes a targeted ad campaign. I'm really excited to work on the design and crawl capabilities of the automation technology." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc joins the company as a software architect and will redesign PaperG's platforms into a more service-oriented architecture, allowing for a more fault-tolerant system while speeding up developer workflows as the company grows. Marc will also be responsible for optimizing the company's content collection engine to automatically create ads faster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're honored to have Marc on our team," said CTO Victor Cheng. "He's made huge contributions to the world of software engineering and we couldn't be happier that he's chosen to work with PaperG. His experience in intelligent layout design will help us take our advertising technology to the next level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About PaperG

&lt;p&gt;KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia Nov 20 (Reuters) - General Electric
 has won a contract worth around 2.1 billion riyals ($560
million) to supply Saudi Electricity Co (SEC) with gas
and steam turbines for two new power plants in Riyadh, sources
familiar with the deal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utility company announced the contract award on
Wednesday but did not name the winner, and a spokesman declined
to comment further. A General Electric spokesman in Saudi Arabia
could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve gas units and four steam turbines will be built and
tested within 40 months, SEC said in a statement. The company is
investing billions of dollars in projects to meet electricity
demand that is rising by around 9 percent annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEC did not provide the capacity of the two power plants but
an industry source said each would have a capacity of between 
1,600 and 1,950 megawatts. An engineering, procurement and
construction (EPC) tender for the plants is expected to be
issued soon, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DONGGUAN, China Nov 20 (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers
shouted slogans on Wednesday outside a Nokia factory
in southern China to protest against what they called unfair
compensation after the company sold its mobile telephones
business to Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of trust in employers has often led Chinese workers to
balk at takeovers they fear will harm employment conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers massed outside the factory gates in the industrial
city of Dongguan said they were battling new contracts worsening
employment terms that they had been forced to sign after the
U.S. software giant bought Nokia's unit in a September deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will definitely continue to fight until we get what's
fair," said a young male worker wearing a checked shirt, who
gave only his surname, Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local riot police beat up four workers on Wednesday morning
and took them away, several witnesses told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 30 police officers kept watch as workers clad in white
Nokia uniforms held up banners with the slogans "Legally protect
our rights" and "Demand fair compensation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia is continuing to talk to the protesters, the
Finland-based company told Reuters in an e-mailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our manufacturing operations in Dongguan continue," it
said. "To accommodate the temporary situation, we have also
adjusted our operations in other manufacturing facilities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But six protesters interviewed by Reuters said they had not
heard from management at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They haven't shown any sincerity in talking to us, and they
won't do anything until things reach a critical stage," said one
worker, who gave only his surname, Yang, and said he had worked
at the factory for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia balked at what it saw as a demand for severance
packages to workers who would not be fired, said an industry
source with direct knowledge of the protest, who asked not to be
named to avoid inflaming the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A small group of employees is taking this as an opportunity
to demand severance packages despite the fact that their jobs
will continue," the source said, adding that he did not expect
lay-offs as a result of the deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protesters represent just a few hundred of the 5,000
workers in the Dongguan factory, the industry source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factory workers interviewed by Reuters said the Microsoft
deal affected the compensation of thousands of workers, a claim 
the industry source characterised as untrue. Nokia declined to

business and license its patents to Microsoft after failing to
recover from a late start in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale is set to close in the first quarter of next year,
after regulatory approvals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent industrial unrest at the China units of foreign firms
has ranged from strikes to hostage-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, workers at a joint venture of U.S.-based Cooper
Tire &amp; Rubber Co and state-owned tyremaker Chengshan
Group went on strike after Cooper agreed to be bought by an
Indian firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters said they doubted the ability of Indian tyremaker
Apollo Tyres Ltd. to bail out Cooper's debts, and
Chengshan eventually asked to dissolve the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, an American factory boss was held hostage in a
Beijing plant for days by dozens of employees demanding
severance packages.&lt;/p&gt;

			SOA Software Announces SOA and API Intermediation for Microsoft 
      Environments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Intermediary for Microsoft Adds Increased Security, Mediation, 
      and Routing
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SOA Software, an API 
      Management and SOA 
      Governance leader that powers the API economy, is adding a new 
      product, Intermediary for Microsoft, to its portfolio for 
      Microsoft-based APIs and SOA services. Built entirely on the Microsoft 
      platform, the Intermediary for Microsoft runs as an independent network 
      management point and acts as an SOA and API intermediary between front 
      end mobile, cloud, and portal applications, and backend Microsoft 
      resources. The new product lets customers virtualize their 
      Microsoft services environment, adding powerful new features to their 
      API and SOA services such as Windows security, NET.TCP mediation, and 
      dynamic routing without having to write new code or modify their 
      existing infrastructure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Microsoft customers, like users of any software stack, face challenges 
      in security, management and performance when they expose backend 
      services through APIs and web services,&#8221; said Alistair Farquharson, CTO 
      of SOA Software. &#8220;Now, with Intermediary for Microsoft, we are excited 
      to offer a new solution to solve some of the most challenging aspects of 
      integrating backend Microsoft resources into an SOA and API program. 
      And, because we designed the solution specifically for and on the 
      Microsoft platform, customers can rest assured that they can continue to 
      leverage all of their existing Microsoft investments.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Intermediary for Microsoft connects front end mobile, cloud, and 
      portal applications, to backend Microsoft resources. Intermediary for 
      Microsoft works without the need to modify front end clients or backend 
      services, write new code, or perform expensive integrations. With its 
      policy-driven approach to modeling SOA and API service interactions, and 
      backed by a feature rich registry / repository and full developer 
      portal, the Intermediary for Microsoft manages an entire Microsoft SOA 
      and API program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SOA Software, a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, is committed to 
      offering the full set of SOA and API management features required by 
      Microsoft customers. The company has long offered full lifecycle SOA and 
      API management solutions for Microsoft environments. Intermediary for 
      Microsoft augments these capabilities, e.g., securely exposing a backend 
      Microsoft service as a Windows Phone REST API, or exposing a full 
      Microsoft services environment to an internal company portal built on 
      another technology. Now, all backend Microsoft resources can play a 
      vital role in cloud, mobile, and internal environments. Whether a 
      Microsoft environment utilizes Active Directory, Windows Server and 
      BizTalk, or Windows Azure, Service Bus, and WebAPI, Intermediary for 
      Microsoft offers seamless SOA and API management support.

      Research and Markets: Microsoft Lync: Market Impact and Growth Potential
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/85k3nk/microsoft_lync) 
      has announced the addition of the "Microsoft 
      Lync: Market Impact and Growth Potential" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft's portfolio development and strategic direction have been in 
      line with the greater momentum in the evolution of the enterprise 
      communications industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      More important, the company has driven certain key aspects of this 
      evolutionary process. This report evaluates the current competitive 
      position of Microsoft Lync and discusses where Lync-based solutions will 
      stand in coming years. The study also assesses the impact of Microsoft 
      Lync on channel and technology partners and competitors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first iteration of Microsoft's unified communications (UC) 
      platforms, Live Communications Server (LCS), was unveiled to the 
      industry ten years ago. Ever since then Microsoft's initiatives in the 
      unified communications and collaboration (UCC) market have remained a 
      persistent and lively topic of discussion among all parties with a stake 
      in the industry. Primarily an enterprise presence and instant messaging 
      engine which displaced Exchange Instant Messaging, LCS was designed and 
      positioned as complimentary and a value-add not only for other Microsoft 
      platforms, including Active Directory, SQL, Exchange and more, but also 
      for third-party communications platforms such as private branch 
      exchanges (PBX) and conferencing platforms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As Microsoft gained experience and expertise in the realm of real-time 
      communications applications development and integration, the 
      Redmond-based company increased its appetite and set its sights on a 
      bigger slice of the communications market. Opportunities and greater 
      control could be gained by relying less on third-parties for core 
      real-time voice and video elements-Microsoft could develop these on its 
      own.

			Feedstock Flexibility Provides Significant Competitive Advantage, 
      Says ExxonMobil Chemical President
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Sustained innovation key to capturing feedstock advantage
      
			
        Ability of new ExxonMobil steam cracker in Singapore to convert crude 
        to chemicals raises the bar
      
			
        Advantages seen in ExxonMobil&#8217;s chemical operations across the world
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Innovation and integration resulting in greater feedstock flexibility 
      have provided a significant competitive advantage for ExxonMobil&#8217;s 
      chemical business, Steve Pryor, president of ExxonMobil Chemical 
      Company, told attendees at the Gulf Petrochemicals and Chemicals 
      Association 8th Annual Forum today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pryor noted that the feedstock landscape is always shifting, influenced 
      by trends and innovations within the chemical industry, as well as in 
      the upstream and refining sectors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As an integrated company, ExxonMobil is constantly moving feedstock 
      across our upstream, downstream and chemical operations to generate the 
      most value from each molecule,&#8221; said Pryor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For example, in Europe, our Rotterdam aromatics plant has been designed 
      to receive feedstock from nine ExxonMobil refineries and chemical 
      plants. Pooling feedstock supply, together with advanced technology, has 
      enabled this plant to become the largest and one of the most profitable 
      in the region.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pryor said feedstock flexibility remains a central element of ExxonMobil 
      Chemical&#8217;s investment strategy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For example, in the U.S. Gulf Coast, we expanded our gas cracking 
      capability while retaining our capacity to process refinery liquids,&#8221; 
      Pryor said. ExxonMobil has also continued to develop new technologies 
      that raise the bar on feedstock flexibility. &#8220;A case in point is the new 
      steam cracker at our Singapore refining and petrochemical complex. This 
      world-scale unit can process an unprecedented range of feedstocks, 
      including crude oil.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Converting crude directly into chemicals provides a cost advantage over 
      naphtha feedstock, the industry standard in Asia, Pryor said. It also 
      saves energy and reduces emissions by eliminating the refining steps 
      required to produce naphtha.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Crude cracking is a first for our company, a first for the world, and 
      yet another step in our industry&#8217;s ongoing search for advantaged 
      chemical feedstock,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For chemical companies to maintain a 
      competitive advantage in this ever-changing environment, we must 
      continuously innovate across the value chain -- from our raw materials 
      to our finished products.&#8221;

      JPMorgan Chase  Co. announced today that it has reached a $13 billion 
      settlement in principle negotiated by the President&#8217;s RMBS Working Group 
      of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force. Today&#8217;s settlement 
      resolves actual and potential civil claims by the Department of Justice 
      (DoJ), several State Attorneys General (State AGs), the Federal Deposit 
      Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration

      residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) activities by JPMorgan 
      Chase, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the settlement, JPMorgan Chase will pay a total of $9 billion in 
      cash and provide $4 billion in borrower relief. The cash portion 
      consists of a $2 billion civil monetary penalty and $7 billion in

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc lost more than $1 billion on currency trades during the third quarter, regulatory filings show, offering some insight into why the firm, considered one of Wall Street's most savvy traders, reported its worst quarter in a key trading unit since the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign exchange was the only trading area that was a money loser, according to regulatory data issued in November. In the third quarter, Goldman reported its weakest revenue - $1.3 billion - in fixed-income, currency and commodities trading since the height of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data, which come from regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve, are reported in aggregate and do not always reflect the way banks tally up their own profits and losses on trading desks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Thursday, Goldman Sachs said that the numbers in regulatory filings "are not representative of the manner in which the firm manages its business activities." According to Goldman's internal calculations, it did not suffer a loss in its currencies trading business in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's trading businesses book profits and losses only on trades that originate within them. Profits and losses from currency trading transactions that originated in another division, and are paired with other kinds of trades, are attributed to that division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Accordingly, gains or losses in one product type frequently offset gains or losses in other product types," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC and Fed require banks to report data in aggregate, based on the product rather than the unit that originated a trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's currency-trading problems came from the way the bank had positioned itself in emerging markets, two sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific positions could not be learned, but the bank was anticipating that the Federal Reserve would begin winding down its monetary-easing programs, the sources said. When the Fed unexpectedly announced that it would keep its massive bond-buying program in place, Goldman was left with positions that lost money, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to SEC data, Goldman had negative revenue of $1.3 billion in currencies, while JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co was $65 million in the red. Morgan Stanley reported $594 million in currency revenue, Citigroup Inc reported $558 million and Bank of America Corp reported $215 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some of Goldman's rivals also said they had a difficult quarter in currency trading, indicating that internal revenue calculations differ from government reporting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a conference call to discuss earnings on October 17, Goldman Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz blamed Goldman's weak currency trading on "difficulty managing inventory," as well as reduced client trading volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that call, multiple analysts asked Schwartz to provide more details about what went wrong in currency trading. Kian Abouhossein, an analyst with JPMorgan, asked why the bank held any inventory at all in what is "a very liquid market," and asked him to explain whether Goldman had hedged or exited its troublesome currency positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz declined to provide details on Goldman's positions but said the bank had reduced currency-trading risk during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's 47 percent drop in fixed-income, currency and commodities revenue last quarter surprised not only its investors but traders at rival firms, because it is typically one of the best trading firms on Wall Street. In research notes following Goldman's results, analysts said they considered it a one-time event and not indicative of broader problems. The bank's stock fell 2 percent that day, but has since risen about 4 percent. It closed at $165 on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect FICC to rebound significantly in the fourth quarter of 2013 as Goldman Sachs' franchise remains strong and predominantly FX related inventory management challenges are unlikely to recur," said Sandler O'Neill analyst Jeffery Harte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Carrick Mollenkamp; Editing by Grant McCool)&lt;/p&gt;

offset gains or losses in other product types," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC and Fed require banks to report data in aggregate,
based on the product rather than the unit that originated a
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's currency-trading problems came from the way the
bank had positioned itself in emerging markets, two sources
familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific positions could not be learned, but the bank was
anticipating that the Federal Reserve would begin winding down
its monetary-easing programs, the sources said. When the Fed
unexpectedly announced that it would keep its massive
bond-buying program in place, Goldman was left with positions
that lost money, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to SEC data, Goldman had negative revenue of $1.3

million in the red. Morgan Stanley reported $594 million
in currency revenue, Citigroup Inc reported $558 million

Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz blamed Goldman's weak

4 percent. It closed at $165 on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect FICC to rebound significantly in the fourth

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects eighth paragraph to attribute data to SEC instead of
the Fed)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Lauren Tara LaCapra and Cezary Podkul&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
lost more than $1 billion on currency trades during the third
quarter, recent regulatory filings show, offering some insight
into why the firm, considered one of Wall Street's most savvy
traders, reported its worst quarter in a key trading unit since
the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign exchange was the only trading area that was a money
loser, according to regulatory data. In the third quarter,
Goldman reported its weakest revenue - $1.3 billion - in
fixed-income, currency and commodities trading since the height
of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data, which come from regulatory filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve, are
reported in aggregate and do not always reflect the way banks
tally up their own profits and losses on trading desks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs exchanges foreign currencies for clients, some
of whom also pair the currency trades with trading designed to
hedge interest-rate moves. But that type of currency trading at
Goldman is separate from the performance of its currency trading
business, which is headed globally by Guy Saidenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's currency-trading problems came from the way the
bank had positioned itself in emerging markets, two sources
familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific positions could not be learned, but the bank was
anticipating that the Federal Reserve would begin winding down
its monetary-easing programs, the sources said. When the Fed
unexpectedly announced that it would keep its massive
bond-buying program in place, Goldman was left with positions
that, "absolutely got annihilated," as one person familiar with
the matter put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to SEC data, Goldman had negative revenue of $1.3
billion in currencies, while JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co was $65
million in the red. Morgan Stanley reported $594 million
in currency revenue, Citigroup Inc reported $558 million
and Bank of America Corp reported $215 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some of Goldman's rivals also said they had a

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) plans to keep overall compensation per employee roughly flat this year from last year, lagging gains at rivals, as the bank's massive legal settlements weigh on its results, two sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonuses were largely set early this week, though payouts could change in unusual situations or if there is an unexpected change in the company's results during the last six weeks of the year, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. It is not yet clear what Chief Executive Jamie Dimon's bonus for 2013 will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay increases have been muted across much of the banking sector in the aftermath of the financial crisis, but JPMorgan's plans are on the low end of what experts forecast for the industry this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, compensation consultant Johnson Associates estimated that commercial and retail bankers overall will get bonuses that are unchanged to 5 percent higher this year. It estimated bonuses across all of Wall Street, including large asset management firms, will be up 5 to 10 percent. Recruiting firm Options Group estimated that average pay will rise 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But JPMorgan has higher legal expenses than rivals. On Tuesday, the bank agreed to pay $13 billion to the U.S. government to settle charges it misrepresented the quality of mortgages it sold to investors before the housing crisis. After taxes, that settlement is equal to nearly half of what the bank can earn in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without legal settlements, JPMorgan's profit would have been about 27 percent higher in the first three quarters than the same period last year, an increase that would have made it easier for the company to boost pay per employee this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank could have taken more dramatic steps to cut costs after recent settlements, like cutting pay across the board or reducing staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its executives believe the legal costs are a temporary drain on profits, and do not want to force current employees to bear too much of the burden of the settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Dimon said this week that it would not be fair to penalize current employees for actions that occurred years ago, largely at banks that JPMorgan acquired in the heat of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have never blamed employees broadly for mistakes that were made away from them," Dimon said on Tuesday in response to a question from a stock analyst about compensation expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOME UP, SOME DOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if pay on average will be more or less unchanged, an individual's pay may rise or fall, depending on the performance of the employee's unit, and his or her own work, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mortgage lending, for example, overall pay is expected to be down because of the dramatic decline in loan refinancing volume. Asset management employees will generally see pay go up following gains in that division that have come with the higher stock market. Within JPMorgan's investment bank, where the year has been good for some units and bad for others, pay generally will be up a little, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 156,000 of JPMorgan's 255,000 employees work in retail, mortgage and credit card businesses, where pay is generally lower than in its investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's headcount has fallen a little since the end of last year, when it was around 259,000, but most of the job cuts have been in lower-wage jobs rather than the investment bank. The bank does not disclose total compensation expense for the whole of JPMorgan Chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement JPMorgan signed this week covers its mortgage lending, sales and securitization practices from more than five years ago. Mortgage deals done by Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual before JPMorgan acquired them accounted for about three-fourths of the liabilities involved in recent mortgage settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's bonus for 2013 has not been set, but for 2012, the board cut his total pay in half to $11.5 million, citing the $6.2 billion of "London Whale" trading losses that happened under his watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after the substantial checks JPMorgan has written, its legal and regulatory issues are not over. The bank faces at least nine other government probes, covering everything from its hiring practices in China to whether it manipulated the Libor benchmark interest rate. It may still also face criminal charges linked to mortgage matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter, JPMorgan lost $380 million after it set aside more than $7 billion, after taxes, to cover litigation expenses. It was the bank's first quarterly loss since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said last month it has some $23 billion set aside to cover remaining litigation expenses. The $13 billion settlement it agreed to this week is covered by that figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nadia Damouni and David Henry; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra, Leslie Adler and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) plans to keep overall compensation roughly flat this year from last year, in a sign that employees will feel at least some pain from the bank's recent legal settlements, according to two sources familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

      only class X-C.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 60 loans secured by 113 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.136 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association; General Electric Capital 
      Corporation; Ladder Capital Finance LLC; and Redwood Commercial Mortgage 
      Corporation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 74.4% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 85.1%, and asset summary reviews on 85.1%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.10x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 106.6%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 8.52%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 8.73% to issuer cash flows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Leverage: This transaction has higher leverage than other recent 
      Fitch-rated fixed-rate deals. The pool's Fitch LTV of 106.6% is higher 
      than the 2012 and first-half 2013 averages of 97.2% and 99.8%, 
      respectively. However, excluding the two largest loans which are secured 
      by multifamily properties in New York City and San Francisco, the pool's 
      Fitch LTV is 103%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Multifamily Concentration: The pool has a multifamily concentration of 
      29.6%, which is significantly higher than the first-half 2013 average 
      concentration of 8.9%. The two largest loans in the pool, The Aire 
      (11.9%) and Veritas Multifamily Portfolio (8.1%) are collateralized by 
      multifamily properties located in CBDs of primary markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Subordinate Debt: Seven loans, representing 33.7% of the pool balance, 
      have subordinate debt in place, including four of the five largest loans 
      in the pool (30.1%). The Aire has a $25 million B-note and unsecured 
      debt in place. The transaction has a Fitch total debt stack LTV and DSCR 
      of 118.9% and 1.01x, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Property Quality: Fitch assigned property quality grades of 'A' or 'A-' 
      to three of the 15 largest loans in the pool, which represent 17.9% of 
      the pool balance. Furthermore, property quality grades of 'B+' or better 
      were assigned to 65.7% of the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch performed two model-based break-even analyses to determine the 
      level of cash flow and value deterioration the pool could withstand 
      prior to $1 of loss being experienced by the 'BBB-sf' and 'AAAsf' rated 
      classes. Fitch found that the JPMCC 2013-C16 pool could withstand a 
      45.4% decline in value (based on appraised values at issuance) and an 
      approximately 13.3% decrease to the most recent actual cash flow prior 
      to experiencing a $1 of loss to the 'BBB-sf' rated class. Additionally, 
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 54.3% decline in value and 
      an approximately 27.5% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to any 'AAAsf' rated class.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.

      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 
      rated 'CMS1-' by Fitch. The special servicer will be Midland Loan 
      Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association, rated 'CSS1' by

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase today announced a donation of $100,000 to support 
      residents as they begin the difficult recovery after tornadoes and 
      storms swept through communities in Illinois and Indiana. The grant will 
      go to the American Red Cross for their Midwest Tornado and Storms fund, 
      earmarked for those communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The people at the American Red Cross work tirelessly to respond to 
      devastation and now, unfortunately, it&#8217;s hit our community,&#8221; said Glenn 
      Tilton, chairman of the Midwest for JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;We hope our grant 
      helps bring some relief to those affected and let them know we are here 
      to help.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally, to provide affected customers time to focus on rebuilding, 
      Chase will automatically waive late fees on credit cards, as well as our 
      consumer loan products, such as mortgages and auto loans, for customers 
      in 13 Illinois counties through November 29. Chase will also waive fees 
      on checking accounts that would otherwise be charged for a lack of 
      funds, such as overdraft or insufficient fund fees.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp aims to upstage rival Sony Corp with a console that goes well beyond gaming and helps transform media viewing, a long-cherished but elusive goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software giant is betting its first new video game console in eight years, which goes on sale on Friday, will help sustain its position as a dominant player in gaming hardware. It also hopes to build a high-margin, rapid-growth business that plays a bigger role in how people watch television and consume media content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The console has received early positive reviews for its performance, interface and exclusive launch games. Yusuf Mehdi, chief marketing and strategy officer for Xbox, said preorders for Xbox One were running at twice the rate of 2005's Xbox 360 but declined to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to be on track for the biggest launch in Xbox history," Mehdi said. "We're building the largest volume of consoles that we've ever done." He added that the company is anticipating an adequate supply to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Xbox games and consoles, including the blockbuster "Halo" game franchise, yielded 10 percent of total Microsoft sales in the last fiscal year. A successful launch could give a much-needed lift to the software titan, which is trying to become a significant player in hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft wants to become a "devices and services" giant as it struggles to find the right formula and hire a new chief executive to take on Google Inc, Apple Inc, and Amazon.com Inc in a mobile-computing era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's Sony, which launched its new PlayStation 4 gaming console last week, and Nintendo Co Ltd, which has struggled with slow sales of its next-generation Wii U console, have also crammed media apps and content onto their machines, but analysts say Microsoft is taking it a step further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox One, which will launch in 13 markets worldwide, will cater to its loyal gamer fan base with exclusive titles like "Forza Motorsport 5" and "Ryse: Son of Rome." Beyond that, the company hopes the device crosses over to the mainstream and becomes a family entertainment center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MONEY IN THE LIVING ROOM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To entice TV viewers and simplify their viewing experience, the new device comes with features like voice control via its Kinect input device - ostensibly in place of a remote - and the ability to integrate it with cable boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the PlayStation and Nintendo's Wii U, the Xbox One comes loaded with Netflix and other popular media apps. But Microsoft has started its own studio to produce exclusive video content, meaning the new device could become a gateway to much more than games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bolster its entertainment offerings, Microsoft launched its Xbox Music app, a digital music service that vies with Apple's iTunes, last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The profit margin of that business is more defensible than the current PC business. Microsoft has a more solid shot at the living room, by way of Xbox, than it does through PCs," said Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot of monetization possible if you can take over the living room, so Microsoft is highly motivated to make that game platform as versatile as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is battling Sony, which sold 1 million of its PlayStation 4s within the first 24 hour of its November 15 release in the United States and Canada, and is currently sold out in many retail stores and online. At $499, the Xbox One costs $100 more than its rival console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TANK OF SHARKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert W. Baird &amp; Co analyst Colin Sebastian has said he expects shipments of 2.5 million to 3 million units for both the Xbox One and PS4 in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is pulling out the stops on marketing, producing creative stunts such as immersing the first Xbox One console to go on sale, in New Zealand, in a tank of 20 sharks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With everything they're going through ... one shining light there that they really feel good about" is the Xbox franchise, said Peter Moore, chief operating officer of Electronic Arts Inc, who led the launch of the Xbox 360 when he was at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a great company with a lot of good businesses, but the real sparkle right now, particularly this week on campus right now ... will be the launch of the Xbox One."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft hopes to avoid the glitches that plagued Sony, whose PlayStation 4 launch was marred by problems while booting up the machine and units being damaging during shipping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selling something more than a game console is imperative, with more and more potential customers gravitating to free online and mobile games, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last eight years, Sony and Microsoft both sold more than 80 million PS3 and Xbox 360 units each, while Nintendo sold over 100 million Wii consoles. The industry has debated whether the console heyday is over, with hardware sales in decline for the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts expect new consoles to reignite the sector. The PS4 is currently in short supply at many retail stores and online after a robust launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of those questions have been put to rest by the strong pickup this weekend of the Sony platform, and we're very confident Xbox will have a strong launch this weekend as well," EA's Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EA games like "Battlefield 4" and "FIFA 14" had strong sales as PS4 machines flew off store shelves, Moore said. The same titles will be released for Xbox One, in addition to some upcoming exclusive titles like sci-fi shooter "Titanfall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a rare display of solidarity, Xbox sent a congratulatory tweet to Sony shortly after the PS4 hit store shelves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This isn't so much a competitive effort. It's really about how we grow the broader market ... that should really be the focus and a little bit of that was the spirit behind congratulating Sony for the good work they've done," Microsoft's Mehdi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by Edwin Chan and Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

      Approval
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Standard of Care for Patients With Metastatic ALK-Positive 
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) has granted Pfizer&#8217;s XALKORI&#174; (crizotinib) 
      regular approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic 
      ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as detected by an 
      FDA-approved test. XALKORI was previously granted accelerated approval 
      in August 2011 due to the critical need for new agents for people living 
      with ALK-positive NSCLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide1 
      with an estimated 1.4 million deaths each year.2 To date, 
      globally more than 6,000 patients have been treated with XALKORI, 
      including those who received XALKORI in clinical trials. ALK testing 
      rates in the U.S. have increased more than 5-fold from 11 percent before 
      the XALKORI launch to more than 60 percent.3
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "XALKORI has dramatically changed the treatment landscape for patients 
      with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC," said Garry Nicholson, president and 
      general manager, Pfizer Oncology Business Unit. "Achievement of this 
      milestone underscores Pfizer&#8217;s commitment to provide physicians with 
      effective cancer therapies for their patients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The FDA&#8217;s action marks the conversion of an accelerated approval to 
      regular approval and is based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 PROFILE 
      1007 confirmatory trial comparing XALKORI to standard chemotherapy in 
      previously treated patients. The results of this study were recently 
      published in the June 20, 2013 issue of the New England Journal of 
      Medicine.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the U.S., XALKORI has received approval in more than 60 
      countries, including EU, Canada, China, Korea, Japan and Australia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			XALKORI&#174; (crizotinib) Indication and 
      Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XALKORI is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients 
      with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are 
      anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive as detected by an FDA-approved 
      test.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hepatotoxicity: Across three main clinical trials fatal hepatotoxicity 
      occurred in 0.2% of patients. Monitor with periodic liver testing. 
      Temporarily suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue XALKORI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumonitis: Across three main clinical trials interstitial lung disease 
      (ILD)/pneumonitis occurred in 2% of patients. Permanently discontinue in 
      patients with ILD/pneumonitis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      QT Interval Prolongation: Across three main clinical trials QT interval 
      prolongation occurred in 2.7% of patients. Monitor with 
      electrocardiograms and electrolytes in patients who have a history of or 
      predisposition for QTc prolongation, or who are taking medications that 
      prolong QT. Temporarily suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue 
      XALKORI.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Bradycardia: Xalkori can cause bradycardia. Across three main clinical 
      trials 11% of patients experienced a heart rate of less than 50 beats 
      per minute. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. Temporarily 
      suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue XALKORI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Embryofetal Toxicity: XALKORI can cause fetal harm when administered to 
      a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to 
      avoid becoming pregnant while receiving XALKORI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Adverse Reactions: Across three main clinical trials the most common 
      adverse reactions (&#8805;25%) were vision disorders, nausea, diarrhea, 
      vomiting, constipation, edema, elevated transaminases, and fatigue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In a phase 3 study in patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC 
      randomized to XALKORI (n=172) or chemotherapy (n=171), serious adverse 
      reactions were reported in 37.2% of patients treated with XALKORI. The 
      most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated 
      with XALKORI were pneumonia (4.1%), pulmonary embolism (3.5%), dyspnea 
      (2.3%), and ILD (2.9%). Fatal adverse reactions in XALKORI-treated 
      patients occurred in 9 (5%) patients, consisting of: acute respiratory 
      distress syndrome, arrhythmia, dyspnea, ILD, pneumonia, pneumonitis, 
      pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, and sepsis. Grade 3 or 4 events 
      occurring at a higher incidence with XALKORI than with chemotherapy and 
      at greater than 2%, were syncope (3%), QT prolongation (3%), and 
      pulmonary embolism (5%). Elevation of ALT of any grade occurred in 76% 
      of patients and grade 3 or 4 in 17% of patients. Neutropenia of any 
      grade occurred in 49% of patients and grade 3 or 4 in 12% of patients. 
      Lymphopenia of any grade occurred in 51% of patients and grade 3 or 4 in 
      9% of patients. Renal cysts occurred in 4% and neuropathy occurred in 
      19% of patients treated with XALKORI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Drug Interactions: Exercise caution with concomitant use of moderate 
      CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice which may 
      increase plasma concentrations of crizotinib. Avoid concomitant use of 
      strong CYP3A inducers and inhibitors. Dose reduction may be needed for 
      co-administered drugs that are predominantly metabolized by CYP3A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nursing Mothers: Given the potential for serious adverse reactions in 
      nursing infants, consider whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue 
      XALKORI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hepatic Impairment: XALKORI has not been studied in patients with 
      hepatic impairment. As crizotinib is extensively metabolized in the 
      liver, hepatic impairment is likely to increase plasma crizotinib 
      concentrations. Use caution in patients with hepatic impairment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Renal Impairment: Administer XALKORI at a starting dose of 250 mg taken 
      orally once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr30 
      mL/min) not requiring dialysis. No starting dose adjustment is needed 
      for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO, Calif., Nov. 21, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - First US health system begins using vRad's RG2 platform leveraging Visage 7 for primary interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Visage Imaging Inc. ("Visage"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Pro Medicus Ltd. (ASX: PME), announced today that its Visage&#174; 7 Enterprise Imaging Platform has been successfully implemented as part of RG2(SM), vRad's next-generation radiology operational management solution. RG2--or Radiology Group 2.0--optimizes coverage of both onsite and cloud based radiology services using physician productivity tools such as a next-generation radiology reading platform with Visage's enterprise diagnostic viewer, global worklists and advanced analytics for faster and better decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	vRad (Virtual Radiologic), based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, is the country's largest radiology group and telemedicine platform. vRad works in partnership with local radiology groups and hospitals to optimize radiology's pivotal role in patient care. vRad's more than 450 radiologists serve over 2,000 radiology groups, hospitals and health systems, reading in excess of 7 million studies annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"This is an important milestone for us," said Dr. Sam Hupert, Chief Executive Officer, Visage Imaging and Pro Medicus CEO. "Our technology has proven its capability with a partner operating in a high-volume, high-demand healthcare environment. Not only does it provide vRad radiologists with the most comprehensive set of clinical tools in a single product, but it is also exceptionally fast. Unlike others who have to move ever increasing datasets across the network, we are able to instantly stream the images to radiologists' desktops regardless of the size of the examination they are reading. Faster delivery means faster diagnoses. That's a competitive advantage and a critical benefit for the patient communities we serve with our partners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We are extremely pleased with the results of our first go live with Visage," said Jordan Halter, vRad's Vice President of Solutions. "RG2 is command central for ground and cloud-based radiology. It's the future of radiology available today and Visage technology is core to delivering on the promise of 'read anything, anywhere, anytime.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Under the terms of the previously announced agreement, the five-year contract period commences with the first clinical go live, paving the way for further Visage installations within vRad's extensive national US-based network. "This is a great start for Visage and we are looking forward to further success as vRad continues to roll out its next-generation RG2 platform," said Dr. Hupert. "We know Visage 7 will provide vRad with a significant strategic advantage in this highly competitive radiology market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;MB Innovations Showcases MaCoca as a Slimple Way to Keep Off Holiday Weight&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;HOLLYWOOD, FL--(Marketwired - Nov 21, 2013) -  Certain things are synonymous with the holidays, such as hot coco, but nutraceutical company MB Innovations is confident that its MaCoca, found in the Slimple weight loss product, will bring even more cheer.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holidays are a challenging time to maintain weight, much less lose. The average American will permanently gain 1 to 2 pounds from Thanksgiving to New Year's. Winter lethargy can also compound weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our goal with Slimple was to design a unique supplement addressing appetite suppression and energy simultaneously," said Richard Gelso, president of MB Innovations and formulator of Slimple. "We are the only nutraceutical company who has the relationship with South American suppliers to bring decocainized coca leaf extract to the United States as a weight loss supplement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gelso said decocainized coca leaf is the same secret ingredient used in the popular cola that uses the coca name. His branded ingredient, MaCoca is a blend of decocainized coca leaf extract, maca root, citrus bioflavonoids, glycomacropeptide, guggul, green tea, lotus leaf extract and annatto leaf powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slimple's key ingredient is decocainized coca leaf extract derived from the highly nutritious Erythroxylon coca plant. Indigenous tribes in South America have cultivated coca leaf for centuries and use it in tea or chew the leaves to suppress the appetite, boost energy levels and increase strength and stamina.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to be confused with the drug, coca leaves and cocaine are different products. Cocaine is an alkaloid derived from the leaves of the coca plant and is a highly addictive, toxic stimulant. Decocainized coca leaf extract is processed using a method that carefully removes the alkaloids while retaining the active ingredients, enabling it to be used legally in the United States as a food additive or dietary supplement.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report by Natural Standard Research Collaboration concludes MaCoca may help reduce fat absorption, maintain a healthy body weight, regulate food intake, increase satiety, regulate blood sugar and stimulate the metabolism. MaCoca doesn't have negative side effects such as jitters or crashing typically associated with energy boosting products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MaCoca can be found in the Slimple dietary supplement ($29.98, 60 capsules, two servings daily) available at: www.itsSLIMPLE.com.

			Brookings and JPMorgan Chase Launch New Exchange Network
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Network, Part of the Global Cities Initiative, Will Help 
      Metropolitan Areas Create Global Trade and Engagement Strategies to Grow 
      Jobs and Expand their Economies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today, the Brookings Institution and JPMorgan Chase announce the launch 
      of the Exchange, a new network of 20 pioneering metropolitan areas 
      committed to increasing global trade and economic competitiveness. The 
      program is part of the Global Cities Initiative, which equips 
      metropolitan leaders with the information, policy ideas, and global 
      connections they need to bolster their regions&#8217; positions in the global 
      economy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the Exchange&#8217;s first year, business, civic, and state and local 
      government leaders from eight metropolitan regions&#8211;Atlanta; Greenville, 
      S.C.; Indianapolis; Jacksonville, Fla.; Milwaukee; Phoenix; Sacramento, 
      Calif.; and Wichita, Kan&#8211;will design and implement strategies to grow 
      their local economies by expanding global trade and investment. 
      Brookings selected metropolitan areas to join the network after an 
      extensive application process that evaluated regions&#8217; readiness, 
      capability, and commitment to pursue the Exchange&#8217;s goals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This group of eight will join 12 U.S. metro areas&#8211;Charleston, S.C.; 
      Chicago; Columbus, Ohio; Des Moines, Iowa; Los Angeles; 
      Louisville-Lexington, Ky.; Minneapolis-Saint Paul; Portland, Ore.; San 
      Antonio; San Diego; Syracuse, N.Y.; and Tampa Bay, Fla.&#8211;that are already 
      involved in Brookings-led metropolitan export planning through the 
      Metropolitan Export Initiative. Economic development leaders from these 
      regions have been invited to continue developing broader global 
      engagement strategies as part of the Exchange. The Exchange network will 
      expand over time to include additional U.S. and non-U.S. cities working 
      together to strengthen their global competitiveness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In today&#8217;s fast-moving business climate, metropolitan leaders must 
      expand their economies globally,&#8221; said Amy Liu, co-director of the 
      Global Cities Initiative, Brookings senior fellow and co-director of the 
      Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program. &#8220;We created this Exchange to turn 
      opportunity into action and to turn good ideas into results. We will 
      give metropolitan leaders tools and guidance to develop actionable plans 
      that will position their regions to thrive in the hyper-integrated 
      global economy.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To achieve economic growth, cities and metropolitan regions must 
      capitalize on their distinctive assets and expand their global trade and 
      investment strategies. Rapid urbanization in mature and developing 
      markets is creating a new consumer class and 85 percent of global GDP 
      growth is projected to occur outside the U.S. between 2013 and 2018. 
      This is a great opportunity for firms and local economies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Metro areas are uniquely positioned to make exports and global 
      engagement a central, consistent part of broader regional economic 
      strategies. Local leaders know their regions best and can help local 
      firms access new markets, align existing export services and bring new 
      business to their regions. They are also best equipped to coordinate 
      regional assets&#8212;such as skills training, innovation capacities, and 
      freight and logistics&#8212;to better support global trade.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;There are enormous untapped opportunities for leaders in cities and 
      metro areas to expand and strengthen their economies through greater 
      global engagement. But business, government and civic leaders must be 
      proactive and purposeful in acting on this opportunity,&#8221; said Richard M. 
      Daley, former Chicago mayor, senior advisor to JPMorgan Chase, and chair 
      of the Global Cities Initiative. &#8220;For decades, JPMorgan Chase has been 
      helping companies expand their businesses globally and now the Global 
      Cities Initiative is doing the critical work of preparing other partners 
      in metropolitan regions to recognize their unique assets and find their 
      place in the global economy.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the Exchange, each metropolitan area will develop a customized 
      global engagement strategy, which will integrate exports and foreign 
      direct investment, and may also include logistics and advanced 
      industries. As part of this work, metropolitan leaders will work with 
      one another to establish new metro-to-metro relationships and to share 
      best practices in globally-oriented economic development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to these 20 metros, the Global Cities Initiative will 
      support strategic economic engagements in select international markets. 
      Last week in M&#233;xico City, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and M&#233;xico City 
      Mayor Miguel &#193;ngel Mancera announced the first international engagement 
      of the Global Cities Exchange and signed an agreement 
      to formalize and strengthen their cities&#8217; economic partnership. Guided 
      by the Global Cities Initiative, the two cities will work together to 
      expand exports, foreign investment, and skilled workforce and research 
      endeavors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the past two years, the Global Cities Initiative has provided 
      metropolitan areas with research and networks to help them capitalize on 
      their distinctive strengths. For example, in Houston, the Initiative 
      inspired local leaders to create a workforce development plan. In 
      Atlanta, the Initiative spurred the development of a new regional export 
      plan. And leaders in metropolitan areas across the country, including 
      Denver and Columbus, have incorporated the &#8220;10 
      Traits of Globally Fluent Metro Areas&#8221; framework into their economic 
      development planning.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2014, the Global Cities Initiative will hold forums in Phoenix and 
      Las Vegas; Jacksonville, Fla.; Seattle; Louisville-Lexington, Ky. and 
      Munich.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Launched in 2012, the Global Cities Initiative is a five-year 
      joint project of Brookings and JPMorgan Chase aimed at helping city and 
      metropolitan leaders become more globally fluent by providing an 
      in-depth and data-driven look at their regional standing on crucial 
      global economic measures, highlighting best policy and practice 
      innovations from around the world, and creating an international network 
      of leaders who ultimately trade and grow together. Since its inception, 
      the Initiative has held forums in Atlanta; Beijing; Columbus, Ohio; 
      Dallas; Denver; Houston; London; Los Angeles; Miami; S&#227;o Pa&#250;lo, Brazil; 
      and Singapore.

			Pfizer and GSK to Initiate Study of Novel Combination Therapy in 
      Patients with Melanoma
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Phase I/II Study combines GSK&#8217;s trametinib and Pfizer&#8217;s palbociclib
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. announced today that it has entered into an agreement with 
      GSK to explore the anti-cancer efficacy and the safety of GSK&#8217;s 
      trametinib (GSK1120212) combined with Pfizer&#8217;s palbociclib (PD-0332991) 
      in a Phase I/II study (Study 200344) in patients with 
      advanced/metastatic melanoma.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Study 200344 is a dose-escalation, open-label study designed to 
      determine the recommended combination regimen (RCR) for trametinib plus 
      palbociclib in patients with melanoma. The study will also evaluate the 
      effect of the combination on tumor biomarkers, safety and anti-cancer 
      activity in patients with BRAFV600 wild type melanoma, including those 
      with NRAS mutations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pfizer Oncology is committed to maximizing the value of our portfolio 
      for patients through the study of novel combinations. This includes 
      combining our own cancer medicines with each other, as well as with 
      those of other companies where there is strong scientific rationale,&#8221; 
      said Garry Nicholson, president and general manager, Pfizer Oncology 
      Business Unit. &#8220;Emerging data suggest the potential for trametinib and 
      palbociclib to work together to treat melanoma. We look forward to 
      collaborating with GSK to explore this potential and evaluate the 
      clinical activity of this combination in melanoma.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The two companies will collaborate on the study, which GSK will conduct. 
      Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Trametinib, a reversible inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, is approved by the 
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the name Mekinist&#174; for the 
      treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
      with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. 
      Mekinist is not indicated for the treatment of patients who have 
      received a prior BRAF inhibitor therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Palbociclib is an investigational oral and selective inhibitor of cyclin 
      dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6. In April 2013, palbociclib received 
      Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for the potential treatment 
      of patients with breast cancer. Palbociclib is not approved for any 
      indication in any markets.

			&lt;p&gt;Ron Daems, President of Strata Oil  Gas Inc., discusses how Warren Buffett's latest oil investment affects shareholders&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Nov 21, 2013) -  Strata Oil  Gas Inc. (OTCQB:SOIGF)(OTCBB:SOIGF)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has now been revealed that Warren Buffett's oil sands exposure has increased again, with his 40.1 million share purchase of Exxon Mobil, one of the world's leading producers and a major player in Alberta's enormous bitumen play through its 70% stake in Imperial Oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Buffett's second recent high-profile oil investment, the first being in June when Berkshire Hathaway announced it had taken a $500-million stake in Suncor Energy Inc., the world's leading oil sands producer and Canada's largest integrated operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tellingly, Buffett increased his stake in Exxon Mobil right around the time it was acquiring the enormous Clyden in-situ bitumen project from ConocoPhillips - a company whose stock he just sold, reducing his holdings in it by 44 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil/Imperial also owns the Kearl project - another massive Alberta-based bitumen project with 4.6 billion barrels of bitumen resource and a project lifespan of over 40 years. Production is already at 80,000 barrels per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, Buffett's ExxonMobil stake gives him ownership in Imperial Oil - one of Exxon Mobil's jewels-in-the-crown, partly because of its enormous Canadian oil sands position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ron Daems, President of Strata Oil, provided these comments to shareholders:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Strata Oil views Buffett's increased stake in ExxonMobil as good news for Alberta's bitumen producers, and a real endorsement of the future potential of the resource. Many of the leading 'Carbonate Triangle' companies have already attracted the investment dollars of some of the world's major investment institutions including Warburg Pincus, Blackstone Capital, and Goldman Sachs. But there's no doubt that Buffett's $3.45 billion stake in ExxonMobil/Imperial and his earlier $500 million stake in oil-sands producer Suncor is the kind of good news that really bodes well for Alberta's bitumen production," said Mr. Daems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All these developments mean that momentum is building in Alberta's bitumen carbonate play, and Strata Oil has one of the largest and most attractive projects in the industry. We acquired our project in 2005 and 2006, making us one of the earliest companies to position in the carbonates. Through drilling and geological analysis, we now have a recoverable resource of 887 million barrels of crude, and a total resource of 3.4 billion barrels. We believe our company offers substantial value to its shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strata Oil's Cadotte Central project is estimated to have a Net Present Value (NPV) of USD $1.3 billion. Its newly updated total of 887 million bbls of recoverable bitumen provides significant additional upside potential which hasn't been factored into the $1.3 billion calculation yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strata Oil is 100% owner of the Cadotte project, in the Peace River region of Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Strata Oil  Gas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strata Oil  Gas is a US-publicly traded company focused on the exploration and development of heavy oil from carbonates. The Company currently holds a 100% interest in 52,480 acres of oil sands leases in the Peace River region of Alberta's Carbonate Triangle. Strata's Cadotte project has been independently evaluated, with a resource base of 3.44 billion barrels in-place with 887 million recoverable barrels. Strata's existing world-class Cadotte Central project of 56,000 barrels-per-day over 20 years is valued at NPV $1.3 billion.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp sold over 1 million of its new Xbox One game consoles within 24 hours of their hitting store shelves on Friday, on par with Sony Corp's PlayStation 4 despite launching in far more countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new console, which launched in 13 countries, set a record for first-day Xbox sales and is currently sold out at most retailers, Microsoft said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony said it sold 1 million PS4 units in 24 hours after launching last Friday in just the United States and Canada. The PS4 expands to other regions, including Europe, Australia and South America, from November 29. It then hits Japan in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is locked in a console war with Sony this holiday season. The software giant hopes the Xbox One not only entices gamers but attracts a broader consumer base of TV fans and music lovers with its interactive entertainment features and media apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are working hard to create more Xbox One consoles," said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of marketing and strategy at Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert W.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp sold over 1 million of its new Xbox One game consoles within 24 hours of their hitting store shelves on Friday, on par with Sony Corp's PlayStation 4 despite launching in far more countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. oil company Chevron 
said on Friday the development of its North Sea Rosebank project
was not currently economically attractive, raising doubts about
a resurgence of the North Sea oil industry as fears rise over
costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said Rosebank, located west of Shetland in the UK
North Sea, did not "currently offer an economic value
proposition" to justify such a large investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron declined to comment on the projected cost of
Rosebank, though estimates of up to $8 billion were circulating
in news reports over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statoil sold its stake in the oil and gas
development earlier this year to OMV of Austria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's hesitation is a blow for the prospects west of
Shetland, a region crucial to plans to revive production in the
British North Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also a setback for Cameron International Inc 
and its newly formed OneSubsea joint venture with Schlumberger
, which recently won a $540 million award from Chevron
for equipment work at Rosebank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron said on Friday its total 2014 revenue from Rosebank
was estimated at $30 million, and its shares fell 1.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project remains in the initial engineering phase, with a
final investment decision planned for 2014, and Chevron said it
would continue to work with partners OMV and Denmark's Dong
 to improve its viability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is now finalising its budget for 2014, which will be
an investment-heavy year as it completes its huge liquefied
natural gas export project at Gorgon in Australia, as well as
three Gulf of Mexico projects due to start up next year that
total $14 billion in cost. The budget is due out in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACCRA (Reuters) - Four citizens of Guyana and one Ghanaian pleaded guilty on Friday to charges related to the seizure of a ship carrying tens of millions of dollars' worth of cocaine, a senior legal official said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghanaian authorities impounded the Guyana-registered MV ATIYAH on Tuesday and arrested the five when they discovered it was carrying 400 kilos (880 pounds) of cocaine worth around $50 million, according to a statement by the Ghana Narcotics Control Board (NACOB).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five men were charged by a High Court judge with offences including engaging in a criminal conspiracy and transportation of narcotics without authority, said the official, who was in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The case was adjourned for three weeks because the full results of the substance (tests) have not been brought back from the laboratory," the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The men, who were remanded in custody, told the court they could not afford a lawyer, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vessel was monitored at sea and detained by anti-narcotics officers working with the Ghana Navy once it entered territorial waters, NACOB said, without giving further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Latin American drug cartels have increasingly used West Africa's string of weak coastal states, including Ghana, as transit points for drugs being smuggled to the lucrative European market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matthew Mpoke Bigg; Editing by David Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			ZICOTM Beverages Joins The Coca-Cola Family
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Coca-Cola North America&#8217;s Venturing and Emerging Brands Business Unit 
      Leads Acquisition of Pioneering Coconut Water Brand
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Uzzell Named as President, ZICO Beverages LLC
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Whether at the gym, shopping mall or office, ZICO Pure Premium Coconut 
      Water provides the natural replenishment you need to renew. And now ZICO 
      will be able to fully access the scale benefits of the Coca-Cola system. 
      Today The Coca-Cola Company and ZICO Beverages LLC announced that 
      Coca-Cola has acquired the outstanding ownership stake in ZICO. The 
      announcement will unlock more capability for ZICO including marketing, 
      selling, manufacturing, innovation and distribution opportunities. 
      Additionally, The Coca-Cola Company will gain a leading position in one 
      of the fastest growing beverage categories in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The move completes the transaction which began in 2009 when Coca-Cola&#8217;s 
      Venturing and Emerging Brands (VEB) business unit first invested in 
      ZICO. In 2012, the Company purchased a majority stake in the brand. And 
      earlier this year, the brand took its place on the signature red 
      Coca-Cola trucks to be distributed throughout the U.S. and Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;When we made our investment in ZICO, we did so because we saw it as a 
      burgeoning premium brand with the potential to be a significant leader 
      in a high growth category,&#8221; said Deryck van Rensburg, President and 
      General Manager, Venturing  Emerging Brands, Coca-Cola North America. 
      &#8220;Over the past four years we have watched the coconut water category see 
      an impressive spike in revenue and household penetration and ZICO 
      solidify its position as one of the leading brands in this category. 
      With our acquisition, we plan to innovate in all aspects of the consumer 
      experience and increase both velocity and distribution to position ZICO 
      for even more growth. This announcement is the sign of a continued 
      beginning for the brand, with more resources, support and cachet to 
      come.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The coconut water category has seen impressive sales growth since its 
      inception, nearly doubling its revenue every year since 2004. In the 
      period since Coca-Cola&#8217;s initial investment in ZICO, the brand has 
      expanded its distribution footprint from 6 markets to national presence, 
      adding such influencer retail partners as Kroger, Target and Walmart. 
      While coconut water growth remains extremely strong in 2013, 
      year-to-date ZICO&#8217;s volume growth continues to outperform the category.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We always believed coconut water would eventually become a major 
      beverage category and ZICO a household name, even when we were running 
      the company from my garage and selling out of a rented truck,&#8221; said Mark 
      Rampolla, ZICO&#8217;s founder and chief executive officer. &#8220;Over the past 
      four years, it has been exciting to see ZICO excel as our partnership 
      with The Coca-Cola Company matured. Now, with full access to the 
      resources of the Coca-Cola system, we have the opportunity to bring ZICO 
      and the healthy, replenishing benefits of coconut water even further 
      into the mainstream and realize our original goals.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the transaction, G. Scott Uzzell will become President and 
      take over day-to-day management of ZICO Beverages, LLC. Rampolla will 
      remain as a non-executive advisor to ZICO supporting the transition and 
      long-term strategic initiatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As we enter a new phase of growth and development, I hoped to find a 
      leader that would respect our brand heritage and organizational culture 
      while helping us capitalize on this incredible opportunity,&#8221; said 
      Rampolla. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known Scott for six years, have a tremendous amount of 
      respect for him and am confident that he&#8217;s the guy to take ZICO to the 
      next level.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Uzzell has served as ZICO&#8217;s Chief Commercial Officer and EVP of Sales 
      for the past year. Prior to this position, Scott played a number of 
      leadership roles for The Coca-Cola Company, including VP of the 
      McDonald&#8217;s business unit and VP/GM, Incubation for VEB. His knowledge of 
      the VEB business and The Coca-Cola system will be critical in ensuring a 
      seamless transition of the new ZICO operating model.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I have long shared the energy, passion and love for ZICO that has 
      existed among consumers and within the company since its inception,&#8221; 
      said Uzzell. &#8220;Mark and his team have done an incredible job building the 
      ZICO brand into what it is today. I&#8217;m excited about leading the team 
      through this next evolution in the brand&#8217;s development and believe that 
      with the team&#8217;s entrepreneurial zeal and the resources of The Coca-Cola 
      Company we can take ZICO to new heights.&#8221;

      Underscoring the performance benefits of high-quality motor oil 
      technology, ExxonMobil has renewed their multi-year technological 
      partnership with Toyota Racing Development, U.S.A. (TRD). ExxonMobil 
      will continue to provide its Mobil 1 racing oil technology to 
      TRD-supported NASCAR teams.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since the 2010 season, TRD-supplied NASCAR engines have been filled with 
      specifically customized synthetic motor oil based on the same technology 
      of Mobil 1 engine oils. The TRD-specific Mobil 1 motor oils deliver 
      outstanding power via unique low-friction synthetic lubricant technology 
      and anti-wear additives to protect and extend the life of engine 
      hardware during high-performance applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited to renew our partnership with a company that has such 
      deep expertise in racing technology,&#8221; said David Wilson, acting 
      president and general manager, TRD, U.S.A. &#8220;Mobil 1 experts, utilizing 
      the resources of one of the world&#8217;s leading racing oil suppliers, will

      performance, ultimately helping us win more races.&#8221;

      This season alone, teams using TRD-supplied NASCAR engines with Mobil 1 
      technology have claimed 12 fastest lap times, 12 pole positions, and 14 
      Sprint Cup wins. NASCAR Sprint Cup teams that currently utilize TRD 
      technology with Mobil 1 motor oil include Joe Gibbs Racing and Michael 
      Waltrip Racing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The racing oils designed for TRD represent the latest in synthetic 
      racing oil technology and are intended to help deliver maximum 
      horsepower with open and restrictor plate race-engine applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The close relationship between ExxonMobil and motorsports provides a 
      unique platform to test new lubricant technology and to prove the 
      performance and endurance of Mobil 1,&#8221; said ExxonMobil Motorsports 
      Manager, Artis Brown. &#8220;At the same time, partnering with the expert 
      engine builders at TRD gives us an additional platform to demonstrate 
      the benefits of our products. This agreement with TRD showcases the 
      engine performance and protection that Mobil 1 racing oil technology 
      delivers for NASCAR drivers and other competitive motorsports drivers.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Novartis is hot on the heels of Pfizer in developing a promising new type of breast cancer drug that analysts believe could generate billions of dollars in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss drugmaker, which has previously kept its research program under wraps, revealed on Friday that its experimental pill LEE011 was set to enter final-stage Phase III clinical trials next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's rival drug palbociclib - the first in the class - is already in Phase III testing, but Novartis' rapid progress means the U.S. group could face competition sooner than expected. Both drugs are pills and work by blocking two enzymes known as cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The significance of the new targeted approach to fighting cancer was highlighted in April when U.S. regulators granted a "breakthrough therapy" designation to palbociclib, based on impressive results seen in mid-stage trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palbociclib is widely seen by investors as Pfizer's most valuable compound in late-stage development and the company has started several new clinical trials to maximize its potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts currently expect annual palbociclib sales of $1.9 billion by 2019, according to consensus estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters Pharma, and some think it could eventually sell $5 billion if it is approved for multiple cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Novartis has not previously revealed mid-stage clinical trial data for LEE011, analysts have not so far modeled sales forecasts for that product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEALTHY ADVANCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEE011's rapid advance suggests that Novartis has stealthily accelerated its development program and "snuck up from behind," according to Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors should therefore be aware that palbociclib could face competition sooner than anticipated," he wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly also has a CDK 4/6 inhibitor in development but it is further behind the other two drug companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novartis disclosed that LEE011 would progress into Phase III clinical testing in a statement ahead of an investor presentation later on Friday, in which it announced a $5 billion share buyback program and highlighted the potential of several research projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like palbociclib, LEE011 will be tested in combination with a standard drug, letrozole, in postmenopausal women undergoing treatment for advanced or metastatic breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 500 women are expected to be enrolled into the Phase III study of LEE011 and the trial is due to complete in November 2016, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health's ClinicalTrials.gov website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also like Pfizer, Novartis is hoping to use its drug beyond breast cancer. The website reveals a total of 11 clinical trials for LEE011 at various development stages, four of which are in breast cancer. Other earlier-stage studies with LEE011 are looking at melanoma, lymphoma and pediatric cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advances in understanding the molecular and genetic basis of cancer means the disease is now a top priority for research teams at many pharmaceutical companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer drugs are expected to be the top-selling therapy area in the coming years, with sales in developed markets forecast to reach between $74 billion and $84 billion by 2017, according to pharmaceutical information firm IMS Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jane Merriman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* New cancer pill LEEO11 starts Phase III tests December&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Rival to Pfizer's highly anticipated palbociclib drug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Points to early competition in potential blockbuster field&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ben Hirschler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Novartis is hot on the
heels of Pfizer in  developing a promising new type of
breast cancer drug that analysts believe could generate billions
of dollars in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swiss drugmaker, which has previously kept its research

accelerated its development programme and "snuck up from
behind," according to Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors should therefore be aware that palbociclib could
face competition sooner than anticipated," he wrote in a
research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly also has a CDK 4/6 inhibitor in
development but it is further behind the other two drug
companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novartis disclosed that LEE011 would progress into Phase III

			&lt;p&gt;New SR 198/Plaza Drive Interchange Will Promote Job Creation and Economic Growth&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;LOWELL, MA--(Marketwired - Nov 25, 2013) - On Tuesday, November 19, engineers from TRC Companies, Inc. joined officials from the City of Visalia, California and other dignitaries for the grand opening of the improved State Route 198/Plaza Drive Interchange. TRC performed the planning and design for this $26 million project which will promote economic growth across Tulare County by improving access to employment centers and enhancing the movement of goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"TRC is proud to have been part of the Plaza Drive Widening and Interchange project," said Mark Imbriani, TRC Vice President and Project Manager. "The wider roadway and enlarged interchange will alleviate traffic congestion and provide better access to Visalia's Industrial Park, which houses many major product distribution centers serving the Western U.S. With better traffic flow, fuel consumption will be reduced and air quality in the area will improve. Travel time for motorists will also be reduced, and safety will be enhanced." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This major public works project commenced by the City of Visalia in 2008 widened Plaza Drive from two to four or six lanes over a distance of 1.5 miles between Airport Drive on the south and Goshen Avenue on the north. Auxiliary lanes were constructed on SR 198 between Plaza Drive and SR 99. The work included widening the structure overcrossing SR 198 from three to seven lanes to improve traffic circulation and capacity. Four retaining walls were required to minimize impacts to a hotel, park, and high-risk utility fiber-optic and gas lines.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRC has worked with the City of Visalia since 2000 on three interchange projects on the SR 198 corridor. The Plaza Drive Interchange project won the 2013 Project of the Year Award in the Economic Development Category from the Tulare County Association of Governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About TRC

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TORONTO, Nov. 25, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DoMark International Inc. (OTCBB:DOMK), a leading smartphone, tablet, and video gaming accessories company, who announced last week that their new Smartlink product, developed by Imagic Ltd., in which DoMark holds a major investment, is to be demonstrated for the first time at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas from January 7th to 10th. After many industry enquiries, DoMark would like to confirm that their new portable product gives players on the move or at home the option to play their favorite games on their smartphone or tablet with our plug in hand held game controller, and they also have the option to play the game on any TV available and see the game on the screen in real time. This is ideal for the hardened gamer who is on the move, and complements the home based systems such as Xbox and Playstation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The Smartlink product is an industry first, aimed specifically at games players to whom instant response is essential between smartphone and TV receiver, and allows users to take their smartphone games and movies for use on TV in any place at any time.

      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan Taxable HFA Trust, Series 2013-2
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to one class of 
      certificates issued by J.P. Morgan Taxable HFA Trust, series 2013-2:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$51,839,264 class A certificates 'AAAsf', Watch Negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction represents a pass-through of all proceeds received in 
      respect of the underlying mortgage revenue bond (MRB) owned by the 
      trust. The rating is based on the credit quality of the MRB.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Proceeds from the certificate issuance were used to purchase the MRB 
      issued by the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority 
      (IHCDA). The MRB is collateralized by Ginnie Mae (GNMA) and Fannie Mae 
      (FNMA) securities. The MRB is rated 'AAA', Watch Negative by Fitch based 
      on the GNMA and FNMA guarantee of full and timely payment of principal 
      and interest on its securities. The GNMA guarantee is backed by the 
      rating of the U.S. treasury, which carries the sovereign rating of the 
      United States of America (rated 'AAA/F1+', Watch Negative by Fitch). The 
      FNMA guaranty is not backed by the U.S. treasury, however, the FNMA 
      rating is linked is currently linked to the U.S. sovereign rating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Payments on the certificates will be made monthly and will consist of 
      all interest and principal payments received from the underlying MRB. 
      The certificates will receive interest equal to 4.00% per annum less 
      extraordinary expenses. The underlying MRB pays a coupon of 4.038%, and 
      the transaction is structured to pass-through all interest and principal 
      proceeds after paying a 0.038% (p.a.) trustee fee and any extraordinary 
      expenses that are incurred. Extraordinary expenses incurred by the 
      trustee are capped at $150,000 per year, and any excess extraordinary 
      expense amount incurred by the trustee is to be paid the following year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction relies, to a lesser extent, on a series of 
      counterparties to perform particular roles, including the trustee (Wells 
      Fargo Bank, N.A.; rated 'AA-/F1+', Outlook Stable by Fitch) and the bank 
      at which the certificate account is established (also Wells Fargo Bank, 
      N.A.). All distributions from the underlying MRB are deposited into the 
      certificate account where they are held un-invested and are subsequently 
      withdrawn by the trustee prior to each payment date. The certificate 
      account is a segregated account held in trust for the benefit of the 
      certificateholders. In its role as both issuer account bank and trustee, 
      Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. satisfies the eligibility criteria described in 
      Fitch's 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance Transactions'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction is established as a grantor trust for federal income tax 
      purposes. Each beneficial owner of the certificates will be treated for 
      federal income tax purposes as owning an undivided interest in each 
      asset held in the trust. To the extent interest on the underlying MRBs 
      is subject to federal income taxation, the portion thereof received by 
      each beneficial owner of a certificate will also be subject to federal 
      income taxation. Fitch has received and reviewed legal opinions 
      addressing the true sale of the underlying MRBs to the trust, the 
      classification of the trust as a grantor trust for federal income tax 
      purposes, and the enforceability of the transaction documents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Any rating action on the underlying MRB will directly affect the rating 
      of the certificates. The MRB rating is currently linked to the U.S. 
      sovereign rating, any rating action on the U.S. sovereign rating will 
      directly affect the rating of the certificates. Further, should Fitch's 
      view of the strength of government support for FNMA be reduced or 
      downgraded, the rating of FNMA may be delinked from the U.S. sovereign 
      rating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The CUSIP for the underlying IHCDA MRB is 454807AD0. For additional

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - An attorney for Chevron Corp on Tuesday accused U.S. lawyer Steven Donziger of orchestrating an international criminal conspiracy by using bribery and fraud in Ecuador to secure a multibillion-dollar pollution judgment against the oil company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was a scheme so audacious, so bold, that it would make even a Mafia boss blush," lawyer Randy Mastro said during his closing argument before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is presiding over the non-jury trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the defense said Chevron had failed to prove Donziger's involvement in any conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Raw accusations and allegations are not proof," said Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer for Donziger. "Steven Donziger may be a jerk. That's not a crime."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six-week trial concerned an $18 billion judgment issued in 2011 against Chevron by Judge Nicolas Zambrano in Ecuador. The ruling was in favor of a group of villagers, who claimed Texaco had contaminated an oil field in northeastern Ecuador between 1964 and 1992. This month, Ecuador's Supreme Court cut the amount to $9.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, which later acquired Texaco, has said Texaco remediated the site before closing operations. The company hopes a verdict from Kaplan that the judgment was based on fraud will help it defend against attempts to enforce the judgment outside Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan will not render a decision right away; the two sides will submit post-trial briefs over the next couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the trial, Chevron submitted reams of documents, including Donziger's private notebook. The company also called more than a dozen witnesses, including linguistics, psychology and computer experts who testified that Zambrano could not possibly have authored the judgment without assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUDGE VERSUS JUDGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the case could come down to whether Kaplan chooses to believe Zambrano, who said on the stand that he wrote the decision alone, or another former Ecuadorean judge, Alberto Guerra, who testified that Donziger's side paid him to ghost-write Zambrano's opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guerra, perhaps the key trial witness, said Donziger was aware of the bribes, while Donziger said during his own testimony that he rejected a solicitation for bribes by Guerra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastro pointed to sections of Zambrano's opinion that appeared to be lifted word-for-word from internal documents held by Donziger's team in Ecuador, complete with the occasional error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's like fingerprints," he said. He also pointed to records that showed money withdrawn from an account used by Donziger's team and funds in the same amounts deposited into Guerra's own account soon after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Littlepage said Chevron's entire case came down to the word of a witness, Guerra, who simply cannot be credited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is based on the testimony of a single witness, an admitted liar, and one whose story has changed many times," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastro also pointed to evidence that an independent expert appointed by the Ecuadorean court to assess Chevron's liability was secretly compensated by Donziger's team and had much of his report ghost-written by a consulting firm hired by Donziger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Littlepage, however, said that Zambrano specifically threw out the report before issuing his opinion and that two appellate courts in Ecuador had since upheld the judgment without reference to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a causal connection between the report and any alleged harm to Chevron, she said, Chevron cannot pursue fraud claims based on the report as a matter of law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the two sides offered sharply divergent portraits of Donziger. Richard Friedman, one of his lawyers, said Donziger deserved enormous credit for shedding light on how U.S. corporations treat "Third World countries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mastro said Donziger had "shamed our profession" by lying, obstructing justice and ignoring the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lawyers don't do these things," he said. "Criminals do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Huge legal costs at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) and slowing demand for mortgages as interest rates rose caused the first decline in bank profits since 2009, a third-quarter regulatory update said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher interest rates lowered the value of fixed income assets and sapped demand for mortgage refinancing, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net interest margins benefited from the rise, but they were still lower than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A $4 billion increase in litigation expenses at one institution - not named by the FDIC but identified as JPMorgan by a source - was the main reason why net income at U.S. banks declined 3.9 percent year-on-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Had it not been for that, the upward trend in earnings would have continued," FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said at a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the bank agreed to pay $13 billion to settle charges it misrepresented the quality of mortgages it sold before the crisis. It had previously recorded $9.3 billion in legal expenses in the third quarter to build reserves in anticipation of the deal and other payouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDIC's numbers are lower than those of JPMorgan because the agency's tally only looks at the bank's subsidiaries that have deposit insurance, and not the entire corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total net profit at FDIC-insured banks was $36 billion in the quarter, $1.5 billion less than a year ago, constituting the first year-on-year decline in profits since the second quarter of 2009, when the industry started recovering from the credit crisis of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also off from a downwardly revised $38.1 billion total industry profit in the prior quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The near disappearance of mortgage refinancing due to rising interest rates has hindered bank revenue," James Chessen, chief economist at the American Bankers Association, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower loan-loss provisions were a significant positive contribution as banks set aside $5.8 billion, the smallest reported by the industry since the third quarter of 1999, the FDIC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term positive trends also continued, as fewer institutions reported quarterly losses, credit quality continued to improve, lending grew at a modest pace, and fewer banks failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equity capital increased by $13.9 billion, or almost 1 percent, after declining in the previous quarter, with retained earnings adding $13.1 billion to the rise. Dividends rose strongly, at a rate of 11.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six banks failed in the quarter, while 43 were absorbed in mergers and one new institution was added.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds detail on JPMorgan))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Douwe Miedema&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Nov 26 (Reuters) - Huge legal costs at JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co and slowing demand for mortgages as interest
rates rose caused the first decline in bank profits since 2009,
a third-quarter regulatory update said  on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher interest rates lowered the value of fixed income
assets and sapped demand for mortgage refinancing, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net interest margins benefited from the rise, but they were
still lower than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A $4 billion increase in litigation expenses at one
institution - not named by the FDIC but identified as JPMorgan
by a source - was the main reason why net income at U.S. banks
declined 3.9 percent year-on-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Had it not been for that, the upward trend in earnings
would have continued," FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said at a
news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the bank agreed to pay $13 billion to settle
charges it misrepresented the quality of mortgages it sold
before the crisis. It had previously recorded $9.3 billion in
legal expenses in the third quarter to build reserves in
anticipation of the deal and other payouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDIC's numbers are lower than those of JPMorgan because
the agency's tally only looks at the bank's subsidiaries that
have deposit insurance, and not the entire corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total net profit at FDIC-insured banks was $36 billion in
the quarter, $1.5 billion less than a year ago, constituting the
first year-on-year decline in profits since the second quarter
of 2009, when the industry started recovering from the credit
crisis of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also off from a downwardly revised $38.1 billion
total industry profit in the prior quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The near disappearance of mortgage refinancing due to
rising interest rates has hindered bank revenue," James Chessen,
chief economist at the American Bankers Association, said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower loan-loss provisions were a significant positive
contribution as banks set aside $5.8 billion, the smallest
reported by the industry since the third quarter of 1999, the
FDIC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term positive trends also continued, as fewer
institutions reported quarterly losses, credit quality continued
to improve, lending grew at a modest pace, and fewer banks
failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equity capital increased by $13.9 billion, or almost 1
percent, after declining in the previous quarter, with retained
earnings adding $13.1 billion to the rise. Dividends rose 
strongly, at a rate of 11.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six banks failed in the quarter, while 43 were absorbed in
mergers and one new institution was added. The total number of
banks whose deposits are guaranteed by the FDIC stands at 6,891,
the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 4421 Trust
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, series 4421 'AA+/F1'; Stable Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --DRIVERs, series 4421 'AA+'; Stable Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA+'; Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4421 
      PUTTERs and series 4421 DRIVERs are based on the ratings that Fitch has 
      assigned to the The Regents of the University of California General 
      Revenue Bonds, 2013 Series AF (rated 'AA+'; Stable Outlook) that have 
      been deposited in the series 4421 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4421 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (rated 
      A+/F1'; Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the PUTTERs will 
      expire on June 30, 2014, the expiration date of the liquidity facility, 
      unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

			Goodwin Procter&#8217;s Growing Appellate Litigation Practice Adds Two U.S. 
      Supreme Court Law Clerks
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Goodwin 
      Procter LLP, a national Am Law 50 firm, announced today that two 
      recent law clerks to Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court have joined the 
      firm as associates in the firm&#8217;s growing Appellate Litigation Practice. David 
      J. Zimmer, who served as law clerk to Justice Elena Kagan, and Brian 
      Burgess, who served as law clerk to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, will 
      reside in the firm&#8217;s San Francisco and Washington, D.C. offices, 
      respectively. They join seven other former Supreme Court clerks who are 
      currently practicing at Goodwin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Zimmer and Burgess will leverage their U.S. Supreme Court experience to 
      support the continued growth of the firm&#8217;s appellate litigation work. 
      They will contribute to client work on a range of appellate matters and 
      complex civil litigation, as well as the development of briefs for cases 
      before federal, state and foreign appellate courts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Law clerks to the U.S. Supreme Court have many compelling options upon 
      entering into private practice, and they typically consider offers only 
      from those law firms that clients retain at the appellate phase of a 
      case,&#8221; said Kevin 
      P. Martin, co-chair of Goodwin&#8217;s Appellate 
      Litigation Practice and a former law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court 
      Justice Antonin Scalia. &#8220;Having both David and Brian join Goodwin not 
      only strengthens our support for clients, but also reflects our 
      commitment to expanding our work in the appellate area. These are two 
      highly impressive attorneys with sterling credentials, and we are 
      excited to welcome them to the firm.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This expansion of Goodwin Procter&#8217;s appellate practice follows the 
      addition of Appellate Litigation co-chair William 
      Jay, a partner in the firm&#8217;s Washington office. Prior to joining 
      Goodwin Procter in 2012, Jay served for five years as Assistant to the 
      Solicitor General at the U.S. Department of Justice, following his 
      clerkship for Justice Scalia. He has argued 11 cases before the Supreme 
      Court, briefed more than 20 Supreme Court cases on the merits and 
      handled more than 30 cases in appellate courts nationwide, including 
      every U.S. Court of Appeals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Before his Supreme Court clerkship, Zimmer also served as a law clerk 
      for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Prior to his legal 
      career, he helped design and implement large-scale surveys with the 
      Government of Sierra Leone Statistics Bureau, including oversight of the 
      World Bank Sierra Leone Employers Survey. He received his J.D. from 
      Harvard Law School, his M.P.A. in International Development from the 
      Harvard Kennedy School and his A.B. in Social Studies from Harvard 
      College.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prior to his Supreme Court clerkship, Burgess worked in the Department 
      of Justice as a special assistant to the Solicitor General, where he 
      successfully briefed and argued a criminal appeal before the Seventh 
      Circuit. He also served as a law clerk on the U.S. Courts of Appeals for 
      the D.C. Circuit and Second Circuit. He received his J.D. from New York 
      University and his A.B. from Dartmouth College.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Members of Goodwin&#8217;s Appellate 
      Litigation Practice have briefed and argued hundreds of high-stakes 
      appeals, securing victories for clients in federal and state appellate 
      courts throughout the United States.

			JPMorgan Chase Adds Autism Benefits to Employee Health Plan
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE:JPM) is adding autism benefits for employees 
      participating in the company&#8217;s health plan. Effective January 1, 2014, 
      intensive behavior therapy for treatment of autism spectrum disorders, 
      such as Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Therapy, will be a covered 
      benefit for employees and their families.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;JPMorgan Chase is excited to offer ABA Therapy and provide this 
      important treatment alternative for the children of our employees,&#8221; said 
      Stephen Cutler, JPMorgan Chase General Counsel and Advisor to Access 
      Ability, the firm&#8217;s Business Resource Group (BRG) for employees affected 
      by disabilities. &#8220;One in 88 children is diagnosed with Autism. With 
      almost 160,000 employees enrolled in our U.S. medical plan, we are 
      confident that this important new offering will change the lives of many 
      of our employees.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For many years, my son was unable to receive the necessary treatments 
      he needs, due to a lack of insurance treatment coverage. This change 
      will allow us to provide a therapy that will help him prosper,&#8221; said 
      Michael Giangregorio, Vice President in U.S. Fixed Income at JPMorgan 
      Chase. &#8220;Thank you to the leadership of JPMorgan Chase for recognizing 
      this need and for taking the necessary steps to help ensure that my son 
      reaches his fullest potential.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ABA Therapy focuses on increasing positive behaviors while reducing 
      those that cause harm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We constantly review our benefits programs and offerings to make sure 
      they address the needs of our employees and their families,&#8221; said John 
      Donnelly, head of Human Resources, JPMorgan Chase  Co. &#8220;I am 
      particularly pleased about this new benefit as I have been actively 
      involved in helping children with autism as a supporter of Heeling 
      Autism, a program sponsored by Guiding Eyes for the Blind that enhances 
      safety, companionship and opportunities for independence for autistic 
      children.&#8221;

			JPMorgan Chase Adds Autism Benefits to Employee Health Plan
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE:JPM) is adding autism benefits for employees 
      participating in the company&#8217;s health plan. Effective January 1, 2014, 
      intensive behavior therapy for treatment of autism spectrum disorders, 
      such as Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Therapy, will be a covered 
      benefit for employees and their families.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;JPMorgan Chase is excited to offer ABA Therapy and provide this 
      important treatment alternative for the children of our employees,&#8221; said 
      Stephen Cutler, JPMorgan Chase General Counsel and Advisor to Access 
      Ability, the firm&#8217;s Business Resource Group (BRG) for employees affected 
      by disabilities. &#8220;One in 88 children is diagnosed with Autism. With 
      almost 160,000 employees enrolled in our U.S. medical plan, we are 
      confident that this important new offering will change the lives of many 
      of our employees.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For many years, my son was unable to receive the necessary treatments 
      he needs, due to a lack of insurance treatment coverage. This change 
      will allow us to provide a therapy that will help him prosper,&#8221; said 
      Michael Giangregorio, Vice President in U.S. Fixed Income at JPMorgan 
      Chase. &#8220;Thank you to the leadership of JPMorgan Chase for recognizing 
      this need and for taking the necessary steps to help ensure that my son 
      reaches his fullest potential.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ABA Therapy focuses on increasing positive behaviors while reducing 
      those that cause harm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We constantly review our benefits programs and offerings to make sure 
      they address the needs of our employees and their families,&#8221; said John 
      Donnelly, head of Human Resources, JPMorgan Chase  Co. &#8220;I am 
      particularly pleased about this new benefit as I have been actively 
      involved in helping children with autism as a supporter of Heeling 
      Autism, a program sponsored by Guiding Eyes for the Blind that enhances 
      safety, companionship and opportunities for independence for autistic 
      children.&#8221;

			Goldman Sachs Asset Management Launches First Closed-End Fund
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Goldman Sachs MLP Income Opportunities Fund Raises $826.3 Million in 
      Initial Public Offering With Aim to Deliver Exposure to America&#8217;s 
      Rapidly Expanding Energy Sector
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For investors seeking to participate in America&#8217;s current energy 
      expansion, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (&#8220;GSAM&#8221;) is pleased to 
      announce the public listing of the Goldman Sachs MLP Income 
      Opportunities Fund (the &#8220;Fund&#8221;), now trading on the New York Stock 
      Exchange under the ticker symbol &#8220;GMZ.&#8221; This is the first closed-end 
      fund ever launched by GSAM.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of advances in drilling, extraction and refining, the US is 
      on a path toward energy independence, primed to surpass Saudi Arabia as 
      the world&#8217;s largest oil producer by 20201.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Expanding our mutual fund platform into closed end funds is an 
      important strategic initiative for GSAM, and we are pleased to have such 
      a successful initial launch,&#8221; said James McNamara, President of the 
      Goldman Sachs Funds in GSAM. GSAM currently manages more than $208 
      billion in US mutual funds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fund aims to invest primarily in Master Limited Partnerships 
      (&#8220;MLPs&#8221;)&#8212;a tax-advantaged structure created for use by energy firms to 
      support growing hydrocarbon extraction and increasing energy demand. 
      Focused specifically on midstream infrastructure, these essential 
      companies include pipeline operators, processors, and fractionation and 
      storage facilities. The Fund seeks a high level of total return with an 
      emphasis on current distributions to shareholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have strong conviction that compelling opportunities in MLP 
      investing lie with midstream companies collecting toll-like revenues, 
      which, we believe, are less exposed to underlying commodity prices,&#8221; 
      said Kyri Loupis, Managing Director and lead portfolio manager for the 
      Fund. &#8220;Our index-agnostic approach and closed-end structure allows us to 
      execute on our best investment ideas, including those offered by smaller 
      cap MLPs poised for higher levels of growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fund is managed by GSAM&#8217;s Energy  Infrastructure Team, among the 
      industry&#8217;s largest and longest-tenured MLP investment groups. As of 
      September 30, 2013, the team managed approximately $6.4 billion in MLPs 
      and other energy sector investments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;MLPs have historically delivered attractive distributions to investors, 
      as well as low interest rate sensitivity2. These attributes 
      can be beneficial to investors in either a low or rising rate 
      environment,&#8221; said Loupis. &#8220;Through the launch of this closed-end fund, 
      we&#8217;re able to provide investors another avenue to access MLP exposure&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fund raised $826.3 million in its common share offering, excluding 
      any exercise of the underwriters&#8217; option to purchase additional shares. 
      If the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, the 
      Fund will raise $950.1 million. Underwriters may exercise their 
      overallotment option up to 45 days after the initial public offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and BofA Merrill Lynch were lead underwriters 
      in connection with the offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman Sachs Asset Management is the asset management arm of The 
      Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), which manages $878 billion as of 
      September 30, 2013. Goldman Sachs Asset Management has been providing 
      discretionary investment advisory services since 1988 and has investment 
      professionals in all major financial centers around the world. The 
      company offers investment strategies across a broad range of asset 
      classes to institutional and individual clients globally. Founded in 
      1869, Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking, securities 
      and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial 
      services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes 
      corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth 
      individuals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Risk Disclosures
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount 
      from their net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;), which may increase investors&#8217; risk 
      of loss. This risk may be greater for investors expecting to sell their 
      shares in a relatively short period of time after completion of the 
      public offering. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market 
      price that is above or below NAV, and may be worth more or less than 
      your original investment. There is no assurance that the Fund will meet 
      its investment objective.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investments in securities of MLPs involve risks that differ from 
      investments in common stock, including among others risks related to 
      limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting MLPs, 
      potential conflicts of interest risk, cash flow risks, dilution risks 
      and trading risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that 
      an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than 
      their original cost. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 
      Please see the Fund&#8217;s prospectus for more risk information.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investors should consider their investment goals, time horizons and 
      risk tolerance before investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund 
      is not appropriate for all investors, and the Fund is not intended to be 
      a complete investment program. Investors should carefully review and 
      consider the Fund&#8217;s investment objective, risks, charges and expenses 
      before investing. The prospectus, 
      which contains this and other information about the Fund, should be read 
      carefully before investing. A copy of the prospectus can be obtained 
      from the Fund&#8217;s website by visiting www.goldmansachsfunds.com, 
      by contacting your financial advisor or by calling (855) 807-2742.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM concentrates on building end to end systems that are able to adapt 
      of market changes. While this may make the IBM product set seem overly 
      heavy in the short run, in the long run, this is of enormous value to 
      clients as proved by the company market leading position in innovation 
      software.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This forecast below is predicated on the assumption that IBM makes 
      available the Watson cognitive computing capability worldwide as a SaaS 
      tool immediately, and people with smart phones learn that for five cents 
      they can access solid medical opinions relating to particular symptoms.

			Research and Markets: 2013 Report on IBM's Software Innovation - with 
      Forecasts to 2019
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/hwn566/ibm_software) 
      has announced the addition of a new report "2013 
      Report on IBM's Software Innovation - with Forecasts to 2019" 
      to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Some software is better than other software in supporting innovation. 
      Simple software changes challenge the best of IT departments in many 
      cases, just for software that is used to run the business. For software 
      used to create entire new business initiatives, innovation software is 
      needed. Innovation software is used to handle the complexity of 
      supporting a current market offering while tailoring a new modality.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Innovation is needed by an enterprise to gain competitive advantage and 
      respond to change in markets. Software used to effect business change, 
      to make innovation happen is fundamentally different from established 
      applications software and the infrastructure that supports those 
      applications. Software for Innovation is most often tuned to supporting 
      any kind of analytics, to helping the line of business change the 
      fundamental nature of the business as product cycles create new market 
      opportunity that demands attention.

&lt;p&gt;MILAN/ROME Nov 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs,
Citigroup and Mediobanca will act as co-global
coordinators in Monte dei Paschi di Siena's 3-billion euro ($4
billion) capital increase, three sources with knowledge of the
matter said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss investment bank UBS was already known to
have been appointed as the global coordinator for the rights
issue, which is due to be formally approved by Monte dei
Paschi's board later on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least six other banks have joined the consortium
underwriting the capital increase as bookrunners, the sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment banking revenues in the current quarter are set to drop 7 percent
from the third quarter and 14 percent from a year ago due to weakness in fixed
income, commodities and currencies (FICC) and equities, analysts at JPMorgan
say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Income in FICC, which accounts for the bulk of investment banks' revenue, is
likely to be down 17 percent from the third quarter, excluding Goldman Sachs
 and Barclays, and down 29 percent from the fourth quarter of
2012, JPMorgan says. Analyst Kian Abouhossein says weak foreign exchange,
commodities and rates will be partly offset by strong credit and a recent pick
up in rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equities revenues is forecast to drop 12 percent from the third quarter, but
rise 15 percent from a year ago. Advisory and investment banking income is
expected to be up 6 percent from the previous quarter, but fall 15 percent on
the year, Abouhossein says in a note on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banks have been hit hard by a slump in FICC revenues this year,
hurt by tougher regulations and uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy, which
sapped activity over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The STOXX Europe 600 Banks Index was down 0.3 percent at 190 points
by 0940 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters messaging rm://steve.slater.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net

&lt;p&gt;(Adds details, quotes, background)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Nishant Kumar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Nov 26 (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc
trader Andrew Wang is preparing to launch an Asia hedge fund
that will bet mainly on the coveted combination of Chinese and
Japanese shares to profit from revived investor interest in
Asia's top two economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asia has dozens of hedge funds investing into both countries
separately but funds that combine the two are rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds investing in Japan and Greater China have
returned 22.8 percent and 13.5 percent respectively so far this
year, according to data from industry tracker Eurekahedge,
outpacing the average 12.95 percent return from broader
Asia-wide hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang, a Chinese who speaks fluent Japanese, is currently in
talks with investors and aims to raise $50 million to $100
million to launch the fund by early next year, said people
familiar with the matter who declined to be named as details
about the fund are confidential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund targets a 20 percent annual return, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redstar executives were not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that both China and Japan, the No. 2 and No. 3
economic powers, are structurally positioning a turning point -
a de-leverage cycle and re-leverage cycle respectively," Wang
told clients in a fund marketing document obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These structural changes are likely to provide big
investment opportunities, both on the long-side and short-side,"
he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong market regulator last week granted a licence
to Wang's Redstar Auspicious Capital Management to start the
fund. Wang, who left Goldman earlier this year, is one of
several bankers who set up investment firms as U.S. regulators
restrict banks from trading with their own money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan has this year lured investors as the monetary stimulus
programme launched under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  sent the yen
sliding and stocks surging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's reform agenda has reinforced investor confidence in
the world's second-largest economy, making money managers such
as BlackRock and HSBC Global Asset Management turn
positive about its prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang, a former managing director at Nikko Asset who also
managed the first China A-shares mutual fund, was a proprietary
trader in the Asian shares trading department of Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is joined at Redstar by former Triskele Capital
Management CIO Shiba Tsuyoshi as head of research, the document
showed.

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA (Reuters) - A peace deal between FARC rebels and the Colombian government would greatly help cut cocaine production in Colombia, but officials fear new crime gangs could fill the gap while anti-narcotics police fight a new scourge: synthetic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As government and FARC negotiators in Havana begin discussing illicit drugs - the third item on a five-point peace agenda - anti-narcotics police chief General Ricardo Restrepo said Colombia had warned the world about the growing risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will be our next battle," the newly appointed Restrepo told Reuters at his office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are easy to produce in any place; you don't need big laboratories. You can produce synthetic drugs from your home. Certainly they will attract a lot of world attention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, the Colombian government has cracked down on cocaine labs hidden in the jungle and the small-scale farmers producing coca, the raw ingredient used to make cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notorious drug cartels have been dismantled, and a U.S.-backed military offensive against the drug-funded FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, and other insurgent groups has helped cut shipments of cocaine overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while a gram of cocaine is considerably cheaper on the streets of Bogota than an ecstasy tablet or hit of crystal meth, synthetic drugs are easier to produce and traffic than a kilo of cocaine, attracting a new type of drug producer and dealer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gram of cocaine costs about $10 in an upscale neighborhood of the capital, while an ecstasy tablet can go for more than $90, according to police officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the narcotics are produced using pharmaceuticals imported legally from Europe, said Restrepo, who was appointed a month ago during a restructuring of the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The synthetic drugs are then sold locally, he said, but also trafficked to Central America, Mexico and onward to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift toward non-conventional drugs could form part of talks with FARC commanders at the negotiating table in Cuba when they kick off again on Thursday. The two sides are set to discuss how to substitute coca farming for legal alternatives, how to prevent drug use, and improve public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HUGE COCAINE PROFITS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year-long talks have clinched agreement on agricultural reform and the FARC's participation in politics. President Juan Manuel Santos has bet his political legacy on reaching a peace accord with the rebels to end five decades of conflict that has killed more than 200,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While FARC commanders deny it, the government has said the rebels remain involved in the cocaine production chain, from coca cultivation through to the lucrative trafficking overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The peace process will bring the nation many undoubted benefits and help the drug trafficking issue," said Restrepo. Without the FARC, he added, there would be a much greater eradication of coca and a decline in cocaine output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of U.S. aid, Colombian anti-narcotic police have made the lives of drug traffickers difficult in recent years, pretty well eliminating the once powerful cartels and arresting the leaders of new crime gangs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the country of nearly 50 million people remains one of the world's biggest cocaine producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca cultivation fell by a quarter last year to about 48,000 (119,000 acres) hectares as troops cracked down on the growers - well below the estimated 160,000 hectares (395,000 acres) more than 10 years ago. About 309 tons of cocaine can be produced annually from those fields today, Restrepo said, down from some 650 tons more than a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some people still reap huge profits from the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cocaine for export costs about $8,000 in Colombia, while the same amount fetches as much as $15,000 in Mexico and $35,000 in the United States. In Europe and Asia, the figure is even higher, Restrepo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a huge challenge. The business creates earnings that are exorbitant, abysmal," he said. "I'm sure we won't eliminate drug trafficking, but we must make sure we reduce it as much as possible, and that demand is kept at a minimum."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Helen Murphy; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Eric Walsh)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;IBM, Microsoft and Google Make Little Headway Against Amazon's IaaS/PaaS Dominance&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;RENO, NV--(Marketwired - Nov 27, 2013) -  New Q3 data from Synergy Research Group shows that the three global IT giants -- Microsoft, IBM and Google -- continue to lag far behind Amazon (AWS) in the IaaS/PaaS market, despite all of them achieving strong growth and despite IBM's acquisition of SoftLayer. Even after adding the PaaS revenues of salesforce.com, in aggregate the group lags some 15% behind Amazon in terms of IaaS/PaaS revenues. In a worldwide market that grew 46% from Q3 of 2012, Amazon grew by 55% and increased its overall market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total IaaS/PaaS revenues for the quarter passed the $2.5 billion milestone, with IaaS accounting for the lion's share -- 64%. North America accounted for 53% of the Q2 market, with EMEA and APAC each accounting for 21% and Latin America 5%. Amazon is the clear market leader in each of the four regions, though the ranking of the chasing pack does differ by region. Associated infrastructure service markets all grew in the quarter, but much more slowly than IaaS and PaaS. Managed hosting revenues grew by 3% year on year, retail colocation grew by 8% and CDN by 14%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been analyzing the IaaS/PaaS markets for quite a few quarters now and creating these leadership metrics, and the relative positioning of the leaders really hasn't changed much. While Amazon dwarfs all competition, the race is on to see if any of the big four followers can distance themselves from their peers," said Synergy Research Group's John Dinsdale. "The good news for these companies and for the long tail of operators with relatively small cloud infrastructure service operations, is that IaaS/PaaS will be growing strongly long into the future, providing plenty of opportunity for robust revenue growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Synergy Research Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synergy provides quarterly market sizing and segmentation data on cloud infrastructure services and related markets, including operator revenues by segment and by region.

			Palmetto Technology Group (PTG) Helps Agency Advisors Move to the 
      Cloud and Improve Productivity with Office 365  Microsoft Dynamics CRM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Palmetto 
      Technology Group (PTG) &#8211; Microsoft 
      Cloud Partner of the Year (East Region) and outsourced 
      IT support company headquartered in South Carolina &#8211; announced today 
      that Agency Advisors achieved greater productivity and stability through 
      the recent implementation of Office 
      365, Microsoft 
      Dynamics CRM, and Cloud 
      Computing. Agency Advisors, a leading provider of commercial real 
      estate underwriting, due diligence, and asset management consultancy 
      services, implemented these technology solutions to better meet the 
      needs of its growing client base and to create greater efficiency.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the support of PTG, Agency Advisors recently implemented Office 365 
      and moved to cloud computing. &#8220;We evaluated other cloud-based 
      services for productivity &#8211; but ultimately we settled on Office 
      365. By moving to the cloud, we gained new functionality and avoided 
      having to re-learn software,&#8221; said Brian Smith, vice president at Agency 
      Advisors. &#8220;We also didn&#8217;t have to compromise on security &#8211; a key 
      component for our business &#8211; with Office 365.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Because Agency Advisors&#8217; email is stored in the cloud, the company has 
      stopped having issues with full inboxes. &#8220;We no longer have the headache 
      of storing local archives because everything is completely in the cloud, 
      in one place, and accessible from anywhere in the world and from mobile 
      devices,&#8221; said Smith. And, with solutions like SharePoint, 
      Agency Advisors has streamlined communication and collaboration between 
      its Greenville headquarters and satellite offices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally, Agency Advisors added Microsoft 
      Dynamics CRM to its technology set and currently uses CRM to track 
      communications with clients and prospects and to set meetings and call 
      backs. &#8220;With Dynamics CRM, we know who&#8217;s working on what deal and with 
      what client, its current status, and when we will deliver it,&#8221; said 
      Scott Williams, assistant vice president at Agency Advisors. &#8220;We also 
      use Dynamics to determine an agent&#8217;s capacity; we have to know where our 
      resources are to see where to allocate business,&#8221; explained Williams.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One month after the CRM implementation, Agency Advisors noted a jump in 
      efficiency. &#8220;Microsoft Dynamics has definitely made tracking sales a 
      much more efficient process,&#8221; said Williams. &#8220;Dynamics enables us to 
      follow every single loan transaction and certain data within those 
      transactions, so we can cross reference it for new deals. Consequently, 
      every time we have a new deal, we can pull standard information from 
      other files instead of redoing it all from scratch.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Office 365 and Cloud Computing help complex and growing businesses like 
      Agency Advisors benefit from familiar software solutions without major 
      downtime from a lengthy implementation and training,&#8221; said Reed Wilson, 
      president at PTG. &#8220;Plus, tools like Microsoft Dynamics CRM can enhance 
      productivity very quickly which later translates into dollars saved,&#8221; he 
      continued.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve was pressing JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) to distance itself from its metals warehousing business more than a year ago, documents seen by Reuters show, long before the issue became a focal point in the debate over Wall Street's role in physical commodities trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of letters between JPMorgan's lawyers and the Fed, released to Reuters through a Freedom of Information Act request, show Wall Street's primary regulator took a tough stance on the bank's efforts to hold onto the global network of Henry Bath &amp; Sons warehouses, part of the larger RBS Sempra commodity trading business it bought in mid-2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correspondence shows the Fed balked at JPMorgan's request to turn the one-time trading assets into a strictly arms-length financial investment back in June 2012, and told the bank it must provide quarterly updates on what it was doing to either comply with banking rules, or sell the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed also pressured JPMorgan to dilute the amount of metal held by its own traders in Henry Bath, an issue that has riled major metal consumers and critics of a copper investment fund the bank was trying to launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, by May this year, JPMorgan had decided to simply sell the business, the letters show. Three months later, with broader pressure mounting over Wall Street's involvement in the raw materials supply chain, JPMorgan would put its entire physical commodity trading business on the block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documents, which consist of six letters over a period of 13 months, provide the deepest look yet at how the Federal Reserve has wrestled with the thorny regulatory question of banks and physical commodity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They show the Fed has at times taken a tough line with banks in the sector, and may darken the outlook for Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), both of which still own physical commodity trading assets such as warehouses, pipelines and oil storage tanks. Both banks argue that a 1999 law gives them greater latitude to own and operate assets as they are former investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letters also raise questions about the Fed's willingness to allow Wall Street to convert former trading assets into passive merchant investments that they can own for up to a decade. Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley have claimed this authority to retain or pursue new investments in recent years, Reuters reported last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for JPMorgan and the Fed both declined to comment on the letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WALL STREET'S WAREHOUSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve announced in July that it was reviewing the broader role of Wall Street banks in physical commodity trading amid rising political scrutiny, and fears that so-called "too big to fail" banks may be taking on unnecessary risks by operating oil tankers and power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it has been tackling the issue for years as Wall Street deepened its collective push into commodity markets, a trend that reached its zenith with JPMorgan's $1.6 billion purchase in 2010 of RBS Sempra, which included Henry Bath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan knew from the outset that the warehouses presented a problem. As a Fed-regulated commercial bank, it did not have the authority to own "non-conforming" assets such as warehouses for longer than a two-year grace period (with three possible one-year extensions). The Fed had already ordered the previous owner, Edinburgh-based Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), to get out of the business of owning commodities storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, metals warehousing has drawn attention due to allegations that banks and merchants have tried to game the London Metal Exchange (LME) warehousing rules, deliberately creating bottlenecks for aluminum consumers such as drinks can makers to boost storage income, while raising physical prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has long said its Henry Bath customers face no long queues, in contrast to the Metro International Trade Services warehouses operated by Goldman Sachs, where metal owners have to wait as long as a year. Goldman has previously denied Metro was driving up prices or violating any laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But JPMorgan has nevertheless been named in a series of class-action lawsuits targeting the industry, and is the subject, alongside other banks and merchants, of a Commodity Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) probe. The Department of Justice is also looking into the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also created controversy in metal markets by trying to launch a physical copper exchange-traded fund for small investors, which would have been backed by metal stored in Henry Bath sheds. Many in the market feared it would artificially tighten supplies and drive up prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By early 2012, other metals traders said JPMorgan was directing aluminum supplies into its own warehouses in Rotterdam, Europe's largest port, and in Chicago. Since the late 1980s, Henry Bath has been owned by trading firms that tended to use it primarily as a place to store their own metal rather than rent out space to other companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear what percentage of metal held in Henry Bath was owned by JPMorgan's traders, but it was high enough to alarm the Federal Reserve and to make it difficult for JPMorgan to classify the asset as a strictly passive investment. By law, banks can only claim the so-called "merchant" authority if there is no interconnection between the bank and the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although JPMorgan operated Henry Bath at arm's length on a corporate level, the commercial ties ran deeper, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Henry Bath has always been a creature of its owners," said an executive at a rival warehousing firm. Prior to JPMorgan and RBS, Henry Bath had been owned by Sempra Commodities, Enron and legendary German trading house Metallgesellschaft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FED REJECTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the apparent obstacles, JPMorgan initially told the Fed it wanted to keep Henry Bath under its merchant authority, which would have allowed it to keep the firm until 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2012, it requested a one-year extension of the grace period to conform the business. But the Fed paused. Instead, after what JPMorgan said were "conversations with (Fed) Board staff", the bank's lawyers submitted a revised request in August, seeking three one-year extensions all at once, with no mention of how it intended to own the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the Fed balked, eventually granting just a basic one-year extension that November, and stipulating that the bank must file a detailed road-map on plans to either conform or sell the business, including quarterly updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear why the Fed declined the three-year extension to the grace period, or what occurred during the discussions held during the interim. But the tone suggests a clear shift in approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems that long before July they made a decision to sell it because the focus of the letters seemed to shift from conformance to divestiture," said a banking lawyer who reviewed the letters but was not authorized to speak to the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By March of this year, it was holding discussions regarding an "outright sale" of the business while also continuing efforts to conform it. JPMorgan was talking to other commodity companies about storing more metal in Henry Bath, in an attempt to "decrease the average percentage" of metals owned by the bank in its 75 warehouses, according to a letter that month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just over one month later however, JPMorgan had given up attempting to retain the business as a merchant investment, a letter dated May 1 shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's decision to sell Henry Bath this year was made after "internal and external" discussions, said a source familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS had also contemplated seeking to keep Henry Bath as a merchant deal after buying into the Sempra Commodities business in 2008, but ultimately decided that it would be better to divest Henry Bath than hold it at arm's length, according to a person familiar with the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources were not authorized to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROFITS HIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, even as the Fed was pressing, the attraction of being in the metals storage business was waning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LME was working on a major overhaul of its warehousing policy aimed at appeasing industrial users who have complained about long wait times and inflated prices for their metal. It proposed a series of tougher new rules this July, and beefed up those measures early in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry Bath reported a profit of just $2.4 million last year, down from $28 million in 2011 mainly due to higher taxes, according to filings with British commercial register, Companies House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others are also feeling the heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have argued that their physical commodity businesses should be grandfathered, both are moving to sell or spin out some parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs executives have publicly said the business remains "core" to its operations, but last week it emerged that the bank would resume talks with parties interested in buying Metro, and was also moving to sell its uranium trading desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan and other banks have adjusted their game depending on the playing field," said Saule Omarova, associate professor of law at the University of North Carolina and a visiting professor at Cornell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The calculus remains complex. And the economics depend on regulatory decisions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD Nov 28 (Reuters) - PetroChina  
has bought a 25 percent stake in the West Qurna-1 oilfield
project from Exxon Mobil, strengthening China's hold on
Iraq's energy resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is already the top foreign player in Iraq's oilfields,
which are the largest in the Middle East open to foreign
investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq said in August that Exxon Mobil was selling more than
half of its 60 percent holding in the field - with Indonesia's
Pertamina taking 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 25 percent stake in the Technical Service Contract (TSC)
for the vast oilfield gives "a larger and stronger presence in
the upstream operations in the Middle East," Petrochina, part of
state-owned China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon remains operator of the project, despite reducing its
stake to 25 percent, while Pertamina has 10 percent, Royal Dutch
Shell 15 percent and the Iraqi state keeps 25 percent,
oil ministry spokesman Asim Jihad said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pertamina could not be reached for immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq's reserves are an alluring prospect for energy firms
seeking to secure new oil supplies, despite tough contract terms
imposed by Baghdad and ongoing security problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Exxon offered to sell its entire stake after a
dispute with Baghdad over contracts it signed with Iraq's
autonomous Kurdistan region - deals the central government
rejects as illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It later committed to further investment at the field - now
pumping almost 500,000 barrels a day - and stepped back from
making a full exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cash-rich China's advance in Iraq has already given it a
strong position in prized southern oilfields, and through
Chinese oil company Sinopec, its reach has extended
into the northern Kurdish region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term access to reserves is a strategic imperative for 
China, a major buyer of Iraqi crude, and Beijing is prepared to
accept tougher terms and lower profits than Western oil majors,
which have to answer to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq has the world's fourth-largest oil reserves and wants to
at least double its production in the next few years and
ultimately challenge Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's
biggest oil supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Nov 28 (Reuters) - Indonesia's energy ministry will
not renew Chevron Corp's oil contract at a small

oil firm Pertamina, industry officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transfer of the Siak oilfield, which produces around

foreign ownership and grab more revenue from its natural

total energy production in Indonesia of around 320,000 barrels
of crude and 636 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.
Chevron is Indonesia's largest oil producer.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The latest customer experience innovation from Nationwide Building Society&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM--(Marketwired - Nov 28, 2013) -  From 26 November 2013, Nationwide Building Society, in partnership with Visa Europe, is announcing the launch of V.me by Visa, a digital wallet that will offer the Society's over six and a half million credit and debit card customers an innovative new way to make shopping online faster, easier and more secure. Nationwide is the first financial services provider to launch this digital wallet in the UK, which aims to provide customers with a seamless online shopping experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;V.me by Visa allows customers to upload multiple cards into a digital wallet. These are safely stored enabling customers to make future purchases without the need to repeatedly enter their card details. As card details are not being passed on to each individual merchant, V.me by Visa is not only faster and easier, but also provides a more secure way of making payments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham Beale, Nationwide's Chief Executive, said: "I'm excited that Nationwide is once again at the forefront of technological innovation by offering the V.me by Visa digital wallet, which will provide our members with a safe, secure and enhanced online shopping experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In 1997, Nationwide were first to offer the UK consumer internet banking and we are always looking to invest in ways to improve the customer experience by pioneering new technology. In 2008 Nationwide took the decision to invest &#163;1bn in the future of the organisation by implementing a large scale systems modernisation programme."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Perry, Chief Commercial Officer for Visa Europe, added: "We're delighted that Nationwide has launched the UK's first V.me by Visa wallet to its members. The wallet can already be used at over 1,400 online merchants, including household names like Curry's and Clarks. By Christmas there will be more than 4,000 places where you can use V.me by Visa in the UK, and more across Europe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently the Society has rolled out a number of digital innovations focused on enhancing customer experience, such as developing one of the highest ranked mobile banking apps and investing in future branch technology with the Cisco Remote Expert. This enables customers to "meet" with a mortgage consultant through a high definition video link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;V.me by Visa is the latest phase of Nationwide's commitment to creating new ways of delivering great customer service and competitive products through digital and technological advances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 1,400 online merchants already accept V.me by Visa, including Clark's, Curry's and PC World. Plans are in place to grow the number of merchants to more than 4,000 later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further details about V.me can be found at here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A video showing the benefits of V.me can be found at here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Nationwide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationwide is the world's largest building society as well one of the largest savings provider and a top-three provider of mortgages in the UK. It is also a major provider of current accounts, credit cards, ISAs and personal loans.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A shareholder who suffered losses in a penny stock trading debacle in Singapore is suing Goldman Sachs, accusing the investment bank of arbitrarily selling her holdings and saying the sales contributed to a crash in their prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Blumont Group Ltd, Asiasons Capital Ltd and LionGold Corp Ltd - three firms interlinked by cross shareholdings and common officers - lost a combined market value of about S$8 billion ($6.4 billion) in just three days of trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court case may shed light on the causes of the crash. Both the crash and huge run-ups in their share prices earlier in the year left many in the market mystified, prompting the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the stock exchange to launch an extensive review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed in the High Court in London on November 20 by Quah Su Ling, who held stocks in all three companies and is the chief executive of investment firm IPCO International Ltd, the second-largest shareholder in Blumont. It is being brought against London-based Goldman Sachs International, a fully owned unit of Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quah said that on October 2 Goldman demanded she pay back about S$61 million ($49 million) in loans in cash, giving her only 1.5 hours to do so, according to the filing which was seen by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Quah failed to make the repayment, Goldman issued a notice of default and immediately started to sell Quah's collateral, including shares in investment firm Asiasons, Blumont, a natural resources investment company, and gold miner LionGold, the filing says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also said that Goldman neglected to contact Hong Kong-based Vicario Investments Limited, which had agreed to buy 10 million shares each in LionGold and Blumont from her in cash, according to the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"...the Defendant continued to sell the Claimant's LionGold and Blumont shares knowing full well that the continued sale of the said shares would depress the share prices and jeopardize the intended purchase by Vicario," the filing added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman for Goldman in London, declined to comment on the case. Quah, who is seeking unspecified damages, could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blumont and Asiasons did not respond to requests for comment about Quah's case. LionGold declined to comment. All three companies have previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to the falls in their share prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact details for Vicario Investments could not be immediately obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alleged action by Goldman came after Singapore Exchange Ltd on October 1 issued a particularly detailed query to Blumont, asking if its activities had justified an eightfold rise in its share price in the first nine months of the year. The query was one of several made to the three companies in September and early October about the rise in their share prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, the three stocks started to plummet, transforming them back into the penny stocks they had once been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three other individuals also received demands from Goldman Sachs to repay loans on October 2, including Wong Chin Yong, chief executive officer of Innopac Holdings Ltd, James Hong, executive director at Blumont and Ng Su Ling, a director at LionGold and at the time, also a director at Blumont, according to the court papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong told Reuters that he was also suing Goldman Sachs but declined to elaborate further. It was not clear if a suit had been filed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Records from the High Court in London show Ng has filed a lawsuit against Goldman, though details were also not immediately available. Ng could not be reached for comment, while LionGold said that Ng's suit was a personal case and did not relate to the management of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's Bullock declined to comment on Ng's lawsuit and possible legal action by Hong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wong and Innopac, a property and equity investment firm, did not immediately reply to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some brokers in Singapore had put trading restrictions on the stocks during September due to concerns that their value was no longer matched by fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Singapore Exchange queried Asiasons and Blumont twice and LionGold once about their share prices in the weeks leading up to the crash, but did not put in place trading curbs until after the stocks started to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exchange later came under fire for lifting those trading curbs before the companies could issue clarifications about their stock moves. It has said that it deployed a series of tools to restore stability in the market when the stocks began to fall and that it uses separate measures to investigate possible wrongdoing.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Nov 30 (Reuters) - A shareholder who suffered
losses in a penny stock trading debacle in Singapore is suing
Goldman Sachs, accusing the investment bank of
arbitrarily selling her holdings and saying the sales
contributed to a crash in their prices.&lt;/p&gt;

the chief executive of investment firm IPCO International Ltd

the stocks during September due to concerns that their value was
no longer matched by fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Singapore Exchange queried Asiasons and Blumont twice
