&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co urged dismissal of a complaint by a top-producing private banker who claims she was fired for questioning the dealings of a lucrative client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former vice president Jennifer Sharkey had accused JPMorgan of firing her in August 2009 after resisting her call to break ties with an Israeli customer who had been a client for 20 years and generated some $600,000 of business annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharkey said she was punished for her role in an internal probe into the client's alleged involvement in mail fraud, bank fraud and money laundering, and fired six days after urging the second-largest U.S. bank to drop the client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tuesday's filing in Manhattan federal court, JPMorgan asked U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet to throw out the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said Sharkey was not covered under whistleblower protection of the federal Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed after Enron Corp's 2001 demise, because it was the client accused of doing something illegal, not the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The absence of any allegation here that JPMorgan Chase itself was violating any of the statutes or regulations enumerated in the Sarbanes-Oxley statute, is fatal to the complaint," JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the bank said it had a right to fire Sharkey at will, and that her claims about the client's alleged activity were not specific enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it has an anti-retaliation policy in its code of conduct, but not in Sharkey's employment contract. It also said Sharkey's similar complaint filed last year with the U.S. Department of Labor was dismissed in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer representing Sharkey, called the motion to dismiss a delay tactic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether she was an employee at will or not is irrelevant," Wigdor said. "If they terminated her because of her complaint then she's protected by Sarbanes-Oxley."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The complaint was about a client engaged in what she (Sharkey) believed were violations of federal law that ultimately had an impact on shareholder value," Wigdor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to her complaint, Sharkey joined JPMorgan in 2006 and managed accounts for more than 75 clients with total assets in excess of $500 million. She was the second-highest producer in her department, according to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharkey is seeking possible reinstatement, back pay and other money damages, deletion of the firing from her record, and other remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Sharkey v. JPMorgan Chase  Co, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-03824.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Clare Baldwin and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Toni Reinhold and Lincoln Feast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co expects retailers to sell $2.4 billion in "Toy Story 3" merchandise this fiscal year, potentially the company's biggest licensing windfall from a single film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third installment of the toys-come-to-life fantasy, launched in 1995 with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen playing Woody the cowboy and Buzz Lightyear, opens June 18. But Disney has plans for the franchise after its theatrical release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borrowing a page from its "Cars" franchise, executives said they planned to make as many as four short "Toy Story" cartoons per year for television and online, keeping the brand alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cars" has generated $2 billion a year in global merchandise sales since that movie came out in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts say that projection may be overly ambitious. The $2.4 billion Disney is expecting in total retail sales, of which the company gets a portion, would be heavily tilted to the next few months to the end of September, when the company's current fiscal year ends. The figure is roughly equivalent to the turnover Disney's consumer division generates every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're more than halfway through the year so we feel pretty comfortable with that number," said Andy Mooney, head of Disney's consumer products division. "It would most likely be our biggest event property ever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney does not disclose how much revenue it receives from licensing, but analysts said the company could receive more than $200 million from its "Toy Story" merchandise line, based on the company's projections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've been waiting for this one, anticipating huge sales," said Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of Time To Play Magazine, which examines the toy industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's projections for "Toy Story 3" merchandising are based on initial sales, predictions from licensing partners and the historical performance of other franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Disney's partnership with Toys "R" Us, the retailer is creating special boutiques within its nearly 1,300 stores that will be dedicated to the movie's products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first "Toy Story" movie came out in 1995 and the sequel "Toy Story 2" in 1999. Both movies and this latest installment are from Pixar Animation Studios, which Disney bought in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined merchandising -- from toys and apparel to stationery and books -- has so far generated more than $9 billion in global retail sales, Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doug Creutz, analyst with Cowen and Company, does not expect an automatic hit for "Toy Story" merchandising, but that it should perform strongly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of it is going to have to do with how the movie does. If the movie is a big hit then they won't have much of a problem," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's consumer products division generated $2.4 billion in revenue last fiscal year, or about 6.7 percent of the company's overall revenue of $36.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An episodic cartoon series tied to "Toy Story", called "Buzz Lightyear Star Command", aired in recent years. But that was focused on just one character, and Mooney said that it contributed little to the merchandising line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we've learned is, the strength of the property rests on the relationship between the core characters, and that was missing from the original Buzz Lightyear series," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mooney said the planned "Toy Story" cartoons of under seven minutes will be more thematically aligned with the films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer (IE) gained browser usage share last month in the U.S., while major rivals Firefox and Chrome both lost ground, Microsoft said today, citing data from Web analytics firm Net Applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is an incredibly competitive space now, which is incredibly healthy," said Ryan Gavin, director of platform strategies for Microsoft. "But we're already seeing Chrome in retreat in the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Net Applications data not available to the general public, all versions of IE gained 0.76 of a percentage point in U.S. usage share last month, accounting for 63.27% of the browsers used in May. Firefox and Chrome, meanwhile, fell 0.24 and 0.45 of a percentage point, respectively, in the U.S. last month, ending with shares of 20.38% and 4.53%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net Applications confirmed that the data Gavin cited was accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the growth of IE in the U.S. was not enough to offset its decline globally, where Microsoft gave up 0.26 of a percentage point to fall to a new low of 59.7%. Meanwhile, Google 's Chrome and Opera Software's Norwegian-made Opera boosted their worldwide shares in May at the expense of IE and Mozilla's Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By May's end, Chrome accounted for 7.05% of the browsers that surfed to the 40,000 sites that Aliso Viejo, Calif.-based Net Applications monitors for clients. Opera increased its share by 0.13 of a percentage point, its largest increase in eight months, to 2.4%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrome's increase of 0.3 of a percentage point was the browser's smallest gain since August 2009, and significantly off its three- and 12-month averages of nearly half a point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firefox, on the other hand, was again down last month, sliding 0.24 of a percentage point to 24.35% worldwide, marking the fourth time in the last six months that the browser's share slipped. In March and April, Firefox gained back some of the ground it had lost since November 2009, but May's decline cost Mozilla most of the growth it had fought for during the two-month stretch. Firefox now stands at about the same share it had in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once considered a lock to hit and then move beyond the 25% bar, Firefox has yet to reach that milestone. In April, Vince Vizzaccaro, a Net Applications executive vice president, said that Firefox was "just holding steady" and explained that gains that had once come its way were instead being gobbled by Google's Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft disputed that Chrome is grabbing share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IE8 continues to lead in user choice," Gavin argued. "It grew 2.5 times faster than any competitor." He arrived at the two-and-a-half times figure by comparing IE8's global increase of 0.81 of a percentage point with Chrome's growth of 0.32 of a percentage point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE8 closed May with 35.38% of the U.S. browser usage share, making it the most-used browser in the country. Microsoft's IE7 was second, with 16.75%, said Vizzaccaro, while Mozilla's Firefox 3.6 was third with 13%. Google's best showing was at No. 8, where Chrome 4.1 accounted for 3.52%. Chrome 5.0 , which just shifted out of beta into what Google dubs its "stable channel," owned 0.76% of the usage market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is doing extremely well with IE8 in the U.S.," said Vizzaccaro in an e-mail today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;" Windows 7 [growth] is certainly part of the reason why IE8 is growing," said Gavin, when asked for Microsoft's explanation of IE's increase in the U.S. "But there is more choice in [the browser] space than at any other time in history," he said, adding that when IE8 goes head-to-head with rivals, such as in Europe, where Windows users have been offered a government-mandated way to change browsers, IE8 does well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IE8 grew half a percentage point in Europe last month," said Gavin, to 29.69%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides touting the climb of IE8, Gavin also plugged the success that Microsoft has had in driving down the share of the nearly-nine-year-old IE6, the aged browser that Microsoft has been aggressively urging customers to ditch. He confirmed that one of his tasks is to push IE6's share to zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the U.S., we're seeing that tip-over [towards zero]," Gavin said, and again credited Windows 7 and IE8 adoption as reasons. Windows 7, the operating system Microsoft launched last October, was the first to include IE8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has made more headway in its "kill IE6" movement in the U.S. than it has globally. According to Net Applications, IE6 accounted for 6.74% of all browsers used last month in the U.S., a number substantially lower than IE6's worldwide average of 17.13%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two biggest groups of customers still running IE6, said Gavin, are enterprises having trouble migrating because of mission-critical Web applications or sites that rely on the old browser, and users in emerging and underdeveloped markets. There, the global economic recession and sluggish recovery have stalled efforts to upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're working very, very actively [to move IE6's share toward zero], but that takes time," acknowledged Gavin. "We're doing a lot of work with partners and developers on educating users to upgrade to a modern browser," he said, pointing out efforts such as the "Adios IE6" campaign now running in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar campaign in Australia equated IE6 to a carton of long-expired milk. "You wouldn't drink 9-year-old milk," the campaign's marketing copy read in a page that showed a milk carton dated August 2001, the month when IE6 debuted. "So why use a 9-year-old browser?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifth major browser, Apple's Safari, owned a global usage share of 4.77%, up 0.05 of a percentage point, and a 10.38% share in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May's browser usage share data is available on Net Applications' site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;A year after Microsoft launched Bing, the product has returned Microsoft to credibility in the search market, and appears to have prompted renewed innovation at Google .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft took the wraps off the Bing search engine on May 28, 2009, letting it finally replace the far-from-beloved Microsoft Live Search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing was seen as the firing of a shot across the bow of Microsoft's increasingly successful rival Google, which made its name - and most of its fortune - on the back its search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, analysts say, Microsoft has been able to stabilize its position in the all-important search business, and appears to have pushed Google engineers to boost the capabilities of its engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bing had a good first year -- not a breakout performance, but it has succeeded in returning Microsoft to credibility in the Web search arena. That's a huge step forward," said Hadley Reynolds, an analyst at IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The competition from Bing has certainly had an effect on Google's pace of innovation," he added. "Google has made more visible changes in the past six months than in the several preceding years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry watchers have maintained that the pickup in online search development over the past six months could very well change the face of search all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Microsoft and Google have integrated real-time search results into their respective engines, allowing users who query a topic to get results, including Twitter posts, that are only a few seconds old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Google innovations include Google Goggles, a photo-based search tool, and a new left rail on the search results page offering users query refinement options and navigation aides. Those features were part of Bing at its launch, noted Reynolds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a follow-up version of Bing added a feature-rich Bing Maps update had some industry watchers saying that Microsoft may have bested Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Enderle Group, said that while Google definitely sees Bing as a worthy contender, Microsoft's hasn't yet noticeably improved its share of the search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early last month, Hitwise, an online traffic monitor, reported that despite the competition from Bing, users turned to Google for more than 71% of all searches in the U.S. in April, 2% more than the previous month. By contrast, Bing was used for 9.43% of searches for the month, 2% less than in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing had made strong gains in market share in the first months following its release, but by early this year had lost some momentum and saw its numbers start to hold steady or even slip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enderle noted that people are simply accustomed to using Google for searches, and that they will need a strong reason to switch engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bing has done reasonably well, given that Google is entrenched and customers are relatively satisfied," Enderle said. "They did better than any of the other challengers and gave Google a wake-up call. However, Google is hardly weakened -- Bing still needs to up their game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan Olds, an analyst with Gabriel Consulting Group, said Bing's biggest challenge is overcoming Google's place as an embedded piece of online culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bing started out strong with a highly publicized introduction, which may have raised hopes that they'd make a bigger dent in Google's share," said Olds. "However, after the hoopla, the war has settled into trench warfare with small gains and losses on each side. Still Bing hasn't had bad results for only a year out and about as good as can be expected against a dominant and smart competitor like Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could put a new spin on the picture is the fact that Microsoft and Yahoo have decided to combine their search businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies last summer announced plans to have Microsoft's Bing search engine power Yahoo's Web sites , while Yahoo sells premium search advertising services for both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-Yahoo deal has since gained regulatory approval, and a joint engineering team was created to work on adapting Bing for the Yahoo site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies have said they hope the Bing engine is added to the Yahoo site, at least the United States, by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Microsoft and Yahoo partnership is almost certainly going to have an impact on Google and its strategy," said Olds. "The battle will be different. The two companies are a threat to Google now because they have staying power. They're not startups or dabblers. They're in it for the long haul now -- fully committed and willing to invest whatever it takes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Gaudin covers the Internet and Web 2.0, emerging technologies, and desktop and laptop chips for Computerworld .

Consolidated and Brookdale Senior Living</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases details on a group of stocks that are currently members of
the exclusive Zacks #5 Rank List - Stocks to Sell Now. These stocks are
currently rated as a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell): SkyWest, Inc. (Nasdaq:
SKYW)and Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLRE). Further, Zacks announced #4
Rankings (Sell) on two other widely held stocks: Coca-Cola Bottling Co.
Consolidated (Nasdaq: COKE) and Brookdale Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE: BKD). To
see the full Zacks #5 Rank List - Stocks to Sell Now visit:
http://at.zacks.com/?id=92

Since inception in 1988, the S 500 has outperformed the Zacks #5 Rank List of
Stocks to Sell Now by 80% annually (+2% vs. +10%). While the rest of Wall Street
continued to tout stocks during the market declines of the last few years, Zacks
told investors which stocks to sell or avoid. 

Here is a synopsis of why SKYW and GLRE have a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell)
and should most likely be sold or avoided for the next one to three months. Note
that a #5 Strong Sell rating is applied to 5% of all the stocks in the Zacks
Rank universe: 

SkyWest, Inc.`s (Nasdaq: SKYW) first-quarter earnings of 26 cents per share,
reported last month, came in 7 cents short of analysts` expectations. For 2010,
the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved down 23 cents to a profit of $1.47 per share
over the past month as both the covering analysts cut back on projections. The
following year`s forecast dropped 40 cents to $1.30 cents per share in the same
period. 

Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLRE) posted a first-quarter loss of 34
cents per share on May 3 in contrast to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a
profit of 27 cents. Earnings per share in the year-ago period stood at 77 cents
per share. The full-year average forecast is pegged at a profit of $2.59 per
share, which declined from $2.94 in the last 30 days. During that time, next
year`s estimate slid 9 cents to $3.94 per share. 

Here is a synopsis of why COKE and BKD have a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) and should
also most likely be sold or avoided for the next one to three months. Note that
a #4 Sell rating is applied to 15% of all the stocks ranked by Zacks; 

Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated`s (Nasdaq: COKE) first-quarter earnings of
50 cents per share, announced on May 11, fell 34% year over year. Earnings
missed analysts` expectations by 32%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2010
dipped 8 cents to $3.26 per share over the past month as 1 analyst out of 2
revised downwards. The same period has seen a decline of 4 cents in the forecast
for 2011, which now stands at $4.07 per share. 

Brookdale Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE: BKD) reported a first-quarter loss of 12
cents per share last month while analysts anticipated a loss of 10 cents. The
Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year widened 5 cents to a loss of 37
cents per share in the last 30 days as 5 analysts out of 7 pulled back on
expectations. Estimate for next year is pegged at a loss of 15 cents per share,
5 cents worse than a month-ago projection.

works. The free special report; "Zacks Rank Guide: Harnessing the Power of
Earnings Estimate Revisions" is available to provide this insightful background.

About the Zacks Rank

Since 1988, the Zacks Rank has proven that "Earnings estimate revisions are the
most powerful force impacting stock prices." Since inception in 1988, #1 Rank
Stocks have generated an average annual return of +27%. During the 2000-2002
bear market, Zacks #1 Rank stocks gained +43.8%, while the S 500 tumbled
-37.6%. Also note that the Zacks Rank system has just as many Strong Sell
recommendations (Rank #5) as Strong Buy recommendations (Rank #1). Since 1988,
Zacks Rank #5 stocks have significantly underperformed the S 500 (-0.9% versus
+9%). Thus, the Zacks Rank system allows investors to truly manage portfolio
trading effectively.

Positives For Oil Stocks

Oil jumped higher for the second straight day [Thursday]. A major pivot low on
the oil chart from July 2009 was hit on Tuesday around $68 dollars a barrel.
From that level, oil closed at the highs of the day on Tuesday. 

This created a bullish double bottom and pivot low. The last two days, solid
gains followed. While oil is seeing these big gains, oil stocks are also
rocketing higher. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) is jumping more than 2.5%
while Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) is up more than 3% on the day. In recent
weeks, spot crude has dropped approximately 25% from the highs. This size drop
killed oil stocks like Exxon Mobil and Chevron. Today [Thursday], with oil up
for the second straight day, these stocks are soaring. 

In addition to the recent drop in oil, the catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of
Mexico hurt oil companies as well. The driller BP plc (NYSE: BP) has taken the
brunt of the hurt in their stock price but other companies like Transocean LTD
(NYSE: RIG) have also been severely hit. 

Even Exxon and Chevron have been hurt slightly over future drilling prospects.
Positive news has been leaking out (pun intended) that the oil spill may have
stopped. This is great news for the oil companies as a whole as the negative
press may start to subside. In addition, BP is jumping almost 7% and Transocean
is up 6% on the day. Happy days are here again for the oil stocks, at least for
today.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N) are the lead candidates for "senior manager" underwriting roles on the General Motors initial public offering, according to Fox Business Network's Charlie Gasparino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The selection has not yet been finalized but if it is, the two banks could split most of the $300 million in underwriting fees, according to the report which cited people with knowledge of the deal.

&lt;p&gt;While BP Is Largest Spill In U.S., Chevron`s Ecuador Disaster Is Largest In
World

Chevron Admits Dumping at Least 16 Billion Gallons of Toxic Waste into
Rainforest


SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
As the nation remains riveted on the tragic BP spill unfolding in the Gulf of
Mexico, Chevron still holds the record for creating the world`s largest
oil-related contamination and it happened deliberately in the populated Amazon
rainforest in an even more sensitive ecosystem than the marshes of Louisiana. 

Chevron`s illegal oil-related dumping is at the root of a class action lawsuit
in Ecuador where the oil giant now faces more than $27 billion in damages for
poisoning an area the size of Rhode Island with 18.5 billion gallons of toxic
"produced water," or more than 474 times the amount of contamination estimated
to have been spilled in the Gulf of Mexico tragedy, according to calculations
made by representatives of the plaintiffs. 

Chevron`s contamination has decimated the traditional lifestyles of five
indigenous groups in the area, and one group has disappeared, according to the
lawsuit. The pollution occurred when Texaco (now owned by Chevron) was the
exclusive operator of a large oil concession in the rainforest from 1964 to
1990. 

A 17-year trial against Chevron taking place in Ecuador`s courts - moved there
from U.S. federal court in 2002 at Chevron`s request - is expected to end later
this year. Chevron has declared the trial court is "biased" against it and has
announced it will not pay any adverse judgment. 

The plaintiffs in the trial are tens of thousands of rainforest residents,
including the surviving members of indigenous groups called the Secoya, Cofan,
Siona, Huarani, and Kichwa. 

These are the facts of Chevron`s dumping in the Amazon and how it compares to
the BP spill in the Gulf:

* In the 1970s, Chevron`s predecessor company Texaco (bought by Chevron in 2001)
perforated hundreds of oil wells across a 2,000 sq-mile swath of rainforest that
was home to the indigenous groups. The area where Chevron operated is one of the
most biodiverse in the world, containing almost 10% of the world`s plant
species. 
* Instead of re-injecting toxic "produced water" (which contains high levels of
salt, pure crude, and the carcinogen benzene) deep into the ground - the
industry practice then recommended by the American Petroleum Institute - Chevron
dumped 18 billion gallons of it into rivers and streams. These waters had been
used thousands of years by the local population for its drinking water. 
* The BP tragedy was an accident; Chevron`s discharge in Ecuador was deliberate.

* Chevron, as reported by 60 Minutes last year, also built more than 900 unlined
waste pits to permanently store toxic sludge - another violation of industry
standards. It then built pipes to drain the sludge into nearby streams. 
* Chevron also burned gas without controls, creating enormous air pollution and
a "black rain" phenomenon in the rainforest.

These facts have been documented in numerous testimonies, in more than 200,000
pages of trial evidence, and in the book Amazon Crude written by law professor
Judith Kimerling and published in 1991 just before Texaco fled the country in
1992, according to representatives of the plaintiffs. 

Experts have concluded that the Chevron discharged at least 345 million gallons
of pure crude oil directly into the rainforest ecosystem, including 17 million
from ruptured pipelines. To put this in perspective, the U.S. government has
estimated that between 18 and 39 million gallons have been spilled thus far in
BP`s disaster in the Gulf, and approximately 11 million gallons of pure crude
was spilled during the Exxon Valdez disaster. 

Just like BP in the Gulf spill, Chevron continually tries to obfuscate the facts
and cover up its responsibility in Ecuador:

* In 1972, a Chevron executive issued a memo ordering that all documents in
Ecuador documenting oil spills be destroyed. 
* Chevron claims it was "released" from further clean-up responsibility based on
a "release" signed with the Government of Ecuador. But Chevron`s "remediation"
was a fraud. Evidence presented at trial shows that the small number of pits
"remediated" are still as contaminated as sites not touched. 
* As a result of Chevron`s fraudulent "remediation," two company lawyers and ten
former Ecuadorian government officials are now under indictment in Ecuador for
lying about the clean-up results. 
* During the trial in Ecuador, lawyers for the plaintiffs have been subjected to
death threats, a Nixon-style dirty tricks campaign to remove a judge, and the
use of junk science by Chevron "experts."
* Chevron claims high cancer rates are caused not by exposure to toxins, but by
the poor personal hygiene among the local population. 
* Chevron also has tried to silence its Ecuador critics - pressuring media
outlets to deny advertising about the company`s human rights problems and even
going as far to have five people arrested at its shareholder meeting last week.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
(BAC.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N) are the lead candidates for
"senior manager" underwriting roles on the General Motors
initial public offering, according to Fox Business Network's
Charlie Gasparino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The selection has not yet been finalized but if it is, the
two banks could split most of the $300 million in underwriting
fees, according to the report which cited people with knowledge
of the deal. GM and the U.S. Treasury are running the selection
process and an announcement is expected later this week or
next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Bank of America declined to comment.
JPMorgan was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. government acquired 61 percent of GM's shares
through its $50 billion bailout of the carmaker, which emerged
from a government-sponsored bankruptcy last July.

&lt;p&gt;Former Dean of UC Davis Management School, Professor Nicole Woolsey Biggart, to
Lead Pioneering Energy Efficiency Center 
DAVIS, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The University of California, Davis today announced the appointment of Professor
Nicole Woolsey Biggart of the university`s Graduate School of Management to the
Chevron Chair in Energy Efficiency. The Chevron Chair directs the UC Davis
Energy Efficiency Center in its mission to accelerate the commercialization of
energy-efficiency technologies, teach future leaders in energy efficiency and
conduct critical policy-supporting research. 

"California is a world leader both in entrepreneurism and energy efficiency and
the UC Davis Energy Efficiency Center is at the vanguard. With her extensive
academic and administrative leadership experience, Professor Nicole Woolsey
Biggart is perfect for this key leadership role," said Steven C. Currall, dean
of the UC Davis Graduate School of Management. 

Professor Biggart joined the UC Davis Graduate School of Management in 1981, and
she was awarded the Jerome J. and Elsie Suran Chair in Technology Management in
2002. She served as dean of the management school from July 1, 2003, to June 30,
2009. As an internationally recognized expert in organizational theory and
management of innovation, her research covers economic and organizational
sociology, firm networks, industrial change and social bases of technology
adoption. She has studied and published on the barriers to implementation of
energy efficient technologies in the commercial building industry. 

"Energy is the life source for our economy and diverse sources of it are
critical to our future," Biggart said. "Reliance on cheap energy is no longer
possible; we need to use our ingenuity and thoughtful use of energy resources.
Energy efficiency is by far the most effective and least expensive `new fuel.`
The UC Davis Energy Efficiency Center is playing a lead role in its advancement
on a global scale." 

Chevron Corp. last year gave UC Davis $2 million to create the endowed chair
along with an additional $500,000 in funding to be used at the director's
discretion for the Energy Efficiency Center. That endowment complements
Chevron's ongoing support for UC Davis, which includes a $500,000 gift in 2008
to be a lead sponsor of the Energy Efficiency Center and a $25 million biofuels
research collaboration begun in 2006 to develop technology to convert nonfood
agricultural waste into next-generation transportation fuels. 

"Advancing energy efficiency, which is the cleanest and cheapest form of
alternative energy, is a commitment that both Chevron and UC Davis share," said
Jim Davis, president, Chevron Energy Solutions. "Nicole has a deep understanding
of technology adoption, and her proven ability to develop innovative business
clusters will play a critical role in the success of the UC Davis Energy
Efficiency Center." 

As the Chevron Chair in Energy Efficiency, Biggart will work to expand the
impact of the center`s research programs through interdisciplinary
collaboration, education, outreach and commercialization of technologies. She
will continue developing UC Davis` strong links to utility, regulatory, policy
and commercial interests, working together to improve energy efficiency at the
state, national and international levels. 

"The UC Davis Energy Efficiency Center is uniquely positioned, having developed
deep connections both with researchers worldwide and entrepreneurial hubs like
Silicon Valley and emerging clean-tech centers like Sacramento," Biggart said. 

In its first four years, the UC Davis Energy Efficiency Center has achieved
several milestones and major accomplishments, including:

* Pioneering a focus on collaboration with the private and public sectors in the
development of promising energy efficiency technologies. 
* Launching the Western Cooling Efficiency Center that joins the existing UC
Davis California Lighting Technology Center. 
* Developing an energy efficiency curriculum tailored to teach future thought
leaders and managers. 
* Designing the efficiency components for California's first net zero energy
community - UC Davis West Village, a dynamic, 220-acre mixed-use community
scheduled to open next year.

About the UC Davis Energy Efficiency Center

Established in 2006, the UC Davis Energy Efficiency Center is the world's first
university center of excellence in energy efficiency. Its mission is to speed
the transfer of energy-saving products and services into the homes, businesses
and lives of Californians.

&lt;p&gt;June 1 (Reuters) - Japan's Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings
Corp (4188.T) aims to increase its annual group sales to about
4.7 trillion yen by fiscal 2015, up about 40 percent from the
current fiscal year projection, the Nikkei business daily
reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mitsubishi Chemical, the country's largest chemicals firm,
intends to raise its overseas sales to account for at least 45
percent of overall sales by the year ending March 2016,
compared with 33 percent at present, the daily said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The operating profit target for fiscal 2015 is set at 400
billion yen, the Nikkei added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company plans to consider more mergers and acquisitions
in order to achieve its sales target, the newspaper said,
quoting the company's President Yoshimitsu Kobayashi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nikkei said the new five-year plan, announced Tuesday,
calls for investment in the field of highly functional
materials for such products as lithium ion batteries and LED
lighting equipments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mitsubishi Chemical plans to invest a total of 30 billion
yen through fiscal 2015 to bolster output of materials for
lithium ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It aims to secure an average global market share of 20
percent for four major lithium ion battery materials, including
electrolytes and negative electrodes, by that year, the
newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company aims to earn 350 billion yen in sales from
lithium ion battery materials, LEDs, next-generation solar
cells and its four other growth business areas in fiscal 2015,
the Nikkei said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc, seeking a consulting mandate from Calpers, assured the pension fund giant in March that it was not "the target of a formal investigation," according to a document obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was six months after U.S. securities regulators notified the powerful Wall Street bank that it was likely to be charged with fraud in connection with the underwriting and marketing of a $1 billion subprime-mortgage-linked security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 16, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil suit against Goldman over that transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's assurances to the California Public Employees' Retirement System came on the bank's March 18 application to become a real estate investment consultant to the largest U.S. public pension fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calpers spokesman Brad Pacheco told Reuters the pension fund's investment staff "will be reaching out to Goldman for an explanation on their response." The investment staff is finalizing contracts for Calpers' consultant pool, which will be effective July 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's response to Calpers could reignite the debate about whether the Wall Street firm had an obligation to inform shareholders and potential clients that the SEC had sent it a so-called Wells Notice -- a letter alerting the firm of the likelihood of a regulatory enforcement action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The securities watchdog notified Goldman last September that it was considering filing an enforcement action over the sale of the ABACUS 2007-AC1 collateralized debt obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the SEC lawsuit, a number of shareholder lawsuits have been filed against Goldman alleging that investors were damaged by the investment firm's decision not to disclose the Wells Notice months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman fell 12 percent on the day the SEC sued Goldman and have lost more than 20 percent since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pacheco said Goldman is one 32 firms the giant pension fund is considering to serve as consultants on real estate-related investments. He said Calpers has not yet made a decision about hiring Goldman or any of the other firms and that its investment staff is in the process of finalizing contracts for the consultant pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman previously has said it did not disclose the Wells Notice in regulatory filings because its lawyers concluded the issue was immaterial to the firm's overall revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts have speculated a settlement with the SEC might cost Goldman $500 million to $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's application to Calpers, obtained by Reuters, was not submitted under oath, and it is not known if the document was reviewed by Goldman's counsel's office. The application is signed by Kristin Gannon, a Goldman managing director and West Coast head of real estate investment banking for the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's comment on the Calpers application that it was not the target of a formal investigation was made in response to a question seeking information about "any business litigation or other legal proceedings relating to your consulting activities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman wrote that its investment banking division "is not known by the firm to be the target of a formal investigation for violation of any regulatory agency." It added the caveat that "from time to time" it receives "inquiries, subpoenas, and notices of investigation relating to various aspects of its business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacob Zamansky, a New York securities attorney who filed one of the shareholder suits over Goldman's failure to disclose the Wells Notice, said, "It looks like Goldman was in denial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLIENTS AS PARTNERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, in the application, also makes the point that it puts the interests of its clients first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our experience shows that if we serve our clients well, our own success will follow," the firm wrote. In response to another question, Goldman said it "treats all of our clients as partners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But critics of the bank contend the SEC lawsuit is proof that Goldman is no less self-interested than any other Wall Street firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC charges that Goldman took advantage of institutional customers by selling a CDO without disclosing that hedge fund manager John Paulson was both shorting the deal and simultaneously helping to pick the underlying portfolio of mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman officials repeatedly have said the firm did nothing wrong in marketing the Abacus deal. The firm has said it will mount a vigorous defense to the SEC charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALPERS EYES GOLDMAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calpers has a long history of holding companies that do business for it to a higher standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the SEC's charges were announced in April, Calpers officials told the Los Angeles Times that they were "disturbed" and that they planned to question Goldman executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will see what develops," Chief Investment Officer Joseph Dear told the newspaper. "Our corporate governance folks are examining Goldman Sachs in respect to their practices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month Calpers weighed in on the side of a proposal that would have forced Goldman to split the roles of chairman and chief executive. The shareholder-initiated proposal was defeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder and Matthew Goldstein; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
The Israel Conference is the nexus point for great business and is selling out
for the second year. The Israel Conference is taking place on Thursday, June 3,
2010 in Los Angeles at the Luxe Hotel on Sunset from 7:30am to 8:30pm. The
Israel Conference sets itself apart from other business conferences by having a
unique focus on Israel-facing companies that include those that are founded in
Israel, those who have R in Israel, those that do business in Israel, and
those who invest in Israeli companies. 

CEO`s and top executives from innovative companies and industry leaders will
share their insights and ignite cross-border business opportunities between
Israel and California in the areas of solar and clean technology, medical
technologies, mobile technology and applications, advertising technologies,
digital delivery technologies, and powerful consumer brands. Attendees are
senior business executives from across the US and Israel. 

The Israel Conference has amazing speakers from major and emerging companies in
hot industries such as Advertising and Mobile. Stellar speakers include Nikesh
Arora, President of Google`s Global Sales Operations and Business Development
who will speak on new modes of advertising under the banner of `Betting on
Disruption`. Arora will also moderate a panel on `Advertising Around the Globe`
which will include a discussion on new trends in advertising technology with
cutting edge companies such as Peer39 that has a unique semantic analysis
technology for online advertising, Innovid that leads in-video advertising,
Amobee that recently launched a new media system for ad-funding the entire
mobile content and communication business, WinBuyer that enables value-added
comparative shopping, and AttracTV that had developed interactive widgets. All
make for an engaging discussion. 

Powerful Consumer Brands often are overlooked because of the volume of
technology that comes out of Israel. This year, a panel is dedicated to
showcasing creative and high-end consumer products that are coming from Israel
and are sold throughout the world. Leading the discussion is Guthy-Renker EVP of
Marketing Glenn Eisen along with Shamrock`s Igal Litovsky. When you purchase
underwear in upscale stores, there is a high probability that it is manufactured
by one of the largest intimate apparel manufacturers in the world, Delta Galil,
whose CEO Isaac Dabah will provide insight into design and manufacture of
apparel based in Israel and produced world-wide. When you reach for spices,
reach into the freezer for unique packaging for freshness of garlic and herbs by
Dorot. When you pamper yourself with lotions, reach for one of the many products
coming from Yes To Inc including Yes To Carrots, Yes To Tomatoes, and Yes To
Cucumbers and Co-Founders Ido Leffler and Lance Kalish will talk about
developing this company in Israel and taking it global. 

The Israel Conference is co-chaired by Yossi Vardi, considered the Godfather of
Israeli High-Tech, and Sharona Justman, managing director of STEP Strategy
Advisors, an acquisitions advisory firm in Los Angeles. According to conference
co-founders, `This conference sells out because of the all-star line-up of key
speakers.This conference is a meeting place for high-calibre attendees to know
each other better and to meet with the speakers in an intimate setting.We have a
unique point of alignment and we are showcasing world-class companies that have
a footprint in Israel.It`s an amazing group of highly focused executives all
together for one day.", says Justman. 

Over 60 companies with a presence in Israel will present across panels, the
unique Fast &amp; Cool track, and in the Pavilion of Companies. Panels embrace
topics on Disruptive Mobile, Medical Wonders, Solar Clean Tech, Powerful Brands,
Advertising around the Globe, and Digital Delivery. The Fast &amp; Cool track
features the companies of Kryon Systems, WorldMate, TuneWiki, WinBuyer,
Pythagoras Solar, Snapily, and Wix. The Pavilion of Companies includes Marvell
Technologies, SeamBI, Tigo Energy, AMIMON, DocStoc, Kryon Systems, and Snapily. 

This year`s special speaker lineup will feature the topics of `Fun and
Creativity from Israel` by Yossi Vardi, `Empowering Business Worldwide` by
Oracle President Safra Catz, `Israel in a Flash` by SanDisk Chairman Eli Harari,
`Global Innovation - Made in Israel` by Google Head of Israel R Center Yossi
Matias, `Building Israel`s Crown Jewels` by Microsoft President of the Israeli
R Center and Corporate VP Moshe Lichtman, `Curious Questions and How to Answer
Any Topic, Anytime` by Answers.com Chairman Bob Rosenschein, and `Betting on
Disruption` by Google President Global Sales Operations Nikesh Arora. 

In addition to the many speakers, there will be incredible networking
opportunities with the many CEO level participants attending. Israeli food will
be served, courtesy of Israel`s largest food companies, Tnuva and Osem, as well
as and a young start up vending machine company for Israeli specialty snacks- U
Vend. The day will conclude with a reception featuring Teperberg Wines. This

&lt;p&gt;  JACKSONVILLE, FL, Jun 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
BinaryNow, Inc. released a new version of Kingsoft Office 2010. This
alternative office suite for Microsoft Windows is composed of three full
featured applications: a word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation
package. The latest version includes a completely redesigned core layout
engine, which makes it the smallest, fastest, and most compatible
alternative to Microsoft Office on the market today. Other improvements
include complete Microsoft Office Open XML support (.DOCX, .XLSX, .PPTX)
and native Adobe PDF support.

    Kingsoft Office 2010 Professional contains 3 applications: Kingsoft
Writer, Kingsoft Presentation, and Kingsoft Spreadsheets. All three
applications have been designed with the simple Microsoft Office 2003
toolbar layout, so many features work exactly the same way as in
Microsoft Office. Switching to Kingsoft Office requires no re-training,
since it provides the same look and feel, along with complete document
compatibility that guarantees painless document exchange between any
versions of Microsoft Office.

    Some of the new features include: better table support, increased
document security, workbook sharing, 27 new spreadsheet functions, .PPTX
format support, and much more.

    Kingsoft Office 2010 is the perfect upgrade for old MS Office users who
have been abandoned by Microsoft after they discontinued their upgrade
pricing this year. Anyone who does not want to pay full price, or learn
the new ribbon interface, but uses the latest Open XML formats, will
benefit from Kingsoft Office.

    The price for Kingsoft Office 2010 Professional is only $39.95. Volume
discounts start at 3 users and an unlimited user license is available for
larger organizations. Initially the software will be available online and
then later this year through national retail locations in the United
States.

&lt;p&gt;  STEVENSON, MD, Jun 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation announces that a class action
lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of the publicly
traded securities of Pfizer, Inc. ("Pfizer" or the "Company") (NYSE: PFE)
during the period between January 19, 2006 and January 23, 2009,
inclusive (the "Class Period").

    No class has yet been certified in the above action. Members of the Class
will be represented by the lead plaintiff and counsel chosen by the lead
plaintiff. If you wish to choose counsel to represent you and the Class,
you must apply to be appointed lead plaintiff no later than July 12, 2010
and be selected by the Court. The lead plaintiff will direct the
litigation and participate in important decisions including whether to
accept a settlement and how much of a settlement to accept for the Class
in the action. The lead plaintiff will be selected from among applicants
claiming the largest loss from investment in the Company during the Class
Period. You are not required to have sold your shares to seek damages or
to serve as a Lead Plaintiff. You may contact Brower Piven (through
hoffman@browerpiven.com or 410/415-6616) to answer any questions you may
have in that regard.

    The complaint accuses the defendants of violations of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 by virtue of the Company's failure to disclose
during the Class Period that they were engaged in an ongoing course of
conduct designed to illegally promote the sale of Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer"
or the "Company") drugs, including Bextra, Geodon, Zyvox, and Lyrica that
resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in false or fraudulent claims
to be submitted to several federal healthcare programs, thus exposing the
Company to untold legal liability. According to the complaint, after, on
January 26, 2009, Pfizer announced that it was paying $2.3 billion to
resolve several ongoing investigations concerning the improper promotion
of and kickbacks involving Bextra, Geodon, Zyvox, and Lyrica and after
the cost of resolving these investigations became public, the price of
Pfizer common stock declined significantly.

    If you have suffered a net loss for all transactions in Pfizer, Inc.
publicly traded securities during the Class Period (including shares or
possibly calls purchased during, but not sold until after the end of the
Class Period or possibly put options sold but not covered until after the
end of the Class Period), you may obtain additional information about
this lawsuit and your ability to become a lead plaintiff by contacting
Brower Piven at www.browerpiven.com, by email at hoffman@browerpiven.com,
by calling 410/415-6616, or at Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation,

Piven have combined experience litigating securities and class action
cases of over 40 years. If you choose to retain counsel, you may retain
Brower Piven without financial obligation or cost to you, or you may
retain other counsel of your choice. You need take no action at this time
to be a member of the class.

&lt;p&gt;PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Parker Waichman Alonso LLP announces that they have filed two lawsuits against
Procter &amp; Gamble on behalf of two women diagnosed with copper deficient
neuropathy attributed to their use of Fixodent&#174; denture adhesive cream. 

According to their complaints, Faye G. Hobson, 45, of Sanford North Carolina,
and Barbara Sue Mendenhall, 58, of Genevieve, Missouri, received dentures years
ago, and both used Fixodent&#174; denture cream. Their lawsuits allege that as a
result of using Fixodent&#174;, Ms. Hobson and Ms. Mendenhall now suffer from
profound and permanent neurological injuries, which has left them unable to
perform their normal, customary, and daily activities. 

The lawsuits maintain that Fixodent&#174; contains a form of zinc, which is bonded to
an unknown formulation. The complaint further alleges that Procter &amp; Gamble
failed to warn about the product's risks and failed to provide adequate warnings
about the zinc in Fixodent&#174;, or adequate instructions to prevent deviation from
accepted use. According to their lawsuit, had Procter &amp; Gamble properly
disclosed the risks associated with Fixodent&#174;, the Plaintiffs would never have
used the product. 

A small amount of zinc is necessary for a balanced diet. However, being exposed
to an excessive amount of zinc can result in copper depletion and serious
negative adverse neurological effects. In August 2008, the peer reviewed journal
"Neurology" reported on four patients suffering from neuropathy and other
neurological symptoms typical of zinc poisoning and copper depletion. It was
determined that excess use of denture cream could have been responsible for
their symptoms. 

In March of this year, Procter &amp; Gamble began to include a caution on its Web
site, http://www.dentureliving.com/, regarding the health risks posed by
excessive exposure to zinc in Fixodent&#174; denture cream. However, Fixodent&#174;
remains on store shelves, where it continues to put countless consumers at risk
for serious and debilitating neurological injuries. Parker Waichman Alonso LLP
continues to call on Procter &amp; Gamble to immediately issue a full recall of all
zinc-containing Fixodent&#174; denture cream products. Procter &amp; Gamble`s main
competitor in the market for denture adhesives, GlaxoSmithKline, recently
decided to cease marketing its zinc containing adhesives. For the sake of
millions of denture adhesive users worldwide, Procter &amp; Gamble needs to take the
same action. 

Ms. Hobson's and Ms. Mendenhall's lawsuits are the latest of many filed by
Parker Waichman Alonso LLP on behalf of the victims of zinc-containing denture
adhesive creams. 

These lawsuits, along with dozens of others filed before them, have been
consolidated for centralized and coordinated pre-trial proceedings in the
Denture Cream Products Liability Litigation in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, before the Honorable Judge
Cecilia Altonaga (MDL No. 2051). Andres F. Alonso Esq., a partner with Parker
Waichman Alonso LLP, was appointed Co- Lead Counsel to the Plaintiffs' Steering
Committee in the litigation by Judge Altonaga in an order filed on July 13,
2009. 

Parker Waichman Alonso continues to offer free consultations to the victims of
denture cream zinc poisoning. If you or a loved one uses or have used Super
PoliGrip&#174; or Fixodent&#174; and now suffer from neurological problems, please contact

&lt;p&gt;Whether it`s a Windows 7 Migration or a Compliance Issue - Industry Leaders are
Choosing Privilege Guard
NORTH ANDOVER, Mass. &amp; MANCHESTER, United Kingdom--(Business Wire)--
Avecto, the most trusted name in least privilege management for Microsoft
Windows systems, today revealed details of two key customers using Privilege
Guard to reduce management costs and improve security. Demonstrating the
benefits that Avecto provides to enterprises, these organizations are leveraging
Privilege Guard to simplify Windows desktop migrations and overcome diverse user
requirements and problem applications to improve desktop security. 

Supporting Desktop Upgrade and Future-Proofing Windows 7 Roll-out

Shop Direct Group is the UK`s leading online and home shopping retailer, with an
estimated five million customers and annual sales of around &#163;1.7 billion. Shop
Direct`s IT team embarked on a major multi-year project to migrate all of its
desktops from Windows 2000 to Windows Vista, with a medium-term plan to
transition to Windows 7. As part of this initiative, Shop Direct determined that
removing admin rights from Windows users using Privilege Guard would catapult
their business forward to achieving a more effective and efficient desktop
structure. 

The ultimate objective is to migrate to Windows 7 and knowing Privilege Guard
supports the latest Windows desktop operating system was very reassuring for
them. "The overall IT infrastructure of our business is now future-proofed,"
says Shop Direct. As a result of removing admin rights, the group is already
seeing positive changes as staff embrace the new desktop, which is expected to
help grow the business further. The IT team is also better able to solve desktop
user problems quickly and easily and the manageability of their remote users has
improved substantially. 

Addressing Diverse User Requirements and Problem Applications to Enable Least
Privilege

Oxford University Press (OUP) is the largest university press in the world. They
recognized that because of the large number of users who required elevated
permissions to perform specific tasks, user admin rights posed a real risk to
their business as it left their desktops vulnerable to malware and unauthorized
configuration changes. 

OUP was updating desktop operating systems from Windows XP to Vista and are now
transitioning to Windows 7. As part of this process, OUP realized that it could
mitigate security vulnerabilities and improve overall desktop management by
removing admin rights from all users with Privilege Guard. 

"Implementing the Privilege Guard solution was seamless and completely
transparent and has given my team a greater degree of control over our desktop
users," said Gavin Wilson, senior support analyst at OUP. "Avecto have provided
us with excellent support, not just for the product, but they have gone beyond
implementation and given us some of the best advice we have ever experienced. We
are confident we made the right decision in choosing them to help roll out our
least privilege strategy." 

OUP efficiently completed the strategic task of reducing malware threats to its
business by leveraging Privilege Guard to implement a policy of least privilege.
As a result, the organization has now streamlined desktop infrastructure support
and improved the overall end-user experience.

"Organizations across industries are recognizing the benefits of enterprise
privilege management on their Windows systems," said Tony Bolland, CEO of
Avecto. "Avecto provides these businesses with the solution they need to empower
their Windows desktop and server users to perform their job functions without
compromising the integrity and security of the systems. We are committed to
helping organizations worldwide realize the value of least privilege through the
industry`s most comprehensive solution." 

About Avecto

Avecto is a pioneer in privilege management, helping organizations to deploy
secure and compliant desktops and servers. With its innovative Privilege Guard
technology, organizations can now empower all Windows-based desktop and server
users with the privileges they require to perform their roles, without
compromising the integrity and security of their systems. 

Customers of all sizes rely on Avecto to reduce operating expenses and
strengthen security across their Windows-based environments. Our mission is to
enable our customers to lower operating costs and improve system security by
implementing least privilege. Avecto is building a worldwide channel of partners

the activities of our competitors and the emergence of new competitors;
construction factors, including delays, unexpected remediation costs, local
opposition and increased cost of labor and materials; the costs and risks
involved in the pursuit of those development opportunities; the availability and
cost of financing; the effects of local and national economic, credit, capital
market, housing, energy conditions on the economy in general and on the gaming

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
The ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs Program kicks off its 39th year today in 12
states across the country. The program is one of ExxonMobil`s signature
community programs and helps 270 nonprofits across America employ college
students for eight weeks each summer. The students receive a paid internship
introducing them to a wide variety of community service organizations and giving
them hands-on experience related to their field of study. Selected nonprofit
agencies receive much-needed support during peak summer months from students
viewed as future community leaders. 

ExxonMobil has provided $16.3 million to fund nearly 4,400 internships since the
program was founded in 1971. In 2010, ExxonMobil will contribute more than
$950,000 to fund 320 positions in Alabama, Alaska, California, Colorado, Kansas,
Louisiana, Montana, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming. The program has
extended to New Jersey this summer for the first time. 

Nonprofit organizations selected for the program span a wide range of missions,
including health, social services, education, arts and emergency assistance.
While working with these organizations, interns gain hands-on experience related
to their career paths, from social work and volunteer coordination to website
management and marketing. 

"The Community Summer Jobs Program gives us a unique opportunity to support
nonprofits while offering valuable experience to talented college students,"
said Robert Lanyon, corporate citizenship and community investments manager for
ExxonMobil. "This program benefits not only the participating students and
nonprofits, but also makes a difference in the lives of our neighbors who are
served by these agencies. We are proud to continue our partnerships with
communities across the country and look forward to seeing the positive impact
our interns make this year." 

In addition to their internships, students also participate in professional
development activities and group service projects in their respective cities.
Interns are paid for all time spent in the program. For more information about

&lt;p&gt;DHAKA, June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron (CVX.N) and
a joint venture of South Korea's G S Caltex, will start drilling
for hydrocarbons at a Bangladeshi gas field in October this
year, a senior official said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The firms had begun preparatory works for oil and gas
exploration in block seven located in southern Patuakhali
district, 320 kilometres (200 miles) from Dhaka two months ago,
Mohammad Hussain Monsur, chairman of the state-run Bangladesh
Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation, or Petrobangla, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petrobangla said drilling of the well in the block would
cost more than $20 million and the oil firms planned to drill
two more wells there if the first produced positive results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steve Wilson, president of Chevron in Bangladesh, said last
December the firm completed a seismic data acquisition program
for the block and evaluation and data processing were under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "An exploration well is planned to be completed by 2011," he
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; G S Caltex owns a 45 percent stake while Bangladesh
Petroleum Exploration and Production Company Limited, a
subsidiary of Petrobangla, holds 10 percent carried over
interest in this block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is producing more than 900 million cubic feet of gas
per day from three gas fields, almost half of the country's
daily gas output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eight foreign firms have been involved in gas exploration
and production in Bangladesh.

&lt;p&gt;  TAMPA, FL, Jun 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT), a leading U.S. producer and exporter of
premium hard coking coal for the global steel industry, announced today
that its Walter Natural Gas, LLC subsidiary has completed its acquisition
of the Alabama natural gas assets of HighMount Exploration &amp; Production
LLC, for approximately $210 million in cash. 

    "We see this as a strategic acquisition related to growing our premium
coking coal operation," said Walter Energy Interim Chief Executive
Officer Joe Leonard. "While this acquisition more than doubles our annual
coal bed methane production and is expected to be a stable generator of
earnings and cash flows into the future, it is more important to us
because it helps ensure that future coal production areas will be
properly degasified, thereby improving the safety and operational
efficiency of our existing and future underground coking coal production."

    As previously announced, the acquisition includes approximately 1,300
existing conventional gas wells, pipeline infrastructure and related
equipment located adjacent to the Company's existing underground mining
and coal bed methane business located in Tuscaloosa County, Ala. Current
proven reserves are approximately 190 bcf (billion cubic feet), with
current annual coal bed methane production of 8.5 bcf. The purchase price
equates to approximately $1.10 per mcf of proven reserves, and the
acquisition is expected to be accretive to Walter Energy's 2010 earnings.
All 47 of HighMount's Alabama active employees accepted offers to remain
with the Company following the sale. Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc.
acted as the transaction advisor to Walter Energy.

    About Walter Energy
 Walter Energy is a leading U.S. producer and
exporter of premium hard coking coal for the global steel industry and
also produces steam coal and industrial coal, metallurgical coke and coal
bed methane gas. The Company has revenues of approximately $1.0 billion

&lt;p&gt;A Continued Commitment to Operational Excellence Helps Microsoft North American
Customer Service Receive Recertification
AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
COPC Inc. (Customer Operations Performance Center Inc.) today announced that
Microsoft North American Customer Service (NACS) has successfully completed
Recertification to the COPC&#174; Vendor Management Organization Standard (COPC-2000
VMO Standard). 

The COPC-2000 VMO Standard is recognized in the customer service operations
industry as the highest level of best practices for outsourcing management.
Vendor management organizations (VMOs) are comprised of internal and/or external
teams that manage a company`s relationship with their outsourced customer
service, contact center and business process outsourcing providers.
Certification to the industry standard ensures that regardless of being
in-sourced or outsourced, corporations can ensure their customers consistently
receive high levels of service and quality combined with high levels of
operational efficiency with reduced costs. 

This Recertification has provided benefits to NACS such as receiving a rigorous
assessment of their successful business practices and processes; recertification
to a known and valued standard in the contact center industry; recognition that
their business processes continue to drive customer-focused performance
management; and sharing of benchmarks and best practices - both within NACS, as
well as compared to other high performing VMOs` processes/approaches. 

The Microsoft North American Customer Service Recertification audit took place
in concert with the Microsoft Global Outsourcing Block Recertification. Both
recertifications were achieved the week of April 6, 2010. 

"The Recertification of Microsoft North American Customer Service to the
COPC-2000 VMO Standard further demonstrates the company`s dedication to
effectively managing their Customer Service Provider relationships," said Cliff
Moore, COPC Inc. Chairman. "Once again, Microsoft has accomplished their goal of
balancing client, end-user, and CSP satisfaction with product and service
performance to receive this type of recertification." 

"Each year we continue to drive improvements with our business model. The
COPC-2000 VMO Standards provide clarity for the NACS Organization to build a
comprehensive operational platform for achieving and exceeding our internal
client and customer/partner needs," said Mark Camp, NACS General Manager. 

Since its original Certification, Microsoft North American Customer Service has
experienced significant improvements in its ability to manage VMO Processes,
including:

* Redesign of the Quality Program Management organization 
* Utilization of Six Sigma/Lean process improvement standards 
* Developed state-of-the-art business continuity planning 
* Consistently drove improvement for both customer/partner as well as vendor
satisfaction year over year

&lt;p&gt;  WOBURN, MA, Jun 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Axceler, the leader in administration software for Microsoft SharePoint,

2009 awards. The new release 4.0 supports SharePoint 2010, demonstrating
the company's continued industry leadership in SharePoint administration
and staying ahead of the needs of SharePoint administrators. The new
features in ControlPoint 4.0 were designed to improve administration of
SharePoint 2007 and bring the same advanced capabilities and more to the
SharePoint 2010 platform.

    Separately today the company also announced its acquisition of
echoTechnology, the technology leader in SharePoint migration. With the
acquisition, Axceler's software solutions now address two of the most
critical areas of SharePoint management -- administration and migration.
Both are required to assist enterprise customers as they migrate to the
new SharePoint 2010 platform. 

    "As enterprise customers get ready for SharePoint 2010, they will
increasingly turn to ControlPoint 4.0 for the powerful capabilities that
make administration of the latest SharePoint platform easier and more
efficient," said Michael Alden, President and CEO, Axceler. "Customers
favor ControlPoint's scalability, ease-of-use and support for distributed
site admins, and now with ControlPoint 4.0, we're bringing those benefits
for SharePoint administration to Microsoft's latest platform." 

    Among the new features in ControlPoint 4.0 are:


--  A single code base that works on either SharePoint 2007 or 2010
--  The ability to manage new SharePoint 2010 features that are important
    when deploying/upgrading to 2010, including:
    --  managing the Visual Upgrade options on the new SharePoint 2010
        user interface; and,
    --  reporting on configured services and databases across multiple
        SharePoint 2010 farms.
--  New capabilities that broaden and deepen the already industry-leading
    feature set for managing SharePoint permissions.

business objectives while supporting users with optimized services. 

"Customers looking to deploy Microsoft`s on-premise cloud and virtualization
solutions will find F5 solutions to be a powerful complement for the enhanced
application delivery, infrastructure visibility, and automation capabilities
they provide," said Dai Vu, Director of Virtualization Solutions Marketing at
Microsoft Corp. "F5 shares our vision for the dynamic data center, and joint
customers looking to deploy solutions in a number of distinct physical, virtual,
and hybrid computing models will see added value." 

To support Microsoft`s vision for dynamic infrastructure with flexible
deployment options and simplified management, F5 delivers:

* Increased Support for Virtualization and Cloud Architecture Models

F5 offers a solution portfolio with both physical and virtual deployment
options, providing comprehensive integration with Microsoft System Center
Virtual Machine Manager, Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V, and more. With F5`s
BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager Virtual Edition, customers can conveniently scale
their data center environments without incurring the added cost and time
associated with deploying traditional hardware. This flexibility gives customers
options for supporting Microsoft applications within a variety of data center
architecture models, including those leveraging cloud computing.

* Enhanced Efforts with Microsoft to Benefit Joint Customers

F5 has joined the Microsoft Dynamic Datacenter Alliance to further its
commitment to providing joint customers with the IT agility they need to support
their organizations and maximize the value of their technology investments.
Recently, Microsoft announced that it would open its Dynamic Datacenter Alliance
to technology partners, including the company`s compute, network, and storage
partners. F5 is the first ADN partner in this alliance and one of the "founding"

such as virtual application provisioning, reconfiguration of network traffic,
and holistic health monitoring. Tight integration between F5 BIG-IP solutions
and Microsoft products enables the F5 Management Pack for Microsoft System
Center Operations Manager and other F5 technologies to provide a unified view
across Microsoft application environments. 

For example, SharePoint-which operates as a composite of multiple application
services, including core Windows Services, IIS, and Microsoft SQL-can now
benefit from network visibility down to the component level. This provides IT
departments with deep visibility into all the complementary technologies that
SharePoint requires. Additionally, flexible F5 solutions-like the iControl&#174; API
and iRules&#174; programming language-enable administrators to customize alert
thresholds, reporting parameters, and resource provisioning. F5 is the only
vendor providing comprehensive functionality, visibility, and management
capabilities to this level of granularity. 

"Our partnership with Microsoft continues delivering value for joint customers,"
said Calvin Rowland, VP of Application Partner Programs at F5. "Through
collaborative interoperability and integration efforts, we`re enhancing
organizations` abilities to control and manage dynamic IT services. Real-time
visibility into the status of computing, network, storage, and software

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Share to grow: users want devices to fit existing ecosystem &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Seeing recovery in corporate demand for software &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Sceptical of Android due to its open-source nature &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Kelvin Soh &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    TAIPEI, June 1 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) expects to grow its share of the tablet PC market as it did in netbooks as users look for software that fits the existing ecosystem, a senior executive said on Tuesday, even as rivals such as Apple (AAPL.O) begin making inroads into the sector.  Most netbook PCs initially ran on the lower-cost, open-source Linux system when they were first introduced by Taiwan's Asustek (2357.TW) in 2007, but Microsoft eventually went on to dominate the sector with more than 90 percent of all netbooks now running on Windows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Having watched this movie play before, there's some consistency in the themes," corporate vice-president for original equipment manufacturing Steve Guggenheimer told Reuters in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "You get a lot of noise, you get a lot of energy around the alternatives, but then when people start selling these machines, and it can't quite do what the consumers want, your printer doesn't work, retailers get returns, then that's when it's hard." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Research firm Gartner says it expects some 10 million tablet PCs to be sold this year as consumers begin embracing such devices, which include Apple's iPad, Dell's DELL.O upcoming Streak and Asustek's Eee Pad, which it launched this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft also said it is now seeing signs of a pick-up in corporate demand, with 45 percent of the chief information technology officers it spoke to ready or preparing to deploy its latest Windows 7 system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We're starting to see that commercial refresh," Guggenheimer said. "There's really good energy on the commercial side, but it hasn't caught up with the level of the consumer yet." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Top PC brands that are heavily dependent on corporate demand such as Lenovo (0992.HK) and Dell DELL.O have said they are seeing signs of growing corporate demand, as companies still running on the decade-old Windows XP system upgrade their software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Guggenheimer was also sceptical of Google's (GOOG.O) chances with smartphones, as its Android system did not have a common platform that could cut across different handset brands and manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "When you write an app for Windows, it can immediately reach hundreds of millions of users," he said. "The challenge for Android is that (software developers) will need to have multiple versions for each individual phone." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Android is Google's open-source operating system for smartphones. Makers such as HTC (2498.TW) and Samsung Electronics 0059309.KS can modify the software to meet their own needs.  The Android system took fourth place from Microsoft in the smartphone operating system market during the first quarter of this year, research firm Gartner said in May, putting the company in a good position as handsets look set to surpass PCs for web browsing.

&lt;p&gt;PARIS--(Business Wire)--
Outsourcing Payroll: What`s at Stake? 

For a company to run steadily and implement ambitious HR strategies, paying
everyone accurately and on time is a basic requirement. But it`s not that
simple. A closer look at payroll reveals how complex and costly it can be.
Assessing payroll-related processes is a significant effort that companies
should make in order to decide on the most relevant strategy and keep this
critical function under control. 

"Outsourcing payroll in Europe" contains compelling arguments to aid companies
in their decision to outsource payroll - and help them obtain buy-in from
management and employees. It also provides tips to make this HR transformation a
success. In today`s business environment, payroll outsourcing is the winning
choice for HR managers and for the organization. 

As ADP is proud to be a leading provider of outsourced HR services, a broader
set of solutions than the initial payroll outsourcing, it is also aware that
this position brings certain responsibilities, the most important one being to
share their knowledge. So Anish Rajparia asked ADP experts to write "Outsourcing
payroll in Europe". Just as HR and company managers assess the day-to-day
service ADP provides, so they will assess these pages, which are intended for
them. 

"Outsourcing Payroll in Europe" aims at bringing answers to company managers who
wonder about the payroll paradox, or who do not understand why a Danish service
company does not approach outsourcing in the same way as an Italian industrial
firm. 

Last, but not least, "Outsourcing Payroll in Europe" ultimate mission is to have
readers know about the different types of solutions. With it taking less than an
hour to read the whole book, by the end of it they will have read all the "do`s
and don`ts" and be ready to discover in the closing pages the ultimate factors
involved in deciding to opt for "payroll outsourcing"... a strategic change for
HR and company managers. 

"I hope reading this will bring company managers valuable insights" said Anish
Rajparia, President, ADP ES International. 

About ADP Europe

With 60 years of unrivalled expertise, ADP is the largest outsourcer of payroll
and human resources administration services, offering solutions adapted to each
company whatever its size, sector of activity or presence, local or
international. For more information, visit the company`s website at

TAIPEI, Taiwan--(Business Wire)--
ARM, Freescale Semiconductor, IBM, Samsung, ST-Ericsson and Texas Instruments
Incorporated (TI), today announced the formation of Linaro, a not-for-profit
open source software engineering company dedicated to enhancing open source
innovation for the next wave of always-connected, always-on computing. Linaro`s
work will help developers and manufacturers provide consumers with more choice,
more responsive devices and more diverse applications on Linux-based systems. 

Linaro aligns the expertise of industry-leading electronics companies to
accelerate innovation among Linux developers on the most advanced semiconductor
SoCs (System-on-Chip). The current wave of "always-connected, always-on" devices
requires complex SoCs to achieve the performance and low power consumers demand.
Linaro was formed to increase investment in open source, address the challenges
in developing products for sophisticated consumer markets and provide the
support of a broad array of semiconductor products from multiple companies. By
providing the common foundations of tools and software for other distributions
and stacks to build upon, Linaro enables greater operational efficiency for the
electronics industry. 

Background

Traditionally, the Linux and open-source software communities focused on solving
the software problems of enterprise and computing markets with a limited choice
of processor platforms. The open source community is transitioning to create
advanced Web-centric consumer devices using high profile open source based
distributions and a wide range of high-performance, low-power ARM-based SoCs.
Linaro will make it easier and quicker to develop advanced products with these
high profile distributions by creating software commonality across semiconductor
SoCs, from multiple companies. 

Consumer Benefits

In addition to providing a focal point for open source software developers,
consumers will benefit by the formation of Linaro. Linaro`s outputs will
accelerate the abundance of new consumer products that use Linux-based
distributions such as Android, LiMo, MeeGo, Ubuntu and webOS in conjunction with
advanced semiconductor SoCs to provide the new features consumers desire at the
lowest possible power consumption. 

"The dramatic growth of open source software development can now be seen in
internet-based, always-connected mobile and consumer products," said Tom
Lantzsch, executive officer, Linaro. "Linaro will help accelerate this trend
further by increasing investment on key open source projects and providing
industry alignment with the community to deliver the best Linux-based products
for the benefit of the consumer." 

Linaro Software and Tools

Linaro will work with the growing number of Linux distributions to create
regular releases of optimized tools and foundation software that can be used
widely by the industry, increasing compatibility across semiconductors from
multiple suppliers. As a result, Linaro`s resources and open source solutions
will allow device manufacturers to speed up development time, improve
performance and reduce engineering time spent on non-differentiating, low-level
software. Linux distributions, open source and proprietary software projects
will benefit from Linaro's investment, with more stable code becoming widely
available as a common base for innovation. 

To further its mission, Linaro aims to unite the open source engineering
resources within its member firms with the broad open source community. Linaro
engineers, leveraging their extensive embedded knowledge, will contribute to a
wide range of open source projects covering areas such as tools, kernel,
graphics and boot code. Linaro intends to work in partnership with the Linux
Foundation to align on core operating principles. 

The company`s first release is planned for November 2010 and will provide
performance optimizations for SoCs based on the ARM Cortex-A processor family. 

In addition to ARM and IBM, four of the world`s leading application processor
companies, Freescale, Samsung, ST-Ericsson and Texas Instruments, will align
open source engineering efforts within Linaro. 

Linaro is a growing organization with additional partners expected to join, thus
expanding the range of expertise that is brought to the open source community.
Companies interested in joining are invited to discuss membership with Linaro
executives. For more information on the company and future access to software

&lt;p&gt; * Visa tells members to halt transactions via UnionPay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Visa to impose fines on members violating rule&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * UnionPay says Visa has no right to restrict payments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Samuel Shen and Farah Master
 (Adds background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHANGHAI, June 3 (Reuters) - Visa International (V.N) has
asked its global financial member institutions to stop
international transactions through the China UnionPay system from
Aug 1 amid intensifying competition in the sector, the official
China Securities Journal reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China UnionPay, the nation's sole bank card processor, has
been stepping up international expansion in recent years,
fuelling tensions with global credit card companies such as Visa,
MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and American Express Co (AXP.N), which are
banned from China's bank card market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No visa card transactions outside the mainland, including ATM
cash services or card payments, should go through the UnionPay
system. If they do, member institutions will be fined, the report
said, without providing further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Calls to Visa offices in the United States were unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A China UnionPay spokesperson told the newspaper Visa had no
right to restrict payment channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China UnionPay President Xu Luode told Reuters in an
interview last November that the company, set up with the help of
China's central bank, aimed to become a globally competitive
brand, riding China's rising influence, but downplayed challenges
to foreign players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seven-year-old UnionPay, benefiting from its monopoly status
in China, is already the second-biggest brand in the Asia Pacific
region in terms of transaction volume, beating 40-year-old
MasterCard and lagging only 50-year-old Visa, according to The
Nilson Report, an industry publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has talked with U.S. credit card companies
about barriers they face in China and is considering the best
steps to crack open that market, U.S. Trade Representative Ron
Kirk said on March 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Ken Wills)

Morgan Asset Mangement (UK) Ltd. Placement, Management Realignment and Exercise of</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;  CALGARY, ALBERTA, Jun 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Rio Alto Mining Limited (Rio Alto or the Company)
(TSX VENTURE: RIO)(OTCQX: RIOAF)(PINK SHEETS: RIOAF)(BVLAC: RIO)(DB
Frankfurt: MS2) is pleased to announce that it has closed a private
placement of common shares with JP Morgan Asset Management (U.K.) Ltd.
for gross proceeds of $7,752,000. At closing 10,200,000 common shares
were issued at a price of 76 cents per share. The Company will pay a cash
finder's fee of $542,640 for assistance in arranging the placement.

    The objective of J.P. Morgan Asset Management (UK) Ltd. is to provide a
portfolio primarily of shares in companies throughout the world engaged
in the production and marketing of commodities. The fund aims to provide
its investors with capital growth over the long term.

    The net proceeds of the private placement will be used by Rio Alto for
the development of the La Arena gold oxide project, commencement of a
systematic exploration program at La Arena focused on increasing the
Company's oxide and sulphide resource base, initiating a definitive
feasibility study on the future development of the La Arena
copper/gold/molybdenum sulphide project and for general corporate
purposes.

    The common shares issued pursuant to the private placement are subject to
a statutory resale restriction period of four months and a day from the
day of issue. The completion of the private placement is subject to final
approval from the TSX Venture Exchange.

    Dr. Klaus Zeitler, Chairman, also wishes to announce that the Board of
Directors has appointed Alex Black as President. Mr. Black replaces Mr.
Feisal Somji as President while Mr. Somji takes on the role of Vice
President Corporate Development, where he will be responsible for
formulating strategies for the future growth of the Company.

    The realignment of management is part of the original strategy of the
board upon the amalgamation of Mexican Silver Mines Ltd. and Rio Alto
where Mr. Somji took on the role of President to complete the corporate
merger of the two companies and work with Mr. Black and Anthony Hawkshaw
to finance the Company to achieve its goal of bringing the La Arena gold
oxide project into production by the end of 2010. As President, Mr. Black
will focus on the development of the La Arena gold oxide project into
production and evaluate the economic feasibility of the
copper/gold/molybdenum sulphide project at La Arena.

    Mr. Black who lives in Lima, Peru has 29 years experience in the mining
industry. He holds a BSc in Mining Engineering from the University of
Southern Australia and is a member of the Australian Institute of Mining
and Metallurgy. He founded Rio Alto S.A.C. in 2006 and played a key role
in the identification and acquisition of the La Arena Project.

    Mr. Somji holds a BSc from the University of British Columbia and an MBA
from Queens University. He has been successful at identifying mineral
exploration prospects, funding them and ultimately taking several
companies public. He was instrumental in the combination of Mexican
Silver Mines and Rio Alto.

    Dr. Klaus Zeitler commented, We are very excited to have attracted
J.P. Morgan Asset Management as our largest shareholder and as a
strategic investor. Its investment in Rio Alto validates our strategy of
becoming a gold producer by the end of 2010 and the future potential of
the La Arena project. This financing by JP Morgan, along with the
recently announced gold prepayment facility from a leading New York based
fund, means that Rio Alto is now fully funded to gold production and
provides funds to unlock additional value at La Arena through exploration
and initiating a definitive feasibility study on the La Arena sulphide
project. I am also very excited about our management realignment. It
streamlines management of the Company by giving Alex responsibility for
building the La Arena gold oxide project and it allows Feisal to focus on
seeking out new growth opportunities.

    Additionally, Rio Alto Mining Limited is pleased to announce that
3,498,000 warrants, of the 4,800,000 warrants which expired on May 30,
2010, have been exercised at 50 cents. The gross proceeds from these
exercises were $1,749,000. All unexercised warrants expired May 30, 2010.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, June 2 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said
operations were normal on Wednesday at its 192,500 barrel per
day (bpd) joint-venture refinery in Chalmette, Louisiana, after
a brief malfunction on Tuesday nigh in a compressor on a
gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We did experience a brief upset last evening at
Chalmette," said Exxon spokesman Kevin Allexon in an statement.

&lt;p&gt; * Disney says optimistic about ESPN's ability to grow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Disney shares up 3.3 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, June 2 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N)
Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger sounded a positive note on
Wednesday about the media giant's theme park business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking at the Sanford C. Bernstein conference, Iger said
park bookings had been increasing in the past few weeks in a
continuation of an upbeat trend Disney first noted in early
May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a conference call on May 11, Disney said hotel
reservations for the third quarter that began April 4 were
running 10 percent behind a year earlier. The company noted,
though, that it had issued a similar outlook for the second
quarter, but bookings came in just 6 percent lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also said that in fiscal 2011 it was no longer
widely going to offer deep discounts as it had over the last 18
months and that in the very recent period prior to that call,
bookings had increased nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger at the time said it was perhaps a sign that people
were planning to vacation more this summer than they did last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, Iger said he remained very optimistic about
ESPN's ability to continue growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Disney were up 3.3 percent at $34.42 in afternoon
New York Stock Exchange trading.

&lt;p&gt;  MIAMI, FL, Jun 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
UB.com is gearing up to host the June 'Second Sundays' online fundraiser,
to benefit the National Tay-Sachs &amp; Allied Diseases Association
("NTSAD"). The $10 buy-in Second Sundays event is scheduled on Sunday,
June 13th at the new time of 14:45 ET, and will be hosted by Team UB's
Joe Sebok, an active supporter of this month's chosen charity. UB will
match the total funds raised by players with all proceeds donated to
NTSAD, plus all participants are automatically in the running for prizes
just for entering, while raising needed funds and awareness for this
important cause.

    "There is nothing more amazing than being able to give back and help
support causes that work to defeat a disease like Tay-Sachs," said Team
UB's Joe Sebok. "Anything done to benefit those stricken with it and
their families I consider a privilege."

    The June 13th Second Sundays charity poker tournament payouts include
entry to the UB's $200+15 buy-in $200,000 Guaranteed tournament to the
top ten finishers. The winner also receives a UB gear swag bag valued at
$100. Register now for this month's Second Sunday event by logging onto
UB.com (or AbsolutePoker.com) and look for the tournament name "Second
Sundays Charity" in the tournament lobby in the "EVENTS" tab.

    Direct donations are also now available online at UB via Player-to-Player
transfer to the account "CHARITIES" (first name is "Charity" -- a
required field for all P2P transfers). The P2P transfer option is a
perfect option for players who can't commit the time at the table to play
in the Second Sunday tournament, but who still want to show that they
care.

    The mission of the NTSAD is to lead the fight to treat and cure
Tay-Sachs, Canavan and related genetic diseases and to support affected
families and individuals in leading fuller lives. Today, thanks to the
tireless work of the NTSAD, more than two million have been tested for
Tay-Sachs disease, thousands of Tay-Sachs carriers have been identified,
and hundreds of healthy children have been born to high-risk couples.

    UB's Second Sunday fundraiser tournaments will be hosted online across
the CEREUS Network on the second Sunday of every month, and players at
Absolute Poker are also invited to participate and support these events,
with each one benefiting a different worthwhile national charity.

&lt;p&gt;Existing support for SharePoint 2007 will be extended to include SharePoint 2010
LANSDALE, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
ProtonMedia today announced its ProtoSphere virtual collaboration environment
for the high-performance workplace will support the new Microsoft SharePoint
2010. ProtonMedia first introduced support for SharePoint 2007 in September
2009, becoming the first and only 3-D virtual collaboration environment to
integrate with SharePoint. By adding ProtonMedia`s SharePoint Media Carousel to
their ProtoSphere environment, companies extend their SharePoint investment and
processes while they improve product life cycle management (PLM) and speed
collaborative decision-making in ProtoSphere. 

"SharePoint is crucial to life sciences as one of the most widely used content
and process management platforms in that industry today," says Ron Burns, CEO of
ProtonMedia. "And therefore it`s crucial to ProtoSphere users, who need to work
with SharePoint`s resources within their virtual collaboration environment. In
addition to ensuring that SharePoint 2010 users can seamlessly work with their
SharePoint data in ProtoSphere, we`re adding some exciting new functionality to
ProtoSphere to take advantage of the latest capabilities Microsoft has released
in SharePoint 2010." 

SharePoint 2010 support will be introduced in a future release of ProtoSphere.
Customers who license SharePoint today and are covered under the ProtonMedia
maintenance agreement will receive SharePoint 2010 when available. 

ProtoSphere`s SharePoint Media Carousel makes it easy for users to share and use
any media stored in or managed by SharePoint. They can securely bring live
content from their company`s SharePoint infrastructure into ProtoSphere`s
virtual environment. Once there, the virtual teams can edit, modify, change, and
write the content back to their SharePoint infrastructure. This includes content
and metadata subject to workflow, process, and compliance rules defined in and
enforced by SharePoint. 

ABOUT PROTONMEDIA

ProtonMedia is the developer of ProtoSphere, the market-leading virtual
collaboration environment for the high-performance workplace, and the #1 virtual
environment for collaborative PLM in life sciences. ProtoSphere`s virtual
environment provides an arsenal of business-focused collaboration and

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, June 2 (Reuters) - Chevron (CVX.N) said on
Wednesday it was stopping operations at one deepwater well in
the Gulf of Mexico to comply with a six-month U.S. moratorium
on deepwater exploratory drilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company said it had already stopped drilling operations
at another deepwater location prior to the extension of the ban
on drilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The six-month drilling ban may have a significant impact
on our drilling program," a Chevron spokeswoman said.

&lt;p&gt;On the heels of a report that Google will phase out Windows in its workplace over security concerns, Microsoft on Tuesday stood up for its operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft 's counterattack was a turnaround from earlier in the day, when the company declined to comment on a story published Monday by the Financial Times . The newspaper cited several unnamed Google employees who said the company is dumping Windows because of worries about security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has reason to fret about security. In January, Google announced that Chinese hackers had broken into its network and stolen confidential information, an incident that led the company to move its Chinese search operation to Hong Kong and out of reach of Chinese government censors. Security researchers later said hackers had targeted Google and other companies with an exploit of a then-unpatched vulnerability in Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than Windows, Google is offering workers the choice between Macs running Apple 's Mac OS X and PCs running Linux , the Financial Times said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When it comes to security, even hackers admit we're doing a better job making our products more secure than anyone else," said Microsoft spokesman Brandon LeBlanc in a post Tuesday afternoon to the company's Windows blog .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And it's not just the hackers; third party influentials and industry leaders like Cisco tell us regularly that our [security] focus and investment continues to surpass others." LeBlanc added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LeBlanc also ticked off half a dozen examples of Microsoft's efforts to make Windows more secure, ranging from "we ship our software and security updates to our customers as soon as possible" to " Windows 7 uses Address Space Layout Randomization [ASLR] as well by randomizing data in memory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security researchers, however, have questioned Microsoft's speed in patching flaws and shown how to bypass Windows' ASLR, most notably in March at the Pwn2Own hacking contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One industry analyst said Microsoft's response was just business as usual for the software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They'll customarily react in blogs to what they consider outrageous claims by competitors," said Rob Helm, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft. "They've done that with individual product blogs for years. The only difference is that Microsoft now has a corporate blog and an organization to support that, which gives them a new venue to make company-level reactions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helm, who covers Microsoft's internal organization, credited Frank Shaw, Microsoft's vice president of corporate communications, with pushing blogs as a response channel. Before joining the company last year, Shaw headed the Microsoft account at Waggener Edstrom, Microsoft's long-time public relations firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw got in his shots at Google earlier Tuesday on Twitter . After calling the Financial Times story "bad reporting" in one tweet, he followed with several others, including, "news flash: Google boards up all windows in its global HQ, citing security concerns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A security expert joined others who questioned the security rationale for abandoning Windows. "If Google is moving away from Windows, then security probably isn't the driving factor," said Andrew Storms, the director of security operations at nCircle Security. "More likely this is the public face Google wants to paint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's employees already use the company's own cloud-based software, including Google Docs, said Storms, and will likely run Chrome OS when it launches later this year. That means Google won't need Windows at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If your entire company is moving to the cloud and the desktop OS doesn't matter, then why pay [Microsoft] for the licensing?" Storms said. "While you are at it, why bother with IT support systems to manage updates, backups, virus protection?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Storms, the move smells more like cost-cutting than security. "[But it's] been cleverly spun into a PR effort to strike at Microsoft," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Google compete on multiple fronts, including search, where Google has a huge lead; business productivity, which Microsoft's Office dominates; browsers ; and mobile operating systems. When Chrome OS launches, they'll be direct rivals in desktop OSes as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, some of those battles have been waged in public with dueling blog posts. Last month, for instance, Google and Microsoft traded blog punches over Microsoft's Office suite, with Google claiming that Docs was a cheaper alternative to upgrading to Office 2010; Microsoft countered that Docs can't cut it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's obvious here that Google is making every effort and taking every opportunity to take shots at Microsoft," Storms said. "But based on Microsoft's mild response, it appears they aren't feeling terribly hurt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After LeBlanc defended Windows, Microsoft again declined to comment or to provide someone from its security team for an interview. Earlier Tuesday, Google refused to confirm or deny the story, saying only that it was always looking for ways to improve business efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Jun 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Editors Note: 1 video and 3 photos are included with this Press Release.

    Microsoft Canada continues to help foster Vancouver's vibrant developer
community with news today that it is working with local government
experts and graduate students at the Centre for Digital Media, Great
Northern Way Campus to make government data more accessible and useful
for citizens. 

    Leveraging Vancouver City's Open Data Catalogue and help from the VanMaps
team, and with guidance from open government activist David Eaves, grad
students at Great Northern Way Campus created TaxiCity, a entertaining
game where players can navigate the city in a yellow cab. Awareness of
the application, which showcases the power of Silverlight and the Bing
Maps API, has moved beyond Vancouver to the rest of Canada. Last week in
Montreal, TaxiCity took home second prize at the FTW! Coding competition
during Make Web, Not War 2010. 

    TaxiCity is just one example of how Microsoft continues to help fuel a
vibrant application ecosystem around Open Data Catalogues across Canada.

    Impact of Microsoft's Cross Country Gov 2.0 and Open Source Initiatives:


--  Since the launch of Vancouver's Open Data Catalogue, local programmers
    have been working on applications to make the data useful for the
    citizens of Vancouver. The release of the Open Data Application
    Framework open source project and the development of such applications
    as VanGuide Vancouver Parking, MapWay and FreeFinders are the result of
    a Microsoft sponsored competition to encourage the development of open
    government apps.

--  Edmonton was the first North American city to use the Open Government
    Data Initiative (OGDI) cloud-based solution from Microsoft for its Open
    Data Catalogue. The catalogue was implemented at minimal cost to the
    City using open source components and Microsoft's newest cloud operating
    system, Windows Azure(TM). Using open standards and application
    interfaces (API), local developers and municipal IT staff can easily
    retrieve data for use in innovative online applications that can help
    improve citizen services, enhance collaboration between public and
    private organizations and increase City transparency. 

--  Microsoft's Gov 2.0 efforts also include sponsorship of GovCamp Canada a
    gathering of local citizens, public sector employees, service delivery
    leaders and policy people with an interest in having a conversation on
    engaging citizens, empowering business and increasing internal
    efficiencies through transformational government activities. 

--  Microsoft continues to contribute and drive innovation through its Open
    Source initiatives such as Microsoft's CodePlex.com, Port25 and Open
    Source Technology Center (OTC). A deep engagement with local Open Source
    and application communities is also maintained through a series of
    events including WordCamp, DemoCamp and most recently ConFoo conference.
    Microsoft's open source efforts also include Web Application Gallery,
    PHP on Windows and the FTW! Coding Competition at Make Web, Not War. 


    Supporting Quotes: 

    Gregor Robertson, Mayor, City of Vancouver 

    In Vancouver we're big supporters of Open Government initiatives.
It's a great way to foster economic growth and an opportunity to rethink
how government operates. Canadian IT companies and cities can and should
be empowering citizens to use data to improve our decision making and
everyday lives. It's exciting to see students from Great Northern Way
Campus using the city's data in new and creative ways.

    Dashan Yue, Grad Student at Great Northern Way Campus and Co-Creator of
TaxiCity 

    When the City of Vancouver released a new version of its Open Data
Catalogue it was a natural next step for us to use the street
center-lines, block outlines, building traces and park geometry available
for TaxiCity. Our program combines different Open Data sets with
Silverlight and Bing which helped to drastically lower development time
while giving us the mapping data we needed to build a visually appealing,
dynamic gaming environment.

    David Eaves, Public Policy Entrepreneur and Open Government Activist 

    It's great to see Microsoft actively fostering application
development using Open Data catalogues on a variety of application
platforms. By doing this work they help demonstrate that open data not
only helps governments meet their transparency goals but that it can help
promote citizen engagement and economic development.

    Nik Garkusha, Open Source Strategy Manager, Microsoft Canada Inc. 

    Applications like TaxiCity are great examples of the power of open
data on the Microsoft-based platform, enabled by open source to make
information available for all citizens. By helping Canadian cities
transform how they deliver services, Microsoft's continued focus is on
interoperability and helping build a vibrant open data application
ecosystem.

&#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Richard J. Meelia, pr&#233;sident du conseil d'administration et

employ&#233;s de nos deux soci&#233;t&#233;s &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Robert Palmisano, pr&#233;sident-directeur
g&#233;n&#233;ral d`ev3. &#171; Nous serons &#224; m&#234;me de promouvoir notre plate-forme extensive de
technologies neurovasculaires et vasculaires p&#233;riph&#233;riques avec une soci&#233;t&#233;

qui est de livrer des solutions m&#233;dicales pointues et innovantes destin&#233;es &#224;
am&#233;liorer les r&#233;sultats th&#233;rapeutiques des patients. Cette combinaison permettra
&#233;galement de poursuivre l`innovation en vue d`appuyer la croissance du march&#233;
endovasculaire et la p&#233;n&#233;tration de la proc&#233;dure &#224; l`&#233;chelle mondiale, tout en

revendiquant des ressources plus approfondies assurant un succ&#232;s soutenu dans
notre secteur &#187;. 

ev3 Inc. a pour mission de d&#233;velopper des technologies et des solutions
innovantes, pointues, &#233;prouv&#233;es sur le plan clinique pour le traitement des
maladies neurovasculaires et vasculaires p&#233;riph&#233;riques. ev3 propose un
portefeuille complet d'options de traitement comprenant les technologies
interventionnelles primaires utilis&#233;es aujourd'hui : ballons d`angioplastie
p&#233;riph&#233;rique, stents, syst&#232;mes d`excision de plaque, dispositifs de protection
embolique, agents emboliques liquides, spires m&#233;talliques pour embolisation,
d&#233;viation de flux, cath&#233;ters de thrombectomie et ballons d`occlusion. 

Points saillants financiers

Dans le cadre de l`accord, Covidien paiera 22,50 en num&#233;raire par action ev3
pour un total approximatif de 2,6 milliards USD, net de l`encaisse acquise.
Cette fusion avec ev3 va fournir &#224; Covidien une plate-forme de croissance
suppl&#233;mentaire et devrait &#234;tre relutive au niveau des taux de croissance du
chiffre d'affaires et des r&#233;sultats. 

La transaction, sous forme d`une offre enti&#232;rement en num&#233;raire par une filiale
&#224; part enti&#232;re de Covidien, suivie d`une fusion en deuxi&#232;me &#233;tape, est soumise
aux conditions de cl&#244;ture habituelles, dont certaines approbations
r&#233;glementaires, et devrait &#234;tre compl&#233;t&#233;e pour le 31 juillet 2010. Le conseil
d'administration des deux soci&#233;t&#233;s a approuv&#233; la transaction &#224; l`unanimit&#233;. Tous
les administrateurs et cadres de direction d`ev3 ont confirm&#233; leur intention
d`offrir les actions dont ils disposent, et certains actionnaires affili&#233;s &#224;
Warburg, Pincus Equity Partners LP, qui d&#233;tiennent environ 24 % des actions
ordinaires en circulation d`ev3, ont conclu des accords d`offre d`actions avec
Covidien. D&#232;s que la transaction sera compl&#233;t&#233;e, Covidien d&#233;clarera ev3 comme
appartenant &#224; sa gamme de Produits vasculaires dans le segment commercial des
Dispositifs m&#233;dicaux. 

En pr&#233;sumant une cl&#244;ture le 31 juillet 2010, Covidien s`attend &#224; ce que cette
transaction dilue son b&#233;n&#233;fice par action 2010 et 2011 sur une base PCGR. Sur
une base non PCGR, &#224; l`exclusion des frais de transaction, de restructuration et
d`autres frais, Covidien s`attend &#224; ce que cette transaction dilue son b&#233;n&#233;fice
par action de 5 &#224; 8 cents pour l`exercice 2010  ; la robustesse sous-jacente des
activit&#233;s existantes de Covidien devrait toutefois compenser en partie cette
dilution. Covidien s`attend &#224; ce que le b&#233;n&#233;fice par action non PCGR de
l`exercice 2011 soit dilu&#233; d`environ 10 &#224; 15 cents, essentiellement attribuable
&#224; des charges de d&#233;pr&#233;ciation/amortissement, d`int&#233;r&#234;ts et d`imp&#244;ts accrues. 

Covidien compte financer la transaction gr&#226;ce &#224; une combinaison d`encaisse,
d`effets de commerce et d`un financement provisoire pleinement engag&#233;. 

Covidien tiendra une conf&#233;rence t&#233;l&#233;phonique et une webdiffusion pour les
investisseurs aujourd'hui &#224; 8 h 00, heure de l`est, pour discuter cette annonce.
Les d&#233;tails de l`appel sont fournis &#224; la fin de ce communiqu&#233;.

Information financi&#232;re non PCGR 

Ce communiqu&#233; contient une mesure financi&#232;re non-PCGR. Cette mesure financi&#232;re
non-PCGR, qui est utilis&#233;e pour mesurer la performance de Covidien, doit &#234;tre
consid&#233;r&#233;e en suppl&#233;ment de, et non pas en remplacement de, ni sup&#233;rieure aux
mesures de la performance financi&#232;re de Covidien pr&#233;par&#233;es conform&#233;ment &#224; PCGR.
Les d&#233;finitions des mesures non PCGR de Covidien peuvent &#234;tre diff&#233;rentes de
celles des termes similaires utilis&#233;s par d`autres soci&#233;t&#233;s, et par cons&#233;quent,
il est important de comprendre comment Covidien d&#233;finit ses mesures financi&#232;res
non PCGR. 

Sp&#233;cifiquement, les charges exceptionnelles associ&#233;es aux co&#251;ts de transaction,
charges de restructuration, et charges de paiements futures sont exclues de la
dilution du b&#233;n&#233;fice par action projet&#233;. 

La direction de Covidien utilise cette mesure financi&#232;re non PCGR car elle
estime qu`elle est utile et plus significative pour quand il s`agit d`&#233;valuer la
dilution du b&#233;n&#233;fice par action projet&#233;, &#224; l'exclusion des d&#233;penses li&#233;es &#224; la
transaction. Cette mesure financi&#232;re non PCGR est &#233;galement utilis&#233;e par la
direction de Covidien pour prendre des d&#233;cisions financi&#232;res et d`exploitation
car elle estime qu`elle refl&#232;te l`&#233;conomie sous-jacente des activit&#233;s continues
de Covidien de mani&#232;re &#224; permettre des comparaisons significatives entre
diff&#233;rentes p&#233;riodes. Ces comparaisons peuvent &#234;tre plus significatives car les
r&#233;sultats d'exploitation pr&#233;sent&#233;s conform&#233;ment &#224; PCGR peuvent inclure, de temps
&#224; autre, des postes qui ne sont pas n&#233;cessairement pertinents pour comprendre
les activit&#233;s de Covidien et peuvent, dans certains cas, &#234;tre difficiles &#224;
pr&#233;voir avec pr&#233;cision et exactitude pour des p&#233;riodes futures. La direction de
Covidien estime que cette mesure financi&#232;re non PCGR fournit des informations
utiles permettant aux investisseurs et &#224; d`autres personnes de comprendre et
d`&#233;valuer, s`ils le veulent, la performance d'exploitation actuelle de Covidien
et ses perspectives futures, comme c`est le cas pour la direction. Les mesures
financi&#232;res non PCGR pr&#233;sentent toutefois des limitations car elles n`incluent
pas tous les postes de revenus et de d&#233;penses qui affectent les op&#233;rations de
Covidien. La direction de Covidien pallie &#224; cette limitation ainsi que d`autres
en consid&#233;rant &#233;galement les r&#233;sultats financiers de Covidien tels que
d&#233;termin&#233;s conform&#233;ment &#224; PCGR.

&lt;p&gt;Clients Broaden Use of Commercial Card Payments to Improve Working Capital,
Increase Rebates and Pay Suppliers Sooner
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan today issued a new report that highlights how businesses are using
payments technology to improve working capital, increase visibility into cash
management, and generate higher rebates on accounts payable (A/P) spending. The
report "Payment`s New Land of Opportunity" features real-life success stories
from J.P. Morgan clients that have implemented Single-Use Accounts and extended
the use of their purchasing card programs to hold on to cash longer, pay
suppliers sooner, increase rebates and reduce A/P manpower costs. 

"Corporate treasury departments are under great pressure to manage costs,
control spending and increase working capital," said Eduardo Vergara, Global
Commercial Card Executive, J.P. Morgan Treasury Services. "Card programs are
becoming the payment tool of choice as organizations increasingly migrate
higher-value, paper-based transactions to electronic payment with complete
confidence." 

Until recently, the prime focus for treasury departments has been at two ends of
the payment spectrum. Credit cards have traditionally been used for travel and
entertainment and some low-dollar expenses, while ACH has been reserved for the
high-ticket, direct suppliers. Check processing, renowned for its high cost and
no revenue benefit, has filled in all the gaps. Now, companies see a new land of
opportunity: the fertile "middle ground" of payment, encompassing a wide field
of transactions that have, until this point, been handled by paper. 

According to the report, the answer for many companies is to target the large,
untapped middle ground. This is the spend landscape that falls somewhere in
between low- and high-ticket transactions, with suppliers that invoice regularly
but may not be high-volume vendors. To address this opportunity, companies are
using two payment solutions, working in tandem: Purchasing Card and Single-Use
Accounts. 

Highlights from the report include:

* Companies are looking beyond traditional spend categories and targeting
non-traditional suppliers for purchasing card payments. Some companies are
capturing higher rebates and paying vendors more quickly by using purchasing
cards to pay for temporary employment services, utilities, employee drug
screening, on-premise security services, legal service providers, advertising
and modeling agencies. 
* Companies using Single-Use Accounts report results such as more efficient A/P
processing, improved fraud protection, increased working capital and larger
financial rebates. 
* Single-Use Account rebates can be significant. Some companies are earning 100
bps on their larger, indirect purchases. 
* Participating suppliers can be paid 15 to 20 days earlier through Single-Use
Accounts, improving the company`s Days Payable Outstanding.

&lt;p&gt;Provides Business Users with a Secure, Compliant Way to Share Large Files Across
the Microsoft Business Productivity Infrastructure
PALO ALTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Accellion, Inc. today announced the industry`s first secure file transfer
solution for the Microsoft Business Productivity Infrastructure (BPI) and
Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS) allowing Microsoft SharePoint, OCS and
Outlook users to easily and securely share digital information. Today`s
announcement extends the Accellion solution to include new plug-ins for
Microsoft Outlook 2010, Microsoft SharePoint 2010, and Microsoft Office
Communications Server 2007 R2 (OCS) for both on-premise and cloud environments. 

Accellion plug-ins for Microsoft Outlook, SharePoint and OCS enable business
users to securely send files to coworkers, remote users, customers or partners
from within the Microsoft business applications. "Quick and easy access to
information is essential for business collaboration, but protection of
intellectual property and meeting compliance requirements is crucial," said
Yorgen Edholm, president and CEO of Accellion. "By integrating the Accellion
Secure File Transfer solution across Microsoft`s BPI, enterprise organizations
can now protect their intellectual property and achieve compliance by providing
users with an easily accessible way to move confidential digital information." 

According to Gartner Senior Research Analyst, Thomas Skybakmoen, "integration of
secure file transfer capabilities with desktop applications makes file transfer
more accessible to business users, enabling enterprises to increase data
security and prevent costly data breaches. Expanded availability and
accessibility of secure file transfer is fueling the growth of the managed file
transfer market." 

Accellion enhances the communications and collaboration experience provided
within Microsoft SharePoint, OCS and Outlook experience by seamlessly adding
secure file transfer capability to the native file transfer capability provided
within these products. Anyone who knows how to use an e-mail paperclip within
Microsoft Outlook, or a pull-down menu within SharePoint and OCS can now access
Accellion Secure File Transfer, thereby enhancing enterprise data security and
compliance. 

The Accellion Secure File Transfer solution allows enterprises and government
agencies to securely send and receive files and folders up to 20GB. Encryption
and business-level authentication validates recipients so confidential
information is not overexposed. Accellion Secure File Transfer also provides an
audit trail with the tracking and reporting necessary to demonstrate compliance.
The Accellion Secure File Transfer solution integrates both on-premise and
off-premise deployment options for cloud and virtual environments, which work
together seamlessly. 

Accellion will be demonstrating secure file transfer plug-ins for Microsoft
SharePoint, Microsoft Office Communications Server and Microsoft Outlook at

&lt;p&gt;spikeInsight Eases the Complexity of Verifying, Fixing and Maintaining Windows
Applications 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
SpikeSource, creator of spikeInsight, the recently launched application
monitoring and remediation service, today announced its support for the new
Microsoft Platform Ready (MPR) site by offering a free 90 day trial of
spikeInsight to members of Microsoft`s Platform Ready service. 

"We are pleased to support Microsoft in their efforts to make software
application development easier, faster, safer, and less expensive," said Shawn
K. O`Neill, SpikeSource CEO. "The developer community is constantly faced with
finding solutions for new complexity challenges. Supporting MPR and its
developer community to help resolve these issues underscores our ongoing
commitment to working within the ecosystem of independent developers, ISVs and
platform vendors to deliver cost effective, world-class products and services." 

In support of Microsoft`s new partner site, SpikeSource is offering a 90-day
free trial of spikeInsight for Microsoft partners. This opportunity gives
partners the ability to improve their application integrity and provides an
easier path to building, fixing and maintaining applications. This offer can be
found in the Exclusive Offers section of their new Microsoft Platform Ready
site, www.microsoftplatformready.com, along with additional resources to help
developers and ISVs. 

"The new Microsoft Platform Ready site is indicative of our continued efforts to
support our developer community and help them create a new breed of innovative
software applications," said Karl Noakes, General Manager of Partner Marketing
at Microsoft. "We are pleased that SpikeSource has chosen to support Windows
developers with its spikeInsight service and welcome their offer to provide a 90
day free trial to Microsoft partners. 

About the spikeInsight service

SpikeInsight helps improve application integrity and provides an easier path to
building, fixing and maintaining applications. SpikeInsight allows users to
perform a software risk assessment, quickly and easily discover what`s in their
applications, and learn how to fix deficiencies and vulnerabilities. This
reduces testing and compliance costs, accelerates time to market, and supports
the migration of applications to new platforms and component upgrades. 

The spikeInsight service provides:

* Application Fingerprint: Conducts a comprehensive scan of the binary code to
map its dependencies and all platform, ISV and third party components, including
APIs. 
* Remediation Recommendations: Performs security testing on the application
fingerprint and provides a comprehensive report identifying known
vulnerabilities and version updates for components, with recommendations for
remediation. 
* Ongoing Monitoring: Provides ongoing alerts to newly discovered
vulnerabilities through daily scans of the application fingerprint against the
National Vulnerability Database, which includes over 42,000 vulnerabilities and
averages 15 new threats daily. These alerts include links to new patches, fixes
and upgrades.

Even seasoned developers and ISVs who use spikeInsight are surprised to discover
hidden components and unknown dependencies within their applications. Risky,
outdated and unlicensed components can cause applications to fail and release
dates to slip. SpikeInsight`s ongoing vulnerability and update checks protect
applications and their customers from problems throughout the application
lifecycle. 

SpikeInsight is available for an annual subscription fee of $299 per
application.

&lt;p&gt;The Kentucky Department of Education is replacing its e-mail servers with a free cloud-based offering from Microsoft, one that will supply 700,000 students, faculty and staff with e-mail and other information-sharing tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By going with a free, cloud-based offering, the state expects to save US$6.3 million in IT-related costs over the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each user of Microsoft's Live@edu will get a 10GB e-mail inbox, along with 25 gigabytes of additional file storage. The service will also include document sharing, instant messaging, video chat and mobile e-mail capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the state had deployed about 180 distributed Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 on-premise servers to handle educational e-mail duties. The migration for the first 500,000 users took about a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Historically, it would have required months and potentially years to migrate hundreds of thousands of people to a new solution," said Chuck Austin, who works in the state education department's Office of Education Technology, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 10,000 schools across 130 countries use the Live@edu service, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, June 3 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is
delaying plans to drill a development well in a long-producing
oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico in response to a U.S. moratorium
on deepwater drilling, a spokeswoman said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company planned to start the well last month in the
Hoover Diana field about 200 miles (321 km) south of Houston, a
field discovered in the late 1990s and producing since 2000. It
is in water about 4,800 feet (1,463 meters) deep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The moves comes after the U.S. government halted issuance
of drilling permits and then on May 27 imposed a six-month
moratorium on deepwater drilling after the April 20 well
explosion that killed 11 workers and spawned a big oil spill.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) as the Bull of the Day
and CONMED (Nasdaq: CNMD) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity
Research provides analysis on Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT), General Motors
Corporation (OTC: MTLQQ) and General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) continues to make progress in delivering cost synergies
from the Rohm &amp; Haas (ROH) acquisition, which is expected to consolidate the
higher margin and higher growth specialty businesses while reducing volatility
in earnings and cash flow. 

Dow is executing planned divestitures and has fully paid off its burdensome
bridge loan related to the ROH acquisition. Dow completed the year ahead of its
cost reduction and synergy goals with an end-of-year run-rate of more than $1.7
billion. 

The company recently provided an update on its Advanced Material division, where
it expects revenue growth of 10% per annum that would drive profitability.
Therefore, we upgrade Dow to Outperform from our previous Neutral
recommendation. 

Bear of the Day: 

CONMED (Nasdaq: CNMD) competes in the orthopedic surgery markets against much
larger, technically-competent companies that possess substantially more assets.
However, a large percentage of CONMED's products are designed for minimally
invasive surgery, a trend that is extremely popular these days. 

The company depends heavily on acquisitions, which may be difficult to fund
during the current weak economic environment. Furthermore, the company needs to
obtain operational synergies out of these acquisitions so that they don't become
a waste of resources. 

We lowered our revenue and earnings per share estimate for both fiscal 2010 and
2011 based on the susceptibility of Conmed to economic turbulence. We therefore
downgrade the stock to Underperform with a target price of $18.

Caterpillar Buys Electro-Motive

In a bid to expand its rail business from service into engine manufacturing,
Caterpillar Inc.`s (NYSE: CAT) wholly owned subsidiary Progress Rail Services
entered into an agreement to purchase Electro-Motive Diesel for $820 million in
cash from Berkshire Partners LLC and Greenbriar Equity Group LLC. Caterpillar
expects to close the deal by the end of 2010, subject to final regulatory
approvals. 

The acquisition of Electro-Motive Diesel will enable Caterpillar to provide rail
and transit customers an industry-leading range of locomotive, engine and
emissions solutions, as well as unmatched aftermarket product and parts support
and a full line of rail-related services and solutions. 

Headquartered in LaGrange, Illinois, Electro-Motive Diesel designs, manufactures
and sells diesel-electric locomotives for all commercial railroad applications
and has sold its products in more than 70 countries worldwide. 

In addition to its manufacturing activities, Electro-Motive Diesel has an
extensive aftermarket business, offering customers replacement parts,
maintenance solutions and a range of value-added services. The company is also a
global provider of diesel engines for marine propulsion, offshore and land-based
oil well drilling rigs and stationary power generation. The company generated
2009 revenues of $1.8 billion. 

Electro-Motive Diesel was spun off from General Motors Corporation (OTC: MTLQQ)
in 2005 and was purchased by Berkshire Partners LLC and Greenbriar Equity Group
LLC. Pursuant to the closure of this deal, Electro-Motive Diesel will now be a
wholly owned subsidiary of Progress Rail Services. With the addition of
Electro-Motive Diesel, Caterpillar will now compete directly with General
Electric Co. (NYSE: GE), another major U.S. maker of locomotives.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

CONSOL Takes Over CNX Gas

CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE: CNX) concluded the acquisition of CNX Gas Corporation
(NYSE: CXG). CNX Gas is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of CONSOL. This
acquisition is part of CONSOL`s previously announced plans of expanding its
natural gas business. 

CONSOL Energy will pay the shareholders of CNX Gas $38.25 in cash for each share
they own. CNX Gas' common stock will no longer be traded on the New York Stock
Exchange. 

CONSOL Energy had commenced the tender offer to purchase all the outstanding
shares of the common stock of CNX Gas for $38.25 each in cash on April 28, 2010.
On May 27, 2010, CONSOL completed the offer acquiring 95% (about 24 million) of
CNX Gas shares that it did not own previously for roughly $918 million ($38.25
per share). 

Earnings Scorecard: Hewlett-Packard

On May 18, 2010, Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ) reported second quarter
2010 results, with EPS of $1.09, exceeding the Zacks Consensus estimate of $1.05
and the year-ago EPS of $0.86. 

Revenue for the second quarter came in at $30.8 billion, an increase of 13.0%
from $27.4 billion reported in the year-ago period, which included a favorable
foreign currency impact of four percentage points. 

Revenue increased across all businesses segments on a year-over-year basis,
attributable to increases in product demand, better market penetration and a
revival in IT spending. Per geographic region, the Americas reported an 11.0%
increase in revenue to $13.5 billion. Revenue increased 11.0% in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa (EMEA) to $11.8 billion and 19.0% in the Asia-Pacific
region to $5.5 billion. 

International markets accounted for 66.0% of total revenue in the second
quarter, with revenue in the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China)
increasing 25.0% on a year-over-year basis and comprising 10.0% of total HP
revenue. 

The company has projected a decent estimate for the third quarter of fiscal
2010, and expects revenues to be in the range of $29.7 billion to $30.0 billion,
a GAAP EPS of $0.87 to $0.89 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.05 to $1.07. For fiscal
2010, the company expects revenue growth in the range of 8.0% to 9.0%. The GAAP
EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.76 to $3.81, and non-GAAP EPS in the
range of $4.45 to $4.50 (up from the previous estimate of $4.37 to $4.44). 

The company has a strong business model, and still rules the computing world,
with the largest market share at 19.7%. This apart, the company has completed
the acquisition of networking major 3Com. HP will now be able to challenge
networking leader Cisco Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO), and gain market share in
the networking business. This apart, the company is expected to benefit
substantially from the increase in IT spending. 

We also note that market research firm Gartner raised its 2010 PC shipment
forecast, and now expects global PC shipments to rise 22.0% this year, up from
its March forecast of 20.0%, attributable to strong consumer demand and
companies replacing aging computers. The research firm expects the Worldwide PC
shipments at 376.6 million units in 2010, compared with 366.1 million units
forecasted in the March quarter and 308.3 million units last year. Global PC
spending is forecasted to increase 12.0% to $245.4 billion in 2010. HP is
expected to grab a major share of the increase in PC shipment. 

HP has also grabbed the top slot in the Server market, generating $3.4 billion
in server revenue during the first three months of the current year, up 16.0%
compared to the year-ago period. This has pushed International Business Machines
(NYSE: IBM) to the second position, which saw sales dipping 2.1% to $3.05
billion. 

We believe that being the largest player in the computing industry, HP will
experience significant improvement in business volume. We completely believe in
the growth story of the company, but would like to see better performance from
its printing unit in the upcoming quarter.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Air Products-Airgas Saga Continues

Air Products &amp; Chemicals Inc. (NYSE: APD) has extended the expiration date of
its tender offer for Airgas Inc. (NYSE: ARG) for the second time, to August 13,
2010 from June 4, 2010. On April 1, 2010, Air Products had extended the
expiration date for the first time from April 9, 2010 to June 4, 2010. 

All other terms and conditions of the offer remain unchanged. Airgas is the
largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases, and "hard
goods" such as welding equipment and supplies. 

In October last year, Air Products had made a hostile bid for rival Airgas for
an all-stock deal at $60.00 per share. Upon Airgas` rejection, Air Products
revised the tender offer to a "cash and stock" proposal with an implied value of
$62 per share. 

On rejection again by Airgas, Air Products upgraded its proposal for a second
time to an all-cash deal of $60 per share of Airgas representing a premium of
38% from the closing price on February 4, 2010 and an 18% cash premium over the
52-week high. The total value of the transaction was approximately $7 billion,
including $5.1 billion of equity and $1.9 billion of assumed debt. Airgas still
believes that the proposal significantly undervalues the company. 

Pennsylvania-based Air Products, however, argues that its proposal would prove
beneficial to Airgas, which has a negative end-market outlook and an unfavorable
earnings guidance. Airgas has no immediate strategic plan to enhance
shareholders` wealth. 

Sara Lee Divests from Indian JV

Sara Lee Corp. (NYSE: SLE) recently indicated that it has completed the sale of
its 51% stake in Godrej Sara Lee Joint Venture to Godrej Consumer Products Ltd.
in consideration for $230 million, putting an end to the 15-year old
partnership. Godrej Sara Lee will now be known as Godrej Household Products. 

Godrej Sara Lee has been the market leader in household insecticides such as
Good Knight mosquito repellent and Hit. In fiscal 2009, the Joint Venture
generated approximately $158 million in sales. 

Sara Lee is also selling its global body care and European detergents businesses
to Unilever (NYSE: UL) and its air care business to Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG).
The Unilever deal is expected to end by calendar-year 2010 and the Procter &amp;
Gamble deal is expected to close shortly after the end of the fiscal year in
July. 

The disposal of Sara Lee`s body care, European detergents, air care and Indian
insecticides business leaves only the shoe care, non-European cleaning brands,
and non-Indian insecticides businesses to be sold in its divestiture plan for
the entire International Household and Body Care business segment. 

All these divestitures will aid Sara Lee to streamline its focus more on the
food and beverage business. Furthermore, the company intends to enhance
shareholder return by using the proceeds to repurchase shares. 

The spate of divestitures in the non-core assets would also augment the
company`s growth via the strategic investment of these proceeds including
accretive acquisitions.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings affirms the 'AAAmmf' rating assigned to the Goldman Sachs Prime
Obligations Fund, a money market fund managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management,
L.P. (GSAM). The affirmation follows Fitch's annual on-site review of the fund
and its investment advisor and is based on the credit quality, diversification,
and liquidity of the fund's portfolio assets and the capabilities of GSAM as
investment advisor. As of May 16, 2010, the portfolio had approximately $24.2
billion in total assets under management. 

The Goldman Sachs Prime Obligations Fund seeks to maximize current income, to
the extent consistent with the preservation of capital and maintenance of
liquidity, by investing in high credit quality money market instruments. The
fund pursues its investment objective by investing in U.S. government
securities, obligations of U.S. banks, commercial paper, including asset-backed
commercial paper (ABCP), and other short-term obligations of U.S. companies,
states, municipalities and other entities and repurchase agreements. Per its
prospectus, the fund does not incur any direct exposure to foreign entities,
although such exposures may be incurred indirectly, for example, through
investments in ABCP conduits sponsored by foreign financial institutions. 

Consistent with Fitch's 'AAAmmf' rating criteria, the fund maintains a high
credit quality by investing exclusively in securities rated at least 'A/F1' by
Fitch or being of a comparable credit quality by other global rating agencies.
As of the date of the annual review, the fund's Portfolio Credit Factor (PCF),
which is a risk weighted measure of the fund's portfolio assets accounting for
the credit quality and maturity profile of the portfolio securities, met Fitch's
'AAAmmf' rating criterion of 1.50 or less. The fund limits its interest rate
exposure and spread risk by limiting its weighted average maturity to reset date
(WAMr) and weighted average final maturity (WAMf) to 60 days and 120 days,
respectively, consistent with Fitch's 'AAAmmf' rating criteria. 

The fund's additional investment restrictions are aimed at maintaining
sufficient levels of daily and weekly liquidity to meet investors' redemption
requests. Specifically, in line with amended Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, which governs investment activities and operations of U.S.
money market funds, the fund must invest at least 10% of its total assets in
securities maturing overnight of other qualified assets such as U.S. Treasuries
and at least 30% of its total assets in securities maturing within seven days or
other qualified assets. As of the date of the annual review, the fund fully met
the liquidity requirements mandated by Rule 2a-7 as well as the liquidity
guidelines outlined in Fitch's rating criteria report for money market funds. 

GSAM is an affiliate of the Goldman Sachs Group (rated 'A+/F1+' by Fitch). The
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a leading global bank, providing capital markets,
financial advisory, asset management and securities services. Fitch views
Goldman Sachs Group and GSAM's investment advisory capabilities, financial and
resource commitments, operational controls, corporate governance, and compliance
procedures as consistent with 'AAAmmf' rating assigned to the fund. Additional
information on Fitch's views of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is available at
'www.fitchratings.com'. 

Applicable criteria available at 'www.fitchratings.com': 

--'Global Money Market Fund Rating Criteria' (Oct. 5, 2009).

&lt;p&gt;  SAN DIEGO, CA, Jun 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
NuVasive, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUVA), a medical device company focused on
developing products for minimally disruptive surgical treatments for the
spine, announced today that Michael J. Lambert, Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer, and Patrick F. Williams, Vice President of
Finance and Investor Relations, are scheduled to present at the Goldman
Sachs 31st Annual Healthcare Conference at The Hyatt Regency Century
Plaza in Los Angeles, CA, on Tuesday, June 15, 2010, at 9:45 a.m. PT. 

    Mr. Lambert and Mr. Williams are also scheduled to present at the 30th
Annual William Blair Growth Stock Conference at The Four Seasons Hotel in
Chicago, IL, on Wednesday, June 16, 2010, at 2:40 p.m. CDT. 

    A live webcast of both presentations will be available online from the
investor relations page of the Company's corporate website at
www.nuvasive.com. After the live webcast, the presentations will remain
available on the website for 30 days.

    About NuVasive
 NuVasive is a medical device company focused on the
design, development, and marketing of products for the surgical treatment
of spine disorders. The Company's product portfolio is focused primarily
on the $5.1 billion U.S. spine implant market. Additionally, the Company
has expanded into the $1.7 billion global biologics market, the $1.7
billion international market, and is developing products for the emerging
motion preservation market. 

    NuVasive's principal product offering is based on its Maximum Access
Surgery, or MAS(R) platform. The MAS platform combines four categories of
products that collectively minimize soft tissue disruption during spine
surgery with maximum visualization and safe, easy reproducibility for the
surgeon: NeuroVision(R), a proprietary software-driven nerve avoidance
system; MaXcess(R), a unique split-blade retractor system; a wide variety
of specialized implants; and several biologic fusion enhancers. MAS
significantly reduces surgery time and returns patients to activities of
daily living much faster than conventional approaches. Having redefined
spine surgery with the MAS platform's lateral approach, known as eXtreme
Lateral Interbody Fusion, or XLIF(R), NuVasive has built an entire spine
franchise. With over 55 products today spanning lumbar, thoracic and
cervical applications, the Company will continue to expand and evolve its
offering predicated on its R focus and dedication to outstanding
service levels supported by a culture of Absolute Responsiveness(R). 

    NuVasive cautions you that statements included in this press release that
are not a description of historical facts are forward-looking statements
that involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors which,
if they do not materialize or prove correct, could cause NuVasive's
results to differ materially from historical results or those expressed
or implied by such forward-looking statements. The potential risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual growth and results to differ
materially include, but are not limited to: the uncertain process of
seeking regulatory approval or clearance for NuVasive's products or
devices, including risks that such process could be significantly
delayed; the possibility that the FDA may require significant changes to
NuVasive's products or clinical studies; the risk that products may not
perform as intended and may therefore not achieve commercial success; the
risk that competitors may develop superior products or may have a greater
market position enabling more successful commercialization; the risk that
additional clinical data may call into question the benefits of
NuVasive's products to patients, hospitals and surgeons; and other risks
and uncertainties more fully described in NuVasive's press releases and
periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NuVasive's
public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission are available
at www.sec.gov. NuVasive assumes no obligation to update any
forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances arising
after the date on which it was made.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft unveiled a major refresh of the Windows Live Essentials suite. The video overview focuses primarily on the improved photo editing, management, and sharing features--which do seem fairly impressive. But, small and medium business customers will be much more impressed with the expanded features and functionality of Windows Live Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has powerful spam filtering protection, and additional innovations in place to proactively combat junk mail which help business professionals cut down on Inbox clutter. However, just the legitimate messages that are supposed to be in the Inbox can create a clutter of their own and make it difficult to communicate efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you log in to Windows Live Mail, the Highlights feature enables you to immediately see if there are any new messages from your contacts, social network updates, or appointments and reminders. The 1-Click Filter in Windows Live Mail lets you filter your view of the Inbox to show only unread e-mails, or only messages from your contacts, or only messages from designated social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn. As the name implies, this filtering is accomplished with a single click. Windows Live Mail also provides&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quick Views let you sort messages from your Inbox and all folders based on which ones contain photos, documents, videos, or messages that you have flagged. Conversation threading makes it easier to follow a message thread from beginning to end, and Windows Live Mail also includes the ability to quickly retrieve the entire history of messages from a given sender. The Sweep feature automatically declutters your Inbox by moving conversation threads to an alternate folder, or deleting them entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Windows Live Mail incorporates some aspects of unified communications and extends mobile access to communication. Instant messaging, SMS messaging, and social networking are all integrated into the app. You can instantly see which contacts are available online, and initiate an instant messaging chat session, or send an SMS text message to the contact's phone without leaving the Windows Live Mail Inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Exchange ActiveSync technology, the Windows Live Mail software can push e-mail messages to your mobile phone. You can automatically update and synchronize your e-mail, calendar, and contacts between your smartphone and the Web. There are also custom apps available for BlackBerry, Nokia, and other mobile phones that don't support Exchange ActiveSync.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Live Mail is also tightly integrated with Office Web Apps, and with Windows Live SkyDrive to enable online viewing and editing of Microsoft Office documents. Windows Live Mail preserves the formatting and appearance of Office docs, and files can be e-mailed to and viewed on alternate platforms like Gmail and Yahoo! Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list goes on. Cloud-based applications and services are not Microsoft's forte--those are Google's stomping grounds.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following ratings of Exxon Mobil Corporation
(ExxonMobil): 

--Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AAA'; 

--Senior unsecured debt at 'AAA'; 

--Commercial paper at 'F1+'; 

--Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. 

The ratings reflect the unsurpassed breadth and quality of ExxonMobil's asset
portfolio and its strong competitive position in all parts of the integrated oil
chain; its relatively heavy exposure to liquids in the upstream; disciplined
focus on generating high returns on capital employed (ROCEs) with very low
levels of financial leverage; strong cash flow generation and a record of
maintaining the highest levels of credit quality throughout previous hydrocarbon
price cycles; as well as the strategic value the rating confers on the company
in negotiations with partners in long-term deals. 

Assuming the XTO acquisition closes as planned in the second quarter, the
assumption of XTO's $10.4 billion in debt will approximately double ExxonMobil's
gross debt from $9.45 billion to $19.98 billion. However, given cash balances of
$13.74 billion, net debt of the combined entity on a pro forma basis at March
31, 2010 would be just $6.24 billion on an asset base of approximately $280
billion. XTO's significant above-market 2010 natural gas hedges - with
approximately 52% of natural gas production hedged at $7.49/mcf for 2010 - eases
near-term concerns that low spot natural gas prices could create external
funding requirements on the part of XTO (year to date Henry Hub natural gas has
averaged $4.61/mcf). 

ExxonMobil's recent upstream operational metrics were robust. Consolidated
reserves rose to 14.96 billion boe at year end 2009 versus 12.81 billion boe the
year prior, an increase of 16.7%. Reserves, including equity affiliates,
increased 8.9% year-over-year to 22.98 billion boe. As calculated by Fitch, the
company's one- and three-year reserve replacement ratios (RRR) were 292% and
155%, well above the levels seen in recent years. Three-year FD was just
$9.52/boe in 2009, which compares favorably to most North American producers.
ExxonMobil's reserves-to-production (R/P) ratio rose to 13.3 years from the 11.3
years seen the year prior, while proven developed reserves comprised 67.3% of
total reserves. Consistent with other supermajors, liquids continue to comprise
a majority of the firm's output (60.7%). A key driver of improvement in several
of the company's 2009 operational metrics stemmed from SEC changes to reserve
booking rules, which allow firms to book syncrude and bitumen reserves from oil
sands mining operations. In 2009, the company booked a total of 2.7 billion boe
of oil sands-linked unconventional reserves. Since this was a one-time
accounting change we are not expecting these impacts to recur. Bracketing 2009
results, reserve replacement remains a longer term issue for supermajors as a
group given increased competition from NOCs, the need to replace very large
production bases each year, and in ExxonMobil's case, a reluctance to chase
unprofitable growth. 

The company's credit metrics continue to be among the strongest across all
peers, consistent with its current 'AAA' rating. As calculated by Fitch, at
year-end 2009, E debt/boe p1 proven reserves was just $0.46/boe versus
$0.53/boe the year prior. E debt/boe proven developed reserves was just
$0.76/boe (figures exclude equity affiliate reserves and allocate 28% of debt to
other operations). For the 12-month period ending March 31, 2010, ExxonMobil had
debt/EBITDA leverage of just 0.22 times (x), EBITDA/gross interest coverage of
48.7x, and free cash flow (FCF) of $972 million. Looking forward, Fitch
anticipates the company will remain significantly FCF positive in 2010. 

ExxonMobil's liquidity remains very strong and is provided mainly by internally
generated cash flows and existing cash balances. At the end of the first
quarter, cash and equivalents of $13.74 billion exceeded debt of $9.45 billion
by approximately 1.45x. The company has had negative net debt since 2003;
however, as previously stated, on a pro forma basis Fitch expects the company
will have a modest amount of net debt following the closing of the XTO purchase.
At Dec. 31, 2009 ExxonMobil had unused short-term uncommitted credit lines of
$4.8 billion, of which $2.3 billion was available to support its commercial
paper program. ExxonMobil's pending debt maturity schedule at March 31, 2010 is
light, and includes nothing due in 2010, $344 million in 2011, $2.73 billion in
2012. XTO's near-term debt maturities are also reasonable. 

Other obligations are manageable. The company's asset retirement obligation
(ARO) was $8.44 billion at year-end 2009, up from $5.35 billion primarily due to
revisions in remediation costs. The underfunded status on ExxonMobil's multiple
pension plans shrank to $11.65 billion at year-end 2009, versus $15.37 billion
the year prior. The decrease was largely due to improved asset performance as
well as company contributions of $4.5 billion to pension plans in 2009. Expected
pension contributions in 2010 are $1.54 billion. Operating lease expense totaled
$4.42 billion in 2009 and covered drilling equipment, tankers, service stations,
and other properties. Derivatives exposure is limited, and the company had a net
derivative asset of less than $15 million on its books at March 31, 2010. 

In rating this issuer, Fitch used the master criteria Corporate Rating
Methodology, dated Nov. 24, 2009; Rating Oil and Gas Exploration and Production
Companies, dated April 6, 2010; and the Credit Rating Methodology for Refiners,
dated Nov. 9, 2007, all of which are available on 'www.fitchratings.com'.

&lt;p&gt; * Says Windows will be used in tablets PCs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says transition from PCs could be even better for co&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Spending in developed world returns - Ballmer
 (Adds Ballmer's comments, details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RANCHO PALOS VERDES, Calif., June 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft
Corp  (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer called the
transition from PCs to smartphones and tablets a time of
"potential tumult" in the technology industry, but said the
software maker will continue to prosper in the changing
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer, who told industry executives he sees tech spending
in developed economies coming back this year, said that
Microsoft's Windows operating system, which runs the vast
majority of the world's PCs, will feature on the new breed of
touchscreen tablet computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software maker, which last week lost
its mantle of largest tech company by capitalization to
longtime arch-foe Apple Inc (AAPL.O), is expected to ride a
resurgence in corporate spending in 2010 after a dry 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But some investors fear it lacks a coherent strategy to
establish a dominant footprint in the next wave of wireless
computing devices, such as next-generation smartphones and
wireless tablets. [ID:nSGE64Q051]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Depending on what you're trying to get done with the
device at different times, there will be people who absolutely
will want the comfortable and familiar look of Windows," said
Ballmer at the All Things Digital conference on Thursday, where
he appeared onstage alongside Microsoft Chief Software
Architect Ray Ozzie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's nothing bad for us in the trend," Ballmer said of
consumers' tastes for new Internet-connected gadgets like
tablets and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple has taken the lead in the nascent tablet market,
selling more than 2 million iPads in about two months.
[ID:nN31178032]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are moving from a world that's fundamentally good for
us to a world that could be even better," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer also said that business in developing countries has
started to come back and that spending by businesses on
technology appears to be recovering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he highlighted macroeconomic risks on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the developed world, things have come off the lows, for
sure. I think our industry is even more revved up about how
good the economy is than maybe some others," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And then we get the Greek question ... Now people are
asking what will happen, and I don't think anybody is smart
enough to know," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It partly depends on what government intervention happens,
which seems to have been relatively aggressive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Microsoft gained 1 percent in a flat market.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase  Co has been fined a record 33.32 million pounds ($49.12 million) in Britain for failing to protect billions of dollars of client money over almost seven years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issuing a stark warning to other banks operating in Britain, the country's Financial Services Authority said on Thursday that JPMorgan Securities Ltd, a UK unit of the bank, had failed to adequately protect between $1.9 billion and $23 billion of client money between November 2002 and July 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This penalty sends out a strong message to firms of all sizes that they must ensure client money is segregated in accordance with FSA rules. Firms need to sit up and take notice of this action -- we have several more cases in the pipeline," said Margaret Cole, the FSA's head of enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under FSA rules, companies have to ringfence client money from the firm's money and keep it in segregated accounts with trust status to protect it in the event of an insolvency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, JPMorgan failed to segregate client money held by its futures and options business (FO) with JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (JPMCB) following the merger of JPMorgan  Co and Chase Manhattan Corporation in 2000. The error remained undetected for nearly seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers voiced surprise at the size of the penalty, which one said should serve as a "wake up call" to senior managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a staggering fine for what is in effect an administrative oversight," said Simon Morris of law firm CMS Cameron McKenna. "The one surprise is that FSA hasn't also gone against the senior managers responsible for this mistake, which is now its normal practice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has performed due diligence checks in its futures business globally since uncovering the error in Britain, a person familiar with the bank said. The internal checks indicate the mistake was a one-off issue resulting from the Chase merger, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. bank by assets, JPMorgan was profitable during the financial crisis and won market share in part by acquiring troubled Bear Stearns Cos in March 2008 and failed Seattle thrift Washington Mutual Inc, just days after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ERROR 'NOT DELIBERATE'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No clients suffered any losses from the breach. But the FSA has been keen to prove its mettle after battling accusations of failing to spot and halt the excessively risky banker behavior that helped trigger the worst credit crisis since World War Two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In handing down the record fine, its largest since penalizing oil company Royal Dutch Shell 17 million pounds in 2004 for overstating oil and gas reserves, the FSA said it took into account that the misconduct was not deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also noted JPMorgan reported the error to the regulator after spotting it last July during conversations between senior staff in its compliance and treasury departments, that it immediately rectified the problem and cooperated with the FSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's cooperation with the FSA earned it a 30 percent discount on its original 47.6 million pound fine, in line with FSA practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the financial crisis brought banks around the world to their knees and crawling to the taxpayer for bail-outs, the FSA has stepped up targeted supervision and regulatory intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It created a specialist CASS (Client Asset Sourcebook) task force last year to measure and mitigate risks to client money and assets -- and has warned compliance departments of financial institutions to expect spot checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last six months, the FSA said it had identified failings that included poor management oversight and control, a lack of trust status for segregated accounts, unclear arrangements for segregating client money and incomplete or inaccurate records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulator has demanded costly and lengthy investigations by third parties -- so-called skilled person reports, made two enforcement referrals, issued private warnings and even frozen assets and issued a ban on taking on new business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.6783 Pound)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Douwe Miedema and Steve Slater in London and Elinor Comlay in New York; Editing by Andrew Callus)&lt;/p&gt;

tablets and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are moving from a world that's fundamentally good for
us to a world that could be even better," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer also said that business in developing countries has

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
has performed checks on its futures business globally after
discovering it had failed to segregate client assets in a UK
unit, a person familiar with the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Britain's Financial Services Authority on Thursday fined
JPMorgan a record 33.32 million pounds ($49.12 million) for
failing to protect billions of dollars of client money over
almost seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's checks indicated the error was a one-off issue
resulting from the merger of JPMorgan  Co and Chase Manhattan

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie was happy to talk about the history of computing Wednesday at a Silicon Valley event but did not want to talk about its future, as least as far as what Microsoft's plans might be pertaining to tablet computing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing at the PLATO@50 conference held to honor the PLATO (Programming Logic for Automated Teaching Operations) platform, Ozzie refused to respond to comments Apple CEO Steve Jobs reportedly made this week about devices such as Apple's iPad reducing the need for PCs. nbsp;Ozzie declined to say what PC software king Microsoft's strategy would be in relation to tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Microsoft recently  killed its Courier tablet project. | Nearly a dozen iPad clones are on display at Computex this week. | Get    the best iPhone and iPad apps for pros with our  business iPhone      apps finder. | And stay ahead   of  advances in mobile technology with InfoWorld's Mobile Edge    blog and Mobilize    newsletter. ] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would respond to that by saying this is great event, this is a tremendous event. I'm really glad to be here tonight. It's really about PLATO and it's about [PLATO founder Donald Bitzer, who was in attendance]," said Ozzie, who worked on PLATO and derived Lotus Notes from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event, Ozzie stressed, was "not about Microsoft" and its plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozzie did cite how PLATO has benefitted Microsoft in his brief interview with InfoWorld, conducted after his public discussion about PLATO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can speak most directly to the fact that I believe the communication tools that were built on PLATO spread out into tools for computer-supported cooperative work, and systems such as [Microsoft] SharePoint are direct beneficiaries of that," he said.nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLATO is a computer-based teaching system that originated at the University of Illinois. It is credited with generating innovations such as plasma displays and social computing. Games were played on the system as well. The PLATO conference, at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., is being held in recognition of the system's 50th anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozzie stressed the excitement PLATO generated from people who worked on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many of us tried to recreate some of that excitement," Ozzie said. "Notes was something many people tried to recreate," based on what had been done with PLATO, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked why PLATO is perhaps not as well-known as it might otherwise be, Bitzer cited the low-key approach to the project. "First of all, we did no advertising ourselves," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitzer also lauded Apple's iPhone, calling it "amazing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have probably as much appreciation for that as anybody," Bitzer said. nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, "Microsoft&#8217;s Ozzie mum on tablet plans," was originally  published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN RAMON, CA, Jun 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Tax &amp; Accounting business of Thomson Reuters has now upgraded its
Sabrix Managed Tax Service (MTS) integration for Microsoft Dynamics Great
Plains (GP) to include enhanced support for the increasingly complex
state and local sales and use tax laws, while improving performance and
tax accuracy and mitigating audit risks. 

    As the economy recovers, states and local municipalities continue to rely
on sales and use tax to generate revenue necessary to balance the budget.
As a result, companies are faced with navigating new or changing complex
tax laws. For example, Ohio recently switched from a destination to an
origin state and now bases taxes on a mix of goods and services in a
given invoice. 

    "What may seem like a simple tax change at the state or local level, can
translate to substantial operational efforts for businesses," said Mark
Lawler, vice president of technology of Sabrix, part of the Tax &amp;
Accounting business of Thomson Reuters. "Sabrix MTS integrated with
Microsoft Dynamics GP provides a flexible, high performance solution able
to address even the most complex state and local tax changes now and into
the future."

    Going beyond native tax features available in Microsoft Dynamics GP or in
third-party tax integrator solutions, Sabrix MTS integrated with
Microsoft Dynamics GP supports per document tax calls, and comes with SAS
70 Type II certified tax content, provided by an in-house tax research
team. Content is automatically updated, eliminating error-prone manual
processes and the need to continuously monitor tax law changes.
Additional benefits include: 


--  Increased tax accuracy and compliance, including support for
    origin-based states and complex tax rules such as: max tax
    jurisdictions; related product/service tax scenarios as required by
    SST; tax on charges such as freight, insurance, and similar; and
    taxation on complex product setups like bill of materials
--  Simplified tax reconciliation process for business users
--  Reduced need for manual adjustments to returns typical with line at a
    time calculated tax data

    

Pricing and Availability
 Sabrix integration for Microsoft Dynamics
GP versions 9 and 10 is available now. Pricing is on a subscription basis
and is based off a company's transaction tax complexity. For more
information, visit http://www.sabrix.com/managedtaxservice.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc analyst who pleaded guilty to running an insider trading scheme and later fled while on probation has been ordered to pay nearly $27.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an opinion released late Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood directed David Pajcin to pay a $7.72 million default judgment plus $20.05 million in fines, in a civil lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pajcin pleaded guilty in April 2006 to securities fraud and conspiracy for orchestrating a $6.7 million insider trading ring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said the ring traded on leaks about mergers, market-moving media reports, and a grand jury probe involving the drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who leaked information included a Merrill Lynch  Co analyst, workers at a printing plant for BusinessWeek magazine, and a New Jersey postal worker who sat on the grand jury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pajcin was sentenced in January 2008 to time served and three years of probation after cooperating with investigators, but soon violated his probation. An arrest warrant was issued in April 2008, court records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood said Pajcin failed to respond to three amended SEC complaints, and his whereabouts remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether Pajcin now employs a lawyer. Paul Lieber, a lawyer who has represented Pajcin in the past, on Thursday said he no longer does. Jesse Siegel, who represented Pajcin in the criminal case, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pajcin is the nephew of Sonja Anticevic, a retired Croatian seamstress whose brokerage accounts he used to execute the illegal trades, regulators said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month Wood threw out a $5.72 million default judgment that the SEC won against Anticevic, after she retained a Croatian lawyer for her defense. Anticevic is believed to be in her late 60s and living on a low income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Anticevic et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 05-06991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Jun 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Riverbed Technology (NASDAQ: RVBD), the IT performance company, today

    Enterprise and government customers use Riverbed WAN optimization
solutions to dramatically accelerate and optimize Microsoft applications
such as SharePoint and Exchange over the WAN. To extend the benefits of
the Riverbed Steelhead(R) appliances, the company offers organizations
the ability to virtualize their branch office IT infrastructure with the
Riverbed Services Platform (RSP), a partition within the Steelhead
appliance that allows organizations to run up to five additional edge
services. With RSP, customers have the ability to virtualize and run
Microsoft services such as Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2003,
Active Directory, DNS/DHCP, media streaming and print services on one
platform, resulting in a reduced IT hardware footprint, lower costs and
easier management. 

    Riverbed has worked closely with Microsoft to enhance the experience of
Riverbed customers running Microsoft applications and services. Most
recently, Riverbed announced that the company is the first WAN
optimization vendor to obtain validation for the Microsoft Server
Virtualization Validation Program (SVVP) for Microsoft Windows Server
2008 R2. With the combination of Windows Server 2008 R2 infrastructure

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/8b491c/microsoft_corporat) has
announced the addition of the "Microsoft Corporation - SWOT Framework Analysis"
company profile to their offering. 

SWOT Analysis, is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats involved in a project or in a business
venture. It involves specifying the objective of the business venture or project
and identifying the internal and external factors that are favorable and
unfavorable to achieving that objective. 

The aim of any SWOT analysis is to identify the key internal and external
factors that are important to achieving the objective. SWOT analysis groups key
pieces of information into two main categories: 

Internal factors - The strengths and weaknesses internal to the organization.
External factors - The opportunities and threats presented by the external
environment. 

The internal factors may be viewed as strengths or weaknesses depending upon
their impact on the organizations objectives. What may represent strengths with
respect to one objective may be weaknesses for another objective. The factors
may include all of the 4Ps; as well as personnel, finance, manufacturing
capabilities, and so on. The external factors may include macroeconomic matters,
technological change, legislation, and socio-cultural changes, as well as
changes in the marketplace or competitive position. The results are often
presented in the form of a matrix. 

SWOT analysis is just one method of categorization and has its own weaknesses.
For example, it may tend to persuade companies to compile lists rather than
think about what is really important in achieving objectives. It also presents
the resulting lists uncritically and without clear prioritization so that, for
example, weak opportunities may appear to balance strong threats.

&lt;p&gt;Red-Hot Slate of Boys Properties Now Includes Cars, Toy Story, TRON, Marvel
Franchises and Phineas and Ferb
GLENDALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
With strong retail sales of licensed Disney merchandise thus far in 2010, Disney
continues its reign as the world`s largest licensor with $27 billion in global
retail sales for 2009. During a presentation this week in preparation for the
annual Licensing International Expo 2010 trade show next week, Andy Mooney,
chairman of Disney Consumer Products (DCP), announced DCP`s new goal to
significantly increase annual global retail sales of Disney and Marvel licensed
merchandise within the next five years, with boys` merchandise playing a
prominent role. 

DCP`s core strategy is to focus on newer properties targeting the boys` market,
including popular Marvel franchises, TRON and Disney Channel and Disney XD hit
series Phineas and Ferb, as well as continued support of its six key franchises:
Disney&#8729;Pixar`s Cars, Disney Fairies, Disney Princess, Mickey Mouse,
Disney&#8729;Pixar`s Toy Story and Winnie The Pooh. With unmatched content, rich
franchises and given recent signs of an improved economy, DCP is primed for
significant growth through the remainder of 2010 and into 2011. 

Retail sales of merchandise for boys` properties have clearly been on the rise
for DCP. 

WHERE THE BOYS ARE

"Our brand is our strongest asset and there is no better time in history for
licensees or retailers to be associated with Disney; our strong slate of boys
properties are designed to capture this market in a very big way," Mooney said.
"The tremendous strength of the Cars franchise, coupled with the recent
acquisition of Marvel, which appeals to older boys, puts us in an optimum
position to increase our share of this segment." 

Toy Story Expected to Reach $2.4 Billion Mark

With fiscal year 2010 retail sales expected to reach $2.4 billion, Toy Story and
its beloved cast of characters have become a priority and long-term franchise
for The Walt Disney Company and DCP`s biggest event film licensing program ever
generating $9B in global retail sales since its inception. As Toy Story 3
readies to release in theaters June 18, major retailers have rolled out
significant Toy Story product statements which have only set in the last month.
But already in that short time, over 3.5 million units of Toy Story merchandise
have been sold. In addition to the momentum from the film and merchandise, the
Toy Story franchise will grow into a cross-company initiative that will include
the introduction of all-new short form content on multiple Disney platforms
modeled after the popular series, Cars Toons.

Cars Franchise Poised To Lead Disney Boys Franchises in 2011

Following the incredible success of Toy Story, DCP`s biggest event film
licensing program, the upcoming release of Cars 2 in June 2011 will be supported
with unprecedented cross-company initiatives that are expected to dwarf DCP`s
huge Toy Story 3 retail sell-in. Cars was the highest grossing animated film in
the U.S. in 2006 and has generated $2B in annual global retail sales every year
since then. Cars has been a huge and consistent hit with boys, parents and
collectors; years after the original film`s debut, Lightning McQueen and Mater
still rank as the #1 and #2 most popular movie characters among moms of boys
2-5. Cars Toons, the hilarious series of shorts airing on Disney Channel, has
made Cars relevant to young boys and provided fresh merchandising themes for
incremental retail programs globally. To date, there have been 150 million
die-cast cars sold around the world. 

Marvel Drives Boys` Marketshare Growth

The acquisition of Marvel and its wildly popular properties, including Captain
America, Iron Man and Thor, gives DCP a tremendous opportunity to reach older
boys and enhance its overall marketing and growth efforts. 

DCP will initially leverage its strong retail and licensing relationships to
stimulate sales internationally; the core Marvel management team will continue
to run Marvel`s domestic brand in New York and will collaborate with DCP`s
domestic team on select, synergistic opportunities. Disney Store and
DisneyStore.com began selling Marvel-licensed products this year with the
release of Iron Man 2 and will continue through the year and into 2011. 

And as the anticipation with TRON Legacy builds with the theatrical release
approaching this holiday, DCP is laying the groundwork for a stellar merchandise
assortment filled with innovation and something exciting for all, primarily
older boys. 

Phineas and Ferb Reigns As #1 Disney Channel Series For Boys 6-11, the #1
Animated Series on TV in Total Viewers, Kids 6-11 and Tweens

Phineas and Ferb is Disney Channel's #1 series among Boys 6-11 and is TV`s #1
animated series in Total Viewers Kids 6-11 and Tweens 9-14. It is also
delivering strong ratings on Disney XD in more than 135 countries and in 26
languages around the world. In the spring of 2009, DCP soft-launched a Phineas
and Ferb t-shirt and by the end of the year Phineas and Ferb became one of the
top three licensed properties in the boys departments at national retailers. The
franchise has also demonstrated strong sales with stationery, fruit snacks,
books, a DS video game and music sound track. For the first time this summer,
consumers can enjoy a full line of Phineas and Ferb merchandise including
skateboards, action figures and an assortment of toys and playthings. A Talking
Perry plush has been a top seller at Disney Store, and DisneyStore.com now lets
consumers create personalized Phineas and Ferb merchandise. 

CORE FRANCHISES CONTINUE IMPRESSIVE GROWTH

DCP`s ambitious plans for Cars, Toy Story and its newer boy`s properties are
incremental to its sharp focus on core franchises including Disney Princess,
Disney Fairies, Mickey Mouse and Winnie The Pooh all of which will continue to
be a major priority across all lines of business. 

It All Starts And Ends With A Mouse

Probably more than any other character, Mickey Mouse exudes the attributes of
trust, quality and fun that have enabled the Disney brand to extend well beyond
the licensed rack. Mickey Mouse reigns as Disney`s largest franchise; products
inspired by Mickey resonate with lifestyles in every consumer age and stage -
from preschoolers to urban artists - and Mickey has inspired countless ideas and
innovations over the years. Beginning this fall, high-end designers like Dolce
and Gabbana, fast-fashion leaders like Uniqlo in Japan and key apparel retailers
in the U.S. will offer exciting new collections geared toward trend-watchers and
fashion-conscious consumers. Often described as the first lady of The Walt
Disney Company, Minnie Mouse will also emerge in fresh new ways at retail in the
U.S., Japan and Europe in a soon-to-be-announced merchandise program. 

Taking Pooh Back To His Roots

Winnie The Pooh continues to be one of DCP`s evergreen core franchises with a
timeless appeal for the youngest consumers and their mothers. Pooh will return
to his roots on July 15, 2011 with a theatrical film release backed by a major
multi-media marketing campaign. At retail, DCP will drive Winnie The Pooh sales
through strong new merchandising programs such as a soon-to-be-announced all-new
Disney Baby collection for infants. 

Disney Princess And Disney Fairies Generate Combined Retail Sales of $5.3B

Girls love to play dress-up and pretend, and they love Disney Princess and
Disney Fairies. Disney Princess is the top girls brand worldwide for girls 2-6
with $4 billion in global sales. Tinker Bell`s tremendous popularity has sparked
another sustainable girls franchise with Disney Fairies which has become a $1.3
billion retail business. As 2010 got started, The Princess and the Frog
connected around the world and brought a new generation of fans to the dreams
and adventures of girls everywhere. DCP officially welcomed Princess Tiana into
the Disney Princess brand with a star-studded coronation ceremony and reception
at the New York Palace Hotel in March. At the Disney Store, Tiana was the #1
best selling fashion doll throughout the Holiday, and continues to sell
strongly. DCP`s Toy and Stationery lines of businesses have enjoyed a healthy
bump through the DVD release and the sales figures continue to grow, proving
that Princess Tiana is a sustainable and incremental addition to the Disney
Princess franchise. Disney will continue to expand both franchises with new
theatrical releases and programs anchored around Blu-ray/DVD launches, online
destinations, interactive games, books, music, theme park and live entertainment
experiences, and more.

Securities Ltd (JPM.N) has been fined a record 33.32 million
pounds ($49.12 million) by Britain's regulator for failing to
protect billions of dollars of client money over almost seven
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Financial Services Authority (FSA) said on Thursday that

Chase Bank N.A. after its merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This error remained undetected for nearly seven years, the

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/f56e10/procter_gamble_c) has
announced the addition of the "Procter &amp; Gamble Company - SWOT Framework
Analysis" company profile to their offering. 

SWOT Analysis, is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats involved in a project or in a business
venture. It involves specifying the objective of the business venture or project
and identifying the internal and external factors that are favorable and
unfavorable to achieving that objective. 

The aim of any SWOT analysis is to identify the key internal and external
factors that are important to achieving the objective. SWOT analysis groups key
pieces of information into two main categories: 

Internal factors - The strengths and weaknesses internal to the organization.
External factors - The opportunities and threats presented by the external
environment. 

The internal factors may be viewed as strengths or weaknesses depending upon
their impact on the organizations objectives. What may represent strengths with
respect to one objective may be weaknesses for another objective. The factors
may include all of the 4Ps; as well as personnel, finance, manufacturing
capabilities, and so on. The external factors may include macroeconomic matters,
technological change, legislation, and socio-cultural changes, as well as
changes in the marketplace or competitive position. The results are often
presented in the form of a matrix. 

SWOT analysis is just one method of categorization and has its own weaknesses.
For example, it may tend to persuade companies to compile lists rather than
think about what is really important in achieving objectives. It also presents
the resulting lists uncritically and without clear prioritization so that, for
example, weak opportunities may appear to balance strong threats.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - John Lindfors of Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) has become the latest senior European technology banker
to depart a major investment bank, leaving to become a partner
at Russian Internet investor Digital Sky Technologies (DST).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; DST, which bought a $300 million stake in Facebook last
year, said in a statement on Thursday that Lindfors would join
in September as a partner to help it "realise the growth
ambitions we have for the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lindfors, a Finn, spent 17 years at Goldman and had been a
partner and head of the European technology investment banking
practice since 2006. He advised Promethean World Plc (PRWP.L),
the British maker of interactive whiteboards, on its 186
million-pound ($274 million) initial public offer in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Europe is suffering a general slowdown in dealmaking,
exacerbated for the technology sector because the continent is
home to just a handful of heavyweight companies, such as SAP AG
(SAPG.DE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That has helped spur a string of departures from the largest
banks. Last month Lindfors's counterpart at UBS (UBSN.VX),
Dominic Lester, left for Jefferies JEF.N, where he will work
alongside Mark Fisher, who quit a similar role at Citigroup
(C.N) in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year Jean Tardy-Joubert quit Bank of America (BAC.N)
Merrill Lynch for boutique Qatalyst Group while Thierry Monjauze
left Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) to open a London office for
mid-market U.S. firm Harris Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman confirmed the move but could not
say who would replace Lindfors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month DST's chief executive, Yuri Milner, told a
British newspaper the group had built up a warchest of more than
$1 billion and was actively looking at companies in Asia,
Australia and Britain. [ID:nLDE64M06H]

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, June 3 (Reuters) - Rajat Gupta, a former director
at Goldman Sachs (GS.N), quit the supervisory board at Sberbank
SBER03.MM, Russia's biggest lender, but remains a strategic
adviser to the board, Sberbank said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Gupta, a former worldwide managing director at McKinsey 
Co, was first elected to Sberbank's supervisory board in 2008
and has been so far the highest-paid director with a 429,000
euros ($524,700) paycheck proposed for 2009. [ID:nNLDE6442E]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gupta has withdrawn his name from the ballot for the
election to Sberbank's supervisory board that will take place at
the annual general shareholders meeting June 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Both sides have come to the conclusion that direct
involvement of Mr. Gupta in Sberbank's strategic tasks and
projects as a strategic adviser will maximise the positive
results of our joint efforts," Sberbank said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gupta came into the public eye in April after the Wall
Street Journal said he told hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam
about Berkshire Hathaway's $5 billion investment in Goldman
before the deal became public. Gupta said he had done nothing
improper. [ID:nN23198525]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State-controlled Sberbank has submitted Gupta's remuneration
to its annual shareholders meeting for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Remuneration for the other directors on the supervisory
board ranged from 1 million roubles to 3.5 million roubles

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to shut down Bing Cashback, the service that offered online shoppers cash rebates for buying products after searching for them on Bing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that the offering, which was based on technology developed by Jellyfish.com, a company Microsoft bought in 2007, didn't do as well as hoped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft attracted more than 1,000 merchant partners who offered cash back to shoppers, said Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice president for Microsoft's Online Audience Business Group, in a blog post. "But after a couple of years of trying, we did not see the broad adoption that we had hoped for," he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cashback will be available to users until July 30. After that, users will have a year to redeem any cash they earned through purchases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the concept of Cashback sounds attractive, it also has a fair amount of complexity and that may have kept users away, said analyst Greg Sterling of Sterling Market Intelligence. Users had to sign up and then understand how and when they would get the cash back, he noted. Plus, some people may have thought it sounded too good to be true. "There's an inherent skepticism that people bring to this," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible the amount of cash being offered wasn't enough to attract more users and maybe the merchant partners didn't do enough promotion, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Microsoft could be in the process of examining its many search initiatives in an effort to discontinue those that aren't paying off. "I would guess it has to do with a lot of the rationalization Microsoft is doing given that they have to take on the Yahoo search platform," said Richard Sim, vice president, product management and marketing at Anchor Intelligence. He said Microsoft appears to be working hard on the integration with Yahoo and so may be looking to trim off unnecessary projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cashback was once central to Microsoft's push to position its search engine as one that was ideal for shoppers. It was also a service that Microsoft founder Bill Gates seemed particularly fond of. He often spoke about the potential for the offering to draw people to Microsoft search. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2008 when the service launched, he described Cashback as a new advertising platform. Search advertising offers essentially nothing in return, compared to advertising on TV or radio, where users get content in return, he explained. Cashback "gives you a reason why you should use a particular search," he said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cashback launched with some marquee names including eBay, Barnes  Noble, Sears, Home Depot, Zappos.com and Overstock.com. It launched with 700 merchants, so it grew only nominally over two years. &lt;/p&gt;

Jobs Data Looms, Top Stocks And Technical Patterns

The markets are struggling to hold the flat line today. The huge rally yesterday
has put the markets in a better mood. President Obama and Vice President Biden
each came out touting the jobs number for Friday morning. In addition, Goldman
Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) upped their estimate for jobs creation in the month
of May from 500,000 to 600,000 today. All this helped the markets rally
yesterday and hold flat today. Volume is getting very light as we head into the
mid day session. 

As a Chief Market Strategist I am eyeing many stocks for possible plays. The top
stock at the moment is AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) should it drop
below $14.00 per share. At this point, it would appear to have significant
upside potential. The technical pullback is solid along with the pattern of
consolidation. 

Overall, the SPDR S 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) remains just slightly positive on the
day. There was a beautiful inverse head and shoulders that played out to the
$111.00 level. Note the chart below. Once that played out, the markets were due
for a small pullback. To get more analysis, guidance and education, join the

</body></entry><entry author="Matthew Goldstein" date="2010-06-04T20:41:28+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/globalNews/idUSTRE65364N20100604"><headline>Analysis: Goldman silence on probe a model others will avoid?</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The decision of Goldman Sachs Group Inc not to tell shareholders that regulators might sue the bank over a subprime mortgage-linked security could cause other companies to rethink the way they handle regulatory investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investment banking powerhouse has said its lawyers found no reason to disclose a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission because the transaction at issue was relatively small and the case had little legal weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But another calculus may have been at work, too: the potential negative impact that disclosing the Wells notice would have had on the firm's share price last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report last summer by Cornerstone Research, a securities litigation consulting shop, found that shares of companies that reported getting a Wells notice from the SEC incurred a "statistically significant market-adjusted" price decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Wells notice is a letter indicating the likelihood of regulatory action and giving the people or company targeted a chance to respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cornerstone report, prepared at the request of the American Bar Association, found that on average, shares of companies dropped 2.6 percent after they reported the receipt of a Wells notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ABA asked Cornerstone to conduct the study because disclosing a Wells notice and the likelihood of an SEC enforcement action is optional. The SEC does not require companies to disclose a Wells notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares fell 12 percent on April 16, the day the SEC sued Goldman for civil fraud in connection with the structuring and sale of a $1 billion collateralized debt obligation. That was seven months after the bank received its Wells notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'MATERIAL'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of an SEC requirement, some experts believe that companies should be obliged to disclose receipt of a Wells notice. Paradoxically, Goldman's much publicized failure to do so could make other companies more likely to do so in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would seem to me that for most public companies a Wells would be material to an investor," said Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on the Cornerstone report or whether it had an impact on the investment firm's decision not to disclose the Wells notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it was up to me, I would make it a disclosable event," said Donald Langevoort, a Georgetown University Law School professor. "I have seen too many cases where companies have not disclosed Wells notices and it just leaves a bad taste for investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cornerstone said that in the 58 cases it examined, not all stocks had significant declines. The researchers concluded that traders and investors were able to "discern firm-specific differences" in the significance of Wells notices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, some Wells notices carry worse news than others. Securities lawyers said it is not always easy for a company to know ahead of time which will be worse -- the harm to its reputation from an investigation or the potential penalty if a violation is found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BROKER REQUIREMENT TOUGHER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Reputation harm is hard to calculate, much less to predict," said David Martin, a partner with Covington  Securities and former director of the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance. "But if a company's stock declines by 10 percent after information is released, a reasonable investor would certainly have more than a germ of an argument that the information was material."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Goldman, it appears the harm right now is more to its reputation than its bottom line. At most, analysts estimate it will cost Goldman between $500 million and $1 billion to settle the SEC lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not an insignificant sum, but it will hardly break the bank for Goldman, which earned $13.39 billion in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's decision not to disclose the likelihood of an SEC lawsuit has sparked a number of lawsuits from investors who claim they were damaged by the sudden sell-off in its stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Goldman and other Wall Street firms do not have to report Wells notices, individual employees are required to alert the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority if they are named in a Wells notice. Over the years, the securities industry's self-regulatory agency has sanctioned brokers and other registered Wall Street employees for not disclosing a Wells notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would likely take either federal legislation or an SEC rule to change the disclosure requirement. And for the moment, neither appears likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even Elson, the corporate governance expert, said he is not ready to put a rule in place automatically requiring disclosure. "It has got to be a judgment call," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But given the fierce market reaction to Goldman's failure to disclose its Wells notice, it may be much harder for companies to make those judgment calls in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matthew Goldstein and Steve Eder; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Shares of Internet firm AOL Inc rose in a broader market sell off on Friday as talk circulated that it may be an acquisition target for Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AOL shares rose as much as 5.8 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. In afternoon trading they were up 46 cents, or 2.2 percent, at $21.46, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq slid more than 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AOL, whose web portal currently outsources web search to Google Inc, is in the process of discussing a new web search deal with "more than two potential partners", AOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong told the D8 tech conference this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result of those discussions could be an outright sale of AOL to Microsoft, the Business Insider news website reported on Friday, citing an unnamed source it said was familiar with AOL's strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's that sort of speculation that is driving the stock higher today," said Clayton Moran, an analyst with Benchmark Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AOL and Microsoft declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose MSN web portal competes with AOL and Yahoo, has already signed a deal for its Bing search engine to provide online search for Yahoo sites, and is keen to increase its share of the search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An outright purchase of AOL would help Microsoft's Bing grow and bring welcome consolidation in the portal market, the Business Insider report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While there is strong strategic rationale behind such a deal (it) doesn't seem likely," said Moran. "We think Time Warner pursued a sale of AOL prior to spinning it out and wasn't able to find an interested enough buyer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AOL, which split from former parent Time Warner Inc last year, has a market value of about $2.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby and Jennifer Saba; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten Large Corporations with Nineteen Projects, Turn to IBM and ANTs to Discuss
Ways to Eliminate Sybase and Reduce Costs and Complexity
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
ANTs software inc. (OTCBB:ANTS), a leader in database consolidation solutions,
today announced an update of the initial phase of its go to market strategy for
the IBM DB2 SQL Skin for applications compatible with Sybase ASE (IBM DB2
SSacSA) product. 

A total of ten Global 2000 and other large corporations in Financial Services,
Healthcare and Manufacturing originally engaged in the official IBM beta program
that is soon to be concluded. These ten organizations, with a total of nineteen
Sybase to DB2 migration projects, are part of the initial company pipeline. ANTs
Software, in collaboration with IBM, expects to convert a number of these
engagements into customers starting in the third quarter of the current year.
Depending on the size of the contracts, and depending on whether ANTs performs
the implementation or not, the revenues resulting from these customers will be
in the multiple millions. ANTs will issue more specific guidance in the near
term, once more information becomes available. 

By employing IBM DB2 SQL Skin for applications compatible with Sybase ASE, these
organizations will be able to accelerate applications migration from Sybase ASE
to IBM DB2 to lower costs, consolidate and maximize infrastructure and better
deploy existing database administrator (DBA) skills. 

Joseph Kozak, Chairman and CEO of ANTs Software said, "By utilizing IBM DB2
SSacSA and IBM`s global support, these customers have the opportunity to create
a lower cost and much more scalable infrastructure. IBM and ANTs are working
closely to expand the current opportunities into global financial services and
telecommunications markets, two sectors where Sybase is prevalent and cost
savings are a major priority." 

Aboutthe IBM DB2 SQL Skin for applications compatible with Sybase ASE

IBM and business partner ANTs Software jointly developed new DB2 capability with
the patent-pending ANTs Compatibility Server (ACS) technology. 

The new IBM DB2 SSacSA feature allows SQL code (queries, functions, and stored
procedures) from Sybase ASE to run natively and transparently against the DB2
DBMS with little-to-no application rewrite. 

IBM DB2 SSacSA general availability was announced on May 20, 2010 and the
product is currently available. 

For more information about IBM DB2 SSacSA, please visit the IBM product page or
the ANTs product page. 

About the IBM and ANTs Alliance

IBM Corp. and ANTs Software has completed and signed a Global OEM agreement. In
compliance with the agreement, ANTs repurposed its patent-pending ANTs
Compatibility Server (ACS) technology to jointly develop with IBM the IBM DB2
SQL Skin for applications compatible with Sybase ASE (IBM DB2 SSacSA) product. 

IBM assumes responsibility for marketing, sales and support of IBM DB2 SSacSA on
a worldwide basis, while ANTs is the preferred service provider for DBMS
migration projects to DB2. 

The ANTs Software database migration technology and services was carefully
selected by IBM after comprehensive research and customer validation of features
and data base migration capabilities.

&lt;p&gt;   * 57 pct see at least 30 pct tumor shrinkage on crizotinib&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Positive response seen in 87 pct of patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Side effects considered mild&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Drug seen as potential advance in personalized medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Berkrot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - An experimental drug being
developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) that targets a specific gene
mutation demonstrated impressive anti-tumor activity in
patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
according to data from a small study presented on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than half of the patients treated with the drug,
crizotinib, experienced significant tumor shrinkage, and nearly
90 percent had at least some positive response, such as a
smaller degree of tumor shrinkage or no worsening of the
disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Many of these patients had received three or more prior
treatments, and we would expect only about 10 percent to
respond. That is why we are so excited about the results," said
Dr Yung-Jue Bang, the study's lead investigator, who presented
the data at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting
in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These results are quite dramatic, and represent an
important improvement over what we would see with standard
chemotherapy for patients with metastatic disease," added Bang,
professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at Seoul
National University College of Medicine in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Researchers had speculated that the fusing of a gene known
as ALK with another gene called EML4 might help explain the
incidence of lung cancer in nonsmokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About one in 20 lung cancer patients in the United States
are estimated each year to be diagnosed with ALK-positive
NSCLC, researchers said. Pfizer estimates there are about 7,500
to 10,000 patients in the United States with the gene
mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crizotinib, which is taken orally twice a day, works by
inhibiting the ALK enzyme that is critical for the growth and
development of cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All of the 76 treated patients in the open label study had
the gene mutation and were either nonsmokers or had long given
up smoking. Most had already undergone multiple chemotherapy
regimens, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fifty-seven percent of the treated patients had their
tumors shrink at least 30 percent, which was characterized as a
partial response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But 87 percent experienced at least some tumor shrinkage or
stable disease after eight weeks, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One patient had a complete response with total
disappearance of the tumor. Another three or four had no
measurable tumor, but could not be characterized as a complete
response because of some residual abnormality, such as
scarring, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A reduction in tumor-related symptoms, such as severe
shortness of breath, coughing, and severe pain was also seen
with crizotinib treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have seen a number of patients whose symptoms begin to
improve within days or weeks of starting therapy," said Mace
Rothenberg, Pfizer oncology's senior vice president for
clinical development and medical affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crizotinib is already being tested in a late-stage study
against second-line chemotherapy agents. The drug is being
developed in conjunction with a diagnostic test from Abbott
Laboratories (ABT.N) to detect the ALK gene mutation, marking
another potential step forward in the field of personalized
medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most common side effects were nausea and vomiting and
were considered to be relatively mild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The median duration of treatment was about six months --
another encouraging sign as the prognosis for recurrent lung
cancer patients is typically survival of just three or four
months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There was no available median progression-free survival
data, meaning more than half the patients in the study were
still alive at the time of analysis.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group's U.S. government ties suffered a fresh blow on Monday, as a commission probing the financial crisis subpoenaed the bank, claiming the firm had flooded the panel with 2.5 billion pages of records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission had asked Goldman to provide documents and grant interviews in connection with the panel's probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, the Wall Street firm produced 5 terabytes of records, with each terabyte containing 500 million pages of digitized records, FCIC Chairman Phil Angelides told reporters on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FCIC Vice Chairman Bill Thomas said Goldman, knowing the panel's limited resources, had sent commission staff hunting for a needle in a haystack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect them to provide us with the needle," Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCIC called Goldman's response "abysmal."

&lt;p&gt;Oil Giant`s Actions Over Ecuador Disaster Condemned by Redford, Herbert, and
Perkins as Chorus of Prominent Voices Grows
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Actor and filmmaker Robert Redford, New York Times columnist Bob Herbert and
bestselling author John Perkins are the latest voices to condemn Chevron`s
desperate maneuvers to avoid liability for the massive oil disaster that has
plagued Ecuador`s rainforest for almost fifty years. 

Herbert reported in his column over the weekend that Chevron`s dumping in
Ecuador - which took place from 1964 to 1992 but has never been cleaned up -- is
larger than the BP spill in the Gulf. He also accused Chevron of treating the
pristine Amazon ecosystem like a "sewer" when it operated an oil concession in
Ecuador. 

Chevron is a defendant in a $27 billion lawsuit in Ecuador`s court brought by
dozens of indigenous groups and farmer communities who accused the oil giant of
dumping a far greater amount of crude than has flowed from the BP disaster. A
final decision is expected later this year. 

"BP`s calamitous behavior in the Gulf of Mexico is the big oil story of the
moment," wrote Herbert in an article published in The New York Times on
Saturday. "But for many years, indigenous people from a formerly pristine region
of the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador have been trying to get relief from an
American company, Texaco [now Chevron], for what has been described at the
largest oil-related catastrophe ever." 

Herbert said that both BP and Chevron, "when left to their own devices, will
treat even the most magnificent of nature`s wonders like a sewer." He also said
both the fishermen of Louisiana and indigenous peoples of Ecuador have been
treated "contemptuously" by BP and Chevron. 

"The families who lives and culture depend upon the intricate web of waterways
along the Gulf Coast of the United States are in a fix similar to that of the
indigenous people zapped by nonstop oil spills and the oil-related pollution in
the Ecuadorian rainforest," he wrote. 

Herbert`s column can be read here. 

Redford, in a column published by The Huffington Post, blasted Chevron for
violating the First Amendment by trying to subpoena the outtakes from an
award-winning documentary film on the lawsuit against Chevron brought by dozens
of Amazonian communities. The film, Crude, was made by celebrated director Joe
Berlinger and garnered 22 awards from film festivals in 2009 after premiering at
Sundance. 

"The potential ramifications of [Chevron`s subpoena] for the journalist
community, film world, and society in general are both shocking and profound,"
Redford wrote. "If we allow the voice of the independent artiest to be stifled
we should expect nothing less than extreme repercussions for freedom of
information&#8230; and freedom in general." 

Redford`s column can be read here. 

John Perkins, the New York Times best-selling author of "Confessions of an
Economic Hit Man" and "Hoodwinked," said: "Chevron winning the case against the
documentary filmmakers will hammer the final nail in the coffin of 'freedom of
speech.' Chevron winning the case against the victims of the oil spills in
Ecuador will not only establish the US in world eyes as a greedy, irresponsible
empire, but it will also set a precedent that will lead to an even more unjust
and unsustainable future, one we should not wish upon our children and
grandchildren." 

Chevron claims it needs the outtakes to help it defend the civil lawsuit, but
observers have pointed out that the oil giant is engaged in a wide-ranging
fishing expedition to undermine Ecuador`s court system in an attempt to avoid
paying an expected adverse judgment. This posture has attracted criticism from
documentary filmmakers Michael Moore, Ric Burns, and Trudie Styler. 

Burns said a ruling in favor of Chevron could deliver a "killer blow" for the
documentary film industry. 

"It makes me shudder to think that all the stuff would be turned over&#8230; not
because of any secrets that are revealed, but because of the killer blow to the
trust a filmmaker cultivated, deeply, over a very long period of time," Burns
said. 

Journalist Bill Moyers also criticized Chevron in an article, saying the oil
giant`s move jeopardizes "the whole integrity of the process of journalism."
Moyer`s article can be read here. 

The lawsuit against Chevron, originally filed in U.S. federal court in 1993, is
taking place in Ecuador at Chevron`s request. Chevron praised Ecuador`s courts
to have the case moved, but now criticizes those same courts given that the
evidence is stacking up against it, say representatives of the plaintiffs.

&lt;p&gt;Eighty-Three Percent of Respondents Say Goldman Sachs` Stature Has Diminished

More than Half of U.S. Investors Surveyed Say Lloyd Blankfein Will Remain
Chairman of Goldman Sachs
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is being "legitimately scrutinized" by regulators who
sued the firm for fraud based on conduct that many in the industry consider to
be common practice, according to a Bloomberg survey. 

The most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history has suffered the
worst reputational decline among its largest competitors, according to the
global quarterly poll of 1,001 investors and analysts who are Bloomberg
subscribers. Eighty-three percent of respondents said Goldman Sachs`s stature
diminished in the past six months; the next closest were UBS AG, with 27
percent, and Citigroup Inc., at 26 percent. 

Goldman Sachs was sued April 16 by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
said the New York-based company failed to inform investors about the role hedge
fund Paulson &amp; Co. played in both helping to select contracts underlying a
mortgage-linked investment and betting against it. Goldman Sachs has said it did
nothing wrong and is fighting the case. 

Asked for their opinion of the SEC fraud suit, 61 percent of respondents replied
that the firm "is being legitimately scrutinized," while 29 percent answered
that the company "is being unfairly vilified." The remainder were undecided. 

Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the poll.


The full story and poll results are available on Bloomberg.com at: 

http://preview.bloomberg.com/news/2010-06-07/goldman-sachs-deserves-scrutiny-by-regulators-in-bloomberg-subscriber-poll.html.


Views of Goldman Sachs and its outlook were more negative outside the U.S.,
where 69 percent of respondents found the SEC suit to be reasonable, compared
with 48 percent of people polled in the U.S. 

Common Practice 

About three-quarters of the people in all regions who said they thought the
SEC`s case was justifiable also said the alleged behavior is common practice. 

The outlook for Goldman Sachs`s stock and management was more optimistic in the
U.S., where more than half of those polled said Lloyd Blankfein would remain
chairman, compared with 36 percent of non-U.S. respondents who said so. 

Three-quarters of respondents said they believe that Goldman Sachs will settle
the charges, with a plurality of 40 percent saying the issue would then
dissipate, compared with 34 percent who said the damage to the firm would be
lasting. About 34 percent of non-U.S. respondents said they thought the bad
publicity would blow over after the firm settles the suit. 

"There`s a real break between perceptions inside the U.S. and outside the U.S.,"
said J. Ann Selzer, president of Des Moines, Iowa-based Selzer &amp; Co., which
conducted the survey. "If you just look at the U.S. customers, they see these
current troubles as temporary and predict the firm will exit standing tall." 

The quarterly Bloomberg Global Poll of investors, traders and analysts in six
continents was conducted June 2-3. It is based on interviews with a random
sample of 1,001 Bloomberg subscribers, representing decision makers in markets,
finance and economics. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1
percentage points. 

While 36 percent of non-U.S. respondents said they expect Blankfein to remain as
chairman, half of those polled said they didn`t expect any major changes to the
firm`s leadership as a result of the lawsuit. A bigger proportion of U.S.
subscribers, 59 percent, didn`t expect major changes, compared with 44 percent
of people outside the U.S. 

Still, Blankfein was viewed unfavorably by 56 percent of poll respondents,
second only to BP Plc CEO Tony Hayward`s 65 percent among a list of 10 public
figures that included President Barack Obama, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 

Goldman`s stock, which ended New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday
at $138.68, has fallen 25 percent since the suit was filed, and 41 percent of
the people surveyed said they are "generally bullish" on the shares. Forty
percent said they`re "generally bearish." Fifty-four percent of U.S. investors
were bullish, compared with 28 percent in Europe and 43 percent in Asia.

 (Recasts paragraph 1, adds details from FCIC's summary of
subpoena)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - The commission probing the
financial crisis subpoenaed Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
after the bank flooded the panel with 2.5 billion pages of
records, increasing tension in Goldman's relationship with the
U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission Vice Chairman Bill
Thomas said on Monday that Goldman, knowing the panel's limited
resources, had sent staff hunting for a needle in a haystack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect them to provide us with the needle," Thomas
said. The FCIC said it subpoenaed Goldman on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street firm produced 5 terabytes of records, with
each terabyte containing 500 million pages of digitized
records, FCIC Chairman Phil Angelides told reporters on a
conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BREAKINGVIEWS column on Goldman Sachs [ID:nN07206337])&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters Insider story on public perceptions of Goldman:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; link.reuters.com/hur38k&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The commission called Goldman's response "abysmal."
Angelides and Thomas said other banks had received and complied
with similar FCIC requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman spokesman Samuel Robinson said in a statement that
"we have been and continue to be committed to providing the
FCIC with the information they have requested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares fell $3.72, or 2.6 percent, to close at
$138.68 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein was on a panel with
three other bank chiefs that testified before the FCIC in
January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disclosure concerns have followed Goldman in recent months.
It has been criticized for not immediately telling investors
that it received a so-called Wells Notice from the SEC last
September, signaling the possibility of civil charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman in
April for civil fraud in connection with the structuring and
sale of a $1 billion collateralized debt obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCIC's subpoena demanded Goldman produce schedules for
interviews with Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar and Chief Operating Officer Gary
Cohn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The subpoena also requested interviews within 10 days with
Goldman executives with the most knowledge of its ABACUS
transactions, which are the subject of the SEC's charges. It
also requested interviews with executives most knowledgeable
about Goldman's use of credit derivatives and its transactions
with insurer American International Group (AIG.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission also expects Goldman to provide further
documents about its complex debt securities business, including
information on collateralized debt obligations based on
mortgage-backed securities, according to a summary of the
subpoena, released on the FCIC's website on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCIC showed its willingness to use its subpoena power
in April when it demanded that Moody's Corp (MCO.N) comply with
its requests, saying it had failed to produce documents and
executives for interviews in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCIC also used a subpoena to compel Warren Buffett to
testify after the Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) chief
rebuffed earlier requests to submit to voluntary questioning.

&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft clarifies its cloud computing strategy this week at its TechEd conference in New Orleans, president of Microsoft's server and tools business Bob Muglia sat down with CIO.com to share guidance for CIOs considering a move to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before a CIO chooses a cloud provider, be it Microsoft or a Microsoft partner, Google, Amazon or others, there are key questions to ask, such as: How responsive is the cloud company? How much access does the cloud provider offer or deny? What does the cloud provider require of you? How prepared is the cloud provider to answer due-diligence questions about physical security and disaster recovery?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How you find the right cloud provider depends on your business, according to industry analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A manufacturing company isn't going to have the same checklist as a service company or retailer," says Bernard Golden, CEO of cloud consulting firm HyperStratus and CIO.com blogger. "But there is a consistent set of things to look at. Some of them are specific to cloud providers, but a lot of them are the same kinds of things you had to look at in outsourcing or any other service provider contract."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, in its usual fashion, aims to offer cloud options for everyone through a public cloud environment hosted by Redmond itself, or by one of its partners, as well as private cloud technology that sits behind an organization's own firewall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his keynote this morning at TechEd, Muglia stated that more than 40 million customers are paying for cloud services from Microsoft, such as Exchange and SharePoint, across 9,000 business customers and more than 500 government entities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview late last week, Muglia said that, first and foremost, a business needs to think through how much control they want to have over data, the security and compliance needs, as well as the level of customization its environment requires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses also need to know that the cloud isn't an all or nothing proposition. Most companies will adopt a hybrid approach where they keep mission-critical applications on-premise and move workloads like e-mail or CRM to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Burden on Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does cloud computing really mean for Microsoft? Well, it fundamentally changes Redmond's long-standing business model. Instead of building a software products and shipping them to people, Microsoft will also provides a service that must have high availability and high degrees of security and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a 180 degree shift in terms of what we do as an organization, and frankly our relationship with the customer," says Muglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a good way, he stresses. The cloud model will improve on Microsoft's current method by which Redmond delivers a new version of a product and companies deploy it now, in a year or maybe they never deploy it, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It can be frustrating for everyone. The customer says, 'Hey, we want this but it's too much of a pain to upgrade. It's not worth it. I'm not going to bother.' And of course we say, 'You'd be so much better off if you did,'" says Muglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So in that case they are not experiencing what our technology can deliver in terms of productivity improvements and cost savings, and it is not as effective all around for them or us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the cloud, Microsoft creates a contract where the burden of keeping customers seamlessly and compatibly up-to-date is on Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a way, Microsoft has always had to facilitate upgrades, but in the end the onus was on the customer to complete the deployment. The cloud changes that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a profound difference between doing it yourself versus having a vendor provide a service you can just consume," says Muglia. "You won't have to deal with all the hardware and maintenance that you've been throwing dollars and people and time and energy at."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it's a public or private cloud, or a mix of both models, an enterprise must assess its needs and determine which data, applications and workloads need to be on-premise and which are better off in a cloud environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Utilizing a combination of both public and private cloud models, and having the ability to port data between these, is truly maximizing the value and benefits of cloud computing," says Vanessa Alvarez, an industry analyst with Frost  Sullivan. "It's not a question about utilizing one or the other, but about how each model can be leveraged."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're a Microsoft shop today, your cloud options break down like this: You can run a private cloud in your own data center where you will have the most control but will have all the hardware and staff costs; you can use a Microsoft partner for a lower cost, but slightly less control; or you can use Microsoft cloud services run from one of Redmond's data centers for even less cost but since it's a very broad, fixed price environment, the user will have even less control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is the only vendor in the industry offering all three of these choices to our customers," says Muglia. "We're unique in that no other vendor has the same level of experience and expertise in software and services." Of course, Microsoft's cloud rivals, including VMware, Citrix, Cisco, Google and Amazon, would argue otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a business wants to go outside the firewall in a cloud environment, Muglia notes, the main difference between using Microsoft and one of its hosting partners is that a partner's cloud can be customized better to your environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll run your entire infrastructure for you, and we'll give you global scale," he says. "But we're not going to give you every option in the world. If you want to have a set of services that interact specifically with your environment, working with a hosting partner may be a good way to do that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

&lt;p&gt;As the technology industry moves toward the cloud, users can ease the transition by adopting a hybrid computing model, said Bob Muglia, Microsoft's president of servers and tools, at the kickoff keynote speech at the company's TechEd 2010 event in New Orleans Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're at the cusp of a major transformation in the industry called cloud computing. It will affect us all. But to get there it will require a lot of execution and changes," he said.

Today there is a lot of work you're doing inside your environment that could be delivered as a service."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft has been criticized for coming late to the cloud computing party, the company seems to be taking the home-field&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;advantage, namely by extending its already existing software to run or manage applications on Windows Azure or other .Net cloud offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft's own cloud service, Azure, was mentioned here, the emphasis remains with software products that are becoming increasingly cloud-enabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are thousands of applications already built," Muglia said in a press conference after his keynote, adding that Microsoft is hoping that customers will see the benefit of running some of these applications in a cloud, be it in Microsoft's Azure cloud, a private cloud or a .Net cloud offered by one of Microsoft's partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the tools he highlighted during the keynote are Microsoft Systems Center, Visual Studio 2010, software from the 2009 Opalis acquisition and Windows Phone 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Systems Center, administrators will be able to manage copies of SQL Server that reside both on local machines and in the cloud. With the new version 4 of .Net,  made available this week, developers can specify if they want the application they are creating to run on the cloud or internally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most-talked-about technology was the Opalis software, which will be included with Systems Center. With this software, administrators can break services down into individual components, including the operating system, the database, the server OS and the middleware. This will allow them to update an operating system, for instance, even while the program is running. It will also allow the administrator to specify a range of instances that can run of each service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Opalis provides a very general-purpose engine that can orchestrate processes within IT," Muglia said. He noted it can work not only with Windows clients, but with Unix and Linux ones as well. It also works well with Microsoft PowerShell, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muglia also demonstrated how Windows Phone 7 will work in this environment. The new interface of Windows Phone 7 will be composed of tiles, with each tile leading to a particular application or service. Users can mix work applications, such as e-mail, and home applications, such as Zune music. The company's mobile OS, meanwhile, can tie seamlessly with Exchange, synchronizing all the e-mail messages and their flags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mobile OS will also be able to be a full participant in a Microsoft SharePoint environment. Users can call up documents, make edits and have them committed back to the SharePoint instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muglia also noted that the first service packs for Windows 2008 release 2 and Windows 7 will be available in July. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the press conference, Muglia admitted that the present versions of Microsoft applications on Azure, such as Windows Azure and SQL Azure, do not have all the capabilities of the standard software editions. For instance, the SQL Services management console is not available on Azure. Feature parity will be coming in the future, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're working hard on Azure," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial
Mortgage Securities Trust commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series
2010-C1. 

Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Loss Severity ratings as
follows: 

--$416,124,000 class A-1 'AAA/LS1';
--$131,283,000 class A-2 'AAALS1';
--$61,488,000 class A-3 'AAA/LS1';
--$608,895,000* class X-A 'AAA';
--$107,452,454* class X-B 'NR';
--$16,118,000 class B 'AA/LS3';
--$26,863,000 class C 'A-/LS3';
--$14,327,000 class D 'BBB/LS3';
--$16,117,000 class E 'BBB-/LS4';
--$8,955,000 class F 'BB/LS4';
--$7,163,000 class G 'B+/LS4';
--$6,268,000 class H 'B-/LS4';
--$11,641,454 class NR 'NR'. 

*Notional amount and interest only. 

The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as of June
3, 2010. 

The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, primary assets
of which are 36 loans secured by 96 commercial properties having an aggregate
principal balance of approximately $716.3 million as of the cutoff date. The
loans were originated by JP Morgan Chase Bank National Association and Ladder
Capital Finance LLC. 

Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, including
site inspections on 65.8% of the properties by balance, cash flow analysis of
88.3% of the pool and asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool. 

The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.37
times (x) and a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 62.4%. This compares
favorably to Fitch rated conduit transactions of 2007 which had average Fitch
DSCR and LTV of 1.05x and 110.7%, respectively. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow
represents a variance of 4.3% to issuer cash flows and 15.9% below full-year
2009 net operating income. 

The transaction is concentrated by loan and sponsor. The largest 10 loans
account for 55.1% of the pool and the largest 15 account for 68.5%.
Additionally, 13 loans to Inland Realty Trust and affiliates account for 37% of
the pool. 

The Master Servicer and Special Servicer will be Midland Loan Services, Inc.
(rated 'CMS1/CSS1' by Fitch).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The trillion dollar U.S. high-yield bond market, hurt by a recent sell-off, could recover and return more than 8 percent this year, Andy O'Brien, co-head of the syndicated leveraged finance group at JPMorgan, said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At some point you look at what are the investment alternatives out there," O'Brien said at the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit in New York. Despite the slow-growth economic environment, defaults will fall and more investors will look at high-yield as an attractive asset class, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widening concerns about a European debt crisis derailed a 14-month U.S. junk bond rally last month, with investment losses totaling about 3.5 percent in May. New junk bond sales slowed to a trickle and several planned sales were pulled as demand for risky assets cooled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, O'Brien said he is bullish on the North American economic environment, and coupons remain high on junk bonds, which will result in positive returns for the year. While economic growth may be modest, it will not slow enough to push more companies into default, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The growth rate may be a little lower but I think it will be sufficient enough to keep companies performing," he said. "We were projecting a 2 to 4 percent default rate" and still do, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. junk bond default rate peaked at nearly 14 percent in November, according to Moody's Investors Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's research staff has estimated that returns on high-yield bonds could be as high as 12 percent this year. Year to date, junk bonds are up about 3.3 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Brien expects high-yield bond issuance to top last year's levels as companies refinance debt and fund mergers and acquisitions. "I think we will see a steady stream of quality transactions," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While leveraged loan issuance has slowed in recent weeks, JPMorgan remains active in loans, where it holds a portion of the loans it underwrites. "We continue to be aggressively providing capital to corporates," said O'Brien, who sits on JPMorgan's balance sheet committee, which determines how the company commits its own capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the top underwriter of high-yield bonds last year and in the first quarter, is forecasting about $200 billion in high-yield bond issuance in 2010, versus $180 billion in 2009. Year-to-date about $120 billion has been sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to see real money accounts see value in the credit markets, either in investment grade market or high yield," O'Brien said. With the direction of the stock market uncertain and money markets yielding zero to 1 percent, "you're going to want to put credit into your portfolio," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dena Aubin and Al Yoon; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

IBM Wins Big Deal in India

Technology giant International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) announced a
10-year, multi-million dollar agreement with India-based ElectraCard Services
(ECS), a leading provider of software solutions for electronic payment systems. 

Under the terms of agreement, IBM will provide technical support for ECS's
disaster recovery infrastructure, giving ECS the scope to focus on core business
while lessening its capital expenditures. 

Armed with IBM`s solution support, ECS`s electra solution suite will enable its
clients, including State Bank of India, Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB), Life Insurance
Corporation of India, Corporation Bank, and many other leading private national
and international banks to better manage their growing customer base. 

The growth trends in e-commerce or online payments indicate a shift in consumer
preference towards more transparent and flexible payment solutions. We feel more
companies like ECS will find it easier to delegate responsibilities to IBM for
its domain expertise and technology competence with regard to scalability and
security, paving the way for recurring revenue growth. 

Recently, IBM took another step towards expanding its software portfolio by
entering into a joint venture with five other tech giants. The company joined
with ARM Holdings Plc (Nasdaq: ARMH), Samsung Electronics Co., Texas Instruments
Inc. (NYSE: TXN), Freescale Semiconductor Inc. and ST-Ericsson to form a
non-profit company, Linaro. 

The newly-formed company will facilitate the speedy development of Linux-based
software compatible with ARM designs for mobile phones, tablet PCs and other
hybrid products. 

This initiative is expected to be of significance to IBM, as the company will be
able to take a larger share in the wireless market, thereby increasing
competition to tech giants such as Microsoft Corp (Nasdaq: MSFT), which are
looking to move beyond their traditional personal computing market.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today said that it would ship a public beta of Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) in July, but did not set a release date during the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company made the announcement from TechEd, the Microsoft IT and developer conference that kicked off Monday in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft acknowledged it was working on a service pack for its newest operating system in March, but at the time declined to discuss timeline for delivering a public preview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's timetable for Windows 7 SP1 is ahead of Vista's schedule by approximately two months. In 2007, Microsoft seeded an invite-only group of testers with an early build of Vista SP1 in September, but didn't offer a build to the general public until December , 11 months after that operating system's release to retail. Windows 7 SP1 is slated to appear nine months after the debut of that OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Microsoft repeated what it said in March, that Windows 7 SP1 will not include any new features. "SP1 will not contain any new features that are specific to Windows 7 itself," said Gavriella Schuster, senior director of the Windows commercial product management group, in a post to a Microsoft company blog on Monday. "For Windows 7, SP1 will simply be the combination of updates already available through Windows Update and additional hotfixes based on feedback by our customers and partners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most notable addition to SP1 will be an updated Remote Desktop client designed to work with RemoteFX, the new remote-access platform set to debut in SP1 for Windows Server 2008 R2, which will also reach public beta next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 will also include a feature dubbed "Dynamic Memory," which lets IT staff adjust guest virtual machines' memory on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft adheres to Vista's schedule, the final build of Windows 7 SP1 should be available before the end of the year -- perhaps as soon as November -- making good on the delivery date revealed by a Malaysian Web site in early March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, TechARP.com , which has accurately called service pack schedules for several editions of Windows, said that while sources had originally pegged a 22-month development schedule for Windows 7 SP1, Microsoft had changed its mind and moved up the service pack ship date to the fourth quarter of 2010 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time she announced the upcoming public beta of Windows 7 SP1, Schuster downplayed its importance. "Customers can feel confident about deploying Windows 7 now," she said, citing analysts' recommendations that enterprise customers need not wait for SP1 -- as some have done historically -- before deploying the new OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Al Gillen, an analyst with IDC, called Windows 7 SP1 an "important milestone," but added that it would have little impact on corporate migrations. "Historically, classic customer deployment behavior for new Windows client operating systems was to wait for the first service pack to arrive," Gillen said in a research note published in May. "[But] the Windows patching process ... has changed the rules of the game for many customers. The continuous stream of patches, over time, delivers a significant portion of service pack content."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gillen's comments echoed opinions expressed earlier by other analysts, including Michael Cherry of Directions on Microsoft and Diane Hagglund of Dimensional Research, who both had said the rapid adoption of Windows 7 made SP1 as a business deployment milestone mostly moot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More important than Windows 7 SP1 itself, Gillen said last month, was that its appearance marks the end of downgrade rights from Windows 7 Professional to the older Windows XP Professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downgrade rights from Windows 7 to XP are to end in late April 2011 or when Microsoft launches Windows 7 SP1, whichever comes first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also delivered a beta of Exchange Server 2010 SP1 today. Previously, the company has said the final of its next mail server software would release before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchange Server 2010 SP1 can be downloaded from the Microsoft site .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;IBM has expanded the scope of its annual conference for Rational Software users, which kicks off on Monday in Orlando, renaming the event IBM Innovate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We've broadened the focus and the theme of this conference to be one of innovation," said Scott Hebner, vice president of Rational marketing and strategy. "It's not just about IT applications anymore. It's about the software-driven innovation agenda that many customers are putting in place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference, which had been simply called the Rational Software Conference, will incorporate not only material about the Rational product line, but also other IBM products and services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, software is becoming more of an essential part of all organizations, especially in new products and services they deliver, Hebner said. Think of automobiles, treadmills, coffee machines, medical devices -- all use software. For most organizations, "software is becoming the key ingredient that is driving innovation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You see companies that are reaping the benefits of using software to drive really innovative products and services," Hebner said. "You need to build a strong competency in software. Otherwise, you're not going to be as successful as you could be in this field." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the 13th year for the conference, which started out for users of the Rational Software Architect. IBM purchased the maker of the system design software, Rational Software, in 2003. This year's attendance is expected to be around 4,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary audience at previous conferences was design architects, developers and other users of the Rational product line. Now, the desired demographic is "anyone who has the responsibility of designing, delivering and subsequently managing a product," Hebner said. This could include product designers and managers to CIOs and other senior executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keynotes will include IBM Senior Vice President John Iwata, who spearheaded IBM's "Smarter Planet" campaign; IBM Vice President Steve Mills, who runs the company's US$24 million software business; Segway inventor Dean Kamen; and IBM fellow Grady Booch, who co-developed the Unified Modeling Language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM will also announce a number of new offerings at the conference. The company will unveil a set of best practices and integrated software, called Integrated Product Management. This offering will help product manufacturing companies expedite their development processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM will also unveil a new form of software licensing model that will allow users to lease Rational software for limited periods of time, which can be less expensive than purchasing the software outright. These tools will be made available through the company's cloud offering. The company has already made some Rational tools available through a cloud offering, and the range of tools will soon be expanded to include most all of the Rational line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, IBM holds five major conferences each year. In addition to Innovate there is also LotusSphere, which focuses on collaboration and workforce productivity; Pulse, which is aimed at the IT operations team; Impact, which is focused on IT strategy and how it fits into business processes; and Information On Demand, which is about using analytics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will feature on Monday an upgrade to its Expression toolset for application design that includes search engine optimization capabilities. But the toolset will not back a video codec being promoted by Google as key to an open media format effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Expression Studio 4 includes tools for designers and developers to collaborate and build user interfaces for the Web, desktop, and devices. Featured among the three configurations of the suite are the following Expression tools: Web, for Web design; Blend, for UI design; Encoder, for video encoding; and Design, a tool for for building UI elements or graphics to be imported into the Web or Blend tools. Expression Web features SuperPreview, a browser compatibility tester. SketchFlow, a prototyping capability, can be used with Blend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ See the InfoWorld Test Center review of Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, which Microsoft says is a companion to Expression. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expression Web in Expression Studio 4 addresses the issue of getting visibility on search engines, said Jon Harris, senior product manager for Expression Studio. "It's almost like a black art" to get this visibility, he said. "The Web team has built a search engine optimization program" to look at application design and code and make suggestions on changes that could enhance search engine optimization, Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expression Web also offers an extensibility model to build add-ins with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new version of Encoder, called Expression Encoder Pro 4, enhances publishing of video to Microsoft's Silverlight rich Internet plug-in platform and backs the latest H.264 video codec capabilities, enabling higher-quality video. But it does not support the VP8 codec being promoted by Google for industrywide usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VP8 is an older codec, lower quality," Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What Encoder is about is delivering the highest-quality video at the lowest bit rate possible," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, Google touted the open source VP8 codec as part of its WebM initiative for an open media format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expression Blend 4 supports Silverlight 4 and .Net Framework 4. It also is compatible with the Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 IDE. Blend 4 features enhanced Adobe Photoshop import capabilities, including layer effects, new and conditional behaviors, enhanced sample data, and Pixel Shader effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expression has accommodated designer-developer workflows at application developer Cynergy Systems, said Dave Wolf, vice president of strategy at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's been great about Expression is that it's really built to suit those workflows. It works the way we work, and it lets us do what we do best with the tools we use every day, even when those aren't Microsoft tools, like Photoshop," Wolf said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expression can serve as a companion to Visual Studio, although Harris acknowledged some overlap, such as coding and design capabilities. But Expression is geared to designers while Visual Studio is focused on coding and debugging, Harris explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expression Studio 4 comes in three versions, including Ultimate, which features Blend with SketchFlow; Web with SuperPreview; Encoder Pro; and Design. Ultimate is geared to professional Web designers and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Expression Studio 4 Premium configuration features Blend; Web with SuperPreview; Encoder; and Design. Expression Studio 4 Web Professional includes Web with SuperPreview, Encoder, and Design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is offering upgrades to Expression 4 at no additional cost to Expression 3 suite owners, in recognition that Expression 3 came out only nine months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not provide pricing for the Premium edition; it is available only through participation in programs such as MSDN Premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, "Microsoft upgrades Expression toolset with search engine optimization," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Securities is selling
the largest new commercial mortgage-backed securities offering
since issuance in the CMBS market began to recover late last
year with its upcoming $716.3 million conduit sale in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The deal, dubbed JPMCC 2010-C1," is backed by 36 fixed-rate
commercial mortgage loans secured by 96 properties. Retail
properties comprise the largest component of the group followed
by industrial and office space. JP Morgan Chase Bank loans
comprise 76.4 percent of the deal, while 21.6 percent of loans
come from Ladder Capital Finance, market sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal would be just the second so-called conduit issue
to hit the recovering market that provides credit for office,
retail and apartment buildings. The conduit deal is seen as a
key gauge of risk appetite for securities tied to the troubled
commercial real estate market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recently, banks have more actively been able to cobble
together loans from several borrowers for multi-loan CMBS
issues. The lending is a hopeful sign for a market whose
absence led to soaring defaults and the risk of hundreds more
with maturing loans finding few outlets for refinancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CMBS conduits were among the most important engines for
growth of the CMBS market during the real estate boom. By 2007,
competition for assets grew at a feverish pace, contributing to
economic growth but also the weaker underwriting standards
responsible for some of the worst loans today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, RBS priced a $309.7 million CMBS backed by
multiple loans, the first sale of its kind in nearly two years
and a benchmark for the recovering CMBS market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest JPMorgan conduit sale is more than twice the
size of April's deal and is yet another positive step toward
recovery for the CMBS market, which continues to evolve from
just single-borrower transactions as investor confidence
builds. Three single-borrower deals were sold in the CMBS
market in December 2009 as the market began to return to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's CMBS conduit sale includes $416.1 million of a 
AAA-rated 4.53-year class, a $131.3 million AAA-rated 6.76-year
tranche and a $61.5 million of a AAA-rated 9.53-year tranche.
The offering also includes AA-rated, A-rated and BBB-rated
classes with a 9.98-year maturity. The sale is expected to
price in mid-June, sources said.

&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is testing the commercial viability of algae biofuel as an alternative energy source to supplement oil and natural gas, a senior executive said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although oil, coal and natural gas are expected to represent about 80 percent of global energy supply mix through 2030, nuclear and renewable energy such as wind, solar, geothermal and biofuels will play a significant role, ExxonMobil's senior vice president Andrew Swiger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global energy demand is expected to rise by almost 35 percent by 2030, from 2005 levels, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are testing the hypothesis that algae biofuels could become commercially viable and achieve sufficient scale to make meaningful contribution to the future energy mix," he told the Asia Oil and Gas Conference in the Malaysian capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunlight and carbon dioxide used to grow the algae could also mitigate the effect of greenhouse gases, while algae has the potential to produce large volumes of oils that can be processed in existing refineries to make fuels compatible with existing transportation technology and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is early days in this research, and the obstacles we face are formidable, but the potential is great," Swiger added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Exxon currently has an interest in 4,900 megawatts of cogeneration capacity at more than 30 sites worldwide. New facilities under construction in Singapore will boost that capacity to more than 5,000 megawatts by next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiger also said that ExxonMobil will not delay the start up of its new petrochemical plant in Singapore despite the glut in ethylene supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are into long-term investments. The petrochemical industry goes through many cycles. We cannot predict the cycles, Swiger told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will start our plant as scheduled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multibillion-dollar ethylene cracker on Singapore's Jurong Island has a capacity of 1 million tonnes per year (tpy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechanical completion and start-up activities of the new facilities will be in phases beginning late 2010 through 2011, the company had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The petrochemical market is starting to feel the pressure of additional ethylene coming on line, traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore and India will add 6.3 million tonnes of ethylene capacity, taking the region's total to 48.33 million tonnes per year (tpy). China will account for more than a third of the additions, reducing its need for imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell has already brought its 800,000-tpy cracker online in March, as did Thailand, where the Map Ta Phut Olefins Co had started a 900,000-tpy cracker around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jennifer Tan and Seng Li Peng; editing by Ramthan Hussain)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DataCore Software Highlights Real-world DataCore + Microsoft Successes that Go
Beyond Servers and Desktops to Virtualize Storage
NEW ORLEANS &amp; FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
DataCore Software, a leading provider of virtualization software for storage,
today highlighted a number of customers that have deployed Microsoft solutions -
including Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 with Hyper-V and Microsoft Cluster
Servers, among others - in conjunction with a virtualized storage infrastructure
powered by DataCore Software. 

A sampling of customers, ranging in size, using both DataCore and Microsoft in
virtualization infrastructures includes health network Continuum Health Partners
(www.datacore.com/continuum), floral distributor Northwest Wholesale Florists
(www.datacore.com/NWF), and law firm McNamee, Lochner, Titus &amp; Williams
(www.datacore.com/mcnamee). These companies are but a small sample of the tens
of thousands of organizations worldwide using DataCore virtualization solutions.


At Tech-Ed 2010 - Metro Clustering Using Microsoft and DataCore

Onsite at the DataCore booth (#442), executives from Continuum Health Partners
("Continuum") will be present to describe how DataCore virtualization software
has been deployed to manage storage across metro clusters at Continuum, whereby
it affords multi-site data protection and failover. The Continuum
representatives present will include IT Director Jill Wojcik and Interim CIO
Mark Moroses. 

Continuum, like many health networks, was faced with the challenge of making
their diverse storage infrastructure available around the clock, across multiple
locations. To meet this challenge, DataCore`s SANsymphony storage virtualization
software is running as metro clusters at two hospitals that are part of the
Continuum Health Partners network (Beth Israel Medical Center and Roosevelt
Hospital in New York), ensuring business continuity and overcoming downtime and
unavailability of data. 

"DataCore storage virtualization software is the key to the virtualization
puzzle - offering the flexible storage virtualization dimension needed for any
virtualization project - and serving as the perfect complement to server
virtualization as well as the perfect enhancement to storage hardware," noted
Jill Wojcik, IT Director, Continuum Health Partners. 

The bottom-line for this customer is that DataCore makes metro clusters
possible. DataCore software runs at each hospital and communicates with its
mirrored counterpart at the central data center, where the rest of the
organizations` data is also stored. Either of these installations can
automatically fail-over to the other "hot site." 

Microsoft solutions running on the DataCore virtualized infrastructure at
Continuum include: Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2, Microsoft System Center
Configuration Manager (SCCM), Microsoft SQL Server, and Microsoft Cluster
Servers (MSCSs). In total, DataCore SANsymphony software virtualizes and manages
well over 200 TBs (collectively) for the various hospitals in the Continuum
network. The environment supports a community of 14,000 users using over
five-hundred (500) servers. For a more in-depth Case Study on this deployment,
please visit: www.datacore.com/continuum. 

DataCore and Microsoft Hyper-V Combine Server and Storage Virtualization with
Live Migration Functionality

Based in Seattle, Washington, Northwest Wholesale Florists (NWF) is one of the
oldest and most respected wholesalers of floral and floral-related products in
the Northwest. According to Doug Otani, General Manager, Northwest Wholesale
Florists, "Our IT environment is now comprised of a virtual infrastructure
whereby DataCore is deployed in conjunction with a clustered Hyper-V system.
With a Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V cluster, our company now has the ability
to live migrate our virtual machines (VMs). Because these VMs can "live migrate"
between the two hosts, the DataCore-Hyper-V virtual infrastructure minimizes and
even eliminates downtime - when we need to do system maintenance." 

Scott Gorcester, President, Moose Logic, a solutions provider and DataCore
partner in the Pacific Northwest, who assured the management team at NWF that
the Windows 2008 Server with Hyper-V was the right way to go, added, "The
bottom-line is that with the DataCore and Windows 2008 Server R2 with Hyper-V
environment, NWF can weather multiple equipment failures and continue to run its
business, which ultimately provides peace of mind because the virtual
infrastructure avoids unnecessary downtime."

&lt;p&gt;  NEW ORLEANS, LA, Jun 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
MICROSOFT TECHED NORTH AMERICA 2010, Booth #1830 -- Xiotech Corporation
today announced that the company's Intelligent Storage Element (ISE(TM))
technology delivered outstanding performance in a series of tests
simulating medium- to large-sized Microsoft Exchange 2007 customer
environments. The results were announced in conjunction with Microsoft
TechEd North America 2010, taking place this week in New Orleans.

    Within the Microsoft Exchange Solution Reviewed Program (ESRP) - Storage
v2.1 framework, Xiotech conducted tests of three distinct storage
systems, each based on its Emprise(TM) 5000. The Emprise 5000 sustained
5,000, 8,000 and 10,000 mailboxes on a single Microsoft Exchange 2007
Server with very heavy user profiles and storage utilization capacity
rates of more than 90 percent. At the 10,000 user level, the results were
achieved in a 3U (5.25 inches) rack. This is in contrast to other systems
tested that required as much as 9U or more.

    "Our objective was to demonstrate that the Emprise 5000 provides the
essential, flexible foundation of a high-performance, low cost,
low-complexity solution, which simplifies storage deployment and
management," said Steve Sicola, Chief Technology Officer at Xiotech. "The
ESRP results underscore a compelling value-add of ISE: it can support
Exchange 2007 in heavy user environments and offer performance unmatched
by, and in a form-factor occupying a smaller data center footprint than,
other storage solutions while allowing complete utilization of storage
capacity."

    With ISE at its core, the Emprise 5000 is a storage blade that delivers
high performance, availability, linear scalability and extremely low
total cost of ownership (TCO). Because Emprise 5000 utilizes sealed
DataPacs rather than individual disk drives, each system provides the
processing power of 20 to 40 disk drives in just 3U, or 5.25 inches of
vertical rack space. And unlike traditional storage systems, Emprise's
patented technology allows the DataPacs to deliver even, predictable
performance, even at 90 percent capacity. The result: a purebred
performance solution devoid of the bottlenecks that so typically plague
current storage architectures. 

    The ESRP - Storage is a Microsoft Exchange Server program designed to
facilitate third-party storage testing and solution publishing for
Exchange Server. Customers can use the solutions published to help
plan/design their own Exchange storage architectures. For complete

&lt;p&gt;  NEW ORLEANS, LA, Jun 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
MICROSOFT TECHED NORTH AMERICA 2010, Booth #1830 -- Xiotech Corporation
today announced that the company's Intelligent Storage Element (ISE(TM))
technology delivered outstanding performance in a series of tests
simulating medium- to large-sized Microsoft Exchange 2007 customer
environments. The results were announced in conjunction with Microsoft
TechEd North America 2010, taking place this week in New Orleans.

    Within the Microsoft Exchange Solution Reviewed Program (ESRP) - Storage
v2.1 framework, Xiotech conducted tests of three distinct storage
systems, each based on its Emprise(TM) 5000. The Emprise 5000 sustained
5,000, 8,000 and 10,000 mailboxes on a single Microsoft Exchange 2007
Server with very heavy user profiles and storage utilization capacity
rates of more than 90 percent. At the 10,000 user level, the results were
achieved in a 3U (5.25 inches) rack. This is in contrast to other systems
tested that required as much as 9U or more.

    "Our objective was to demonstrate that the Emprise 5000 provides the
essential, flexible foundation of a high-performance, low cost,
low-complexity solution, which simplifies storage deployment and
management," said Steve Sicola, Chief Technology Officer at Xiotech. "The
ESRP results underscore a compelling value-add of ISE: it can support
Exchange 2007 in heavy user environments and offer performance unmatched
by, and in a form-factor occupying a smaller data center footprint than,
other storage solutions while allowing complete utilization of storage
capacity."

    With ISE at its core, the Emprise 5000 is a storage blade that delivers
high performance, availability, linear scalability and extremely low
total cost of ownership (TCO). Because Emprise 5000 utilizes sealed
DataPacs rather than individual disk drives, each system provides the
processing power of 20 to 40 disk drives in just 3U, or 5.25 inches of
vertical rack space. And unlike traditional storage systems, Emprise's
patented technology allows the DataPacs to deliver even, predictable
performance, even at 90 percent capacity. The result: a purebred
performance solution devoid of the bottlenecks that so typically plague
current storage architectures. 

    The ESRP - Storage is a Microsoft Exchange Server program designed to
facilitate third-party storage testing and solution publishing for
Exchange Server. Customers can use the solutions published to help
plan/design their own Exchange storage architectures. For complete

&lt;p&gt;Company to provide strategic overview and updated fiscal 2010 guidance
MIAMI--(Business Wire)--
Please replace the release with the following corrected version due to multiple
revisions. 

The corrected release reads: 

BURGER KING HOLDINGS, INC. TO PRESENT TODAY AT GOLDMAN SACHS LODGING, GAMING,
RESTAURANT &amp; LEISURE CONFERENCE

Burger King Holdings, Inc., (NYSE:BKC) will present at the Goldman Sachs
Lodging, Gaming, Restaurant &amp; Leisure Conference today at the Goldman Sachs
Conference Center, located at 32 Old Slip, New York, NY beginning at 2:30 p.m.
ET. The presentation will be webcast live via the company's investor relations
Web site at http://investor.bk.com and at
http://cc.talkpoint.com/gold006/060710a_mg/?entity=9_FS5MR0G. 

Amy Wagner, senior vice president, investor relations and global communications,
will present the company's strategic overview and will discuss the updated
fiscal 2010 guidance. The company maintains its expectations for fiscal 2010
guidance with the exception of worldwide net restaurant growth and the effect of
currency translation on its results. 

Fiscal 2010 net restaurant growth is now expected to be 230 to 250 due to the
brand`s exit from the Israel market, representing 55 restaurants, based on a May
2010 agreement entered into between the company and its Israeli franchisee.
Excluding the closure of these restaurants, the company`s fiscal 2010 net
restaurant growth would have been at the higher end of the previously guided 250
to 300 range. These restaurant closures do not affect the company`s present
plans for growth in Europe and elsewhere in the Middle East and the company
remains wholly committed to growing the brand in these regions. 

Given current currency exchange rates, currency translation for the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2010 is now expected to have an unfavorable impact to revenues
resulting in a $0.01 to $0.02 negative effect on diluted earnings per share
(EPS). This compares to the previously provided guidance of a positive currency
translation impact on diluted EPS in the fourth quarter, resulting in a slightly
positive currency translation impact on full fiscal year diluted EPS. As a
result, for the full 2010 fiscal year, the company now expects the effect of
currency translation on diluted EPSto be neutral to slightly negative. 

For a complete listing of the guidance and assumptions upon which such guidance
was made refer to the company's Forms 8-K filed on August 25, 2009, October 29,
2009, February 4, 2010 and April 29, 2010. 

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements made in this press release that reflect management's
expectations regarding future events are forward-looking in nature, including
statements regarding the company's belief and expectations about net restaurant
growth for fiscal 2010 and the impact of the company`s exit from the Israel
market; its belief and expectations regarding the growth of the brand in Europe
and elsewhere in the Middle East; and its belief and expectations regarding
currency translation for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2010,
including the impact of currency translation on diluted earnings per share for
both periods. These forward-looking statements are only predictions based on our
current expectations and projections about future events. Important factors
could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or
implied by these forward-looking statements, including those risk factors set
forth in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the following: (i) our ability to successfully implement our
international growth strategy and risks related to our international operations;
and (ii) risks arising from the significant and rapid fluctuations in currency
exchange markets. 

Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements
are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results. Moreover, neither we nor any
other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of
these forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking
statements as predictions of future events. We do not undertake any
responsibility to update any of these forward-looking statements to conform our
prior statements to actual results or revised expectations.

&lt;p&gt;Integration leverages Microsoft BI platform to deliver self-service, ad-hoc
analytic capabilities to non-technical business workers
EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn.--(Business Wire)--
SwiftKnowledge, LLC, a global provider of web-based business intelligence (BI)
software, announced today it will demonstrate a new Microsoft&#174; SharePoint&#174;
integration at the 2010 Microsoft TechEd/Business Intelligence Conference, being
held June 7-10, 2010 in New Orleans, La. SwiftKnowledge is exhibiting in booth
#2624 at the event. 

The new SharePoint integration became available in April as part of
SwiftKnowledge`s Version 9 product release. Version 9 builds upon
SwiftKnowledge`s enduring mission and philosophy of extending easy-to-use yet
powerful reporting and analysis tools to non-technical, frontline workers, so
they can gain more insight into information and make better decisions. The
company`s 100 percent web-based technology offers breakthrough usability and
robust analytic capabilities via an integrated, single-product code base;
patented performance and a data packet engine that accelerate queries and
promote self-service BI; and patented, cell-based security that provides true
data and feature/functionality granularity without sacrificing control or
performance. 

Via the new integration, SwiftKnowledge customers can merge SwiftKnowledge
reports and BI functionality - including drill-down, filtering and drag-and-drop
- in Microsoft SharePoint, enabling SharePoint users to access ad-hoc reporting
and analytic capabilities through their familiar SharePoint portal interface. 

"Dan Moloney, Ph.D. and I founded SwiftKnowledge specifically to resolve the
unaddressed need for frontline employees to quickly perform their own
interactive, ad-hoc business analyses from familiar desktop and web
environments, from anywhere, at anytime," said Allie Gentry, chief technology
officer for SwiftKnowledge. "Microsoft is the recognized leader in desktop
applications; we`re excited to offer SharePoint users a flexible tool that
adapts to their tendencies and needs, and helps them easily, intuitively analyze
their data without needing assistance from power users or business analysts." 

SwiftKnowledge leverages a Microsoft SQL Server&#8482; 2008 R2 Analysis Services data
infrastructure to power a new era of BI applications that deliver an ad-hoc
analysis experience to users in web time via a zero-footprint web deployment.
SwiftKnowledge`s speed and simplicity put users in control, allowing them to
perform ad-hoc analysis without the traditional dependence on expensive BI
customization and support specialists. The technology`s "mashboard" mashup
functionality combines structured data with unstructured content - including web
pages, Web 2.0 content and YouTube videos - and its tabbed dashboards provide a
familiar web experience, and are easy to create and customize. 

In addition, users can easily share the configurable views and analyses they
create with other employees, without needing additional downloads or software
licenses. Power users and business analysts can quickly develop reports by using
SwiftKnowledge`s web-based authoring - rather than client-side software - and
they also can leverage SwiftKnowledge`s predictive modeling and data mining
capabilities to develop advanced BI applications, such as a product
recommendation engine based upon customer profiles. 

SwiftKnowledge is currently participating in the Microsoft Front Runner early
adoption program for Microsoft Office 2010, SharePoint 2010, SQL Server 2008 R2,
Windows 7, Windows Azure and Windows Server 2008 R2. The Front Runner program is
designed to help independent software vendors (ISVs) ensure their applications
are compatible with the latest Microsoft technologies, then assist them with
subsequent product development, testing and marketing.

&lt;p&gt;Company enhances Double-Take&#174; Availability functionality for Windows Server 2008
Hyper-V and Exchange 2010 and integration with Microsoft Systems Center
SOUTHBOROUGH, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Double-Take&#174; Software (NASDAQ: DBTK) announced today that it has created new
integration capabilities for Microsoft management systems, including Microsoft`s
System Center Operations Manager and System Center Virtual Machine Manager,
delivering federated application availability and recovery capabilities across
the entire scope of Microsoft`s infrastructure. At this year`s Microsoft
Tech&#183;Ed, IT managers will be able to see first-hand how these new levels of
integration, with a focus on Exchange 2010 and Window Server 2008 Hyper-V, will
allow a company to maintain application uptime and perform simplified recoveries
with just one solution by using Double-Take Availability. 

"Microsoft platforms are a clear choice for the vast majority of our customers,"
said Christian Tate, vice president of worldwide marketing at Double-Take
Software. "We`re pleased to offer those customers peace of mind in knowing that
they`ll always be able to maintain application availability and uptime and keep
employees productive by providing them with `one tool` that makes achieving this
goal easy . We feel that this approach is both unique in the market and provides
real business value to our customers." 

Double-Take Software has observed an accelerated adoption of Hyper-V and a
strong conversion to the next evolution of unified communications with Exchange
2010. With this announcement, IT managers should feel secure that they can
implement technology from Microsoft and keep it available and connected at all
times with solutions from Double-Take Software. Without an easy-to-use "one
tool" approach, companies are forced to make tradeoffs between expensive and
complex options or running the risk of downtime. Not only does Double-Take
Availability protect a company`s infrastructure, but as a "one tool" solution it
also provides availability and uptime for the full spectrum of applications
provided by Microsoft, including SharePoint, SQL Server and Dynamics. 

Double-Take Software has also extended its management support for Microsoft
System Center Operations Manager users by integrating the Double-Take
Availability management console with Operations Manager for a simplified user
experience. The Double-Take Availability management pack provides users with
information on any Double-Take Availability "events," including explanations of
each event, probable causes, and suggestions for what to do next. 

In addition, Double-Take Software now provides users with integration
capabilities within the System Center Virtual Machine Manager module, which
helps IT managers visualize and manage their virtual machines, through a new
PROTip for Hyper-V virtual machines being protected with Double-Take
Availability Virtual Host Edition. This PROTip will notify the Virtual Machine
Manager user if the virtual machine is in a failover state and initiate failover
of that virtual machine with a simple click, all within the Virtual Machine
Manager console. 

"As the adoption of Hyper-V accelerates in the marketplace, we see great
customer value in working with Double-Take Software, helping customers protect
their data and applications in smart and efficient ways," said Jim Schwartz,
director of Solutions Marketing, Virtualization at Microsoft Corp. "Together, we
are bringing our customers strong solutions for their everyday IT needs."

&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS--(Business Wire)--
Emulex Corporation (NYSE:ELX) will demonstrate the benefits of leveraging Emulex
OneSecure adapters and EMC PowerPath Encryption with RSA at Microsoft Tech-Ed in
New Orleans, June 7-10, 2010. 

Emulex is showcasing its OneSecure adapter, an 8Gb/s Fibre Channel encryption
Host Bus Adapter (HBA) that provides high-performance, affordable,
hardware-based encryption. Emulex OneSecure adapters protect data on the wire
and at-rest, encrypting data throughout the data lifecycle without impacting
application performance. The security solution being demonstrated combines
Emulex OneSecure adapters and EMC PowerPath Encryption with RSA running SQL
Server 2008 R2 on Windows Server 2008 R2. 

This combination delivers a complete security solution for Fibre
Channel-connected hosts, which encrypts data without sacrificing server
performance, system uptime or stability for high workload data center
environments. By using a host-based encryption strategy, users will achieve
industry-leading performance by offloading encryption processing to the HBA,
superior data security and protection against data breaches, minimizing the
window of vulnerability by securing data where it originates, at the host, as
described in SNIA`s Best Current Practices, at a lower price-point than other
solutions available today as demonstrated using Emulex`s Cost of Encryption
Calculator. 

The joint solution, which is compatible with existing infrastructures, will be
demonstrated in the Emulex booth at Microsoft Tech-Ed this week in booth #344.

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
iTKO, a leading provider of virtualization and validation solutions for
enterprise cloud applications, today announced further integrations of their
LISA software with the IBM (NYSE: IBM) Rational Software Delivery Platform based
on the IBM Jazz platform. 

The combined products help to ease the challenges of developing and testing
modern applications, including cloud-based services, integration platforms such
as IBM WebSphere/MQ, DataPower and many more enabling technologies. 

"We are driven to help our customers` teams better collaborate and accelerate
the development lifecycle," said Michael Loria, vice president, IBM Rational
Business Development. "The combination of IBM Rational and iTKO`s LISA solutions
allows quality to move upstream in the development process, while helping to
mitigate the risks of change and complexity in current software environments." 

The iTKO integrations have received "Ready for IBM Rational Software"
validation, and are available today for on-premise deployment; iTKO intends to
offer the integrations in the cloud later this year. The iTKO solutions
currently integrated with IBM Rational Quality Manager, IBM Rational Team
Concert, IBM Rational ClearQuest and other IBM software tools include:

* Integrated Defect Management: Leverages LISA Pathfinder for complete
transparency and traceability across all application tiers and technologies to

customers already realize, which can include a 25% improvement in development
productivity, a 25% reduction in infrastructure costs, and a 50% reduction in
bugs and performance issues delivered in deployment." 

iTKO`s LISA product suite eliminates application development constraints using
virtual service environments, optimizes discovery and resolution of coding
defects, and improves test automation and validation for complex enterprise
applications. LISA virtualization and validation solutions also support cloud
application development to remove accessibility and capacity constraints in
elastic cloud development and test environments. 

The latest iTKO integrations to IBM Rational Team Concert and IBM Rational

&lt;p&gt;New Windows Remote Management (WinRM) Support in Privilege Guard Delivers
Consolidated Desktop Event Reporting to Simplify Compliance Initiatives
NORTH ANDOVER, Mass., and MANCHESTER, U.K.--(Business Wire)--
Avecto Ltd, the most trusted name in least privilege management for Windows
systems, announced its support for Microsoft Event Forwarding to provide
centralized auditing of Windows desktops for least privilege compliance. By
leveraging Windows Remote Management (WinRM) protocol, Avecto Privilege Guard
can now document compliance-relevant events at desktops across the enterprise
and generate detailed reports to demonstrate compliance with industry
regulations. 

"A growing number of organizations are looking to adopt a least privilege
approach, as it provides a number of benefits, including increased desktop
security and reduced operational costs," said Mark Austin, CTO at Avecto. "The
requirement to remove administrative rights from users is frequently driven by
external or internal compliance initiatives, and in these situations the
auditing of privileged operations is very important. With the addition of new
WinRM support, Avecto is dramatically simplifying desktop compliance for
enterprises across industries." 

A number of compliance regulations demand the implementation of least privilege,
including Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC), Government Connect and
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Least privilege is also
recommended by other regulations, such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) and Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). 

The Avecto Privilege Guard solution enables companies to adopt the principle of
least privilege by removing admin rights from users and assigning privileges
directly to applications, based on policy settings, which are centrally managed
through Active Directory Group Policy. All privileged applications are audited
to the Windows event log, providing detailed information on the application and
the policy where it was defined. By leveraging Microsoft WinRM, important events
may be forwarded to a centralized server, allowing compliance reports to be
generated. For more advanced reporting the forwarded events may be further
consolidated with Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or a SQL
Server database. 

WinRM is Microsoft`s implementation of WS-Management Protocol, a SOAP-based,
firewall-friendly protocol, which provides a common way for systems to access
and exchange management information across an IT infrastructure. WinRM is a
standard component of Windows 7, as it was introduced in Windows Vista, and it
may also be installed on Windows XP desktops. 

A free solution guide is available from Avecto on setting up and configuring
WinRM for event forwarding at http://www.avecto.com/resources. 

About Avecto

Avecto is a pioneer in privilege management, helping organizations to deploy
secure and compliant desktops and servers. With its innovative Privilege Guard
technology, organizations can now empower all Windows-based desktop and server
users with the privileges they require to perform their roles, without
compromising the integrity and security of their systems. 

Customers of all sizes rely on Avecto to reduce operating expenses and
strengthen security across their Windows based environments. Our mission is to
enable our customers to lower operating costs and improve system security by
implementing least privilege. Avecto is building a worldwide channel of partners
and system integrators and is headquartered in Manchester, UK, with offices in
the U.S. and the Netherlands. For more information, visit www.avecto.com.

&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR, June 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
is testing the commercial viability of algae biofuel as an
alternative energy source to supplement oil and natural gas, a
senior executive said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Although oil, coal and natural gas are expected to
represent about 80 percent of global energy supply mix through
2030, nuclear and renewable energy such as wind, solar,
geothermal and biofuels will play a significant role,
ExxonMobil's senior vice president Andrew Swiger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global energy demand is expected to rise by almost 35
percent by 2030, from 2005 levels, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are testing the hypothesis that algae biofuels could
become commercially viable and achieve sufficient scale to make
meaningful contribution to the future energy mix," he told the
Asia Oil and Gas Conference in the Malaysian capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sunlight and carbon dioxide used to grow the algae could
also mitigate the effect of greenhouse gases, while algae has
the potential to produce large volumes of oils that can be
processed in existing refineries to make fuels compatible with
existing transportation technology and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is early days in this research, and the obstacles we
face are formidable, but the potential is great," Swiger added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Exxon currently has an interest in 4,900 megawatts
of cogeneration capacity at more than 30 sites worldwide. New
facilities under construction in Singapore will boost that
capacity to more than 5,000 megawatts by next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swiger also said that ExxonMobil will not delay the start
up of its new petrochemical plant in Singapore despite the glut
in ethylene supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are into long-term investments. The petrochemical
industry goes through many cycles. We cannot predict the
cycles, Swiger told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will start our plant as scheduled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The multibillion-dollar ethylene cracker on Singapore's
Jurong Island has a capacity of 1 million tonnes per year
(tpy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mechanical completion and start-up activities of the new
facilities will be in phases beginning late 2010 through 2011,
the company had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The petrochemical market is starting to feel the pressure
of additional ethylene coming on line, traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  China, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore and India will add
6.3 million tonnes of ethylene capacity, taking the region's
total to 48.33 million tonnes per year (tpy). China will
account for more than a third of the additions, reducing its
need for imports. [ID:nSGE62S035].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shell has already brought its 800,000-tpy cracker online in
March, as did Thailand, where the Map Ta Phut Olefins Co had
started a 900,000-tpy cracker around the same time.

&lt;p&gt;JERSEY CITY, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Pivot Inc., the leading provider of liquidity management and collaboration
software to the financial markets, today announced the integration of its core
technology platform with Microsoft Office Communications Server (OCS). With the
6.0 release of Pivot, the need to drive profits through speed and efficiency for
institutional trading desks and the need for enterprise-wide standardization for
corporate IT departments can be met with an OCS plus Pivot solution. 

Across Wall Street, there is an increasing demand for the seamless integration
of horizontal corporate applications, designed to meet the needs of an entire
enterprise, and vertical business line platforms, designed to meet the needs of
specific departments. Pivot is prized by traders, sales traders, market makers,
and brokers for its ability to drive profitability through increased speed in
locating and acting on trading opportunities. Microsoft OCS, on the other hand,
increasingly is the preferred solution for financial services firms because it
creates a highly efficient unified communications layer across all departments. 

By integrating the two platforms, large and mid-size financial firms can meet
the needs of all constituents. Traders can leverage the speed enhancements and
market visibility of Pivot with colleagues running Office Communicator and with
counterparties who have federated OCS connections. Supported features include
Pivot to Office Communicator chats, PIC integration, auto discovery, integrated
status and presence, contact list management, side-by-side PIC and direct AIM
and Yahoo! Messenger connectivity, and persistent chat history. 

"Firms are challenged to facilitate and streamline communication and data
dissemination across offices and geographical boundaries and can struggle in
gaining timely access to information and enabling direct, efficient
communication between colleagues, which is vital for maintaining pace with the
markets," said Ben Narey, U.S. director of Banking and Capital Markets Industry
Solutions. "Organizations with strong demand for Pivot`s tailored front office
offering are now better able to take advantage of the strengths of both
Microsoft and Pivot offerings in deploying a true unified communications
platform." 

In addition to enabling Microsoft OCS enterprise connectivity, Pivot`s
extensible platform allows users to aggregate information flow from multiple
public network connections including Twitter, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), and
Yahoo! Messenger. Pivot also supports a number of private third-party
subscription services such as industry forums, pricing models, and analysis and
data providers and delivers everything into consolidated, customizable screens
that are designed to maximize desktop real estate. 

"Distilling a vast amount of relevant trading communication and data into a
single screen and giving a user the ability to efficiently use that information
is what we do extremely well," said John H. Eley, CEO. "With our Microsoft
partnership and this integration, we can expand the solution to improve an IT
department`s ability to deliver value to end users while executing on corporate
mandate for efficiency through standardization." 

Pivot`s network of more than 300 firms, including the top 5 U.S. banks, consists
of cash equities, equity derivatives, and commodity OTC and derivatives markets
traders and brokers. 

About Pivot, Inc.

&lt;p&gt;  PITTSBURGH, PA, Jun 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Sherpa Software, a leading email management, e-discovery and archiving
solution provider, today announced the availability of Sherpa Software
Mail Attender version 4.6 for Microsoft(R) Exchange environments. The
updated offering helps organizations take advantage of added capabilities
of Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 by automating movement of PST files to
the Personal Archive, a new feature of Exchange 2010. By automating the
migration of PST data into the Personal Archive, Sherpa Software
addresses many of the challenges PST files create, enabling users to
interact with archived e-mail within their primary mailbox, as well as
discover, manage and back-up PST files.

    Instead of requiring system administrators to move PST data manually into
the Personal Archive mailbox by mailbox for each individual user, Sherpa
Mail Attender 4.6 allows email administrators to automate this process
using a global policy and also allows them to extend search capabilities
to the Personal Archive for discovery purposes. Other features allow for
the creation of rules and enforcement of policies to manage PST files on
a group, user or individual basis.

    "With customers increasingly using email to store critical information,
the volume of email and the need to manage information in these systems
will only continue to increase," said Kevin Ogrodnik, president, Sherpa
Software. "Sherpa is committed to easing customers' transition to
Exchange 2010 with products that offer flexible architectures and
reasonable prices to enable companies of all sizes to effectively address
their email management needs."

    Sherpa Software Mail Attender is a highly scalable content management
tool that automates the scheduling of common policies in multiple
information stores. Mail Attender streamlines the management process to
effectively address issues relating to policy enforcement, Outlook PST
management, corporate email compliance and storage. Mail Attender is
designed to be as non-invasive as possible and can be installed on any
network-enabled machine. Mail Attender has been the recipient of notable
industry awards, most recently having been named Best of Tech--Ed 2009 in
the messaging category by Penton Media's Windows IT Pro(R) and SQL Server
Magazine(R).

    In addition to Mail Attender, Sherpa Software offers Archive Attender, a
data archiving solution; Discovery Attender, an e-discovery tool; and PST
Backup Attender, a PST management solution.

    Sherpa Software will demonstrate Mail Attender 4.6 at Microsoft Tech-Ed,
Booth 2541 on June 7-11, 2010 in New Orleans, LA. Sherpa also will
feature other product offerings for Microsoft Exchange environments

&lt;p&gt;  SEATTLE, WA, Jun 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Attachmate Corporation today announced its next-generation terminal
emulation software Reflection(R) 2011 will soon be available for native
deployment within Microsoft's application virtualization (App-V)
environment. Additionally, Attachmate has joined Microsoft's System
Center Alliance Program. Attachmate is the first software vendor to offer
native support for Microsoft App-V, enabling IT administrators to quickly
and easily leverage Reflection 2011 in application deployments through
App-V, eliminating compatibility issues for enterprises at the user
desktop.

    While the current economic climate continues to challenge organizations
to do more with less and leverage existing IT resources, companies are
facing increased demand for remote access to mission-critical enterprise
applications. Reflection 2011 enables enterprises to meet these demands
by offering advanced terminal emulation technology, which can be deployed
across a variety of virtualized environments. Based on the customer
demand for App-V support, Attachmate is making Reflection 2011 available
in the App-V format to its customers without repackaging.

    Northern Trust, a leading investment management company based in Chicago,
has recently been testing Reflection 2008 in an App-V environment to
address application incompatibility issues. Catherine Casacchia, manager
of document management infrastructure at Northern Trust, says, "We plan
to leverage Microsoft's App-V solution in the future and are happy to see
Attachmate will be supporting this strategic platform as we move in this
direction."

    "Microsoft's App-V technology allows enterprise applications to be
deployed in real time, to any Windows client and is becoming a
'must-have' for organizations," said Karri Alexion-Tiernan, director of
product management at Microsoft Corp. "We're thrilled that Attachmate, a
long-time and well-respected partner, is joining us in making Microsoft
App-V the standard in application virtualization by becoming the first
vendor to offer native support for our solution." 

    More and more organizations are looking to migrate to the Windows 7
platform while simultaneously deploying the latest virtualization
technologies. Reflection 2011 is the most advanced Windows-based terminal
emulator on the market, built on .NET and with a Windows 7 look and feel.
With support for the leading application solutions such as App-V and
desktop virtualization platforms, Reflection 2011 can be deployed via
server or client-based virtualization technologies, maximizing IT
flexibility and eliminating incompatibilities with other operating
systems and applications.

    "Attachmate remains committed to offering our customers the most advanced
terminal emulation technology that can be seamlessly deployed with the
latest virtualization technologies," said Kris Lall, product marketing
manager for Attachmate. "Reflection 2011 is extremely well suited to work
with App-V and enables us to save our customers significant time and
resources by giving them centralized control over desktop applications
across the enterprise no matter what operating system they're using."

&lt;p&gt;Company to provide strategic overview and updated fiscal 2010 guidance
MIAMI--(Business Wire)--
Burger King Holdings, Inc., (NYSE:BKC) will present at the Goldman Sachs
Lodging, Gaming, Restaurant &amp; Leisure Conference today at the Goldman Sachs
Conference Center, located at 32 Old Slip, New York, NY beginning at 1:00 p.m.
ET. The presentation will be webcast live via the company's investor relations
Web site at http://investor.bk.com and at
http://cc.talkpoint.com/gold006/060710a_mg/?entity=9_FS5MR0G. 

John W. Chidsey, chairman and chief executive officer, will present the
company's strategic overview and will discuss the updated fiscal 2010 guidance.
The company maintains its expectations for fiscal 2010 guidance with the
exception of worldwide net restaurant growth and the effect of currency
translation on its results. 

Fiscal 2010 net restaurant growth is now expected to be 230 to 250 due to the
brand`s exit from the Israel market, representing 55 restaurants, based on a May
2010 agreement entered into between the company and its Israeli franchisee.
Excluding the closure of these restaurants, the company`s fiscal 2010 net
restaurant growth would have been at the higher end of the previously guided 250
to 300 range. These restaurant closures do not affect the company`s present
plans for growth in Europe and elsewhere in the Middle East and the company
remains wholly committed to growing the brand in these regions. 

Given current currency exchange rates, currency translation for the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2010 is now expected to have an unfavorable impact to revenues
resulting in a $0.01 to $0.02 negative effect on diluted earnings per share
(EPS). This compares to the previously provided guidance of a positive currency
translation impact on diluted EPS in the fourth quarter, resulting in a slightly
positive currency translation impact on full fiscal year diluted EPS. As a
result, for the full 2010 fiscal year, the company now expects the effect of
currency translation on diluted EPS to be neutral to slightly negative. 

For a complete listing of the guidance and assumptions upon which such guidance
was made refer to the company's Forms 8-K filed on August 25, 2009, October 29,
2009, February 4, 2010 and April 29, 2010. 

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements made in this press release that reflect management's
expectations regarding future events are forward-looking in nature, including
statements regarding the company's belief and expectations about net restaurant
growth for fiscal 2010 and the impact of the company`s exit from the Israel
market; its belief and expectations regarding the growth of the brand in Europe
and elsewhere in the Middle East; and its belief and expectations regarding
currency translation for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2010,
including the impact of currency translation on diluted earnings per share for
both periods. These forward-looking statements are only predictions based on our
current expectations and projections about future events. Important factors
could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or
implied by these forward-looking statements, including those risk factors set
forth in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the following: (i) our ability to successfully implement our
international growth strategy and risks related to our international operations;
and (ii) risks arising from the significant and rapid fluctuations in currency
exchange markets. 

Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements
are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results. Moreover, neither we nor any
other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of
these forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking
statements as predictions of future events. We do not undertake any
responsibility to update any of these forward-looking statements to conform our
prior statements to actual results or revised expectations.

&lt;p&gt;Program Portfolio Management and Social Product Development Among First
Offerings Built on Microsoft SharePoint 2010


NEEDHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
PTC (Nasdaq: PMTC), The Product Development Company, today expands Windchill,
its family of PLM solutions, with the announcement of several new and enhanced
solutions built on the Microsoft SharePoint 2010 collaboration platform. 

Highlights

* Windchill PPMLink - A new program portfolio management solution that couples
stage-gate methods with unique capabilities to aggregate program and
product-related metrics, improving visibility and decision-making 
* Windchill SocialLink - A new solution utilizing social computing capabilities
to bring the collective wisdom of communities to bear on product development
challenges 
* Windchill Web Parts for SharePoint - An enhanced solution that consolidates
critical information from Windchill and other enterprise systems for
presentation in a familiar Microsoft SharePoint 2010 environment for easier,
extended information access 
* Windchill ProductPoint - An enhanced solution, to address the specific CAD
data management needs of small and mid-sized businesses (SMB)

Prior to the launch of Microsoft SharePoint 2010, PTC was invited to participate
in Microsoft Corp.`s Technology Adoption Program (TAP) for SharePoint 2010. This
provided PTC early access to SharePoint 2010, and was established to yield
benefits for product development organizations in the form of enhanced executive
visibility, wider-information access, and improved team productivity. Through
increased R investment and active participation in the SharePoint 2010 TAP,
these new PTC solutions are being announced weeks after Microsoft`s initial
public release of SharePoint 2010. 

"PTC believes in Microsoft`s vision around the SharePoint 2010 business
collaboration platform for the enterprise," said Jared Spataro, director,
SharePoint Product Management, Microsoft. "The potential for PTC to deliver
great product development solutions for customers, based on the SharePoint
platform is demonstrated by the early success of Windchill ProductPoint and the
release of these new PTC solutions, offering significant value to manufacturing
companiesseeking to improve product development processes." 

Windchill PPMLink

Windchill PPMLink extends Microsoft`s Enterprise Project Management capabilities
with configurable stage and gate processes, and scorecards that aggregate
traditional project management measurements with PLM-derived product attributes.
Further, it allows each project team the freedom to choose its own solution for
project management while facilitating comprehensive bottom-up metrics reporting.


In a December 2009 independent Forrester Research, Inc. report, "It`s Time To
Revisit Portfolio Management For Product Development," Senior Analyst Roy C.
Wildeman stated that "Across the product life cycle, few processes have as much
impact on a company`s product innovation efforts and financial performance as
managing the R project pipeline and resulting new products." He also stated in
the report that "[PPM] applications can help clarify and align product
development strategy with the core strategy of the business." 

Windchill Web Parts for SharePoint

Windchill Web Parts for SharePoint 2010 provides a single, consolidated view of
product information by enabling SharePoint users to easily view, search, and
edit Windchill data together with content from ERP, finance and other enterprise
applications. Using Microsoft`s Business Connectivity Services, Windchill Web
Parts for SharePoint 2.0 offers new and enhanced capabilities that expand the
current search, assignment, and executive reporting features and take full
advantage of the SharePoint environment. 

Windchill SocialLink

With Windchill ProductPoint 1.1 and Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire 5.0, PTC first brought
social computing features into product development applications. Now, PTC is
announcing its development of a dedicated solution, enabling companies of all
sizes to realize the value of social product development. Windchill SocialLink
will combine social computing enabled by Microsoft SharePoint 2010 with a rich
knowledge of product data, and deliver a modern user experience, seamlessly
accessible across all PTC solutions. Content tagging, filtering, and activity
feeds will automatically disseminate relevant knowledge quickly to product
communities and "communities of practices," self-forming groups united by shared
professional interests. Uncovering and utilizing the collective wisdom of the
crowd will enable faster and more-effective decision-making. 

Planned capabilities and associated benefits of this new solution include:

* Community provisioning for information sharing and collective problem solving 
* Dissemination of relevant knowledge to community members intelligently
extracted from product content and metadata housed in the Windchill PLM system
by way of activity streams 
* Knowledge and expertise discovery, via personal profiles which are
continuously updated based on PLM system usage 
* Modern, engaging user experience delivered via a social toolbar offering
connectivity to all PTC product development solutions

Windchill ProductPoint

Windchill ProductPoint offers CAD vaulting, sharing, visualization, mark-up, and
data reuse within heterogeneous environments, typical of SMB product
organizations. Additionally, new data loading tools facilitate the direct
migration of Pro/INTRALINK 3.x content, including as-stored configurations,
metadata and full version history, into Windchill ProductPoint. 

"By extending SharePoint 2010, Windchill enables everyone -- design engineers,
program managers, and top executives-- to participate in the product development
process in a meaningful way through a familiar platform," said Brian Shepherd,
executive vice president, product development, PTC. "This results in better,
faster decision-making, which can ultimately drive a sustained competitive
advantage for our customers." 

Availability

PTC is demonstrating these solutions at the PTC/USER World Event 2010, from June
6-9 in Orlando, FL. PTC expects these solutions to be available later this year.

distributed by CCE. The new license agreement will have an initial term of 20
years, with 20-year renewal periods. This license agreement will replace the
existing agreements between DPS and CCE upon the completion of The Coca-Cola
Company`s acquisition of CCE`s North American bottling business. 

Under the new agreement, The Coca-Cola Company will distribute Dr Pepper
trademark brands in the U.S., and Canada Dry in the Northeast U.S. where they
are currently distributed by CCE. The Company will distribute Canada Dry, C`Plus
and Schweppes in Canada. 

In addition, the Company will offer Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in local
fountain accounts currently serviced by CCE and will include Dr Pepper and Diet
Dr Pepper on its Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser. The Coca-Cola Freestyle
agreement has a term of 20 years and DPS`s investment associated with the
program is estimated at $115 million to $135 million. 

"We are pleased to have reached a fair and mutually beneficial agreement with Dr
Pepper Snapple Group to continue distributing their brands, marking yet another
key milestone in our acquisition of the North American operations of Coca-Cola
Enterprises," said Muhtar Kent, chairman and chief executive officer, The
Coca-Cola Company. "Importantly, this agreement aligns with our 2020 Vision of
more than doubling our system revenue while increasing our system margins by
leveraging the world's most powerful distribution network." 

Mr. Kent continued, "Through this new relationship, The Coca-Cola Company will
become one of the largest Dr Pepper trademark bottlers in the United States and
will provide CCE`s current customers with uninterrupted distribution of Dr
Pepper brands. Based on early pilot program results, we believe our Coca-Cola
Freestyle customers will be excited about having an even greater choice of
brands available to distribute in their outlets." 

The closing of the CCE acquisition is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of
this year and is subject to, among other things, regulatory and CCE shareholder
approvals. 

The Coca-Cola Freestyle dispenser uses proprietary PurePour Technology and has
the capacity to dispense more than 100 beverages in the same amount of space as
a standard eight-valve machine. In development for more than four years, the
sleek, stylish units offer consumers an unprecedented assortment of branded
waters, juice drinks, and sparkling beverages, including many drinks that have
never before been sold in the U.S. The Coca-Cola Freestyle dispenser has already
been rolled out to more than 20 customers in select locations, and the Company
will add another 500 machines as part of pilot tests later this summer.
Consumers can now experience Coca-Cola Freestyle virtually at
www.Facebook.com/Coca-ColaFreestyle or at www.thecoca-colacompany.com. 

About The Coca-Cola Company and CCE Transaction

In February, The Coca-Cola Company and CCE announced that they entered into
definitive agreements enabling the Company to acquire CCE's North American
bottling business, and for CCE to acquire the Company's bottling operations in
Norway and Sweden. Additionally, CCE will have the right to acquire The
Coca-Cola Company's majority interest in its German bottler. At the close of the
acquisition of CCE`s North American bottling business, Coca-Cola Refreshments
USA, Inc. will integrate four business components into a 21st-century bottling

&lt;p&gt;  SANTA CLARA, CA, Jun 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
InMage(R) (www.inmage.com) is presenting IT professionals with an
integrated recovery solution to address Windows backup and disaster
recovery requirements for mixed physical and virtual server environments
at Microsoft TechEd North America 2010. Using a simplified deployment
model in Windows environments, InMage eliminates discrete backups, frees
up significant administrator time by automating much of the data
protection and recovery processes, and reduces costs by replacing
multiple existing products (backup agents, replication software,
clustering or failover software) with a single, centrally managed
solution.

    "Organizations that require application-consistent recovery options for
mixed physical and virtual environments face many challenges in finding a
single, low overhead recovery solution that covers all existing backup
and disaster recovery requirements," said Eric Burgener, senior vice
president of product management for InMage. "It's become clear that
older, point-in-time based approaches to data protection that worked well
on physical servers can't just be transferred to virtual server
environments. But disk-based 'continuous' technologies offer many options
to address these requirements and make administrators' lives much easier."

    InMage is a Microsoft Certified Partner and has worked with Microsoft to
provide extensive support for Windows applications and environments.
InMage is integrated with Windows Volume Shadowcopy Services (VSS) and
uses it to provide application-consistent recovery options for all the
major Microsoft applications, including Exchange, SharePoint, SQL, and
any NT file system (NTFS) based applications. InMage also supports
application failover and failback of these same Microsoft applications
out of the box, giving administrators options to recover both data and
applications rapidly, reliably and without manual intervention. InMage
also supports other key enterprise applications including Oracle, SAP and
Blackberry Enterprise Server using these same capabilities.

    Microsoft TechEd North America 2010 takes place from June 7-10 at the New
Orleans Morial Convention Center. The InMage exhibit will be located at
booth #1545.

    About InMage
 InMage is the leading independent software vendor of
disk-based, business application recovery solutions for both physical and
virtualized environments. The company's integrated recovery software
supports both local and remote backup and disaster recovery, performing
exceptionally well in heterogeneous IT infrastructures with mixed
platforms and storage. Customers can address stringent disaster recovery
requirements, backup problems and application availability with one
product, where multiple products were once required. InMage is
headquartered in Santa Clara, CA, with additional offices in Europe and
the Asia Pacific region. For more information, visit www.inmage.com.

&lt;p&gt;VMware has enjoyed a long run as king of x86 server virtualization, and the pioneering vendor remains the one to beat when tallying enterprise market share. But its competitors, particularly Microsoft and Citrix Systems, are gaining ground as IT executives begin to view server virtualization not only as a means to cut costs in the data center but also as a baseline technology for enabling cloud computing.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware vs. everyone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware introduced its first x86 server virtualization products in 2001. It wasn't until a few years later that the first commercial versions of the open source Xen virtualization hypervisor hit the market, and Microsoft's release of Hyper-V followed in 2008.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its generous head start, VMware started winning customers, particularly among large enterprises looking to save money and gain efficiencies by consolidating data center assets. As interest in the technology rose, so did VMware's marketshare. In early 2008, researchers estimated that at least 50% and as many as 80% of enterprise customers were using its hypervisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the high numbers, the race to virtualization is by no means over. Virtualization deployments have been expanding over the past several years, but plenty of workloads remain to be virtualized. At the end of 2009, only 18% of enterprise data center workloads that could be virtualized had been virtualized, according to Gartner. The number is expected to grow to more than 50% by the close of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vendors including Microsoft, Citrix (which acquired XenSource in 2007), Oracle (which acquired Virtual Iron in 2009), Parallels, Novell and others are gunning for new virtualized workloads, and they're using management capabilities, automation technologies and vendor partnerships to sweeten and differentiate their offerings.These tactics are timely. As today's IT buyers mull virtualization technologies, they're considering a lot more than just the hypervisor used to create virtual machines. IT teams need tools to manage virtual server technologies from x86 environments back to the mainframe, across multi-platform hypervisors and consistently alongside physical machines. They also need security and monitoring tools, and capabilities such as live migration to maintain business continuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises have learned they need to carefully track the configuration of virtual machines to ensure compliance with business policies and prevent virtual server sprawl &#8211; particularly as they get their IT infrastructures ready for cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtualization is a critical step in the journey to the private cloud, according to Matt Eastwood, group vice president of enterprise platforms at IDC. "Customers are quickly moving beyond the core hypervisor and focusing on mobility, self-provisioning, and metering and chargeback capabilities," Eastwood said in a statement. &#8220;As a result, IDC believes that automation tools increasingly represent the battleground in determining the winners and losers in a marketplace which is rapidly reshaping itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, VMware has been beefing up its management and automation capabilities, most recently by acquiring IT management technologies from EMC's Ionix portfolio for about $200 million. It also is part of a three-way partnership with Cisco and EMC to develop a series of cloud-computing platforms, called Vblocks, that are based on servers and networking gear from Cisco, EMC's storage, and VMware's VSphere virtualization software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its latest Magic Quadrant for x86 server virtualization infrastructure, Gartner recognizes VMware as the market leader. But it also acknowledges some challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VMware's challenge is to protect and grow its installed base and technology leadership as it expands into complementary markets that leverage virtualization, such as cloud computing," Gartner writes in its report, released in late May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citrix, meanwhile, has emphasized its virtualization management offerings &#8211; both for its own XenServer hypervisor and longtime partner Microsoft's Hyper-V platform &#8211; and made its hypervisor technology available for free to entice customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Its bold move to make XenServer (including XenCenter and XenMotion) free has resulted in a large upswing of product activations. However, the vendor has not yet been able to monetize that with product maintenance agreements or its add-on Essentials management offering," Gartner writes about Citrix in its Magic Quadrant. "Citrix is also trying to find a comfortable complementary role with Microsoft's Hyper-V, adding extended management tools to Microsoft's offering (which might reduce its reliance on its own offering, XenServer)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, too, has been working to emphasize virtualization management capabilities available in its Systems Center Virtual Machine Manager, and it has emphasized its multi-vendor approach to management. By making its hypervisor available for free, packaged with Windows Server 2008, Microsoft has steadily gained price-conscious users, particularly among midsize companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft competes very well in midsize organizations that are just now beginning to virtualize," Gartner writes in its market evaluation. "Microsoft's biggest challenge is overcoming VMware's deep market penetration in all but smaller enterprises that have been slow to virtualize. In many ways, Microsoft has been left with the late technology adopters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing remains an important customer draw for Microsoft, Gartner says. "Microsoft's biggest trump card is that it does not need virtualization to be a stand-alone business, so it will be able to maintain a price advantage on VMware."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So who's the winner? VMware's early lead has been tough for its competitors to overcome. But in the big picture, there are plenty of widespread virtualization deployments still to be undertaken by midsize and large enterprises. As the key players compete for mindshare, enterprises get to enjoy the benefits of more mature offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

 (Wraps up comments by Exxon executives on deepwater drilling)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jennifer Tan and Chen Aizhu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KUALA LUMPUR/BEIJING, June 7 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil warned
against quick reactive changes to deepwater drilling laws that
damage long-term investment decisions and urged governments to
take time to assess the reasons for the Gulf of Mexico oil
spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Senior executives of oil major Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
also underscored the importance of production from deepwater
drilling in meeting global energy demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We need to guard against premature reactive changes to
legislation that may not in the longer term be helpful but
detrimental to the industry," ExxonMobil senior vice president
Andrew Swiger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is too early to speculate on any changes to legislation
until the investigation is complete," he told reporters at an
industry conference in the Malaysian capital.
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FACTBOX describing details of the drilling ban and proposed
safety recommendations: [ID:nN01123942]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FACTBOX on other Gulf operators targeted for shutdown:
[ID:nN02184586]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Obama administration recently put on hold new deepwater
exploratory drilling in the U.S. for six months pending the
findings and recommendations of a presidential commission
investigating the causes of the explosion in April that sank
Transocean's RIGN.S Deepwater Horizon rig leased by BP Plc
(BP.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The review may lead to new laws on drilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark Albers, ExxonMobil's senior vice president told
Reuters the impact of the moratorium on deepwater drilling in
the Gulf would be much longer than the six-month ban Washington
slapped, as it takes time to understand the effect of possible
new regulations and bring the rigs back to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's important that in the next five years, deepwater will
contribute 10 million barrels per day of oil (equivalent).
That's equivalent to what Saudi Arabia is producing," Albers
said in an interview in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a very important element of meeting the world's
energy demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HIGHEST SAFETY STANDARDS CRUCIAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following the order to idle 33 deepwater rigs, Royal Dutch
Shell (RDSa.L), ExxonMobil, Chevron (CVX.N), Marathon (MRO.N)
and other firms have begun curbing Gulf operations, which some
argue exacerbates the harm to a Gulf Coast economy already
losing fishing and tourism business to the spill.
[ID:nN03241086]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lengthy deepwater drilling moratorium could also hit
future U.S. oil and natural gas output. U.S. Gulf offshore oil
operations produced 1.6 million barrels of oil per day in 2009,
accounting for 8 percent of U.S. liquid fuel consumption, said
the U.S. Energy Information Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Interior Department has also outlined a series of
potentially costly new safety rules and standards that oil
companies will have to contend with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There will be significant impact to the thousands and
thousands of people who work not only in the industry but those
who support the industry, from catering, to diving to
inspections," Albers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association
estimates the moratorium could sideline up to 7,000 highly paid
rig workers and cost four to five times as many support jobs at
catering, service boat and drilling supply firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swiger added that the U.S. oil giant has been providing
assistance in response to the oil spill in the Gulf, which
highlighted the importance of upholding the highest standards
of safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We stand ready to support efforts to determine how such an
incident can be prevented from happening again," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BP is facing another difficult week of tough  questions
from investors and U.S. lawmakers despite making progress in
capturing an increasing amount of oil spewing from the ruptured
well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The major said on Sunday its containment cap had captured
10,500 barrels of oil (439,950 gallons/1.67 million litres) in
24 hours and a second system should be in place soon, enabling
it to siphon the vast majority of oil spewing from the leak
about a mile (1.6 km) below the water's surface.
[ID:nN06177006]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the U.S. admiral leading the government relief effort
said the coast will be under siege from the spill for many more
months.

&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR, June 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
will not delay the start up of its new petrochemical plant in
Singapore despite the glut in ethylene supplies, a senior
executive said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

industry goes through many cycles. We cannot predict the

Jurong Island has a capacity of 1 million tonnes per year
(tpy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mechanical completion and start-up activities of the new
facilities will be in phases beginning late 2010 through 2011,
the company had said.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today patched 34 vulnerabilities in Windows, Office and Internet Explorer (IE), including an IE8 bug used by a Dutch security researcher in March to win $10,000 at the Pwn2Own contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update was the largest from Microsoft so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's patch for IE8 was the last of those used to hack three browsers -- Mozilla's Firefox and Apple 's Safari as well as IE -- at the March challenge. Mozilla patched Firefox April 1, eight days after the contest, while Apple fixed its flaw on April 14, 21 days post-Pwn2Own. This year, both Mozilla and Apple beat the time it took them to patch the vulnerabilities used in 2009's edition of Pwn2Own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft essentially matched its patch speed of last year, when it also fixed 2009's Pwn2Own flaw with a June update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Actually, that's a pretty quick turn-around," said Aaron Portnoy, security research team lead with HP TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) bug-bounty program. TippingPoint and ZDI sponsored this year's Pwn2Own, as it did the three years prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers put the IE update at the top, or near the top of their to-do lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IE is certainly the most important of the 10 to patch," said Andrew Storms, the director of security operations for nCircle Security, citing the six flaws fixed in the MS10-035 update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rated the IE update as "critical," the highest threat ranking in its four-step scoring system, and said the six fixes within the update addressed two critical bugs, two marked "important" and two more tagged as "moderate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late March, Dutch researcher Peter Vreugdenhil , a Pwn2Own newcomer, exploited a vulnerability in IE8 running on Windows 7 with attack code called at the time "technically impressive" by Portnoy. To hack IE8, Vreugdenhil first had to bypass the operating system's primary defenses -- Data Execution Prevention, or DEP, as well as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vreugdenhil used a two-exploit combination to circumvent first ASLR and then DEP to successfully break into IE8 within two minutes .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josh Abraham, a security researcher with Rapid7, slipped MS10-035 a bit farther down his list. "I think people should be patching the media decompression vulnerability first," he said, referring to MS10-033 . "I'd put the IE update directly following that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms also put the spotlight on MS10-033, another of the three critical updates Microsoft issued today. "It's another 'movies-to-malware' kind of vulnerability, with exploits of malicious media files in a classic drive-by attack scenario," said Storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS10-033 contains fixes for two vulnerabilities, both critical, that affect every supported operating system in Microsoft's portfolio, including the newest, Windows 7. Microsoft said that DirectX, the Windows media runtime, the encoder and a COM component all contain bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is more of the usual," said Abraham, talking about MS10-033, "where attackers can leverage client software using drive-by downloads."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, Microsoft patched 34 vulnerabilities -- tying a record first set in October 2009 -- including six marked critical. Fixes were published for SharePoint, the Internet Information Services (IIS) server, the OpenType compact font format, the Windows kernel, .Net and several Microsoft-made and third-party ActiveX controls used in IE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest update, MS10-038 , fixed a whopping 14 flaws in various versions of Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet, including one bug in the Mac editions. Jason Miller, data and security team manager for Shavlik Technologies, tagged the Excel update as one he'd put at the top of any to-do list because of the widespread use of the spreadsheet in businesses and the fact that Excel file are rarely blocked, giving hackers an easy entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like Abraham, Miller pushed MS10-035 as extremely urgent. "We've seen this several times in the last six months or so, when Microsoft has patched its media software and media formats," he said. "Media, video, online stream...they're more and more prevalent not only for business, but for people in business. I can guarantee that someone is watching video right now in every organization. [Media] is just like a browser [as far as patching] at this point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month's security update can be downloaded and installed via the Microsoft Update and Windows Update services, as well as through Windows Server Update Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

Natural Gas Burns Brightly In Stocks

Natural gas and the United States Natural Gas Fund, LP (NYSE: UNG) have been one
of the few positives in an overall ugly market that cannot seem to get away from
a crashing Euro, global double dip fears and a Gulf of Mexico oil spill that
shows no end in sight. Natural gas has been dropping for the better part of two
years. The top was hit in mid 2008 and since then it has fallen off a cliff and
never recovered. Oil topped out at the same time, but made a bottom in March
2009 and has rallied at times 100% off those lows. Natural gas never saw any
significant rally. 

This may be the time for natural gas to burn brightly. As the oil spill has
filled the news and the Gulf of Mexico, President Obama has endorsed natural
gas. A hot summer in the northeast has also kept demand strong as inventories
showed yesterday. A depressed natural gas price means it is cheap compared to
its counter part in oil. With public sentiment shifting from oil to cleaner
fuels, natural gas may be just starting its upward trend. 

While natural gas may be a story for the months to come, many key natural gas
stocks have already run significantly. As a Chief Market Strategist, I would shy
away from paying up for them in this type of market. Let them come back down and
settle. Once that happens, they may be a great buying opportunity. Look at
Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE: CHK) and Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:
DVN). In addition, I think it is wise to watch ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:
XOM) as they bought XTO Energy, a natural gas player not long ago.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Mylan Gains Generic Approval

Matrix Laboratories, a subsidiary of Mylan (Nasdaq: MYL), recently received
final approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its generic
version (gabapentin) of Pfizer`s (NYSE: PFE) Neurontin, a treatment for
postherpetic neuralgia. Gabapentin tablets had US sales of about $174 million
for the twelve months ending March 31, 2010. 

In the past few months, Mylan has received approval for other significant drugs,
including for Valtrex, GlaxoSmithKline`s (NYSE: GSK) treatment for herpes virus
infection, Boehringer Ingelheim's benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treatment,
Flomax; Lundbeck`s Desoxyn, and generic versions of Glaxo`s smoking cessation
aid Zyban. 

Mylan received a noteworthy FDA approval for HIV treatment as well. The company
received approval under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)
for the generic version of Bristol Myers Squibb's (NYSE: BMY) HIV treatment,
Videx. 

Mylan is a leading player in the generics market. Currently, Mylan has 140
Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDAs) pending FDA approval, representing
$95.5 billion in annual brand sales, according to IMS Health. Among these, 40
are potential first-to-file opportunities, representing $21 billion in annual
brand sales. 

Given the strength of Mylan`s generics portfolio, the company recorded a 7%
increase in revenues during the first quarter of 2010. The company re-affirmed
its 2010 EPS guidance in the range of $1.50 to $1.70 and expects to generate
total annual revenue of about $5.45 billion to $5.75 billion. 

More Oil Discovery for Petrobras

Brazilian state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro (NYSE: PBR) announced
the discovery of a new light oil accumulation in the Campos Basin off the
Brazil's southeastern coast, following a string of major offshore finds. As per
the company, this new find, named Brava, holds an estimated 380 million barrels
of recoverable oil equivalent, which is equal to 2.6% of the company`s proven
reserves. The discovery was made at a depth of 4,460 meters at the Marlim field,
which is situated 170 kilometers (105 miles) off the coast of Macae, a city in
Rio de Janeiro state. 

Petrobras has discovered billions of barrels of oil in offshore reserves in the
past two years and more recently made a successful discovery of two other oil
deposits in the Campos Basin, where most of the Brazilian crude production takes
place. The company also plans to continue to perform more tests to evaluate the
productivity of the reservoirs. 

Petrobras projected investments in the range of $200 to $220 billion for the
four-year period 2010 - 2014, mainly to develop new oil fields. The company
targets to reach daily production level of 5.7 million barrels a day by 2020 (up
from the production of 2.5 million barrels a day in 2009), based on developments
of fields in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean. 

Petrobras, a global leader in deepwater oil exploration and production,
dominates Brazil`s oil and gas sector. It produces substantially all of Brazil`s
crude oil and natural gas, accounts for almost all of the country`s refining
capacity, is building the country`s natural gas infrastructure and enjoys
premium market share positions in the petroleum product and liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG) marketing businesses. While the company no longer operates as a legal
monopoly, the size and reach of its operations make it a quasi-monopoly in
Brazil.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Smartphone Growth to Accelerate

According to a recent release by research firm iSuppli Corp, global smartphone
shipments are expected to increase 105% to 506 million units in 2014 from 246.9
million expected in 2010. 

The research firm said that the smartphone unit shipment growth of 35.5%
expected in 2010 will drive the mobile phone market. Overall mobile handsets are
expected to grow 11.3%. 

This growth will be fueled by new smartphones from large handheld device
companies, such as Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG), Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT),
Nokia Corporation (NYSE: NOK) and Research in Motion Ltd (Nasdaq: RIMM). While
the wireless market is quite competitive, the surge in smartphone units
indicates significantly higher growth potential for leaders such as Apple Inc.
(Nasdaq: AAPL). 

Apple has dominated the U.S. smartphone market and is expected to further
strengthen its position through the launch of a fourth generation iPhone. 

The new iPhone will be thinner than the previous generation, with a higher
resolution display and a front-facing camera for videoconferencing. The most
important feature is its superior ability for multitasking, such as listening to
music and simultaneously reading email via updated iPhone software (OS4). 

The new iPhone is expected to be priced at $199, while the current iPhone 3GS is
expected to see a price cut to $99. This could definitely drive higher demand
for Apple`s iPhones. 

Overall iPhone unit sales were 8.75 million during the most recent quarter
(second quarter of 2010), representing 131% unit growth over the year-ago
quarter and the highest in the company`s history. iPhone sales represented
approximately 40% of the company`s total revenue. 

The increase was driven by strong international demand for the smartphone as
well as the addition of new carriers in key overseas markets. 

Apple`s market share represents about 3% of the overall cell phone market, and
ranked no. 6 according to iSuppli in the global cell phone market in the first
quarter. Wall Street expects Apple to sell a total of about 36 million iPhones
in its fiscal year ending 2010, which is a whopping 80% increase from over 20
million iPhones units sold in fiscal 2009.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

How Will BP Survive the Spill?

The Gulf of Mexico oil spill has put British oil giant BP Plc (NYSE: BP)
squarely at the top of the corporate pariah list. This environmental catastrophe
has not only made BP everybody`s chief villain, but also put an unflattering
public spotlight on the oil industry`s Achilles heel: deepwater drilling. 

While the damage to the environment and Gulf Coast businesses is very real, this
crisis and its effects are also expected to create its own set of winners and
losers. On top of the losers list is BP, which has not only lost more than a
third of its market value, but is also facing doubts about its ability to exist
as an independent entity. 

Real and speculative stories about BP going the rounds in recent days range from
the risk of government expropriation of the company to its emergence as a buyout
target to talk of a dividend cut. My goal in this write-up is to size up these
stories to answer the ultimate question of whether the company can survive in
its present shape. 

Government Expropriation

Let me take on the easiest-to-tackle issue (basically a rumor) first -- that the
U.S. government will expropriate all or part of BP`s assets. This is a
non-existent threat and doesn`t hold any water. The U.S. is a country of laws,
with a proud tradition of property rights. While BP is no doubt exposed to a
host of liabilities and lawsuits, including the Justice Department`s civil
and/or criminal probes, they will be all be determined under the due process of
law. BP may be a pariah, but there should be no doubt that it will get fair and
transparent judicial treatment. 

Is BP a Buyout Target?

After losing about a third of its market value, BP`s market capitalization has
slipped from being the second among the five super majors -- Exxon (NYSE: XOM),
BP, Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Shell (NYSE: RDS.A) and Total (NYSE: TOT) -- to around
the same level as France`s Total. The company`s diminished value has prompted
rumors that it could be in play, withExxon and Shell often cited as the
potential acquirers. 

While BP`s lucrative portfolio of oil and natural gas assets would make it an
attractive target, I don`t consider it a viable option for three reasons. First,
no super-major would like to shoulder the unquantifiable liability exposure of
BP. Second, anti-trust concerns in the U.S. and Europe would make such a
combination a hard sell. And third, BP has a significant downstream (refining &amp;
marketing) presence, which isn`t of interest to any of the super-majors. 

How Secure is the Dividend?

This may actually be the more plausible of all the concerns about BP, given the
company`s deep set of current problems. However, there are two aspects to the
dividend decision -- financial and perceptional (or political). 

Let`s address the financial aspect first. Looking purely at the company`s
financial profile, I wouldn`t consider the dividend to be at risk. Behind this
view is a conservative look at the company`s cash flows this year and next
versus its need for capital expenditures, dividend payouts and other
spill-related liabilities. 

BP plans to spend around $22 billion on capital expenditures this year and
around that same level next year, while its annual dividend payouts amount to
around $10.5 billion. In terms of operating cash flows, the company will
generate anywhere from $25 billion to $34 billion this year, depending on oil
prices ranging from $60 per barrel to $80 per barrel (keeping natural gas
constant at $5 per Mcf). As long as oil and natural gas prices remain in this
range or above, the company will have sufficient internal cash flows to meet
these needs. 

In addition to its ample operating cash flow cover, BP also has a fairly strong
balance sheet, notwithstanding its recent rating downgrades that still leave it
in pristine investment-grade territory. It had a net debt-to-capitalization
ratio of around 19% as of the end of the first quarter. This leaves BP plenty of
capacity to raise debt to meet its obligations. BP also has an ongoing asset
disposition program that can be expanded to raise more cash. 

The point is that from a purely financial standpoint, the company has sufficient
resources to meet its needs without needing to cut the dividend.

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA and NEW ORLEANS, LA, Jun 08 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
Amid high-profile product launches and talks by executives, award-winning
software development tools vendor Developer Express, Inc.
(www.devexpress.com) has decided to make fundraising for charitable
causes the focus of its presence at this year's Microsoft TechEd
conference in New Orleans the week of June 7.

    Never known to skimp on tradeshows, DevExpress was a platinum sponsor of
last year's TechEd. But upon hearing that the conference would be held in
New Orleans this year, the company felt its resources would be better
invested in other ways. "The decision was simple and unanimous," said
Julian M. Bucknall, Chief Technology Officer at DevExpress, "Given the
reality of life for those living in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina,
and now with the Gulf oil slick, everyone in our company felt that we
should be helping a New Orleanian family rather than doing what we
usually do for a conference." Accordingly, DevExpress decided to sponsor
the building of a house by Habitat for Humanity for a young New Orleans
woman.

    The company also plans to raise money on the exhibitor floor for the
Southeast Louisiana branch of the Boys and Girls Club of America. The
DevExpress booth will display a "Welcome Home" card for the Habitat for
Humanity house recipient, to be signed by TechEd attendees and presented
to her at the organization's Wall Raising Ceremony on June 11. For each
signature obtained, DevExpress will donate $5 to the Boys and Girls Club
up to $10,000.

    "We hope that our participation at this year's conference will support
and garner awareness for the ongoing humanitarian efforts in New
Orleans," said Mark Miller, Chief Scientist at DevExpress. "On a personal
level, we're also looking forward to getting our hands dirty helping
out." 

    Microsoft TechEd will take place June 7-10 at the Morial Convention
Center, 1001 S. Peters St., New Orleans, LA, 70130. Visit the DevExpress
booth at #2613.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Dumped Toxins for 26 Years; Indigenous Groups Decimated; CEO Fights
Shareholders; Chatter about Bankruptcy
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Chevron`s potential $27.3 billion liability for causing the world`s worst
oil-related catastrophe in Ecuador`s rainforest - dubbed the "Amazon Chernobyl"
by locals -- is starting to look like a glaring underestimate compared to the
astronomical damages facing BP in the wake of the Gulf oil spill, according to
an analysis in The New York Times published today. 

In his "Dealbook" column, Andrew Ross Sorkin reports investment bankers have
concluded that BP could be a ripe takeover target because it faces a $40 billion
liability for the Gulf spill. He says under various worst case scenarios - such
as a jury trial in Louisiana - the potential liability could surpass a whopping
$100 billion. 

The $40 billion includes an estimated $23 billion in clean-up costs according to
Credit Suisse and an additional $14 billion from fisherman and the tourism
industry, according to analysts. The amount could lead BP to what bankers call
the dreaded "Texaco Scenario" -- where Texaco`s $10.5 billion liability in the
Penzoil case (then the largest civil judgment in U.S. history) forced it to file
for bankruptcy in 1987. 

"The question is, who would buy BP, given its enormous liabilities," wrote
Sorkin. 

Chevron has a similar problem in Ecuador, given that the company dumped at least
ten times as much oil into the rainforest as has spewed out of BP`s Deepwater
Horizon well, according to observers. The same logic used in the Sorkin article
suggests that in a worst-case scenario - particularly if the Ecuador trial judge
increases the damages awarded well above the $27 billion estimate -- Chevron
might face the same danger of bankruptcy now looming over BP, according to Pablo
Fajardo, the lead Ecuadorian attorney for the plaintiffs. 

"We believe the damages estimate in Ecuador is glaringly low in light of the
latest assessments of BP`s liability by Wall Street analysts," said Fajardo. 

The Ecuador disaster is still considered the world`s largest oil-related
catastrophe, though it often is not "ranked" because it was the product of
deliberate planning to cut costs rather than a spectacular accident, according
to representatives of the plaintiffs. "Chevron dumped more than 18.5 billion
gallons of toxic waste -- about 4 million gallons per day for more than two
decades -- and the world paid almost no attention," said Mitch Anderson, an
American organizer who works with the affected Amazonian communities. 

Experts have concluded that Chevron discharged at least 345 million gallons of
pure crude into the Amazon as part of its illegal dumping - far more than both
the 11 million gallons spilled in the Exxon Valdez and the enormous amounts of
crude spewing out of the BP well in the Gulf. 

The Chevron Ecuador disaster poisoned an ecosystem roughly the size of Rhode
Island that is even more sensitive to its indigenous inhabitants than the
coastal marshes of Louisiana are to local fishermen, according to Luis
Villacrecis, an environmental consultant who works with the plaintiffs. 

"We have long said that the $27 billion damages number for Chevron in Ecuador is
too low because it does not take into account the true restoration of the
rainforest," said Villacrecis. 

"Because this is far away from the United States, and because the victims are
mostly indigenous, Chevron believes it can receive a discount on the actual
damages," he added. "Whether that is true remains to be seen." 

The dumping, which occurred when Texaco (now Chevron) operated a large oil
concession from 1964 to 1990, has decimated the traditional lifestyles of five
indigenous groups while a sixth, the Tetete, has disappeared. The case was moved
from U.S. federal court to Ecuador at Chevron`s request in 2002 as a way for the
oil giant to try to avoid or minimize liability, said Anderson, who works at
Amazon Watch.. 

Much of the damage in Ecuador - including 916 unlined waste pits gouged from the
jungle floor and used for permanent waste storage - is still visible and will
cause harm for centuries unless cleaned up, according to experts. Proof can be
seen in a 60 Minutes segment which shows the pipes Chevron built to drain toxic
sludge from the pits into the forest, or in the documentary film Crude, which
chronicles the legal battle of the communities against Chevron. 

The Ecuador liability has clearly gotten under the skin of Chevron`s new CEO
John Watson, who is under attack for helping to engineer Chevron`s purchase of
Texaco for $31 billion in 2001 without proper due diligence. Watson oversaw the
integration of the two companies. 

At the Chevron annual meeting on May 26, Watson had five shareholders arrested
after they made known their criticisms of the company`s poor human rights and
environmental record. Among them were Anderson and noted author Antonia Juhasz,
who was forcibly dragged out of the meeting by several Houston police officers. 

Inside the meeting, Chevron's management team suffered a humiliating rebuke when
shareholders supported a resolution relating to Ecuador with 26% of the vote,
representing an estimated $38 billion in shareholder value. The shareholder
support represents an increase of nearly 400% over previous resolutions
associated with the Ecuador problem. 

"The shareholder defiance of Watson combined with the enormous potential Ecuador
liability helps explain why Chevron management is trying to silence its
critics," said Anderson.

&lt;p&gt;  HONOLULU, HI, Jun 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Broadway in Hawaii announced it will bring the national touring
productions of two award-winning worldwide smash hit Broadway musicals to
Honolulu's Neal S. Blaisdell Concert Hall this year. Disney's "Beauty and
the Beast" Musical will open at the Blaisdell Concert Hall on September
21, 2010 and is sure to be one of this year's biggest family events in
Honolulu! Andrew Lloyd Webber's "CATS" musical will arrive in Honolulu on
December 28, 2010 and will be one of the hottest tickets in town for New
Year's Eve.

    "The extraordinary success of our 13 week run of 'The Lion King' really
put Honolulu on the theatrical map," said Blaisdell Concert Hall GM John
Fuhrman at a press conference held this morning. "We couldn't be more
pleased to follow up with the Hawaiian debut of 'Beauty and the Beast'
and the long awaited return of 'CATS.'" "Beauty and the Beast" will come
to life on stage at the Blaisdell from September 21 to October 3. "CATS"
-- a true Broadway classic -- will be presented for one-week only from
December 28 to January 2. Both shows are the national touring companies
playing major cities across North America. The "Beauty and the Beast"
tour reunites the original creative team from the original Broadway
production.

    "Given the demand we've seen for top-quality family shows like these we
expect tickets to go fast," said Fuhrman, "especially as there are two
big incentives to buy tickets now. First, the opening night of both shows
are priced 30-40% below prime weekend performances. Second, both shows
have two performances with a 50% discount for kids. We usually see our
Honolulu ticket buyers wait until the last minute but I don't think that
will be the case this time, at least until these performances are sold
out."

    At the press conference, Blaisdell officials announced an exciting new
venture with NewSpace Entertainment, the independent presenter of live
theater and concerts behind Broadway in Hawaii, who will bring these
Broadway productions to Honolulu.

    NewSpace, based in Salt Lake City, presented nearly 200 events in 50
North American cities this season. "We've been presenting shows like
Stomp, Cirque Dreams, Bill Cosby, Jim Brickman, Grease, and Cats to
Honolulu for nearly a decade," said NewSpace COO Steve Boulay. "We are
thrilled to bring these shows to the Blaisdell in 2010."

    Boulay explained that Broadway in Hawaii is committed to extending that
investment in Honolulu. "There are quite a few important shows which have
yet to make their Honolulu debut and we hope to be able to have some
exciting announcements in the near future. Today we are pleased to
announce the formation of the Broadway in Hawaii Education Fund that
gives much-needed financial support to arts programs in local schools, as
well as programs offered through non-profit organizations. $.50 from
every ticket purchased will support The Broadway in Hawaii Education Fund
that will, in turn, support the following programs:


--  Friends of Kennedy Theatre Endowment Scholarship Fund to fund
    scholarships to the University of Manoa Theatre and Dance program,
--  Kaimuki High School Performing Arts Center,
--  Performing Arts Center of Kapolei (PACK) via Kapolei High School,
--  Castle Performing Arts Learning Center,
--  Alliance for Drama Education and
--  Honolulu Theatre for Youth."

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/7f5d90/ibm_south_africa_g) has
announced the addition of the "IBM SOUTH AFRICA GROUP LTD.: International
Competitive Benchmarks and Financial Gap Analysis" report to their offering. 

Though we heavily rely on historical performance, the figures reported in this
report are not historical but are forecasts and projections for the coming
fiscal year. The forecasts are updated quarterly. This particular report was
updated in the last quarter. In order to maintain comparability over time and
across companies and countries, we use an index system. In the case of a firms
assets, we treat the total assets as equaling 100, irrespective of the value of
the local currency. All other assets are then calculated as a percent from total
assets. In this way, the structure of the firms assets can be easily interpreted
and compared with international benchmarks. For liabilities, total liabilities
and equity are indexed to equal to 100. For the income statement, total revenue
is indexed to equal 100, and all other figures are calculated as a percent of
these figures. Ratios are projected using raw financial statistics and, as
ratios, are therefore comparable. The source(s) for the various raw statistics
include public filings, corporate releases, and various other data sources. 

Given a company's financial structure, the resulting figures are benchmarked
across leading competitors. In choosing the leading competitors, Icon Group
chooses only those firms with sound financial situations or those not undergoing
radical restructuring, or where random volatility, mergers, or bankruptcy
affects financial performance. 

Since the calculation of competitors benchmarks proceeds in a similar fashion,
but are aggregated across all competitors, one can directly conduct a financial
gap analysis. Here, Icon Group graphically reports, for each part of the
financial statement, the larger gaps that the firm has vis-a-vis the leading
competitors. A gap need not be a bad sign. Rather, it is simply a substantial
difference that might merit further attention or signal a firms relative
strength or weakness for the coming fiscal year. Again, all figures are
projections, so due caution is required

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The trillion dollar U.S. high-yield bond market, hurt by a recent sell-off, could recover and return more than 8 percent this year, Andy O'Brien, co-head of the syndicated leveraged finance group at JPMorgan, said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At some point you look at what are the investment alternatives out there," O'Brien said at the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit in New York. Despite the slow-growth economic environment, defaults will fall and more investors will look at high-yield as an attractive asset class, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widening concerns about a European debt crisis derailed a 14-month U.S. junk bond rally last month, with investment losses totaling about 3.5 percent in May. New junk bond sales slowed to a trickle and several planned sales were pulled as demand for risky assets cooled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, O'Brien said he is bullish on the North American economic environment, and coupons remain high on junk bonds, which will result in positive returns for the year. While economic growth may be modest, it will not slow enough to push more companies into default, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The growth rate may be a little lower but I think it will be sufficient enough to keep companies performing," he said. "We were projecting a 2 to 4 percent default rate" and still do, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. junk bond default rate peaked at nearly 14 percent in November, according to Moody's Investors Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's research staff has estimated that returns on high-yield bonds could be as high as 12 percent this year. Year to date, junk bonds are up about 3.3 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Brien expects high-yield bond issuance to top last year's levels as companies refinance debt and fund mergers and acquisitions. "I think we will see a steady stream of quality transactions," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While leveraged loan issuance has slowed in recent weeks, JPMorgan remains active in loans, where it holds a portion of the loans it underwrites. "We continue to be aggressively providing capital to corporates," said O'Brien, who sits on JPMorgan's balance sheet committee, which determines how the company commits its own capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the top underwriter of high-yield bonds last year and in the first quarter, is forecasting about $200 billion in high-yield bond issuance in 2010, versus $180 billion in 2009. Year-to-date about $120 billion has been sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to see real money accounts see value in the credit markets, either in investment grade market or high yield," O'Brien said. With the direction of the stock market uncertain and money markets yielding zero to 1 percent, "you're going to want to put credit into your portfolio," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dena Aubin and Al Yoon; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co has made heavy losses from bad coal-price bets, traders dealing with the U.S. investment bank said, at a time when proprietary trading at deposit-taking banks faces increased regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent months, JPMorgan has aggressively bet on the unusual discount of coal in Europe to South African coal, but was caught out when demand in Europe picked up and the discount narrowed, they added, confirming a recent press report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coal delivered into Europe is normally more expensive than that bought on a free on board (FOB) basis in South Africa because the European price reflects the cost of shipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was the implied freight which racked up the losses. We think around $175 million loss in April and another big loss in May," said a source at a large European utility, which is an active player on the coal swaps market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was first reported by the New York Post, which said JPMorgan may have been hit by a loss of $250 million this quarter, due to wrong bets on coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kristin Lemkau, a JPMorgan spokeswoman in New York, said the New York Post story was incorrect, and declined to comment further. A spokeswoman in London declined to comment, saying the bank did not speak about trading positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan shares were 1 percent higher at $37.09 at 1521 GMT, outperforming the Dow Jones blue-chip index, which was 0.12 percent stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the trading loss would be minimal for JPMorgan, the New York Post said, but would provide ammunition to politicians, who advocate the curbing of such proprietary trading by deposit-taking banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coal swaps and physical markets are extremely illiquid and immature compared with the oil market, and trading counterparties tend to know each other well because there is very little central clearing and settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coal can be vulnerable to aggressive trading, but its direction can be hard to predict, because the market moves rapidly from physical glut to tightness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had been selling European physical coal delivered into Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp and API2 coal swaps, which settle against physical prices, hoping to maintain the unprecedented spread between the European prices and the API4 South African swaps, traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was caught out as the discount of API2 to API4 -- known as the implied freight because it normally indicates just shipping costs -- had shrunk to a few dollars at most, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;API4 coal swaps settle against the API4 physical index which is a benchmark for FOB Richards Bay South African coal cargo prices. API2 swaps settle against the API2 physical index, the delivered Europe coal price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore and Elinor Comlay in New York; Editing by Douwe Miedema and Simon Jessop in London)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds confirmation from traders, previously NEW YORK)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jackie Cowhig&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, June 8 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) has
made heavy losses from bad coal-price bets, traders dealing with
the U.S. investment bank said, at a time when proprietary
trading at deposit-taking banks faces increased regulatory
scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In recent months, JPMorgan has aggressively bet on the

GMT, outperforming the Dow Jones blue-chip index .DJI, which
was 0.12 percent stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The impact of the trading loss would be minimal for
JPMorgan, the New York Post said, but would provide ammunition
to politicians, who advocate the curbing of such proprietary
trading by deposit-taking banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The coal swaps and physical markets are extremely illiquid
and immature compared with the oil market, and trading
counterparties tend to know each other well because there is
very little central clearing and settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coal can be vulnerable to aggressive trading, but its
direction can be hard to predict, because the market moves
rapidly from physical glut to tightness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan had been selling European physical coal delivered
into Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp and API2 coal swaps, which
settle against physical prices, hoping to maintain the
unprecedented spread between the European prices and the API4
South African swaps, traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it was caught out as the discount of API2 to API4 --
known as the implied freight because it normally indicates just
shipping costs -- had shrunk to a few dollars at most, they
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; API4 coal swaps settle against the API4 physical index which
is a benchmark for FOB Richards Bay South African coal cargo
prices. API2 swaps settle against the API2 physical index, the
delivered Europe coal price.

 (Updates to midday, changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ryan Vlastelica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - The Dow and the SP 500 rose
in choppy trading on Tuesday as higher oil prices lifted
Exxon, while the Nasdaq fell after an analyst cut price
targets on tech bellwethers such as Amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's comments appeared
to reassure investors and helped offset the tech weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bernanke said the U.S. economy seemed to have enough
momentum to avoid a "double-dip" recession, while European
leaders were committed to ensuring the survival of the euro
and had enough money to meet obligations of heavily indebted
member nations. For details, see [ID:nLDE65705B]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), up 2.1 percent at $60.56, gave
the Dow its biggest boost. Exxon's stock advanced along with
U.S. crude oil futures CLc1, which rose 61 cents to $72.05 a
barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The markets are in a tug-of-war in the absence of any
real news," said Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager at Swarthmore
Group in Philadelphia. "We've heard some positive comments,
but there is still concern about Europe and the Gulf of
Mexico."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 47.39
points, or 0.48 percent, at 9,863.88. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX was up 1.27 points, or 0.12 percent, at
1,051.74. But the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down
16.32 points, or 0.75 percent, at 2,157.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also providing strength to the Dow was Caterpillar Inc
(CAT.N), which rose 1.1 percent to $56.43 after affirming its
long-term profit goal. [ID:nLDE6571PX]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors remained anxious about debt levels in several
euro-zone countries, as Portugal, Italy and Spain prepared to
sell new bonds this week. It will be Spain's first sale since
a credit rating downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Europe remains No. 1 on the list of obstacles facing the
economy," said Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer of
Advisors Capital Management in Paramus, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Investors don't have the confidence that Europe will be
able to address its shortfalls, or that European growth can
recover enough to help these economies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Large-cap technology companies dragged the Nasdaq lower
after Bank of America-Merrill Lynch cut price targets on
several Internet stocks, citing uncertainty over earnings due
to the dollar's gains against the euro since April. Amazon.com
Inc (AMZN.O) fell 3 percent to $118.38. [ID:nSGE6570FA]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also weighing on tech was Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), which
fell 1.3 percent to $24.95 after the Dow component said it
planned to make a private offering of senior notes in a move
to repay short-term debt. [ID:nN08189730]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The euro EUR=, used by investors in recent weeks as a
barometer for euro-zone stability, gained 0.6 percent to
$1.1986, a session high, a day after the currency hit its
lowest level against the dollar since early 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. stock market's increased volatility in recent
weeks has made investors more sensitive, backing away at the
first hint of selling pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At midday, though, the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, or
VIX, was down 2.4 percent at 35.70. [ID:nN08196317]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) shed 1.6 percent to $136.40
after the banking company was subpoenaed by the commission
probing the financial crisis. [ID:nN07197430]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Goldman lowered its view on the deepwater
drilling sector to "neutral" from "attractive" on expectations
that the moratorium on deepwater drilling would be extended
and bring pressure on day rates and delayed price hikes.
[ID:nSGE6570DJ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S.-listed shares of Transocean Ltd (RIG.N) slid 9.5
percent to $44.48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), another Dow component, was up 0.6
percent at $67.15 after the world's biggest hamburger chain
reported a stronger-than-expected rise in global same-store
sales in May. McDonald's however, said a weak euro would hut
its full-year profit. [ID:nN08226441]

Morgan Securitiesfor Brokerage, Trading and Custodial Services</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Traditional and alternative asset manager EquityStar Capital Management today
announced a new alliance with J.P. Morgan Securities. "EquityStar formed the
relationship because of J.P. Morgan's leading financial execution services as
well as its position as a well-regarded credit counterparty," says Steven
Zoernack, Managing Partner at EquityStar. J.P. Morgan offers innovative
solutions and services across multiple asset classes and geographies and is
committed to providing fund managers like EquityStar with the right tools to
help them grow a more effective and dynamic business by delivering the extensive
capabilities of the entire J.P. Morgan franchise. 

EquityStar Capital Management is a socially responsible, multi-strategy
investment and wealth advisory firm created to provide traditional and
alternative asset management exclusively for global institutional investors,
retirement plan sponsors and certain qualified individuals. The fund will trade
in the universe of the 1500 most liquid global companies and is open to new
investors. By reinvesting some of the firm`s profits into African economies,
EquityStar will help give citizens of Emerging Nations the confidence to
reinvest in their own economy by helping to open up their markets to free trade
and encouraging Foreign Capital. 

EquityStar`s equity long/short strategy will aim for returns of 25-35% while
attempting to keep volatility between 7-10%. The market neutral strategy will
attempt to hedge most of the general market risk and volatility (including ones
similar to the wild swings as of late) out of the portfolio. The new fund
expects to raise $50 million by September 2010, with a target of $100 million or
more by year end. Capacity of the fund is expected at $1.5B. 

Some of the much sought after features of EquityStar include independent tier 1
service providers, transparency, weekly and sometimes daily liquidity, no
lockups, oversight by an outside risk manager, and a financially strong
custodian to protect the assets. The fund`s independent administrator manages
$130 billion in funds and grants trading only access to the investor funds. This
is especially beneficial in today`s climate. 

EquityStar was formed as a Master Feeder structure to accommodate U.S., non-U.S.
and U.S. tax exempt investors. Steven Zoernack is the managing partner and chief
investment officer of EquityStar and serves as portfolio manager for the fund. 

The new fund will utilize sophisticated quantitative systems using technology
such as neural networks to optimize its investment selections and to attempt to
produce a higher Sharpe Ratio, or risk-adjusted rate of return. Using a blend of
fundamental and technical analysis, EquityStar will seek to generate positive
absolute returns in rising, falling and volatile, range-bound markets. 

"The 2008 -2009 market deleveraging left many pricing dislocations within the
capital structure. As a result there are multiple opportunities to capitalize on
mispriced assets. Much of the global equity, debt, currency and commodity
markets still retain valuable relative value and unique opportunities", says
Steven Zoernack. 

Mr. Zoernack has 25 years experience in the investment and finance community and
was formerly with Bear Stearns and Sun Credit. He advised a niche group of
wealthy clients representing several hundred million dollars in investment
assets spanning equities, commodities, and alternative investments. 

According to Steven Zoernack, "We buy companies with good bottom up fundamentals
and sell closely related companies that are overvalued in relation to the
companies we buy while minimizing correlation to the overall markets. A recent
example of this strategy would have been to purchase equally dollar weighted
shares of Visa (V) and sell equally dollar weighted shares of MasterCard (MA),
i.e. purchase 3,000,000 shares of Visa for every 1,000,000 shares of MasterCard
sold short. The trade would have been successful whether the overall stock
market went up or down because of the correctly predicted declining relative
difference in value between the two investments." Deriving returns from the
performance differential within the pair, this approach seeks to achieve
consistency of return by earning small, steady profits on many positions, rather
than trying for large gains that may end up being equally big losses. 

Balanced long/short equity trading - combined with good stock-picking ability -
can provide consistently good performance in any market and even excel in a
market decline. In today`s investment climate, this can be a very attractive
feature to investors. 

Investment in the Fund is not available to the general public.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment from JPMorgan in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
may have taken a $250 million loss this quarter because of bad
bets on coal prices, the New York Post reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm may have employed an arbitrage-trading strategy
linked to the differences in coal prices between northwest
Europe and South Africa, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan was still unwinding its trading positions, the
paper said, citing people familiar with the firm's trading
strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in New York,
said the New York Post story is not right, and declined to
comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The impact of the trading loss would be minimal for
JPMorgan, but would provide ammunition to people who advocate
curbing such proprietary trading by deposit-taking banks, the

&lt;p&gt;Companies Team to Build New Technology and Services That Will Deliver Enterprise
3-D Virtual Collaboration and Communication Solutions to the Life Sciences
Sector
LANSDALE, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and ProtonMedia have entered into a teaming agreement that will
result in the delivery of innovative, 3-D virtual collaboration and
communication solutions engineered specifically for global life sciences
organizations. Under the terms of the agreement, ProtonMedia`s ProtoSphere
technology will be the basis for customized, 3-D virtual collaboration
environments to create high-performance workplaces. IBM`s Global Business
Services division will provide consultancy, integration, deployment, and
installation services to life science customers around the world, leveraging the
ProtoSphere platform. The companies are also in discussions for cross-marketing
initiatives for their solutions. 

"We`re excited to collaborate with ProtonMedia," says Cindy Skirvin, Partner of
Strategy and Transformation Workforce and Talent Solutions for IBM Global
Business Services. "By combining our strengths and breadth of technology
services with ProtonMedia`s virtual collaboration platform, we`re enabling
organizations to address some of the most pressing issues facing them today,
including speeding decision-making across the entire product lifecycle, meeting
human capital management needs, and improving workplace performance overall." 

Skirvin recently joined ProtonMedia`s Executive Advisory Board with Cisco`s Greg
Pelton and Microsoft`s Sam Batterman. Skirvin and ProtonMedia CEO Ron Burns will
be presenting at the Society of Pharmaceutical and Biotech Trainers (SPBT)
Conference in Orlando, Fla., on June 9. Their workshop is entitled "Utilizing
3-D Virtual Worlds and Informal Learning in Employee Training and
Collaboration." They will discuss how ProtoSphere is being used to help life
sciences companies overcome the pressures to operate globally with effective
remote teams, improved recruiting and onboarding, increased productivity and
efficiency and reduced overall costs. They will explore lessons learned from
these experiences, as well as ways that other life sciences companies can use
ProtoSphere for their learning and collaboration needs. 

"IBM continues to break new ground and lead life sciences with forward-thinking
and innovative technology services," says Burns. "IBM recognizes that
ProtoSphere has a significant installed base in life sciences, and that there
are great opportunities for both companies to help life sciences organizations
around the world lower costs, improve team productivity, and speed knowledge
transfer using ProtoSphere. By pairing IBM`s vast resources and domain expertise
with ProtonMedia`s leadership in business-focused virtual collaboration
technology, it`s clear the market can expect to see some eye-opening new
developments in the near future."

&lt;p&gt;Dotfuscator and Runtime Intelligence Support Silverlight Across Full Spectrum of
Versions, Deployment Configurations and Platforms to Offer Developers, Designers
and Architects Universal Means to Monitor and Protect Silverlight Application
Assets
NEW ORLEANS--(Business Wire)--
PreEmptive Solutions, a leading provider of solutions to measure, manage, and
protect applications, announced today that Dotfuscator and Runtime Intelligence
offer the industry`s first universal means to monitor and protect Microsoft
Silverlight applications. 

Universal support means that PreEmptive`s Dotfuscator and Runtime Intelligence
offer the ability to:

* Inject analytics into Silverlight assemblies with no programming or access to
source code to help developers and architects improve software quality and user
experience; 
* Integrate web analytics through Expression Blend and the Silverlight Analytics
Framework to help designers fine tune web application design and value; 
* Compress and link Silverlight assemblies to optimize load time and
performance; 
* Obfuscate Silverlight assemblies to protect Intellectual Property and prevent
tampering; and 
* Process XAP files and automatically re-sign assemblies to automate and
streamline the build process.

Universal support includes:

* Deployment from any server including the Windows Azure Platform to any client
including mobile platforms and out-of-browser implementations; 
* Silverlight versions 2 through 4; 
* Visual Studio versions 2003 through 2010 and versions 1.1 through 4.0 of the
.NET Framework; and 
* Expression Blend versions 3 and 4.

"Silverlight`s power stems in large part from its ability to span devices and
deployment models," said Gabriel Torok, President of PreEmptive Solutions. "Our
Runtime Intelligence offers developers and IT leadership the unique ability to
monitor and measure application impact across these diverse scenarios while
Dotfuscator ensures that their development investments are secure and
efficient." 

"Lack of awareness of usability and lack of adoption of user-centered design
processes and metrics-based validation mean that most enterprises will be
RIA-enabled but `ROI blind.` They won't know whether they have achieved positive
ROI, because they don`t have the processes and tools to capture and analyze
objective data about user behavior." Gartner, Inc. Predicts 2010: Web
Technologies Evolve in Multiple Dimensions: Mobile, Social and Real Time, Ray
Valdes et al, December 14, 2009. 

"The central role of Silverlight is still only just emerging," said Sebastian
Holst, chief marketing officer at PreEmptive Solutions. "Recent, early successes
extending analytics and protection to Windows Mobile 7 and into XAML resources
outside of Silverlight assemblies have only served to reinforce the criticality
of being able to measure user experience and secure applications across both
physical layers and form factors."

&lt;p&gt;  SUNNYVALE, CA, Jun 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Demonstrating continued momentum just six months after announcing its
three-year strategic alliance with Microsoft, NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP) today
announced tight integration with Microsoft(R) technology to enable the
growing number of joint customers and service providers to better
optimize and evolve their infrastructure while dramatically reducing

Customers can now use familiar Microsoft management tools to easily
monitor and manage their virtual environments that include NetApp(R)
storage and build internal and public clouds. This tight integration
between NetApp and Microsoft extends the broad strategic alliance
developed to help customers transform their data centers to be more
efficient, agile, and dynamic. 

    "Tight integration with leading partners like NetApp enables our joint
customers to better manage their storage and all of their physical and

individual VMs via Microsoft System Center Operations Manager. 

    Companies of all sizes are benefiting from the powerful combination of
NetApp and Microsoft technologies. For example, WhiteWater West is
achieving significant efficiencies through streamlined monitoring and
management, while Avanade is successfully transforming its IT environment.

    "WhiteWater West manages our virtual environment, which includes NetApp
storage, using Microsoft System Center Operations Manager. We spend about
10 minutes each month -- just enough time to log in, check reports, and
log out -- and have set up centralized reporting using ApplianceWatch PRO
to trend our storage utilization and deduplication savings," said Dan
Morris, senior systems engineer at WhiteWater West. "We're saving more
than 3 terabytes, or 50%, and we store more than 6 terabytes of data on a
NetApp system, which has physically less than 4 terabytes of disk
storage. The space we've saved through NetApp deduplication alone will
support one year's data growth with enough capacity left over to
integrate one of our international offices into our Microsoft Exchange
system." 

    "Avanade runs more than 500 virtual machines across our production, test,
and development environments using Hyper-V and NetApp storage, along with
integrated management through Microsoft System Center," said Patrick
Cimprich, vice president and chief architect at Avanade. "In April, we
launched an automated self-service portal that enables users to request
and immediately receive virtual machines for up to three weeks. So far
the results are impressive, with virtual environments provisioned within
minutes instead of days. In fact, we're already seeing significant
time-to-market gains and estimate we'll save more than 1,000 IT hours by
the end of the year." 

    To help simplify the creation of self-service portals and automate
management for public and private clouds, NetApp has integrated its
best-of-breed technologies with Microsoft's Dynamic Datacenter Toolkits
(DDTKs). Through this tight integration, NetApp now offers rapid
provisioning and cloning of Windows(R) PowerShell cmdlets for the Dynamic
Datacenter Toolkit, which provides a foundation for building private
clouds. For the Dynamic Datacenter Toolkit for hosters (DDTK-H), which
provides a foundation for building hosted clouds, NetApp can deliver
scripts that leverage the new NetApp Windows PowerShell cmdlet library
for automated failover and rapid provisioning and cloning. The NetApp
Windows PowerShell cmdlet library allows users to easily invoke the
capabilities of NetApp storage solutions via Microsoft System Center, or
similar tools.

    "As part of our strategic alliance, NetApp and Microsoft continue to
deliver on our promise to help customers transform their data centers to
achieve greater efficiencies, increase agility, and respond faster to
changing business needs," said Patrick Rogers, vice president of
Products, Alliances, and Solutions Marketing at NetApp. "Our joint vision
with Microsoft centers on delivering a unified architecture for customers
to design and build highly efficient, virtualized, and dynamic data
centers to enable enterprises, integrators and service providers to
deliver IT as a service."

&lt;p&gt;Due to an early emphasis on getting the right architecture for its Azure cloud platform, which went live in February, Microsoft's cloud service is still missing key features that are available in the company's standalone products, said Microsoft executives at the company's 2010 Tech Ed conference, being held this week in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Even though Windows Azure is being used in a wide variety of applications, there are still features missing," admitted Bob Muglia, president of Microsoft's servers and tools division, in an interview. He was quick to add that Microsoft does plan to offer most of the major features still not available within 12 to 18 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not to say every single feature will be there [in this time frame], but the major gaps will start to close," Muglia said. He mentioned a number of features that only recently have been added to the Azure versions of Microsoft products: One is SQL Server's support of geolocation coordinates as a data type. Another is support of .NET version 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other features, such as SQL Server Integration Services, have yet to be incorporated into the Azure version, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a press conference on Monday, Muglia said that when approaching the cloud, Microsoft chose to focus on cloud-specific attributes such as the ability to automatically scale up to as many instances as needed, or to fail over automatically should one location go down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We chose to build the platform with all these attributes, even at the cost of the features that you need aren't yet available," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge of cloud-enabling applications involves more than simply putting the software online, Muglia explained. "When we built Windows Server Azure, we didn't just take Windows Server and host it in a data center. We asked what it would take to build a global-scale cloud platform." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the company decided to focus on making a platform that would be as scalable as possible, to give it the ability to keep multiple copies of data on hand, and to hit the other requirements that are touted as advantages of cloud computing. "We'll get a subset running first, and then we'll add features over time," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muglia pointed to the SQL Server Azure edition as an example of this approach. He noted that a single instance of SQL Server Azure is running "across thousands of computers in six data centers around the globe," he said. Nobody else has run a single database across so many distributed servers, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domino's Pizza was one of the early adopters of Azure, noted Prashant Ketkar, who is Microsoft's director of product and field marketing for Windows Azure. For Super Bowl Sunday, a popular American sporting event held in January, the company was able to spin up more instances of its online ordering system to handle additional traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about Azure compatibility, Ketkar said that it would take some work in moving an application that currently runs on Windows Server over to Windows Server Azure. By the end of the year, Microsoft will offer the capability to move such programs without any reconfiguration, though these apps won't be able to take advantage of Azure's scaling and other native features, he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Wahbe, who is corporate vice president of server and tools marketing for Microsoft, noted that the Azure platform has a more sophisticated approach than that offered by potential competitors like Google and Amazon due to the fact that it will provide a single platform for all instances of software, whether they run internally on Azure itself, or on another .NET-based cloud platform. "No one else is doing that," he said.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muglia said that thus far, e-mail and collaboration applications have been most often ported to the cloud.  More complex applications, such as enterprise resource planning applications, are not as common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small businesses are more likely to move to the cloud before large ones, because they tend to write their own programs less often, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says traders' role in picking securities not disclosed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Seeks $56 million in compensatory damages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Seeks $1 billion in punitive damages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * SEC examines second Goldman security - FT report
 (Adds FT report that SEC probes another Goldman CDO)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder and Matthew Goldstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - An Australian hedge fund is
suing Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) over an investment in a
subprime mortgage-linked security that contributed to the
fund's demise in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit filed on Wednesday accuses Goldman of
misrepresenting the value of the notorious Timberwolf
collateralized debt obligation, which garnered a lot of
attention during a recent congressional hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Basis Yield Alpha Fund sued Goldman to recoup the $56
million it lost on the CDO, said Eric Lewis, a Washington-based
lawyer for the fund. The suit also seeks $1 billion in punitive
damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The litigation is the latest in a string of legal and
public relations headaches for Goldman. In April, U.S.
securities regulators charged the powerful Wall Street bank
with civil fraud in connection with the structuring and sale of
another CDO called Abacus 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission was examining another
Goldman CDO -- Hudson Mezzanine Funding -- that was not part of
the April civil fraud lawsuit. The FT, citing people familiar
with the matter, said the inquiry into the $2 billion CDO was
part of a wider probe into the CDOs of Wall Street banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Australian hedge fund decided to file suit after months
of settlement talks with Goldman broke down. Reuters on Tuesday
first reported on the likelihood of a lawsuit. The suit was
filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 36-page complaint opens with a rhetorical flourish that
repeats a Goldman executive's description of the Timberwolf CDO
as "one shitty deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; See here for a copy
of the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The suit alleges that Goldman pitched the Timberwolf deal
to Basis even as the bank's sales force and mortgage traders
knew the market for CDOs could soon crumble. In June 2007,
Basis paid $78 million for two pieces of the CDO with a face
value of $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Basis, which financed the transaction with a loan from
Goldman, said it lost more than $50 million when the bank began
making margin calls on the product just weeks after selling the
deal. Basis said the margin calls quickly forced it into
insolvency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You can't say you are basically selling a strong
performing high-yielding security that you know is going to
tank," said Lewis, a partner with the law firm Baach Robinson 
Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "MISGUIDED ATTEMPT"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman called the suit "a misguided attempt by Basis ...
to shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, said, "Basis is now
trying to recoup its losses based on false allegations that it
was misled about aspects of the transaction and market
conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $1 billion Timberwolf CDO and the aggressive tactics
Goldman employed to sell the deal were a focal point of an
April hearing by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. One of the documents unearthed by the panel was
an email in which former Goldman mortgage executive Thomas
Montag called Timberwolf "one shitty deal," just days after the
firm completed the sale to Basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hedge fund's lawsuit, which draws on other documents
introduced by the Senate panel, alleges that Goldman
misrepresented the value of the Timberwolf securities and
failed to disclose that Goldman's trading desk had a role in
working with Greywolf Capital Management in picking
Timberwolf's underlying securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOLDMAN COORDINATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the Senate subcommittee hearing in April, Goldman
Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said the bank's employees are
often unaware of what strategies are being employed elsewhere
at the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have 35,000 people and thousands of traders making
markets throughout our firm," Blankfein said in response to a
question from Senator Carl Levin. "They might have an idea. But
they might not have an idea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the Basis lawsuit raises new questions about the
coordination between Goldman's trading desks and its sales
staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Lehman, who joined Goldman in 2004 and worked as a
managing director in Goldman's mortgage trading operation, met
with representatives of Basis to convince them that the prices
Goldman was selling the Timberwolf deal at were fair and
legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit alleges that Goldman's sales and trading desks
worked together to sell the deal, while Goldman itself was
betting against the performance of the CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is not a bad case for dealing with the whole issue of
how Goldman was conducting its business," said Lewis. "They
were selling bonds like they were used cars, in that you say
what you need to get it done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE LAWSUITS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other investors in Goldman's CDO products are likely to
keep a close eye on the Basis case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If they can prove there is some smoke there, many
investors could feel they have a right to say they were also
harmed in some way," said Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager
and banking analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel in
Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, lawsuits against firms over the marketing of toxic
CDOs have been rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott Berman, a partner with Friedman Kaplan Seiler 
Adelman who frequently represents institutional investors, said
it's a bit of mystery that the financial crisis hasn't spawned
more private litigation over CDOs and other exotic
investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Some of it may be being dealt with in private arbitration
rather than litigation," said Berman. "It's also possible that
many institutions are simply wary of suing each other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master) v. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York, No. 10-04537.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Food and Drug Administration has warned Pfizer Inc for failing to quickly report serious and unexpected potential side effects from its drugs already on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 12-page warning letter to Pfizer Chief Executive Jeffrey Kindler, the FDA cited numerous examples involving some of the company's top-known brands, including impotence drug Viagra, cholesterol pill Lipitor and seizure medicine Lyrica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delays in reporting side effects date back as  far as 2004 and have grown in recent years, according to the FDA's letter that was released by Pfizer on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ronald Pace, director of the FDA's New York office, told Pfizer in the letter dated May 26 that it had not properly documented or investigated reported problems in patients after the drugs were approved for use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"FDA expects drug manufacturers to establish and implement reasonable mechanisms to assure that all serious and unexpected experiences are promptly recorded and investigated," Pace wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pace asked Kindler to arrange a meeting between the company and the agency over the violations. Pfizer said it received the letter June 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA conducted a 6-week inspection of Pfizer's New York headquarters in July and August of 2009, where agency inspectors found system-wide lapses at the world's largest drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient reports "contained serious and unexpected adverse events... that were not submitted until they were identified during the FDA inspection," Pace wrote. Efforts to fix the problem "have been shown to be ineffective," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Pfizer said it would work with the FDA to satisfy the agency "and to assure optimal surveillance and reporting of post-marketing adverse events."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it also said that such individual reports are just one part of its overall monitoring of the drugs it sells and that it "believes we provide complete and accurate data to determine the benefit and risk profile for all of our medicines, and to enable their safe and appropriate use."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its letter, the FDA cited multiple examples of reporting lapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, while Viagra and similar medications are known to cause serious visual problems, including blindness, Pfizer failed to report cases related to its drug within the agency's 15-day deadline "by misclassifying and/or downgrading reports to non-serious without reasonable justification."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with Pfizer's now withdrawn painkiller Bextra, FDA granted the company a waiver allowing 60 days to forward any complaints, a window of time the drugmaker still missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA said Pfizer initially blamed the problems on a new computerized system to handle the reports, saying staff were not properly trained. In a September 2009 response to the agency, Pfizer told the agency it would update user manuals, better train its staff in the computerized reporting system and take other action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite those steps, the FDA said in its letter that the company's actions were "inadequate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer told the FDA that its reporting improved after May 2009, but did not include any data backing up that claim, the FDA said.

He also called for Pfizer to submit a revised plan to fix the problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failure to fix the problems could result in legal action without notice and the FDA could delay action in approving the company's pending drugs, among other penalties, Pace said in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Susan Heavey, additional reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second time in nine months, Microsoft said it would not patch a vulnerability in an older product because creating a fix was "infeasible."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The omission leaves users running Office XP vulnerable to attack unless they take additional steps on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office XP, which debuted in March 2001, remains on Microsoft's list of supported suites -- users will continue to receive security updates through mid-July 2011. But on Tuesday, Microsoft said a COM (component object model) validation vulnerability in the aged suite couldn't be patched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision was explained in one of the 10 updates Microsoft issued yesterday that patched a record-tying 34 vulnerabilities .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The architecture to properly support the fixes to correct validation does not exist on Microsoft Office XP, making it infeasible to build the fixes for Microsoft Office XP products to eliminate the vulnerability," said Microsoft in the MS10-036 security bulletin. "To do so would require rearchitecting a very significant amount of the Microsoft Office XP products, not just the affected components."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if it managed to rework Office XP, Microsoft said the effort would "sufficiently introduce an incompatibility with other applications that there would be no assurance that these Microsoft Office products would continue to operate as designed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is another example of old software showing its age," said Amol Sarwate, the manager of Qualys' vulnerabilities research lab. "The interdependencies of those [.dll files] is almost impossible to patch without upgrading the whole platform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of an actual patch, Microsoft urged Office XP users to download and run an automated tool from its "Fit it" library. The tool, said Microsoft, "provides similar protections against the vulnerability" as the patch offered to people running Office 2003 and Office 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft built a shim to protect Office XP," said Richie Lai, Qualys' director of vulnerability research. "It's a workaround, but Microsoft's not fixing the vulnerable code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fix it shim can be downloaded from Microsoft's support site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the second time since September 2009 that Microsoft has passed on providing a patch. Then, Microsoft declined to patch two bugs in the implementation of TCP/IP in Windows 2000 and Windows XP. TCP/IP is the Web's default suite of connection protocols. Microsoft used the same rationale last September as it did Tuesday to explain why it isn't patching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, I wouldn't call this a trend," said Sarwate when asked whether the two incidents indicate a decision by Microsoft to refuse to patch older products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, users running Office 2003 or Office 2007 must upgrade those suites before applying Tuesday's patch, Microsoft added.

&lt;p&gt;  BIRMINGHAM, AL, Jun 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Health officials in Canada have added a Boxed Warning to the Pfizer
smoking cessation drug Champix(R) (varenicline) alerting consumers to the
risk of neuropsychiatric side effects. The safety warning from Health
Canada notes that patients using Champix(R) in an effort to quit smoking
should be aware that neuropsychiatric side effects have occurred in
people who have a history of psychiatric disorders and in people who have
not suffered psychiatric disorders in the past. In addition to the Boxed
Warning, Health Canada issued a Public Communication noting that
Champix(R) patients who drink alcohol may be at increased risk for
neuropsychiatric side effects. The advisory also mentions the risk of
allergic reactions and side effects ranging from sleepiness and dizziness
to loss of consciousness and seizure. 

    The Health Canada advisory recommends that "Patients should not engage in
potentially hazardous activities, such as driving a car or operating
heavy machinery until they know how they may be affected by Champix(R)."
The Pfizer drug is also under fire in the U.S. Champix(R) is marketed
under the trade name Chantix(R) in the U.S. and similar health alarms
were sounded by the FDA nearly a year ago. The FDA 2009 warning noted
that the stop smoking drug had been linked to a number of
neuropsychiatric side effects including suicide, suicide ideation,
depression and aggression. Pfizer, the manufacturer of Champix(R) and
Chantix(R), faces lawsuits in the U.S. and Canada as a result of serious
injury and death alleged to be associated with its use.

    In the United States, all federal Chantix(R) litigation has been
coordinated in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama before Judge Inge
Johnson. Attorney Ernest Cory of Cory Watson Crowder &amp; DeGaris has been
appointed to serve as Lead Counsel for plaintiffs in this litigation. In
Canada, Cory Watson Crowder &amp; DeGaris and other counsel have filed class
actions against Pfizer on behalf of all Canadian citizens injured by the
drug. 

    Cory Watson Crowder &amp; DeGaris is a Birmingham, Alabama law firm
recognized nationally for its practice in mass torts litigation of
defective medical devices and pharmaceuticals, class actions,
multidistrict litigation and complex litigation including business and
securities litigation and environmental litigation.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may be the biggest software company in the world, but like everyone else who does a deal with Apple, it too was sworn to secrecy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We agreed not to disclose our terms," said Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice president, online audience business at Microsoft. Speaking on stage at Search Marketing Expo in Seattle, he was being pressed to discuss the details of Microsoft's recent agreement with Apple that resulted in the inclusion of Bing as a search option for iPhone users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mehdi said that Apple was impressed with some new Bing features that are in store for iPhone users. "The key is, we did a lot of work on HTML5 and we showed them some prototypes, we demoed them at WWDC. Those really lit people up with all the things we can do with HTML5," he said. Microsoft plans to roll out those new features in the next few months, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Worldwide Developers Conference is an annual Apple conference being held this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They said, 'our customers are saying we'd love to try Bing, and choice is good for consumers," Mehdi said. "So it was an easy discussion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal to put Bing on iPhones may have surprised some onlookers because Apple and Microsoft are fierce competitors in several markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the agreement with Apple, Mehdi talked about a range of subjects related to Bing, which launched just about a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he said the company is proud of the success of Bing, he also admitted that it has had its share of missteps and that Microsoft has a lot of work to do. Bing has gained 20 million new users in a year and gained four points of market share, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some offerings have done surprisingly well. For instance, Bing Recipes, which lets people search for recipes based on food items, has done particularly well. "That thing went nuts. It gets huge traffic," he said. Bing travel, shopping and local services have also done well, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But "there are a lot of things we've tried that didn't work and we have to tune and improve them," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Microsoft recently announced it is shutting down Cashback, a service that gave people rebates for purchases made after searching on Bing. The company has done some distribution deals that weren't worth the investment, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have miles to go before we're doing a good job at the decision engine," he said. Rather than call it a search engine, Microsoft prefers to call Bing a decision engine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mehdi was presented with a cake and a candle to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Bing, he downplayed the significance of the past year's gains. "I don't think we deserve cake and candles. We have a lot of work to do. But it's been a great year," he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is launching a new social search page that displays results from Facebook and Twitter, an executive announced on Wednesday at Search Marketing Expo in Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can visit Bing.com/social once it goes live later Wednesday and search for topics or see what topics are trending. They'll find a summary of the topic as well as a list of top shared links, said Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice president, online audience business at Microsoft. This is a list of links that people are most commonly sharing on Facebook and Twitter. Users will also be able to see how many people are sharing each link. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service displays information from Facebook fan pages as well as popular shared links that people post on their own pages, but only in aggregate. Even if a Facebook user chooses to share all their information with everyone, Microsoft won't show that information publicly in a way that is tied to an individual. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're harnessing the power of what's going on in the social community to help you make better decisions," Mehdi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last year Microsoft began displaying Twitter searches in Bing, but the update announced on Wednesday integrates both Twitter and Facebook in the same place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google also includes Twitter items in its search results, but Mehdi argues Microsoft's offering is better. "We have the best access to this social information at Twitter and Facebook than any other search engine," he said. &lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Acergy: An Attractive Investment

Acergy S.A. (Nasdaq: ACGY) is a leading oilfield contractor engaged in the
designing, procurement, building, installation and servicing of a range of
offshore surface and sub-surface equipment for the oil and gas industry. 

In recent times, the company has successfully pursued a strategic shift towards
the relatively high-margin deepwater markets (engineering and construction) that
have braved commodity pricing and credit market turmoil. Deepwater drilling and
subsequent construction activities are expected to get a further boost from the
arrival of a large number of newbuild rigs in the coming years. 

Acergy is one of only four companies providing a wide range of offshore services
globally. As such, it remains well-positioned to capitalize on the positive
outlook for demand in subsea engineering and construction services over the
coming years. 

Acergy has been relatively untouched by the economic downturn so far, as more
than 60% of the company`s worldwide clients are well capitalized oil majors like
ExxonMobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM), Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX), StatoilHydro ASA (NYSE:
STO) or state-owned energy companies like Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., or Petrobras
(NYSE: PBR). While the occasional delay cannot be ruled out, we believe that
most of the projects sponsored by them will remain unaffected. 

Helped by these factors, the company recently posted better-than-expected first
quarter 2010 results. Moreover, Acergy`s strong backlog, currently standing at
$2.5 billion, offers long-term earnings and cash flow visibility. This enables
the company to navigate through the current downturn better than many of its
peers.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Securities' $716.3
million commercial mortgage-backed securities conduit sale was
meeting with good interest on Wednesday as price guidance
emerged for the largest conduit sale in nearly two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The deal, dubbed "JPMCC 2010-C1," is backed by 36
fixed-rate commercial mortgage loans secured by 96 properties.
JP Morgan Chase Bank loans comprise 76.4 percent of the
offering, while 21.6 percent of loans come from Ladder Capital
Finance, market sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal would be just the second so-called conduit issue
to hit the recovering market that provides credit for office,
retail and apartment buildings since 2008. The conduit
offering is seen as a key gauge of risk appetite for
securities tied to the troubled commercial real estate
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale's largest AAA-rated tranche, a $416.1 million
4.53-year issue, is expected to price at a spread of 140 basis
points over swaps, a second AAA-rated $131.3 million 6.76-year
issue is seen pricing at a spread of 160 basis points over
swaps, while its $61.5 million AAA-rated 9.53-year securities
are expected to come at spread of 160 basis points over swaps,
market sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dwight Asset Management is looking to purchase the
shortest 4.53-year tranche, rated AAA by all three major
rating agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the current environment, we are looking for spread
in the shortest possible duration. We like the five-year A1
tranche, it offers a spread of 140 basis points over swaps. We
are not going to go out beyond that and take on extension
risks for an additional 20 basis points," said Paul Norris,
portfolio manager at Dwight Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A HOPEFUL SIGN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal's AAA-rated issues carry 15 percent credit
enhancement, though some investors had expected higher
levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We were expecting between 15 to 20 percent of credit
enhancement for the AAA-rated tranches, but 15 percent is fine
because all three rating agencies agreed on it, and that gives
us confidence," Norris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recently, banks have more actively been able to bundle
together loans from several borrowers for multi-loan CMBS
issues. The lending is a hopeful sign for a market whose
absence led to soaring defaults and the risk of hundreds more
with maturing loans finding few outlets for refinancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the real estate boom, CMBS conduits were among the
most important engines for growth of the CMBS market. By 2007,
competition for assets grew at a feverish pace, contributing
to economic growth. But the weaker underwriting standards were
also responsible for some of the worst loans today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, RBS priced a $309.7 million CMBS backed by
multiple loans, in the first sale of its kind this year. That
followed three single-borrower deals that were sold in the
CMBS market in December 2009 as the market began to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's upcoming conduit sale includes three
lower-rated tranches. A $16.1 million AA-rated 9.98-year note
issue that is expected to price at a spread of 225 to 240
basis points over swaps, a $26.9 million A-minus rated
9.98-year note issue that is expected to price at a spread of
325 to 340 basis points over swaps, and $14.3 million of
BBB-rated 9.98-year notes that is seen pricing at a spread of
425 to 440 basis points over swaps, market sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit enhancement levels for the AA-rated tranche is
12.75 percent, 9 percent for its A-minus tranche and 7 percent
for its BBB-minus rated issue, sources said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are now near a bottom and could rally before the end of July, the chief U.S. equity strategist for JPMorgan Chase said on Wednesday, adding that U.S. equities currently may be a better bet than European shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Thomas Lee, speaking at the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit in New York, projected the Standard  Poor's 500 index .SPX would climb more than 10 percent to reach 1,200 by the end of July, and hit 1,300 by the end of this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark index on Wednesday ended at 1,055.69 points, down 0.6 percent on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're still pretty bullish on stocks," Lee said. "Consensus right now thinks markets are going to be flat-lined through the summer. I don't think that's what's going to happen. My best guess would be we are making a bottom pretty early in June, and then we have a strong rally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual investors, however, are buying corporate bonds, even though their net supply is shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee does not expect the U.S. economy, which has grown for three straight quarters, to fall back into recession soon, but he sees the U.S. Federal Reserve holding off on raising interest rates until at least well into 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also suggested U.S. equities may be a better investment in the near term than equities in Europe, where several countries face real or perceived structural problems, including the ability to manage their debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock market trading has been volatile in recent weeks, largely because of the European sovereign debt worries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 is down 13 percent from its April 23 closing high for the year and is considered in correction territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Europe may take five, six, seven quarters to really resolve itself," Lee said. "From a U.S. equity perspective, markets are in a state of panic. I just don't think you can maintain a state of panic for six quarters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee is "bullish" on smaller-capitalization stocks and favors domestic cyclical shares, including consumer companies, small-cap industrials, basic materials such as paper and steel, financials and some areas of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - An Australian hedge fund is suing Goldman Sachs Group Inc over an investment in a subprime mortgage-linked security that contributed to the fund's demise in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed Wednesday afternoon, accuses Goldman of misrepresenting the value of the notorious Timberwolf collateralized debt obligation, which garnered a lot of attention during a recent congressional hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis Yield Alpha Fund sued Goldman to recoup the $56 million it lost on the CDO, said Eric Lewis, a Washington-based lawyer for the fund. The suit also seeks $1 billion in punitive damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The litigation is the latest in a string of legal and public relations headaches for Goldman. In April, U.S. securities regulators charged the powerful Wall Street bank with civil fraud in connection with the structuring and sale of another CDO called Abacus 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund decided to file suit after months of settlement talks with Goldman broke down. Reuters on Tuesday first reported on the likelihood of a lawsuit. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 36-page complaint opens with a rhetorical flourish that repeats a Goldman executive's description of the Timberwolf CDO as "one shitty deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See here for a copy of the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit alleges that Goldman pitched the Timberwolf deal to Basis even as the bank's sales force and mortgage traders knew the market for CDOs could soon crumble. In June 2007, Basis paid $78 million for two pieces of the CDO with a face value of $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis, which financed the transaction with a loan from Goldman, said it lost more than $50 million when the bank began making margin calls on the product just weeks after selling the deal. Basis said the margin calls quickly forced it into insolvency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't say you are basically selling a strong performing high-yielding security that you know is going to tank," said Lewis, a partner with the law firm Baach Robinson  Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"MISGUIDED ATTEMPT"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman called the suit "a misguided attempt by Basis ... to shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, said, "Basis is now trying to recoup its losses based on false allegations that it was misled about aspects of the transaction and market conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $1 billion Timberwolf CDO and the aggressive tactics Goldman employed to sell the deal were a focal point of an April hearing by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. One of the documents unearthed by the panel was an email in which former Goldman mortgage executive Thomas Montag called Timberwolf "one shitty deal," just days after the firm completed the sale to Basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund's lawsuit, which draws on other documents introduced by the Senate panel, alleges that Goldman misrepresented the value of the Timberwolf securities and failed to disclose that Goldman's trading desk had a role in working with Greywolf Capital Management in picking Timberwolf's underlying securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN COORDINATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Senate subcommittee hearing in April, Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said the bank's employees are often unaware of what strategies are being employed elsewhere at the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have 35,000 people and thousands of traders making markets throughout our firm," Blankfein said in response to a question from Senator Carl Levin.

&lt;p&gt; * Fund says Goldman misrepresented value of Timberwolf CDO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says traders' role in picking securities not disclosed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Seeks $56 million in compensatory damages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Seeks $1 billion in punitive damages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Updates with timing of filing of lawsuit)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder and Matthew Goldstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - An Australian hedge fund is
suing Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) over an investment in a
subprime mortgage-linked security that contributed to the
fund's demise in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit, filed Wednesday afternoon, accuses Goldman of
misrepresenting the value of the notorious Timberwolf
collateralized debt obligation, which garnered a lot of
attention during a recent congressional hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Basis Yield Alpha Fund sued Goldman to recoup the $56
million it lost on the CDO, said Eric Lewis, a Washington-based
lawyer for the fund. The suit also seeks $1 billion in punitive
damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The litigation is the latest in a string of legal and
public relations headaches for Goldman. In April, U.S.
securities regulators charged the powerful Wall Street bank
with civil fraud in connection with the structuring and sale of
another CDO called Abacus 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hedge fund decided to file suit after months of
settlement talks with Goldman broke down. Reuters on Tuesday
first reported on the likelihood of a lawsuit. The suit was
filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 36-page complaint opens with a rhetorical flourish that
repeats a Goldman executive's description of the Timberwolf CDO
as "one shitty deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; See here for a copy
of the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The suit alleges that Goldman pitched the Timberwolf deal
to Basis even as the bank's sales force and mortgage traders
knew the market for CDOs could soon crumble. In June 2007,
Basis paid $78 million for two pieces of the CDO with a face
value of $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Basis, which financed the transaction with a loan from
Goldman, said it lost more than $50 million when the bank began
making margin calls on the product just weeks after selling the
deal. Basis said the margin calls quickly forced it into
insolvency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You can't say you are basically selling a strong
performing high-yielding security that you know is going to
tank," said Lewis, a partner with the law firm Baach Robinson 
Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "MISGUIDED ATTEMPT"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman called the suit "a misguided attempt by Basis ...
to shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, said, "Basis is now
trying to recoup its losses based on false allegations that it
was misled about aspects of the transaction and market
conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $1 billion Timberwolf CDO and the aggressive tactics
Goldman employed to sell the deal were a focal point of an
April hearing by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. One of the documents unearthed by the panel was
an email in which former Goldman mortgage executive Thomas
Montag called Timberwolf "one shitty deal," just days after the
firm completed the sale to Basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hedge fund's lawsuit, which draws on other documents
introduced by the Senate panel, alleges that Goldman
misrepresented the value of the Timberwolf securities and
failed to disclose that Goldman's trading desk had a role in
working with Greywolf Capital Management in picking
Timberwolf's underlying securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOLDMAN COORDINATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the Senate subcommittee hearing in April, Goldman
Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said the bank's employees are
often unaware of what strategies are being employed elsewhere
at the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have 35,000 people and thousands of traders making
markets throughout our firm," Blankfein said in response to a
question from Senator Carl Levin. "They might have an idea. But
they might not have an idea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the Basis lawsuit raises new questions about the
coordination between Goldman's trading desks and its sales
staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Lehman, who joined Goldman in 2004 and worked as a
managing director in Goldman's mortgage trading operation, met
with representatives of Basis to convince them that the prices
Goldman was selling the Timberwolf deal at were fair and
legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit alleges that Goldman's sales and trading desks
worked together to sell the deal, while Goldman itself was
betting against the performance of the CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is not a bad case for dealing with the whole issue of
how Goldman was conducting its business," said Lewis. "They
were selling bonds like they were used cars, in that you say
what you need to get it done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE LAWSUITS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other investors in Goldman's CDO products are likely to
keep a close eye on the Basis case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If they can prove there is some smoke there, many
investors could feel they have a right to say they were also
harmed in some way," said Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager
and banking analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel in
Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, lawsuits against firms over the marketing of toxic
CDOs have been rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott Berman, a partner with Friedman Kaplan Seiler 
Adelman who frequently represents institutional investors, said
it's a bit of mystery that the financial crisis hasn't spawned
more private litigation over CDOs and other exotic
investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Some of it may be being dealt with in private arbitration
rather than litigation," said Berman. "It's also possible that
many institutions are simply wary of suing each other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master) v. Goldman

&lt;p&gt;While the race to make the fastest browser JavaScript engine continues at a heated pace, Microsoft senior product manager Pete LePage reminded the audience at Microsoft TechEd, held in New Orleans this week, that the speed of JavaScript execution is only one aspect of browser speed, and not particularly a dominant one at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Performance is really a multipart system. It is not something that if you just have a really fast JavaScript engine, then your browser will be fast. Not always will performance be dependent on the JavaScript engine," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LePage's presentation focused on the latest developer edition of Internet Explorer 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make his point, LePage, who works on the Internet Explorer team, showed the results of an analysis of four sample Web sites that were studied by the IE developer team. Two were Excel Web applications, and two were unnamed news sites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Excel Web apps, executing the JavaScript took less than 10 percent of the total workload to render a page. For the two news sites, the JavaScript execution took between 20 percent and 35 percent of the workload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all these cases, JavaScript execution was a big, though not dominant, portion of the work needed to display a Web page or Web application. Other chores that chewed up a lot of processing time included rendering, which took about 20 percent of the time in each case, and layout, which took anywhere from under 10 percent to over 30 percent. Formatting, CSS and HTML parsing also required some attention as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we can get JavaScript engine faster, which is important, then we have to get other things faster as well. We have to get rendering faster. We have to get the performance of the browser in general faster," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, the effectiveness of the JavaScript engine is measured by the SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark. He noted in these cases, "It is an interesting test, in terms of looking at how fast a number of things happen, but it doesn't necessarily tell us how fast the browser is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that the IE9 JavaScript engine is a slouch. Microsoft is revamping its JavaScript engine for the IE 9 release, making a number of changes that should speed performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, the new JavaScript engine starts to interpret the code as soon as it is downloaded, and can use additional cores of the user's computer to compile the script into byte code so then when it is called, it will run very quickly. "Once we switch to compiled code, the code is running significantly faster," He said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most notably, the browser will also be able to offload visual rendering duties to GPUs (graphics processing units).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the speed of the new browser, LePage put it through the SunSpider paces, comparing it to the speed of IE8 under the same test. The IE8 browser took about 3800 milliseconds to complete the benchmark. In contrast, Platform Preview 2 had executed the test in under 500 milliseconds. This beats the scores of both Firefox 3.6 and 3.7, LePage noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example of how both the new JavaScript engine and GPU offloading speeded IE9, LePage showed a demonstration, from the Microsoft test site of some JavaScript-based browser icons that spun around. In IE9, they spun smoothly, at 60 frames per second (FPS), according to LePage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, LePage showed the same demonstration in Google Chrome, "which isn't compiling the code" he said, and wasn't using hardware-assisted acceleration. This same page struggled along at about 2 FPS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LePage also talked about how compliant IE9 would be with the nest generation HTML5 and related set of Web standards now being developed. In his keynote earlier this week, Bob Muglia, Microsoft president of software and tools, proclaimed that IE9 would support HTML5. LePage offered a more nuanced view of that statement, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The browser would support much of HTML5, LePage said, though he would not say definitively that IE9 would support all of the specification, mainly because the specification is still in a state of flux. The current specification for HTML5, when printed out, is over 1,100 pages, up from 900 pages in February, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're putting as much effort into making sure we get as much HTML5 support as we can," he said, noting that it is still be revised, and will be for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LePage also would not comment on if IE9 would support Canvas, or when the final release date of IE9 would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LePage plans to post a copy of his presentation slides on his blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The recent sell-off in industrial commodities may have been sharper than investors expected but they could stage an equally surprising rebound if emerging nations continue to rapidly build infrastructure, a strategist for top commodities trader Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global economy, which drove base metals markets to multi-month lows this week and weighed on oil prices, could become a boon to industrial commodities in the next 12 months, Abby Joseph Cohen, senior U.S. investment strategist for Goldman, said at the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our view is that commodity prices will be rising again," Cohen said. Goldman's latest monthly forecast projects a 23 percent rise in energy prices over the next year and 6 percent growth for base metals such as copper, aluminum, zinc, nickel and tin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, the No. 1 investment bank and commodities trader on Wall Street, expects prices of precious metals such as gold to rose 17 percent over the next 12 months. Gold hit record highs above $1,250 an ounce this week. Goldman is only bearish on agriculture, which it expects to contract by 1 percent over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For industrial commodities particularly, infrastructure growth in the BRIC nations -- comprising Brazil, Russia, India and China -- will be key, Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The demand globally for commodities may surprise ... because the growth of the economy in those nations may understate the need for certain commodities like industrial metals," Cohen said. "If you are building new cities, if you are building transportation systems, you need more of these materials than you otherwise would."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude prices were up almost 4 percent in New York on Wednesday after an unexpected drawdown in oil stockpiles in the United States -- the world's No. 1 energy consumer. Oil prices were down about 10 percent on the year earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O/R&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copper prices also rebounded on Wednesday, rising almost 3 percent in New York and London, after unofficial data showed strong growth in exports by top metals consumer China MET/L. Copper had been down 20 percent on the year just two sessions ago on fears that the European debt crisis could lead to a double-dip recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen said she does not see a double-dip recession, but she expects U.S. economic growth will slow in the second half of 2010, primarily because of a drag in creating new employment to replace the millions of jobs lost during the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she said U.S. banks were no longer tightening lending conditions for small- and medium-sized businesses and that federal interest rates were likely to stay low for a long time -- all good signs for businesses and their demand for basic resources like commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inventories of some commodities were also falling faster than supply could come on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also haven't really seen very much investment in the way of petroleum infrastructure for many years and there is not very much spare capacity," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States is not facing a double-dip recession, and with inflation low conditions are setting up for "equities in general" to do well, Goldman Sachs' senior U.S. investment strategist Abby Joseph Cohen said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An SP 500 index level of 1,250 to 1,300 points .SPX is "fair value and achievable" over the next six to 12 months, Cohen said at the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 was trading on Wednesday at 1,075 points, up 1.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen, president of Goldman's Global Markets Institute, said the biggest worry shadowing the U.S. economy as it moves past the deep recession that started in late 2007 is the slow pace of job creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Concern No. 1 -- and it far outstrips everything else -- is the labor market. We all know that job creation has resumed, but it has resumed at a very slow pace," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments by Cohen, who began her career as an economist with the Federal Reserve Board, echoed those made Wednesday by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. recovery is on a solid footing but it could be years before the jobs lost during the deep recession of 2008-2009 are restored, Bernanke said in testimony to the House Budget Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Cohen said that the weak May payrolls report, which was released on Friday, triggering a sell-off in the U.S. stock market, should be viewed as "noise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Monthly data are often misleading. You need to look at the figures on a two-to-three-month rolling basis, on which basis there has been a modest increase in hiring," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs currently estimates U.S. GDP growth for 2010 at 2.9 percent following the 2.4-percent contraction in 2009. But after 3.0 percent growth in the first and second quarters, growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2010 will moderate to just 1.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen said that with inflation and unit labor costs under control and more modest growth ahead, the Federal Reserve will wait "as long as possible" before raising interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from the Fed, showing that standards for commercial and industrial loans are no longer tightening, was among the positive elements at work in the U.S. economy, Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are, we think, from a commercial standpoint, past the worst in terms of the availability of credit," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also forecasts corporate spending on technology as a source of strength for the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many individual investors in the United States have been rattled by stock market volatility in recent years, from the slide that savaged retirement accounts in 2008 to the startling and still unexplained "flash crash" on May 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Cohen said the defensive response -- to stay out of the stock market altogether -- was a worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It makes me somewhat concerned that individuals are flocking to bond funds," she said. "Those investments may not hold up for them long term" if inflation starts to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, though, U.S. inflation is low -- forecast by Goldman at 1.7 percent for 2010 and 0.6 percent for 2011 -- which is supportive of higher stock price/earnings multiples, Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 is trading at about 14 to 14.5 times this year's expected 2010 earnings per share. "With inflation under control you might expect an 18 P/E ratio," Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EUROPE GROWTH A WORRY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning to Europe, Cohen said that the euro, which on Tuesday traded at its lowest point since 2006, is "about where it should be" for now given the sovereign debt crisis shadowing parts of the Continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly there are worries about European growth," she said, adding that countries such as Spain are "moving on the right path" toward restoring fiscal balance, but "without being too extreme."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eurozone faces its toughest test to date from the rolling sovereign debt crisis, but there is "sufficient political determination" to ensure it survives, Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany, whose exports are skewed to the type of industrial equipment now seeing rising demand, stands to benefit from the weak euro, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Padraic Cassidy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), focusing on constitutional law,
said today it is pleased a federal district court in New York has extended an
order permitting 13-year-old Raymond Hosier, who was suspended indefinitely for
wearing a Rosary to school, to remain in class and to finish out the school year
wearing his Rosary. U.S. District Court Judge Lawrence E. Kahn today signed an
order in which both sides agree to extend a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)
through September 2010. 

"It's important that Raymond be permitted to complete this school year with his
Rosary in place," said Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel of the ACLJ, which represents
Raymond Hosier in the case. "The lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of
the school district's dress code policy will continue to move forward. And we
remain confident the court will ultimately conclude that Raymond's rights were
violated and the dress code policy is not only flawed but unconstitutional as
well. At the same time, by extending the order, the school district has a window
of opportunity to utilize common sense. We stand ready to resolve this issue -
either inside or outside court - to ensure that Raymond's rights are permanently
protected." 

In the stipulation order signed today, both parties agreed to extend the TRO
through September 10, 2010 "as the parties work to resolve this matter over the
summer. . ." At the same time, the court ordered that school officials are
enjoined from preventing Raymond from attending school while wearing the Rosary
outside his clothing through September 10, 2010. 

You can read the order here:
http://www.aclj.org/media/pdf/Hosier-Stip-Order_20100609.pdf

Today's order extends a TRO that was issued June 1, 2010 which cleared the way
for Raymond to return to Oneida Middle School in Schenectady with his Rosary in
place. 

The ACLJ filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Raymond Hosier and his mother,
Chantell. 

The suit requests a jury trial and asserts that the school's actions violated
Raymond's constitutional rights of speech and expression, free exercise of
religion, and due process under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. 

In suspending Raymond, school officials contended that wearing a Rosary that
included religious beads violated the school district's dress code policy and
asserted that the Rosary is considered a gang-related symbol. 

In the complaint, the ACLJ contends that Raymond wears the Rosary to express his
faith in God and honor the memory of a deceased uncle and a brother who died
with that very same Rosary in his hand. The complaint also asserts that Raymond
is not a member of any criminal gang and does not wear his Rosary to promote
gang membership or violence. The ACLJ complaint also notes that Raymond has been
wearing the Rosary since September 2009 without causing "any disruption to the
school environment."

&lt;p&gt;  MONTREAL, Jun 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SoftCity, the first social commerce site dedicated to software, today
announced it is a network partner for Microsoft(R) BizSpark(TM) Program
to further assist start-up developers with advanced tools and support for
software development. Any qualified and registered developers on SoftCity

privately held company building a software-based product or service (even
using open source code), in business for fewer than three years, and with
less than US$ 1M in annual revenue.

    BizSpark(TM) is a worldwide program launched in late 2008 by Microsoft to
support developers and offer start-ups all the software (Visual Studio,
Expression, Windows Server, SQL Server, Azure) and Microsoft hosting
solutions (PC, Cloud, Web, Mobile, Embedded) they need to successfully
develop their software applications. Since it was launched, more than
30,000 startups worldwide have benefited from all the latest Microsoft

started today in the fantastic adventure of creating new software
applications," said Blaise Rabaud, CEO of SoftCity.

    SoftCity: Microsoft's Network Partner

    With one of its main objectives being to bring developers together around
a strong community, especially to offer them an opportunity to create
software with the support of their peers, SoftCity quite naturally became
a Microsoft Network Partner. SoftCity enthusiastically recommends the
Microsoft(R) BizSpark(TM) program to any developer involved in innovative
and ambitious projects. In addition to the outstanding technological
benefits (development tools, server platforms, technical support and even
"cloud computing") offered under this program, any qualified startup will
benefit from high visibility in the community of entrepreneurs, business
angels and company incubators, as well as the opportunity to make its
products known.

    "We are thrilled that SoftCity, which brings many independent developers
into its community, has joined our network of partners for the
BizSpark(TM) program," declared Cliff Reeves, General Manager, Emerging
Business Team at Microsoft. "SoftCity, one of the first communities built
around software, bringing together users, experts and developers,
features a completely innovative social-commerce concept for BizSpark
members to engage with each other, and to try and buy software."

between Microsoft and Avanquest, founding member of SoftCity. "Based on
our long and successful partnership with Microsoft, Avanquest understands
the benefits that Microsoft's products and ecosystem can provide to young
companies," said Bruno Vanryb, co-founder and CEO of Avanquest Software.

a strong community, especially to offer them an opportunity to create
software with the support of their peers, SoftCity quite naturally became
a Microsoft Network Partner. SoftCity enthusiastically recommends the
Microsoft(R) BizSpark(TM) program to any developer involved in innovative
and ambitious projects. In addition to the outstanding technological
benefits (development tools, server platforms, technical support and even
"cloud computing") offered under this program, any qualified startup will
benefit from high visibility in the community of entrepreneurs, business
angels and company incubators, as well as the opportunity to make its
products known.

    "We are thrilled that SoftCity, which brings many independent developers
into its community, has joined our network of partners for the
BizSpark(TM) program," declared Cliff Reeves, General Manager, Emerging
Business Team at Microsoft. "SoftCity, one of the first communities built
around software, bringing together users, experts and developers,
features a completely innovative social-commerce concept for BizSpark
members to engage with each other, and to try and buy software."

    This valuable new partnership was made possible thanks to the strong ties
between Microsoft and Avanquest, founding member of SoftCity. "Based on
our long and successful partnership with Microsoft, Avanquest understands
the benefits that Microsoft's products and ecosystem can provide to young
companies," said Bruno Vanryb, co-founder and CEO of Avanquest Software.
"The social commerce aspects of SoftCity and the support and software of
BizSpark is an extremely powerful combination of tools for startup
developers."

&lt;p&gt;200 charities to share more than $5 million in charitable donations in online
giving campaign
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Chase announced today it has kicked off its Chase Community Giving Summer 2010
program on the Facebook platform. The program will award more than $5 million to
be shared among 200 charities with grants ranging from $20,000 to $250,000.
Participants can begin voting for their favorite charities June 15. 

The first Chase Community Giving program, held earlier this year, was the most
popular corporate philanthropy crowdsourcing campaign of its type. More than 2
million users on the Facebook platform became fans of the program and helped
decide which, of more than 500,000 charities, should receive a share of $5
million. More than 100 winners from 31 states were selected. Chase Community
Giving is back again - and improved. The number of charities eligible to receive
awards has doubled and several new tools have been introduced. 

"As a company, we`re highly committed to serving our local communities, and
Chase Community Giving has proven to be an innovative approach to philanthropic
giving at the local level. We`ve now seen that when corporations listen to the
communities they serve, they can learn a great deal and, in turn, help worthy
causes achieve goals that would have never been possible," Jamie Dimon, Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, said. 

Chase Community Giving provides an opportunity for small and local organizations
to build awareness of their causes on a national level. And it allows
individuals to help direct where the Chase donations should go through the power
of the Facebook platform. 

"This initiative is a new paradigm for corporate giving because it removes
logistical barriers for small non-profits, provides a national platform for
small and newly established charities to be heard, and allows individuals to
have a voice in our philanthropic giving," Kimberly Davis, President of the
JPMorgan Chase Foundation, said. 

Based on feedback from participants, the program has been updated and improved.
Charities will be able to edit their charity profiles and add meaningful media
to help tell their stories in the form of videos and photos. Badges have been
introduced, which users earn to indicate their commitment to their community; in
addition a Gift Vote feature has been added, which lets users earn the right to
give additional votes to a friend. The Leaderboard is a returning feature, which
has been improved, and will be used throughout the program. It willreflect the
charities` standings based on total votes received and will be updated at least
once daily. 

The site for the Summer 2010 Program is live now and can be found at
http://apps.facebook.com/chasecommunitygiving. Charities can start personalizing
their pages and voting begins June 15 and ends at 11:59 PM EDT on July 12.
Winners will be determined on or around July 13. 

To underscore the smaller and local focus of the program, 501(c)(3) public
non-profits with operating expenses of $1 million or less will be eligible. The
top vote-receiving charities meeting the eligibility and other requirements of
the program rules will receive the top grants. The eligible charity with the
most votes receives $250,000; the top 4 runners-up receive $100,000 each; and
the remaining eligible charities in the top 200 will each receive $20,000. There
will be one round of voting. Winning charities chosen by voters in the last
program are not eligible for the Summer 2010 program. Like the previous round,
the $5 million to be granted in Chase Community Giving is in addition to the
bank`s regular philanthropic giving. JPMorgan Chase donates more than $100
million annually to charitable giving. 

Earlier this year, Chase Community Giving fans selected Invisible Children, a
San Diego-based charity focused on returning child soldiers in Africa to school,
to receive a $1 million grant in the final round of the program. The 100
recipients of Chase Community Giving grants supported a wide range of meaningful
causes from charities supporting the families of U.S. Iraq and Afghanistan war
veterans, to helping the homeless, to providing education for disadvantaged
students, to supporting families and children battling illnesses. 

As before, Chase Community Giving will have an Advisory Board for the program,
which is a panel of individuals from a diverse range of philanthropic
backgrounds to lend their knowledge and experience to the program. Further
details about the Advisory Board and its members will be announced later this
month.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) may be looking at new legal headache, as settlement talks with an Australian hedge fund that invested $100 million in a now toxic mortgage-linked security appear to be breaking down, a source said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawyers working for the Basis Yield Alpha Fund could file a lawsuit against Goldman over the transaction -- called Timberwolf -- as early as Wednesday, said a person familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiations between Goldman and Basis began months ago, but have heated up in the wake of a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Goldman over another subprime mortgage-linked security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund purchased a $100 million slug of the Timberwolf collateralized debt obligation in June 2007 at a time when the market for mortgage-linked securities was about to crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The managers of the Basis fund claim Goldman's sales and trading desk misled them and the ill-timed Timberwolf purchase helped hasten the fund's demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Dobson, a director for the Basis fund, declined to comment on whether the fund's lawyers would file a lawsuit. Dobson, reached at Basis Capital Group's offices in Sydney, said managers of the one-time $500 million fund are committed to reaching the "best possible outcome" for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Naturally we are pretty passionate about the events of 2007," said Dobson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $1 billion Timberwolf CDO was memorably described by a former Goldman executive as "one shitty deal," according to an email disclosed during a hearing in April by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Basis does sue over the Timberwolf deal, it would come less than two months after the SEC sued Goldman for civil fraud in connection with the structuring and sale of another CDO called Abacus 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIGHT OR SETTLE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has vowed to fight the SEC charges, but there has been speculation on Wall Street that the investment firm is looking to cut a deal with regulators. Analysts estimate the cost of settling the SEC matter could cost Goldman between $500 million and $1 billion in fines and restitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a breakdown in the settlement talks with the Basis fund may be an indication that Goldman is no mood to roll over and reach a quick deal with the SEC either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are indications that Goldman's relations with regulators are becoming increasingly strained and testy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, members of a Congressional panel that's looking into the cause of the financial crisis blasted Goldman for dumping some 2.5 billion pages of digitized records on it, after initially refusing to comply with a request for information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Angelides, chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, said it was as if Goldman pulled "a dump truck to our offices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's decision to play hardball with the commission might make sense from a tactical point of view. But the firm's feisty approach toward dealing with regulators and politicians isn't winning over investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman are down 26 percent since the SEC filed its lawsuit on April 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They should be bending over backwards to cooperate and get the things taken care of so they can get people focused back on the franchise and the business," said Walter Todd, a portfolio manager with Greenwood Capital, which owns Goldman debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder and Matthew Goldstein)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mortgage industry technology developer reaches significant milestones
COLUMBIA, Md.--(Business Wire)--
IndiSoft, LLC , a technology developer focusing its efforts on the default
service management industry, announced today that its RxOffice platform has
processed more than 18 million transactions since 2008. The company also is in
the process of receiving third-party certification from Microsoft&#174;, which will
validate the platform`s security and scalability. 

"The transaction numbers show that our technology is proven and is capable of
handling the growing needs of the default management industry," said Sanjeev
Dahiwadkar, CEO and president of IndiSoft. "Our continued commitment to the
industry and flexibility is evident in the on-going platform adjustments we make
based on changes from the federal government, investors, GSEs, insurers and
servicers. 

"Soon we will receive Microsoft certification, which will demonstrate how
committed we are to providing the mortgage industry with technology that will
improve the default services process and save all parties involved time and
financial resources." 

Essentially, RxOffice is a case management, workflow management and document
management platform that has processed more than 14.5 million cases in workflow
transactions as of June 2010. RxOffice also includes a robust document
management solution and houses over 3.5 million documents relating to mortgage
defaults. 

"Mortgage defaults are at unprecedented volumes and millions of HAMP trial
modifications are stalled from lack of supporting documents," said Anna Taylor,
CTO of IndiSoft. "While legacy systems have been challenged in storing and
associating specific documents with specific cases, RxOffice can manage
high-volumes and sorting documents properly."

to its users.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, June 9 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
plans to invest more than $1 billion to enhance crude oil
output at Malaysia's maturing Tapis field in 2013, a company
spokeswoman said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Front-end engineering at the enhanced oil recovery project
has started, she said, but declined to comment on the
production volume of the flagship light sweet grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2008, subsidiary ExxonMobil Exploration and Production
Malaysia Inc signed a production sharing contract (PSC) with
Malaysia's national energy company Petronas [PETR.UL] to invest
$2.1 billion in the enhanced oil recovery project at Tapis and
six other oil and gas fields -- Seligi, Guntong, Semangkok,
Irong Barat, Tabu and Palas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil is the operator and the companies each have a 50
percent stake in the PSC.
 Petronas said last year that Malaysia's overall crude output
has fallen to 550,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 600,000 bpd in
2008, as ageing fields took their toll after years of steady
production levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall output for both crude oil and condensates fell to
650,000 bpd versus 700,000 bpd last year, the company had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Output from the Tapis field, off peninsular Malaysia's east
coast, has fallen to some 200,000 bpd from its production of
around 300,000 bpd for the past few years, sources close to the
development had said. [ID:nSP430900]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petronas' chief Shamsul Azhar Abbas told local media last
week the company wants to set aside more resources for oil
fields at home and trim overseas exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tapis has an API gravity of 45.6 and contains 0.0324
percent sulphur.

&lt;p&gt;Today, ING CEO Jan Hommen will address the Goldman Sachs European Financials Conference
in Madrid, Spain. In his presentation, Mr. Hommen will repeat the progress ING has made
through the end of the first quarter in delivering on its previously stated strategic
priorities. 

 

In his presentation, Mr. Hommen will review the good progress made in the orderly
separation of Banking and Insurance, and reiterate ING's objective of creating strong
companies that are able to operate on a standalone basis by the end of this year.
Importantly, ING has set clear targets to strengthen the performance of both Banking and
Insurance, and ING's first quarter results show encouraging progress in both businesses
towards achieving them.

 

Mr. Hommen will also reiterate that in the current environment with volatile markets and
a fragile economic recovery, managing risk and leverage remains an important priority.
In this respect, ING reduced its Southern European sovereign debt exposure during the
second quarter. ING also continues to steadily reduce its exposure to real estate,
including an evaluation of the position of Real Estate Investment Management within the
Banking business and a reassessment of Real Estate Development projects that started in
the fourth quarter.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft researchers have slashed desktop energy use with a sleep proxy system that maintains a PC's network presence even when it is turned off or put into standby mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 Microsoft research projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has deployed the sleep proxy system to more than 50 active users in the Building 99 research facility in Redmond, Wash., according to the Microsoft Research Web site and a paper that will be presented at the Usenix technical conference in Boston later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A number of studies have noted that most office machines are left on irrespective of user activity," Microsoft researchers write in a paper titled "Sleepless in Seattle no longer." "At Microsoft Research, we find hundreds of desktop machines awake, day or night &#8211; a significant waste of both energy and money. Indeed, potential savings can amount to millions of dollars per year for larger enterprises."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep proxies allow machines to be turned off while keeping them connected to the network, waking the machines when a user or IT administrator attempts to access it remotely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's research group isn&#8217;t the first to work on a sleep proxy &#8211; or even the only one presenting sleep proxy research at Usenix &#8211; but Microsoft contends that most previous work has evaluated sleep proxies only in small testbeds or simulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not aware of any paper detailing the deployment of any of these proxying solutions in an operational enterprise network on actual user machines," Microsoft said. "This is disconcerting: systems that work well on testbeds often encounter potentially serious challenges when deployed in operational networks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's sleep proxy system has been operational for most of the past year, with software deployed on users' primary workstations. So far, the system has allowed user machines to sleep more than 50% of the time, but Microsoft hopes to increase that number by minimizing "interference from IT management tasks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Sleep Proxy system is based on two components: server-side software called SleepServer, and SleepNotifier, which runs on client machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SleepNotifier alerts SleepServer just before the client goes to sleep, and SleepServer ensures that all incoming traffic meant for the client comes to the proxy instead," Microsoft writes in another article titled "Trying to cure PC insomnia." "The proxy server's role is to monitor traffic and respond accordingly. For some requests, it responds on behalf of the client so the client can continue sleeping, and others it ignores. Some traffic, such as a user access request, causes the SleepServer proxy to awaken the client and present the user with apparently seamless remote access."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft is using the system with Windows, it is designed to be agnostic to the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SleepServer component is described by a separate group of researchers from the University of California, San Diego, who will also present a paper at Usenix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, titled "SleepServer: A Software-Only Approach for Reducing the Energy Consumption of PCs within Enterprise Environments," says energy savings from the system should range from 60% to 80%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desktops provide a bigger target for energy savings than laptops, because laptops consume less power when active and are more often put to sleep by users, Microsoft researchers said. In modern buildings, 50% to 80% of electricity used can be attributed to IT equipment, particularly desktops, the UC-San Diego researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing may help reduce energy use in desktops and mobile clients, however, according to two other research papers that will be presented at Usenix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Usenix paper, "The Case for Energy-Oriented Partial Desktop Migration," looks at migrating idle desktop sessions to the cloud to reduce energy costs. A second paper, "Energy Efficiency of Mobile Clients in Cloud Computing," measures energy use of mobile handheld devices and discusses "implications for the design and engineering of energy efficient mobile cloud computing solutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jbrodkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about data center in Network World's Data Center section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;A Google engineer today published attack code that exploits a zero-day vulnerability in Windows XP, giving hackers a new way to hijack and infect systems with malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But other security experts objected to the way the engineer disclosed the bug -- just five days after it was reported to Microsoft -- and said the move is more evidence of the ongoing, and increasingly public, war between the two giants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it is investigating the vulnerability and would have more information on its next steps later today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Tavis Ormandy, a security engineer who works for Google in Switzerland, hackers can leverage a flaw in Windows' Help and Support Center, which lets users easily access and download Microsoft help files from the Web and can be used by support technicians to launch remote support tools on a local PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ormandy posted details of the vulnerability and proof-of-concept attack code to the Full Disclosure security mailing list early Thursday. "Upon successful exploitation, a remote attacker is able to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the current user," Ormandy wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ormandy, his attack scenario works using all major browsers, including Microsoft's newest, IE8. The bug is even easier to exploit when the machine has Windows Media Player, software that's installed by default with all versions of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ormandy also said he had come up with a way to suppress a warning prompt that Windows XP displays when the Help and Support Center is called, making the attack stealthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His attack is complicated, and requires several tricks, including bypassing a whitelist meant to limit the accessed help documents to legitimate support files; using a cross-site scripting vulnerability; and then executing a malicious script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his attack code works. Researchers at French security vendor Vulpen Security confirmed today that Ormandy's proof-of-concept works as advertised on Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) and SP3 machines running Internet Explorer 7 or IE8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching to another browser, such as Mozilla's Firefox or Google's Chrome, is not a solution, Ormandy maintained. "Machines running [a] version of IE less than [IE]8 are, as usual, in even more trouble ... [but] choice of browser, mail client or whatever is not relevant, they are all equally vulnerable," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ormandy admitted that he reported the vulnerability to Microsoft only five days ago -- on Saturday, June 5 -- but said he decided to go public because of its severity, and because he believed Microsoft would have otherwise dismissed his analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I had reported the ... issue without a working exploit, I would have been ignored," he said in the Full Disclosure posting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also slammed the concept of "responsible disclosure," a term that Microsoft and other vendors apply to bug reports that are submitted privately, giving developers time to craft a patch before the information is publicly released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is another example of the problems with bug secrecy (or in PR speak, 'responsible disclosure')," Ormandy said. "Those of us who work hard to keep networks safe are forced to work in isolation without the open collaboration with our peers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft took Ormandy to task for giving it less than a week to deal with his report. "We are especially concerned about the public disclosure of this issue given we were only notified about it by this researcher on the 5th of June," said Jerry Bryant, a group manager with the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), in an e-mail this morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others were even blunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google can't have its cake and eat it, too," said Robert Hansen, the CEO of SecTheory. A noted security researcher -- in 2008, he and Jeremiah Grossman, chief technology officer at WhiteHat Security, made headlines when they revealed details about browser "clickjacking" attacks -- Hansen scolded Google, Ormandy's employer, for claiming that the company abides by responsible disclosure when its security researchers do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their researchers are going off half-cocked," said Hansen, who deplored Ormandy's quick publication of the vulnerability and attack code. "It just doesn't add up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hansen went even further, and said a case could be made that Ormandy's fast trigger could be part of the battles between Google and Microsoft. "It sounds to me like Google was upset about the publicity over its decision to drop Windows, the 'use anything but Microsoft' thing. Google got a lot of backlash from the security community over that, because it doesn't matter what OS you use."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month Google and Microsoft traded shots over a report that Google was urging its workers to dump Windows over security concerns. Security analysts said the charge was bogus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This stinks of retribution," said Hansen. "If Google really goes by responsible disclosure, they should fire Ormandy today." Hansen noted that Ormandy credited other Google security researchers for their help and linked to a Google blog on browser security in his message on Full Disclosure. "You shouldn't do that if you want to disassociate yourself from your employer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's impossible, argued Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Security. "[As a security researcher] you can't really separate your work from your employer. So you have to wonder if [Ormandy[] isn't intentionally feeding the feud between Google and Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Hansen, Storms questioned Ormandy's decision to reveal his findings just five days after he reported the vulnerability to Microsoft. "You can't say in this case that the vendor was sitting on their hands, not being responsive, which is why researchers usually go public, to force [a vendor's] hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is no better than not reporting it to Microsoft," concluded Storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hansen, who acknowledged that he has worked for Microsoft as a security consultant on several projects, weighed in again. "The whole thing rubbed me the wrong way," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ormandy did not respond to a request for comment on Hansen's accusations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others knocked Ormandy for offering up a unsanctioned fix. In his note on Full Disclosure, Ormandy recommended moves that users could take until a patch is ready, including a link to what he described as an "unofficial (temporary) hotfix."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Secunia said the patch didn't work. "It is possible to bypass the fix implemented by the unofficial hotfix and still exploit the vulnerability," claimed the Danish vulnerability tracking firm in a blog post Thursday .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft agreed with Secunia. "The mitigations [Ormandy] presented may not be effective, so he has really put both our customers and the customers of his employer at risk," said the MSRC's Bryant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's next regularly-scheduled security updates will ship July 13. Storms, for one, doesn't think Microsoft will have a fix finished by then. "They probably already have all the patches for July in QA by now," said Storms. "I don't think it's feasible that they could have something ready in time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Soccer, the No. 1 sport in most of the world, is finally getting a big roll on U.S. television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News Corp and Walt Disney Co are making big bets on the growing popularity of top level European league soccer in the United States, thanks to global stars like David Beckham and a more diverse U.S. population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies see it as a way to boost the affiliate fees they charge cable distributors, while also drawing audiences of 18-49 year-old males coveted by advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the U.S. is becoming more diversified and we've seen a steady increase in ratings for our soccer games," said Scott Guglielmino, ESPN vice president programing and acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Soccer will be a growth area for media conglomerates as more people are getting interested in soccer and in stars like David Beckham as well as continued immigration of people who are used to the sport," said David Joyce, a Miller Tabak analyst who covers Disney and News Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While soccer -- or football as it is called in most countries -- is a favorite among pre-high school kids in U.S. suburbs, their interest shifts to American football, baseball and basketball as they get older -- and it is those games that U.S. television favors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Major League Soccer franchise is covered by some networks but it pales in comparison with the pedigree and star power of English, Spanish or Italian soccer leagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Disney, where ABC and ESPN have the U.S. rights to live coverage of the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the plan is to ramp up its involvement in soccer both in the United States and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom alone, ESPN has committed to more than $400 million in soccer rights over the next few years, according to Credit Suisse estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closer to home, ESPN struck a deal to broadcast 46 live English Premier League matches in the United States in 2009-10, buying rights to those games from News Corp. It has enjoyed enough viewership for the sport on ESPN2 that next season it will carry 75 live matches including weekend and some mid-week matches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is more, soccer has proven that it can draw big U.S. viewership, at least for the top events. The U.S. audience for the 2006 World Cup final, for instance, eclipsed the audience for that year's National Basketball Association championship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WELCOME COMPETITION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has built a lot of its success in pay-TV on the back of exclusive soccer deals, particularly in the UK with its satellite TV operator BSkyB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, Murdoch's company has led the charge through Fox Soccer Channel, whose ratings jumped last season after it won rights to broadcast games from the European Champions League. That helped boost its mid-week ratings, in addition to its usual lineup of live weekend matches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in a sign of how seriously Fox is approaching soccer, it aired live coverage of the Champions League final in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the strongest indication of Fox's belief in the future of soccer with U.S. audiences was the launch in March of Fox Soccer Plus, a new premium channel covering even more live soccer matches as well as some rugby matches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox Soccer President David Nathanson said even though the new channel was launched in the second half of the soccer season, it was still well received by viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are 700 live events you won't see anywhere else," he said. "Remember, we're marketing this to our existing Fox Soccer Channel audience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that Fox Soccer Channel reaches 36 million homes -- only about a third of the total U.S. television homes -- it still has plenty of upside. For now, though, those figures put it at a disadvantage to ESPN. ESPN2, which carries the Premiership games, reaches 50 million American homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathanson said that competition benefits all players in the U.S. TV market when it comes to soccer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it gets competitive in some ways that's a good thing, the more promotion will help drive interest to the sport and our channels also," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But competition can also mean higher rights fees down the road, as networks vie to build up their soccer brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is believed to have agreed to pay global soccer body FIFA around $94 million for broadcast rights of this year's World Cup and in 2014, according to Credit Suisse.

&lt;p&gt; * U.S. cable networks building up soccer coverage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * ESPN to increase coverage of soccer next season&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Fox Soccer's premium channel offers more live matches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Yinka Adegoke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - Soccer, the No. 1 sport in
most of the world, is finally getting a big roll on U.S.
television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News Corp (NWSA.O) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) are making
big bets on the growing popularity of top level European league
soccer in the United States, thanks to global stars like David
Beckham and a more diverse U.S. population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies see it as a way to boost the affiliate fees
they charge cable distributors, while also drawing audiences of
18-49 year-old males coveted by advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the U.S is becoming more diversified and we've
seen a steady increase in ratings for our soccer games," said
Scott Guglielmino, ESPN vice president programming and
acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Soccer will be a growth area for media conglomerates as
more people are getting interested in soccer and in stars like
David Beckham as well as continued immigration of people who
are used to the sport," said David Joyce, a Miller Tabak
analyst who covers Disney and News Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While soccer -- or football as it is called in most
countries -- is a favorite among pre-high school kids in U.S.
suburbs, their interest shifts to American football, baseball
and basketball as they get older -- and it is those games that
U.S. television favors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S Major League Soccer franchise is covered by some
networks but it pales in comparison with the pedigree and star
power of English, Spanish or Italian soccer leagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Disney, where ABC and ESPN have the U.S. rights to live
coverage of the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the plan is to ramp
up its involvement in soccer both in the United States and
abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the United Kingdom alone, ESPN has committed to more
than $400 million in soccer rights over the next few years,
according to Credit Suisse estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Closer to home, ESPN struck a deal to broadcast 46 live
English Premier League matches in the United States in 2009-10,
buying rights to those games from News Corp. It has enjoyed
enough viewership for the sport on ESPN2 that next season it
will carry 75 live matches including weekend and some mid-week
matches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What is more, soccer has proven that it can draw big U.S.
viewership, at least for the top events. The U.S. audience for
the 2006 World Cup final, for instance, eclipsed the audience
for that year's National Basketball Association championship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WELCOME COMPETITION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has built a lot of its success
in pay-TV on the back of exclusive soccer deals, particularly
in the UK with its satellite TV operator BSkyB (BSY.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the United States, Murdoch's company has led the charge
through Fox Soccer Channel, whose ratings jumped last season
after it won rights to broadcast games from the European
Champions League. That helped boost its mid-week ratings, in
addition to its usual lineup of live weekend matches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in a sign of how seriously Fox is approaching soccer,
it aired live coverage of the Champions League final in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the strongest indication of Fox's belief in the
future of soccer with U.S. audiences was the launch in March of
Fox Soccer Plus, a new premium channel covering even more live
soccer matches as well as some rugby matches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox Soccer President David Nathanson said even though the
new channel was launched in the second half of the soccer
season, it was still well received by viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These are 700 live events you won't see anywhere else," he
said. "Remember, we're marketing this to our existing Fox
Soccer Channel audience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given that Fox Soccer Channel reaches 36 million homes --
only about a third of the total U.S. television homes -- it
still has plenty of upside. For now, though, those figures put
it at a disadvantage to ESPN. ESPN2, which carries the
Premiership games, reaches 50 million American homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nathanson said that competition benefits all players in the
U.S. TV market when it comes to soccer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If it gets competitive in some ways that's a good thing,
the more promotion will help drive interest to the sport and
our channels also," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But competition can also mean higher rights fees down the
road, as networks vie to build up their soccer brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney is believed to have agreed to pay global soccer body
FIFA around $94 million for broadcast rights of this year's
World Cup and in 2014, according to Credit Suisse. Univision
[UVN.UL], which has covered the tournament every four years
since 1978, has Spanish language rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We like to think we've had a great influence in the
growing popularity of soccer on TV in the US," said Alina
Falcon, president of news at Univision. "We take soccer very
seriously all year round and even non-Hispanic viewers tune
into watch the passion with which we present our games."

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--

EMC) and Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE: HPQ).

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

NetApp Partners with Microsoft

NetApp Inc. (Nasdaq: NTAP) has strengthened its strategic alliance with
Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT). Accordingly, the two companies are going to
increase technological collaboration in an attempt to help common customers and
service providers improve their infrastructure and enhance their operational
efficiency. The resultant cost reduction and improvement in management
capabilities of these companies should improve customer satisfaction and bring
new ones. 

With the help of Microsoft`s management tools and NetApp`s storage solutions,
customers are expected to create efficient internal and external networks that
will ultimately improve the performance of the data centers owned by end
customers. 

We believe this is a win-win situation for both the companies, as the alliance
will enhance the technological exchange between them, at the same time helping
them increase their market reach, by providing easy access to each other`s
customer bases. 

The data storage segment is expected to witness a pickup in demand, keeping pace
with the improvement in IT spending. Object based storage is yet another space,
which is creating interest among IT managers. This is a new method of storage
and access of data through the use of object names. It also helps to retrieve
rich metadata that provides a detailed description of the content, thus
facilitating the process of storing large objects, at the same time improving
the search speed. So, improvement in technology and new service offerings are
expected to take the storage industry to new heights, thereby improving business
volume. 

This apart, NetApp has also performed well in the third quarter, reporting EPS
of 40 cents, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents per share.
Moreover, revenue grew substantially during the third quarter to reach $1.01
billion, improving by a staggering 35.5% compared with the year-ago period. This
was attributable to the revival in all business segments following the year-long
recession. 

Having said that, we are slightly apprehensive about the stiff competition that
NetApp faces from tech giants International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), EMC
Corp. (NYSE: EMC), Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE: HPQ) and Hitachi Data Systems in
the data storage and management software space, which may slightly rationalize
growth prospects. We believe this collaboration will help NetApp progress
towards the leadership position in the storage segment.

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta--(Business Wire)--
Walton International Group Inc. and Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 (the
"Partnership") announced today the closing of the private placement announced on
March 19, 2010. 

An aggregate of $17,244,500 was raised, resulting in the issuance of 1,724,450
partnership units, the maximum offered in the placement. 

The private placement consisted of a non-brokered private offering of up to
1,724,450 units at a subscription price of $10.00 per unit, and was conducted on
similar terms as the initial public offering the Partnership completed on
February 25, 2010 under its prospectus dated January 28, 2010. 

The total proceeds raised under both the private placement and the Partnership`s
initial public offering total $35,800,000. As outlined in the prospectus, the
net proceeds of both offerings will be used to purchase and manage two parcels
of land comprised of 155 acres of land located near Toronto in Alliston,
Ontario, and 300 acres of land located in the southwest quadrant of the City of
Ottawa. The Partnership`s investment objective is to maximize returns to limited
partners through the acquisition, management, concept planning and eventual sale
of these two properties. 

The Partnership is managed by Walton International Group Inc., part of the
Walton Group of Companies. Walton seeks to acquire and syndicate undeveloped
land that is strategically located in the path of major North American urban
growth corridors. These lands are syndicated to investors, without the use of
leverage, made development-ready through concept planning, and then sold for a
profit when it is commercially opportune to do so. Walton has completed 38
projects, providing returns to investors from the profit made on the sale of the
lands. In business for 30 years, the Walton Group currently manages
approximately $2.5 billion of real estate assets, comprised of approximately
51,300 acres of land, on behalf of itself and investors and clients in North
America, Europe and Asia.

&lt;p&gt;MONTREAL (Reuters) - The president of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said on Thursday that there is "no indication" that the investment bank is close to settling U.S. fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn also said there is no sense of timing on a potential settlement, adding that Goldman's client franchise was strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no indications of anything at this point" on a settlement or its timing, Cohn told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our client franchise is very strong. We've built up a relationship with our clients over 140 years. We continue to service our clients, we continue to serve our client needs. Our clients are very loyal," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, the SEC charged Goldman with civil fraud in connection with the structuring and sale of a debt security called Abacus 2007. The SEC is investigating another Goldman mortgage-linked deal called Hudson Mezzanine Funding, a source familiar with the matter has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohn said he read about the latest probe in the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC's probe into Goldman comes as the U.S. Congress tries to hash out a final bill to revamp the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under consideration are proposals to ban banks like Goldman from proprietary trading and ownership of hedge funds and private equity funds as well as measures that could force big banks out of the lucrative derivatives business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMBIGUITY IN VOLCKER'S RULE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohn said the proposal by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker to prohibit proprietary trading was "unclear in certain areas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Definitions in the Volcker rule are not clear. When they talk about proprietary trading, what is proprietary trading? When they talk about private equity, do they mean private equity or do they mean debt funds?" said Cohn. "These things are still quite ambiguous at this point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if the Volcker rules could force Goldman to divest its real estate business, Cohn said "anything is possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A select group of lawmakers will start hammering out the final financial regulation bill later on Thursday. They must decide whether to include a version of the Volcker rule and the derivatives measure proposed by Senator Blanche Lincoln, a Democrat from Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to get banks in the business of banking, Lincoln wants to force banks to choose between their over-the-counter derivatives desks and access to the Federal Reserve's emergency funds and other federal protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohn said Lincoln's plan had "issues." But that he understood some of her intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEWARE OF REGULATORY ARBITRAGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Union is also trying to overhaul its financial system after the 2008 financial crisis exposed gaps in regulation. Although the United States and the European Union agree that there must be higher capital standards for banks, the two economies are taking different approaches in a number of other areas of the financial market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They differ on how to further safeguard the financial system and whether to clamp down on banks' speculative activities among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohn said he shares concerns about so-called regulatory arbitrage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To the extent that you have a regulatory environment in a country that is significantly different than a regulatory environment in another country, the markets are efficient, clients are efficient, the business will migrate to those areas where it can efficiently be done," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Spicer and Rachelle Younglai; Editing by Jan Paschal and Theodore d'Afflisio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Former New York Federal Reserve president Gerald Corrigan said the U.S. Congress is on the right path to improve financial regulations, but warned that the so-called Volcker rule might have unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They have the ball on the fairway but they're not yet on the green," said Corrigan, now a managing director at Goldman Sachs (GS.N), making an analogy to a partially completed hole in the game of golf. "We are making progress," he added later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at Boston College's Carroll School of Management, Corrigan urged lawmakers to focus on reducing the likelihood of the largest banks taking excessive risks because of expected government bailouts, the doctrine known as "too big to fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress must create a process for closing and liquidating giant banks that fail in an orderly manner, he said. But such a task is not easy, Corrigan warned, citing his 25 years working as a bank regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the history of mankind, we have never successfully executed the orderly wind down of a large failing financial institution," he said. "It is so damn hard to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress is likely to enact strict limits on banks' proprietary trading activities, as suggested by former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, Corrigan said. But he worried that this solely U.S.-enacted reform would put U.S. banks at a disadvantage in the global marketplace. "It's going to happen but it's not going to happen outside of the U.S., certainly not in Europe," he said. "That's a problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is not a human being alive for whom I have greater respect than Paul Volcker," Corrigan added. "We do have a difference of opinion on this particular matter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although complicated security structures were partly to blame for the crisis, Corrigan did not foresee banning financial innovations. "You can't regulate away complexity. You can't regulate away technology," he said. "It's here to stay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The root cause of the credit crisis, as in most past banking system meltdowns, was lending institutions making bad decisions, Corrigan said. But in congressional efforts to reform regulation "you don't hear much about what can be done to strengthen credit origination," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrigan, who left the New York Fed and joined Goldman in 1994, generally praised government efforts to revive the economy and minimize fallout from the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the whole, the last 18 months have worked out probably better than many of us thought in the darkest days of the crisis," Corrigan said, citing in particular the ability of troubled banks to raise so much capital from private investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite recent debt problems in Europe and stock market corrections around the world, Corrigan said he is still relatively optimistic about global growth prospects. The former Fed official conceded that the odds of a double dip recession have risen a bit lately but it is still an unlikely outcome, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The odds still favor a respectable pattern of GDP growth at least out into the first half of next year," he said.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, June 10 (Reuters) - Former New York Federal Reserve
president Gerald Corrigan said the U.S. Congress is on the
right path to improve financial regulations, but warned that
the so-called Volcker rule might have unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "They have the ball on the fairway but they're not yet on
the green," said Corrigan, now a managing director at Goldman
Sachs (GS.N), making an analogy to a partially completed hole
in the game of golf. "We are making progress," he added later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking at Boston College's Carroll School of Management,
Corrigan urged lawmakers to focus on reducing the likelihood of
the largest banks taking excessive risks because of expected
government bailouts, the doctrine known as "too big to
fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Congress must create a process for closing and liquidating
giant banks that fail in an orderly manner, he said. But such a

1994, generally praised government efforts to revive the
economy and minimize fallout from the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On the whole, the last 18 months have worked out probably
better than many of us thought in the darkest days of the
crisis," Corrigan said, citing in particular the ability of
troubled banks to raise so much capital from private
investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite recent debt problems in Europe and stock market
corrections around the world, Corrigan said he is still
relatively optimistic about global growth prospects. The former
Fed official conceded that the odds of a double dip recession
have risen a bit lately but it is still an unlikely outcome, he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The odds still favor a respectable pattern of GDP growth
at least out into the first half of next year," he said. "The

&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman president says Volcker rule unclear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Goldman has "issues" with Senate's derivatives plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * U.S. SEC probing another Goldman debt deal-source
 (Adds bylines and further comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Spicer and Rachelle Younglai&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MONTREAL, June 10 (Reuters) - The president of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc (GS.N) said on Thursday that there is "no indication" that
the investment bank is close to settling U.S. fraud charges with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn also said there is no sense of
timing on a potential settlement, adding that Goldman's client
franchise was strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's no indications of anything at this point" on a
settlement or its timing, Cohn told reporters on the sidelines of a
conference in Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our client franchise is very strong. We've built up a
relationship with our clients over 140 years. We continue to service
our clients, we continue to serve our client needs. Our clients are
very loyal," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, the SEC charged Goldman with civil fraud in connection
with the structuring and sale of a debt security called Abacus 2007.
The SEC is investigating another Goldman mortgage-linked deal called
Hudson Mezzanine Funding, a source familiar with the matter has
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cohn said he read about the latest probe in the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC's probe into Goldman comes as the U.S. Congress tries to
hash out a final bill to revamp the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under consideration are proposals to ban banks like Goldman from
proprietary trading and ownership of hedge funds and private equity
funds as well as measures that could force big banks out of the
lucrative derivatives business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMBIGUITY IN VOLCKER'S RULE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cohn said the proposal by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker to prohibit proprietary trading was "unclear in certain
areas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Definitions in the Volcker rule are not clear. When they talk
about proprietary trading, what is proprietary trading? When they
talk about private equity, do they mean private equity or do they
mean debt funds?" said Cohn. "These things are still quite ambiguous
at this point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked if the Volcker rules could force Goldman to divest its
real estate business, Cohn said "anything is possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A select group of lawmakers will start hammering out the final
financial regulation bill later on Thursday. They must decide whether
to include a version of the Volcker rule and the derivatives measure
proposed by Senator Blanche Lincoln, a Democrat from Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an attempt to get banks in the business of banking, Lincoln
wants to force banks to choose between their over-the-counter
derivatives desks and access to the Federal Reserve's emergency funds
and other federal protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cohn said Lincoln's plan had "issues." But that he understood
some of her intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEWARE OF REGULATORY ARBITRAGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Union is also trying to overhaul its financial
system after the 2008 financial crisis exposed gaps in regulation.
Although the United States and the European Union agree that there
must be higher capital standards for banks, the two economies are
taking different approaches in a number of other areas of the
financial market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They differ on how to further safeguard the financial system and
whether to clamp down on banks' speculative activities among other
things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohn said he shares concerns about so-called regulatory
arbitrage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "To the extent that you have a regulatory environment in a
country that is significantly different than a regulatory environment
in another country, the markets are efficient, clients are efficient,
the business will migrate to those areas where it can efficiently be
done," he said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/MONTREAL (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators are hunting for fresh dirt on Goldman Sachs Group Inc, hoping to bolster their lawsuit against the bank and perhaps force it to settle on terms more to the regulators' liking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months ago the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Wall Street's most powerful bank with civil fraud in connection with a subprime mortgage-linked security. The case hinges on whether Goldman misled investors when it marketed Abacus 2007, a mortgage-linked security that turned toxic during the mortgage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the SEC is also looking at other collateralized debt obligations that turned toxic, including Hudson Mezzanine Funding, a source familiar with the investigation said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You put a number of things together and then it becomes harder to defend against all of them," said Annemarie McAvoy, a Fordham University School of Law professor and a former federal prosecutor. "So you finally cry uncle and say, 'Fine, I'll settle.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman President Gary Cohn said on Thursday there were "no indications" that his firm was close to settling the SEC fraud charges. He was speaking to reporters after addressing a securities regulation conference in Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC's expanding investigation of Goldman's CDOs comes as federal prosecutors probe some of the complex mortgage-linked transactions that Wall Street firms cobbled together and which helped spark the worst financial crisis in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is getting into the act. Reuters has learned the securities industry's self-regulatory agency recently began its own investigation into whether Wall Street banks violated customary sales practices in hawking CDOs to institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A document reviewed by Reuters reveals FINRA is looking into potential improprieties in the structuring of the deals and the relationship between the CDO underwriters and mortgage lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman customers also are putting pressure on the bank and its chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Australian hedge fund sued Goldman on Wednesday, accusing the bank of misrepresenting the value of the Timberwolf CDO in 2007. The fund says its investment in Timberwolf contributed to its demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters previously reported that SEC lawyers had looked at the $1 billion Timberwolf deal before filing the Abacus lawsuit in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC's interest in the $2 billion Hudson CDO was first reported by the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares are down more than 25 percent since the SEC filed its lawsuit on April 16. With pressure mounting on the bank this week, the shares were off 3.5 percent to $132.00 in Thursday afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STRENGTHENING THE CASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Carl Levin, during a hearing in April of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, raised Abacus, Timberwolf and Hudson while questioning a cast of past and present Goldman employees, including Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Senate floor speech in May introducing legislation to curb conflicts of interest in Wall Street deals, Levin zeroed in on Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When Goldman first sold the securities to its clients, more than 70 percent of Hudson Mezzanine had AAA ratings," he said. "But ... within 18 months Hudson was downgraded to junk status, and Goldman cashed in at the expense of its clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hudson deal closed in November 2006 and went into liquidation in May 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The myriad investigations, coupled with the Timberwolf litigation, could create a tipping point at which Blankfein and other Goldman executives decide they have no choice but to reach some sort of comprehensive settlement, according to legal experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Will there be more stuff? At this point, it certainly wouldn't surprise me," said White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the least, the SEC could be looking to bolster its Abacus case, which some saw as weak. SEC commissioners voted to bring the lawsuit in a split decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fordham's McAvoy said the SEC's strategy could be to strengthen the initial case by adding new material from other deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of folks don't think the initial case is as strong as the SEC made it out to be," McAvoy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder in New York and Rachelle Younglai in Montreal; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Player Celebrations Will Bring Clean Drinking Water to Thousands of School
Children in Africa

Fans to Vote for the Winning Celebration at www.fifa.com/celebrations


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Scoring a goal on football`s biggest stage catapults players into a moment of
pure happiness and celebration that defines their careers and marks some of the
most iconic scenes in FIFA World Cup matches. Today, Coca-Cola for the first
time in FIFA World Cup history has revealed plans to recognise the most
entertaining goal celebration with the "Coca-Cola Celebration Award." 

During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, player goal celebrations will be uploaded to
www.fifa.com/celebrations and fans will be invited to vote for the most
outstanding player celebrations online. Players are sure to "release their
African rhythm" and create some iconic moves that will rival the legendary
celebrations that have become ingrained in FIFA World Cup history and fans`
hearts. All FIFA World Cup players celebrating goals will have a chance of
winning. The award will respect the laws of the game. 

Coca-Cola will contribute $1,500 to fund the "Water for Schools" initiative in
Africa each time a player celebrates a goal. The eventual winner will be
rewarded with the first-ever Coca-Cola Celebration Award. Coca-Cola will also
donate on the winning player`s behalf an extra $50,000 to the "Water for
Schools" program to mark the historic occasion for an anticipated total
contribution of $300,000. The "Water for Schools" program is just one part of a
$30 million legacy by Coca-Cola to provide at least 2 million people in Africa
with clean water and improved sanitation by 2015. 

Coca-Cola is using the occasion of the first FIFA World Cup on African soil to
raise awareness of the vital role clean drinking water plays in developing
communities. For every 10 goal celebrations in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, it is
estimated an entire school could gain clean water access, benefitting nearly 500
children. By participating in the voting, football fans can have a hand in
supporting clean water initiatives that will leave a lasting legacy of water
sustainability in Africa and beyond. 

"Inspired by Roger Milla`s iconic corner flag dance in the 1990 FIFA World Cup,
Coca-Cola Celebration Award has been created to give players and fans the chance
to not only show their passion for football but also tackle the hugely important
issue of water sanitation," said Emmanuel Seuge, group director, worldwide
sports and entertainment marketing, The Coca-Cola Company. 

The Coca-Cola Celebration Award is one of a wide range of programs included in
the Company`s sponsorship campaign, which encourages fans to let go of their
inhibitions and celebrate. The campaign invites people to express their optimism
and passion for football through active dance celebrations as excitement builds
for the greatest single-sport spectacle on the planet. 

"Every FIFA World Cup creates those special iconic moments, when a footballer
has just scored a goal and, with a spontaneous release of emotion, begins to
celebrate the triumph with a unique celebration," said J&#233;r&#244;me Valcke, FIFA
Secretary General. "Those moments of happiness will now have added significance
and will be shared with those people in Africa who will benefit from The
Coca-Cola Water for Schools project." 

Coca-Cola "Replenish Africa Initiative"

The "Water for Schools" effort builds upon a long and deep history of global
water stewardship by Coca-Cola, including The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation`s
"Replenish Africa Initiative" (RAIN) to improve water resources in Africa. In
March 2009, the foundation announced its latest commitment under RAIN, an
unprecedented, six-year, US$30 million drive to provide at least 2 million
people in Africa with clean water and improved sanitation by 2015 - helping to
meet the United Nations` "Millennium Development Goals" for access to clean
water. 

The RAIN community water projects throughout the African continent by The
Coca-Cola Africa Foundation reflect The Coca-Cola Company`s water stewardship
goal of returning to communities and to nature an amount of water equivalent to
what the Company uses in all of its beverages and their production. 

The Company`s strategy for achieving that goal includes reducing the water it
uses; returning all water it uses for manufacturing to the environment, at a
level that supports aquatic life and agriculture; and replenishing healthy
watersheds and sustainable community water programs, to balance the water used
by Coca-Cola to make finished beverages. 

The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation concentrates on three areas to support its RAIN
goals: rehabilitation of water distribution areas; productive use of water; and
protection of watersheds. The foundation currently has community water projects
in 19 African countries, reaching more than 300,000 people.

selected Junction Solutions to deliver its end-to-end solution sets for the

Services with the visibility it needs to streamline business processes and
improve how it services its customers.

objectives and enable a rapid implementation," said Becky Martin, Vice

complete solution for both our manufacturing and retail operations mirrored what
we felt was most important in an implementation partner to ensure we got the
greatest value from our investment while also supporting our ability to expand
our business." 

"The visibility into our direct marketing operations that will be enabled by the
JunctionMCR solution is going to greatly improve how efficiently we are able to
manage our promotions, program tracking and distribution management from within
Microsoft Dynamics AX as well as how we can service our customers," said Bob

&lt;p&gt;  ROCKVILLE, MD, Jun 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Hi-G-Tek, Inc. a leading global provider of wireless sensing solutions
that monitor and capture real time location, security, and condition
information about cargo and assets, and Navisat Telematics, an industry
leader in turnkey supply chain management and security solutions, have
completed the implementation of Kenya's Electronic Cargo Tracking System
(ECTS). With the ECTS in place, the KRA now requires importers,
exporters, clearing agents and transporters to comply with the new
regulations by installing electronic seals. No cargo under customs
control will be allowed to transit Kenya after the end of June without
the appropriate tracking devices installed. The ECTS is one of the most
advanced systems of its kind in the world and is the first to be
implemented on a nationwide basis in Africa.

    "Customs' authorities in many parts of the world are grappling with the
problems of significant tax loss, cargo theft, and regulatory
compliance," said Don DeLaski, CEO of Hi-G-Tek, Inc. "Hi-G-Tek's
sophisticated technology and in-depth field experience with cargo
security and tracking solutions offer governments the opportunity to
solve these problems in a cost-effective way. We are pleased to be the
technology provider for the ECTS in Kenya and to be working with our
in-country partner, Navisat Telematics, to ensure that all stakeholders
come into compliance with the new regulations." 

    Hi-G-Tek's system is unique in that it allows for monitoring not only at
the level of the truck, but also at the level of the individual
containers or cargo components themselves. This state-of-the-art sensing
capability, which is based on a series of patented technologies, is the
foundation of the Hi-G-Tek platform.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/385028/ibm_south_africa_g) has
announced the addition of the "IBM SOUTH AFRICA GROUP LTD.: Labor Productivity
Benchmarks and International Gap Analysis" report to their offering. 

Though we heavily rely on historical performance, the figures reported in this
report are not historical but are forecasts and projections for the coming
fiscal year. The forecasts are updated quarterly. The source(s) for the various
raw statistics include public filings, corporate releases, and various other
data sources. 

Given a company's financial structure, the resulting figures are benchmarked
across leading competitors. In choosing the leading competitors, Icon Group
chooses only those firms with sound financial situations or those not undergoing
radical restructuring, or where random volatility, mergers, or bankruptcy
affects financial performance. 

Since the calculation of competitors labor ratios proceeds in a similar fashion,
but are aggregated across all competitors, one can directly conduct a gap
analysis. Here, Icon Group graphically reports, for each labor productivity area
the larger gaps that the firm has vis-a-vis the leading competitors. A gap need
not be a bad sign. Rather, it is simply a substantial difference that might
merit further attention or signal a firms relative strength or weakness for the
coming fiscal year.

&lt;p&gt;  ST. LOUIS, MO, Jun 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
KnowledgeLake, Inc., a leading provider of document imaging and capture
technologies for Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Content Management
solutions, today announced it is leveraging SharePoint 2010 as the
platform for building its company's public website.

    KnowledgeLake was a first mover on the SharePoint platform in 2003.
KnowledgeLake is unique among ECM vendors in that it focuses exclusively
on SharePoint as the repository for its document imaging, capture and
workflow solutions. 

    "Today we are proud to announce that we are again a first mover with
Microsoft in that we are launching knowledgelake.com on the SharePoint
2010 platform," stated Ron Cameron, President and co-founder of
KnowledgeLake, Inc. "As the SharePoint ECM market leader, we found it
important that we use our own technology. We believe in the Microsoft
solutions that we promote to our customers, so we are not going to use
competitive technologies for things like our website, mobile phones, or
search. The added bonus for us is that Microsoft products are the most
widely used and highest quality in the world. Our total cost of ownership
for the new website will be very low."

    KnowledgeLake has taken advantage of the web content management
capabilities in SharePoint to improve the authoring and publishing
process of its website. This functionality will allow KnowledgeLake to
save money by reducing the number of resources required to administer
knowledgelake.com. KnowledgeLake also uses SharePoint as a collaboration
tool for internal operations such as software development, human
resources and accounting. 

    "I've used numerous content management systems prior to my experience
with SharePoint 2010 and can say that the templating, publishing and web
parts functionalities in SharePoint really set it apart from the rest,"
stated DJ Monzyk, Graphic/Web Designer, KnowledgeLake, Inc. "I am used to
spending time finding, researching, installing, troubleshooting and
maintaining multiple 'modules' to support all of the things in my
previous CMSs that SharePoint can do out of the box. Despite being a
first-time implementer/developer of SharePoint as a customer-facing CMS
solution, and having little asp and xsl/xslt history, I was able to pick
up everything quickly to develop a beautiful and powerful customer-facing
publishing website safely supporting multiple content authors."

    "KnowledgeLake has truly embraced the SharePoint ECM platform," said
Tricia Bush, Director for SharePoint Product Management at Microsoft
Corp. "Traditionally, KnowledgeLake has developed innovative products
that expand the enterprise content management features already in
SharePoint 2010. So with SharePoint 2010, KnowledgeLake has taken that to
the next level to develop its website."

    About KnowledgeLake, Inc.
 KnowledgeLake, Inc. develops document imaging
related products and solutions for Microsoft SharePoint. KnowledgeLake
extends the ECM capabilities of SharePoint, enabling businesses to reduce
mailing costs, streamline operations, and achieve regulatory compliance

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - An Australian hedge fund is suing Goldman Sachs Group Inc over an investment in a subprime mortgage-linked security that contributed to the fund's demise in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit filed on Wednesday accuses Goldman of misrepresenting the value of the notorious Timberwolf collateralized debt obligation, which garnered a lot of attention during a recent congressional hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis Yield Alpha Fund sued Goldman to recoup the $56 million it lost on the CDO, said Eric Lewis, a Washington-based lawyer for the fund. The suit also seeks $1 billion in punitive damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The litigation is the latest in a string of legal and public relations headaches for Goldman. In April, U.S. securities regulators charged the powerful Wall Street bank with civil fraud in connection with the structuring and sale of another CDO called Abacus 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was examining another Goldman CDO -- Hudson Mezzanine Funding -- that was not part of the April civil fraud lawsuit. The FT, citing people familiar with the matter, said the inquiry into the $2 billion CDO was part of a wider probe into the CDOs of Wall Street banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australian hedge fund decided to file suit after months of settlement talks with Goldman broke down. Reuters on Tuesday first reported on the likelihood of a lawsuit. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 36-page complaint opens with a rhetorical flourish that repeats a Goldman executive's description of the Timberwolf CDO as "one shitty deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See here for a copy of the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit alleges that Goldman pitched the Timberwolf deal to Basis even as the bank's sales force and mortgage traders knew the market for CDOs could soon crumble. In June 2007, Basis paid $78 million for two pieces of the CDO with a face value of $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis, which financed the transaction with a loan from Goldman, said it lost more than $50 million when the bank began making margin calls on the product just weeks after selling the deal. Basis said the margin calls quickly forced it into insolvency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't say you are basically selling a strong performing high-yielding security that you know is going to tank," said Lewis, a partner with the law firm Baach Robinson  Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"MISGUIDED ATTEMPT"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman called the suit "a misguided attempt by Basis ... to shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, said, "Basis is now trying to recoup its losses based on false allegations that it was misled about aspects of the transaction and market conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $1 billion Timberwolf CDO and the aggressive tactics Goldman employed to sell the deal were a focal point of an April hearing by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. One of the documents unearthed by the panel was an email in which former Goldman mortgage executive Thomas Montag called Timberwolf "one shitty deal," just days after the firm completed the sale to Basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund's lawsuit, which draws on other documents introduced by the Senate panel, alleges that Goldman misrepresented the value of the Timberwolf securities and failed to disclose that Goldman's trading desk had a role in working with Greywolf Capital Management in picking Timberwolf's underlying securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN COORDINATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Senate subcommittee hearing in April, Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said the bank's employees are often unaware of what strategies are being employed elsewhere at the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have 35,000 people and thousands of traders making markets throughout our firm," Blankfein said in response to a question from Senator Carl Levin. "They might have an idea. But they might not have an idea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Basis lawsuit raises new questions about the coordination between Goldman's trading desks and its sales staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Lehman, who joined Goldman in 2004 and worked as a managing director in Goldman's mortgage trading operation, met with representatives of Basis to convince them that the prices Goldman was selling the Timberwolf deal at were fair and legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit alleges that Goldman's sales and trading desks worked together to sell the deal, while Goldman itself was betting against the performance of the CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not a bad case for dealing with the whole issue of how Goldman was conducting its business," said Lewis. "They were selling bonds like they were used cars, in that you say what you need to get it done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE LAWSUITS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other investors in Goldman's CDO products are likely to keep a close eye on the Basis case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they can prove there is some smoke there, many investors could feel they have a right to say they were also harmed in some way," said Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager and banking analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, lawsuits against firms over the marketing of toxic CDOs have been rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Berman, a partner with Friedman Kaplan Seiler  Adelman who frequently represents institutional investors, said it's a bit of mystery that the financial crisis hasn't spawned more private litigation over CDOs and other exotic investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of it may be being dealt with in private arbitration rather than litigation," said Berman. "It's also possible that many institutions are simply wary of suing each other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master) v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-04537.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder and Matthew Goldstein; editing by John Wallace, Andre Grenon and Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned Pfizer Inc for failing to quickly report serious and unexpected potential side effects from its drugs already on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 12-page warning letter to Pfizer Chief Executive Jeffrey Kindler, the FDA cited numerous examples involving some of the company's top-known brands, including impotence drug Viagra, cholesterol pill Lipitor and seizure medicine Lyrica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delays in reporting side effects date back as far as 2004 and have grown in recent years, according to the FDA's letter that was released by Pfizer on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ronald Pace, director of the FDA's New York office, told Pfizer in the letter dated May 26 that it had not properly documented or investigated reported problems in patients after the drugs were approved for use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"FDA expects drug manufacturers to establish and implement reasonable mechanisms to assure that all serious and unexpected experiences are promptly recorded and investigated," Pace wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pace asked Kindler to arrange a meeting between the company and the agency over the violations. Pfizer said it received the letter June 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA conducted a 6-week inspection of Pfizer's New York headquarters in July and August of 2009, where agency inspectors found system-wide lapses at the world's largest drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient reports "contained serious and unexpected adverse events... that were not submitted until they were identified during the FDA inspection," Pace wrote. Efforts to fix the problem "have been shown to be ineffective," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Pfizer said it would work with the FDA to satisfy the agency "and to assure optimal surveillance and reporting of post-marketing adverse events."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it also said that such individual reports are just one part of its overall monitoring of the drugs it sells and that it "believes we provide complete and accurate data to determine the benefit and risk profile for all of our medicines, and to enable their safe and appropriate use."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its letter, the FDA cited multiple examples of reporting lapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, while Viagra and similar medications are known to cause serious visual problems, including blindness, Pfizer failed to report cases related to its drug within the agency's 15-day deadline "by misclassifying and/or downgrading reports to non-serious without reasonable justification."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with Pfizer's now withdrawn painkiller Bextra, FDA granted the company a waiver allowing 60 days to forward any complaints, a window of time the drugmaker still missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA said Pfizer initially blamed the problems on a new computerized system to handle the reports, saying staff were not properly trained. In a September 2009 response to the agency, Pfizer told the agency it would update user manuals, better train its staff in the computerized reporting system and take other action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite those steps, the FDA said in its letter that the company's actions were "inadequate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer told the FDA that its reporting improved after May 2009, but did not include any data backing up that claim, the FDA said. Additionally, the company did not prove to the FDA that it trained all the employees it said it would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the FDA, the company's delays in telling the agency about reported complaints have only grown. About 4 percent of Pfizer's 80,560 reports were sent late from March 2006 through December 2008 compared with 9 percent from December 2008 to June 2009, the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the FDA cited Pfizer for not immediately telling the FDA about thefts and significant losses of its medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA's Pace requested an immediate meeting and asked for the problems to be fixed within 15 days, or an explanation provided if it would take longer. He also called for Pfizer to submit a revised plan to fix the problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failure to fix the problems could result in legal action without notice and the FDA could delay action in approving the company's pending drugs, among other penalties, Pace said in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Susan Heavey, additional reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pace asked Kindler to arrange a meeting between the company
and the agency over the violations. Pfizer said it received the
letter June 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDA conducted a 6-week inspection of Pfizer's New York
headquarters in July and August of 2009, where agency
inspectors found system-wide lapses at the world's largest
drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The patient reports "contained serious and unexpected
adverse events... that were not submitted until they were
identified during the FDA inspection," Pace wrote. Efforts to
fix the problem "have been shown to be ineffective," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a statement, Pfizer said it would work with the FDA to
satisfy the agency "and to assure optimal surveillance and
reporting of post-marketing adverse events."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it also said that such individual reports are just one
part of its overall monitoring of the drugs it sells and that
it "believes we provide complete and accurate data to determine
the benefit and risk profile for all of our medicines, and to
enable their safe and appropriate use."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its letter, the FDA cited multiple examples of reporting
lapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For example, while Viagra and similar medications are known
to cause serious visual problems, including blindness, Pfizer
failed to report cases related to its drug within the agency's
15-day deadline "by misclassifying and/or downgrading reports
to non-serious without reasonable justification."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And with Pfizer's now withdrawn painkiller Bextra, FDA
granted the company a waiver allowing 60 days to forward any
complaints, a window of time the drugmaker still missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDA said Pfizer initially blamed the problems on a new
computerized system to handle the reports, saying staff were
not properly trained. In a September 2009 response to the
agency, Pfizer told the agency it would update user manuals,
better train its staff in the computerized reporting system and
take other action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite those steps, the FDA said in its letter that the
company's actions were "inadequate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer told the FDA that its reporting improved after May
2009, but did not include any data backing up that claim, the
FDA said. Additionally, the company did not prove to the FDA
that it trained all the employees it said it would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the FDA, the company's delays in telling the
agency about reported complaints have only grown. About 4
percent of Pfizer's 80,560 reports were sent late from March
2006 through December 2008 compared with 9 percent from
December 2008 to June 2009, the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, the FDA cited Pfizer for not immediately
telling the FDA about thefts and significant losses of its
medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FDA's Pace requested an immediate meeting and asked for the
problems to be fixed within 15 days, or an explanation provided
if it would take longer. He also called for Pfizer to submit a
revised plan to fix the problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Failure to fix the problems could result in legal action
without notice and the FDA could delay action in approving the
company's pending drugs, among other penalties, Pace said in
the letter.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, June 10 (Reuters) - The first gas production at
Chuandongbei gas field in southwestern Sichuan province, a joint

of the foreign cooperation department under CNPC, said in a
presentation to the International Oil and Gas Conference in
Beijing. He did not elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yan said in September 2009 that first production was

high-sulphur gas field using technology from Chevron, which will
be the operator of the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chuandongbei block, covering 1,970 square kilometres,
has proven gas reserves of 176 billion cubic metres (bcm) and
companies said in 2007 that they planned to process the gas at
two plants with total capacity of 740 million cubic feet per
day, or 7.6 bcm a year.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/DETROIT (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) are likely to be the lead underwriters in General Motors' GM.UL initial public offering, a source said on Friday, a role more attractive for its prestige than its fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks were competing fiercely to underwrite an offering that could be $10 billion to $20 billion, a person briefed on the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that size, the deal would be the largest U.S. IPO since Visa Inc's (V.N) offering of $19.7 billion in March 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data, and one of the biggest U.S. offerings of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury Department owns nearly 61 percent of the automaker's common shares after GM filed for bankruptcy last year. The automaker has since emerged from Chapter 11 protection and an IPO is a key step for GM to end its support from the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sooner they can get the government out of there the better," said Aaron Bragman, an analyst at research firm IHS Global Insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have estimated that the company could be worth more than $80 billion, which would leave taxpayers with a sizable paper profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The automaker's connection with the United States government has earned it the nickname "Government Motors" and cost it market share domestically among consumers who view it as a failed company, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley has been one of the government's key advisers in restructurings during the financial crisis. The bank advised the U.S. Treasury on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and is helping the government sell its remaining stake in Citigroup Inc (C.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The underwriting banks are expected to get about 0.75 percentage point of the deal in fees, the person briefed on the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is relatively low. A typical fee for a smaller IPO is 7 percent, but multibillion-dollar deals usually carry fees closer to 3 or 3.5 percentage points, a banker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM may also be looking for a line of credit, the person briefed in the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A banker said underwriters may be willing to accept lower-than-usual fees because taking a company such as GM public is seen as prestigious and underwriters hope to win future business from the automaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Mary Claire Delaney, GM spokesman Tom Wilkinson and JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment. A Treasury spokesman referred queries to the department's statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIZE IN FLUX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM will choose the lead bankers for the IPO, but the Treasury has veto power over the selection and will determine the fees paid to underwriters, the Obama administration said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government would retain the right to decide whether to participate and at what level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury provided $50 billion of bankruptcy and bailout financing to GM last year. That rescue included $43 billion of cash and nearly $7 billion of direct loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM repaid a $6.7 billion loan in April. The rest of the U.S. investment is an equity stake the government can start selling after GM launches an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM has not said how big the IPO will be, but for taxpayers to be fully repaid the company must be valued at more than $70 billion. Last month, a JPMorgan debt analyst put GM's stock market value at nearly $90 billion. Ford Motor Co (F.N), in comparison, has a market capitalization of $38 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person briefed on the matter said the IPO could be as big as $20 billion if market demand is high, but cautioned the size is still in flux and would likely be closer to $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the U.S. stock market having dropped in recent weeks as Europe wrestles with a credit crunch, many initial public offerings have struggled to find buyers, forcing some companies to shelf IPO plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of the GM offering is uncertain, but the Obama administration said it would not happen before the fourth quarter.

&lt;p&gt; * Banks keen for role seen as prestigious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * IPO will not happen before Q4-Obama administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds information on valuation)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Clare Baldwin and Soyoung Kim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK/DETROIT, June 11 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N)
and JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) are likely to be the lead
underwriters in General Motors' [GM.UL] initial public
offering, a source said on Friday, a role more attractive for
its prestige than its fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks were competing fiercely to underwrite an offering
that could be $10 billion to $20 billion, a person briefed on
the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At that size, the deal would be the largest U.S. IPO since
Visa Inc's (V.N) offering of $19.7 billion in March 2008,
according to Thomson Reuters data, and one of the biggest U.S.
offerings of all time. [ID:nN11146801]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Treasury Department owns nearly 61 percent of the
automaker's common shares after GM filed for bankruptcy last
year. The automaker has since emerged from Chapter 11
protection and an IPO is a key step for GM to end its support
from the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The sooner they can get the government out of there the
better," said Aaron Bragman, an analyst at research firm IHS
Global Insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have estimated that the company could be worth
more than $80 billion, which would leave taxpayers with a
sizable paper profit. [ID:nN11152225]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The automaker's connection with the United States
government has earned it the nickname "Government Motors" and
cost it market share domestically among consumers who view it
as a failed company, analysts say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley has been one of the government's key
advisers in restructurings during the financial crisis. The
bank advised the U.S. Treasury on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
and is helping the government sell its remaining stake in
Citigroup Inc (C.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The underwriting banks are expected to get about 0.75
percentage point of the deal in fees, the person briefed on the
matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is relatively low. A typical fee for a smaller IPO is
7 percent, but multibillion-dollar deals usually carry fees
closer to 3 or 3.5 percentage points, a banker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM may also be looking for a line of credit, the person
briefed in the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A banker said underwriters may be willing to accept
lower-than-usual fees because taking a company such as GM
public is seen as prestigious and underwriters hope to win
future business from the automaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Mary Claire Delaney, GM
spokesman Tom Wilkinson and JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony
declined to comment. A Treasury spokesman referred queries to
the department's statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SIZE IN FLUX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM will choose the lead bankers for the IPO, but the
Treasury has veto power over the selection and will determine
the fees paid to underwriters, the Obama administration said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government would retain the right to decide whether to
participate and at what level. [ID:nN10253769]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Treasury provided $50 billion of bankruptcy and bailout
financing to GM last year. That rescue included $43 billion of
cash and nearly $7 billion of direct loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM repaid a $6.7 billion loan in April. The rest of the
U.S. investment is an equity stake the government can start
selling after GM launches an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM has not said how big the IPO will be, but for taxpayers
to be fully repaid the company must be valued at more than $70
billion. Last month, a JPMorgan debt analyst put GM's stock
market value at nearly $90 billion. Ford Motor Co (F.N), in
comparison, has a market capitalization of $38 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The person briefed on the matter said the IPO could be as
big as $20 billion if market demand is high, but cautioned the
size is still in flux and would likely be closer to $10
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the U.S. stock market having dropped in recent weeks
as Europe wrestles with a credit crunch, many initial public
offerings have struggled to find buyers, forcing some companies
to shelf IPO plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The timing of the GM offering is uncertain, but the Obama
administration said it would not happen before the fourth
quarter. Chief Executive Ed Whitacre has said an IPO is a
possibility later this year or in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and
Morgan Stanley were all asked to pitch for the offering, the
person briefed on the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, the Treasury hired Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N) to advise
it on a GM IPO. Under Treasury's 18-month contract with Lazard,
the bank is being paid $500,000 a month until an IPO is
completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In May, GM posted first-quarter profit of $865 million,
surprising Wall Street, and said it might post its first
full-year profit since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal was the first to report earlier on
Friday that Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan were set to be the lead
underwriters of the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley shares closed 1.6 percent higher at $26,
while JPMorgan was down 0.5 percent at $37.09, both on the New
York Stock Exchange.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Trade Trouble, but Less than Thought

As the world economy started to recover so did the price of oil, and once again
our trade deficit has started to deteriorate. This does offer some hope on the
trade picture going forward, as the trouble in Europe has caused oil prices to
fall again, but nothing like the collapse in late 2008. That effect, though, is
likely to be swamped by the loss of U.S. competitiveness on the non-petroleum
side as the Dollar has soared and the Euro collapsed in recent months. Keep in
mind that this data is for April, and thus is before most of the Greek Drama
effects had time to hit, both in terms of the price of oil, and the strength in
the Dollar. 

The effect of changes in exchange rates often works with a bit of a lag, and the
initial effect of a strengthening currency can actually be a decline in the
trade deficit (it costs fewer dollars to buy the same quantity of stuff when the
Dollar is worth more) but that effect is eventually swamped by the fact that
people can get similar goods at cheaper prices from countries with weaker
currencies. 

For example, a Chinese hospital might have already ordered an MRI machine from
General Electric (NYSE: GE), and with the Dollar stronger, it will show up as
being worth more. However, for the next machine the Chinese hospital wants to
buy, they might discover that the Siemens (NYSE: SI) product is just as good (or
almost as good), but since the Euro is very weak, they can get the Siemens
machine significantly cheaper in Yuan than it would cost to buy another GE
machine. This is what economists refer to as the "J-curve." 

I tend to worry far more about the trade deficit than I do about the budget
deficit. It is the trade deficit that is responsible for our increasing
indebtedness to the rest of the world. For each dollar of the trade deficit, we
either have to sell off an asset worth a dollar or go into debt for a dollar. 

If one thinks of it in terms of selling assets, the picture becomes more clear.
In April, we effectively sold off the equivalent of Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) after
we sold off the equivalent of Bristol Myers (NYSE: BMY) in March. How much
longer can we keep that up before we have nothing left? 

Remember that every dollar that the trade deficit goes up, there is a dollar
less of GDP. If we could eliminate the trade deficit, we would increase GDP by
$483 billion at the April rate, or 3.3%. 

The core of our deficit problem is our addiction of oil. That actually
understates the problem in calling it an addiction, since we really need it to
survive. It is kind of like saying a diabetic is addicted to insulin. The BP
(NYSE: BP) disaster in the Gulf really highlights that we cannot drill our way
out of the problem. At best, domestic oil drilling can mitigate the problem, but
clearly it has to be far more regulated and controlled to make sure that it is
done safely than we have seen in the past. Having regulators that are not
LITERALLY in bed with the industry they regulate would be a very good place to
start...

 By Marianna Parraga

 CARACAS, June 11 (Reuters) - Venezuela said on Friday a
preliminary court ruling signaled Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) will
not win its full compensation claim of $10 billion after
President Hugo Chavez nationalized its oil projects in 2007.

 Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said the decision by the World
Bank's International Center for Settlement on Investment
Disputes set a shorter time period for compensation than the
U.S. oil giant had requested.

 "Venezuela sees this ruling as favorable, although we are
conscious that this is not the end of the judicial process,"
Ramirez told a news conference.

 An Exxon Mobil spokesman said it remained willing to talk
directly with the government about compensation, while
continuing arbitration proceedings. The company's stock fell
0.05 percent to $61.86 on Friday.

 Chavez's socialist government took control of the country's
most lucrative oil fields from foreign companies in a push for
state-run industry in 2007 that also took in telecommunications
and power firms, farms and parts of the finance sector.

 That included taking a majority stake in heavy oil projects
in the Orinoco belt worth tens of billions of dollars. (Factbox
[ID:nN11258364])   

 France's Total SA (TOTF.PA) and Norway's StatoilHydro
(STL.OL) received about $1 billion compensation after reducing
their holdings. BP Plc (BP.L) (BP.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
also remained as minority partners and received compensation.

 Along with ConocoPhillips (COP.N), Exxon left Venezuela all
together after failing to agree to compensation with the
government. Both companies launched suits later that year.

 In 2008, Exxon asked a British court to freeze $12 billion
of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA's overseas assets in lieu
of compensation.

 Chavez threatened to cut oil exports to the United States
in retaliation, before the British court rejected the request.

 Venezuela has a total of 10 pending cases before the World
Bank's court, of which Conoco's is the largest claim.

 Exxon had petitioned it to consider compensation from 2004
when Chavez raised royalties for oil companies.

 But Ramirez said the preliminary ruling by the court was
that it would only consider the period after 2006 when Exxon
registered its assets in the Netherlands, with whom Venezuela
has a bilateral investment protection treaty.

 Exxon brought its case against Venezuela in October 2007,
and ConocoPhillips followed suit two months later.

 Ramirez said ConocoPhillips was seeking $30 billion in
compensation, which the oil minister called a "fantasy."

 "Both these amounts are invalid because they include
executive decisions taken by the government since 2004," he
said. "Their opening arguments are rejected by this decision."

 A ConocoPhillips spokesman said the company had no
comment.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades and assigns Loss Severity (LS) ratings to JP Morgan
Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corporation's commercial mortgage
pass-through certificates, series 2002-CIBC4 as follows: 

--$10 million class D to 'A/LS5' from 'AAA'; Outlook to Negative from Stable;
--$24 million class E to 'B-/LS5' from 'A'; Outlook to Negative from Stable;
--$12 million class F to 'B-/LS5' from 'BBB'; Outlook to Negative from Stable;
--$12 million class H to 'C/RR6' from 'CCC/RR1'. 

In addition, Fitch downgrades and assigns a Recovery Rating (RR) to the
following class: 

--$14 million class G to 'C/RR6' from ''BB'; Outlook Negative. 

Fitch also lowers the Recovery Rating of the following class: 

--$4 million class J to 'C/RR6' from 'C/RR2'. 

Fitch affirms and assigns LS ratings to the following classes as indicated: 

--$49.2 million class A-2 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable;
--$403.2 million class A-3 at 'AAA'/LS1; Outlook Stable;
--Interest-only class X-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;
--Interest-only class X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;
--$32 million class B at 'AAA/LS4'; Outlook Stable;
--$34 million class C at 'AAA/LS4'; Outlook to Negative from Stable;
--$6 million class K at 'C/RR6';
--$8 million class L at 'C/RR6';
--$2.4 million class M at 'D/RR6'. 

Fitch does not rate class NR. Class A-1 has been paid in full. 

The rating downgrades are due to an increase in expected losses on specially
serviced assets coupled with expected losses following Fitch's prospective
review of potential stresses to the transaction. Fitch expects losses of 6.9% of
the remaining pool balance, approximately $42.1 million. The majority of the
Fitch total expected losses (82%) are associated with the specially serviced
asset, Highland Mall. 

As of the May 2010 distribution date, the pool has paid down 23.6% to $610.5
million from $798.9 million at issuance. There are 108 of the original 121 loans
remaining in the transaction, 27 of which have defeased (31%) including four
(9.3%) of the top ten loans in the transaction. Three loans (12%) are currently
in special servicing and losses are expected. 

The largest loan in special servicing (10.3%), the Highland Mall loan, is
collateralized by 487,170 sf of a 1,120,347 sf Regional Mall located in Austin,
TX. The mall was originally anchored by Dillard's Women's, Macy's and Dillard's
Men's and Home. Macy's and Dillard's Women own their own stores and underlying
land. The loan transferred to special servicing in June 2009 due to imminent
default relating to tenancy issues. Dillard's, one of the anchors, closed its
owned store and filed a suit to void the lease for an additional 80,000 sf. A
notice of breach of the ground lease was sent to the borrower, and the borrower
disputed the alleged breaches. In September 2009, the borrower filed a suit
against the fee owner to dispute the breach and prevent the termination of the
ground lease. A monetary default occurred with the September 2009 payment. The
asset became real estate owned (REO) on May 4, 2010 through the special purpose
entity's (SPE) assumption of the ground lease. The SPE, with title to the
leasehold, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 12, 2010. As of the March 31, 2010
rent roll, in-line occupancy is 63%, and overall occupancy, which includes the
80,000 sf Dillard's Men's and Home space, is 71%. Fitch expects significant
losses upon liquidation of this asset based on a recent valuation obtained by
the servicer. 

The second largest specially serviced asset (1%) is secured by an industrial
warehouse property located in New Kingstown, PA and is currently 90 days
delinquent. The loan transferred to special servicing in November 2009 due to
monetary default. Excel Logistics which was the sole tenant at the property
vacated upon their lease expiration in July 2007. The property had been leased
to several month-to-month tenants which have since vacated. The property is
currently 100% vacant, and there are no prospective tenants at this time. 

Fitch stressed the cash flow of the remaining non defeased loans by applying a
5% reduction to 2009 fiscal year end net operating income, 10% reduction to
2008, and 15% for all loans which did not report YE 2008 and applying an
adjusted market cap rate between 7.25% and 10.5% to determine value. 

Similar to Fitch's prospective analysis of recent vintage CMBS, each loan also
underwent a refinance test by applying an 8% interest rate and 30-year
amortization schedule based on the stressed cash flow. Loans that could
refinance to a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 times or higher were
considered to payoff at maturity. Of the non-defeased or non-specially serviced
loans, four loans (2.9% of the pool) incurred a loss when compared to Fitch's

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's mounting legal and regulatory woes stemming from the firm's sale of subprime mortgage-linked securities are turning into gold for a growing number of lawyers in New York and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street investment firm tapped well known litigation specialists Boies, Schiller  Flexner to defend a lawsuit filed June 9 by an Australian hedge fund that seeks $1 billion in damages, said people familiar with the situation, but who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Boies, the New York-based firm's co-founder and chairman, is best known for overseeing the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust case against Microsoft Corp and directing former Vice President Al Gore's Florida recount in the 2000 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boies Schiller will join with lawyers from Sullivan  Cromwell, Skadden Arps, Gibson Dunn  Crutcher and O'Melveny  Myers, all of whom have had a hand in advising Goldman on either a civil fraud lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or on dealings with other federal investigative bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's rising legal tab is just one more example of fallout from myriad investigations and lawsuits facing the company as it fends off allegations from regulators, customers and shareholders that it used deceptive sales practices to market billions of dollars' worth of collateralized debt obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, the regulatory scandal, which began with the filing of the SEC lawsuit on April 16, has cost Goldman $25 billion in market capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which does not break out a specific line item for outside legal expenses in its quarterly financial reports, declined to comment on its legal defense strategy. It disclosed at its annual shareholder meeting that it paid $293 million in 2009 for outside legal expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Schiller, Boies Schiller's co-founder, who has represented Barclays Capital in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, will oversee Goldman's defense to the lawsuit brought by Basis Yield Alpha Fund, sources said. Schiller could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis seeks to recoup the $56 million it lost on an investment in a CDO called Timberwolf that liquidated in 2008 -- a little over a year after Goldman underwrote the $1 billion deal. The now-defunct Basis fund, which contends Goldman misrepresented the value of the Timberwolf securities, also seeks $1 billion in punitive damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the weeks leading up to the filing of the lawsuit, negotiations between Goldman and the Australian hedge fund had been led by Richard Klapper of Sullivan  Cromwell, people familiar with the situation said. But once the lawsuit was filed, Goldman decided to retain the Boies firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Boies firm, sources said, may also work on other CDO-related matters facing Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klapper, who could not be reached for comment, has been Goldman's lead outside lawyer in dealing with the SEC, which filed a civil fraud lawsuit over another CDO, Abacus 2007, on April 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the SEC lawsuit, Goldman has been signing up other high-profile lawyers, some with deep political connections in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first people Goldman turned to was Gregory Craig, a former White House counsel for President Barack Obama, and now a partner in Skadden's Washington office. Working with Craig is Skadden litigation partner Cliff Sloan, who served as associate counsel to former President Bill Clinton and has also represented the rock band Bon Jovi in a copyright infringement lawsuit, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craig declined to comment on Skadden's legal work for Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, though, started building its outside legal team long before it was charged by the SEC on April 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than a year, the firm was the subject of a probe by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, a examination that concluded with a Capitol Hill hearing on April 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two former subcommittee staffers -- K Lee Blalack, a partner with O'Melveny  Myers, and Michael Bopp, a partner with Gibson Dunn -- helped prepare Goldman Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and other current and former executives for the widely publicized hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matthew Goldstein and Steve Eder.

&lt;p&gt; (adds quotes, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Nancy Leinfuss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Securities sold the
largest conduit deal in the CMBS market in nearly two years on
Friday into solid demand but investors required extra spread to
buy securities further out the curve and for lower-rated
securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The commercial mortgage-backed securitization, dubbed
"JPMCC 2010-C1," is backed by 36 fixed-rate commercial mortgage
loans secured by 96 properties. JPMorgan Chase Bank loans
comprise 76.4 percent of the offering, while 21.6 percent of
loans come from Ladder Capital Finance, market sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale's largest AAA-rated tranche, a $416.1 million
4.53-year issue, priced at initial spread guidance of 140 basis
points over swaps. Its AAA-rated $131.3 million 6.76-year issue
also priced at initial guidance of 160 basis points over swaps,
market sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both tranches met with the strong interest, with many
buyers particularly focused on the shortest tranche, market
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We participated in the deal's $416.1 million five-year
'AAA' tranche and would have like to have played in the 10-year
'AAA' issue, but the size was too small at $61.5 million," said
William Bemis, portfolio manager at Aviva Investors. "There's a
big difference in liquidity with a larger-sized tranche," said
Bemis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal also included $61.5 million of AAA-rated 9.53-year
securities that priced five basis points wider than guidance at
165 basis points over swaps, as investors required additional
spread premium for the longer maturity, market sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The conduit sale's three lower-rated tranches included a
$16.1 million AA-rated 9.98-year note issue that priced at a
wider spread of 250 basis points over swaps, versus spread
guidance of 225 to 240 basis points over swaps, market sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All classes of the deal got done but the issuer struggled
with the 'AA' class, which underwriters were still taking
orders for this morning," said Bemis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its other tranches included, a $26.9 million A-minus rated
9.98-year notes also priced at a wider spread of 345 basis
points over swaps, compared to earlier guidance of 325 to 340
basis points over swaps, and its lowest BBB-rated $14.3 million
9.98-year note issue that also came on the wider end of initial
guidance of 425 to 440 basis points over swaps, at a 440 basis
points, market sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal was just the second so-called conduit issue to hit
the recovering market that provides credit for office, retail
and apartment buildings since 2008. The conduit offering is
seen as a key gauge of risk appetite for securities tied to the
troubled commercial real estate market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recently, banks have more actively been able to bundle
together loans from several borrowers for multi-loan CMBS
issues. The lending is a hopeful sign for a market whose
absence led to soaring defaults and the risk of hundreds more
with maturing loans finding few outlets for refinancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, RBS priced $309.7 million CMBS backed by multiple
loans, in the first sale of its kind this year. That followed
three single-borrower deals that were sold in the CMBS market
in December 2009 as the market began to recover.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Thursday confirmed that Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 contain an unpatched bug that could be used to infect PCs by duping users into visiting rigged Web sites or opening attack e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it has seen no active in-the-wild attacks exploiting the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bug in Windows' Help and Support Center -- a component that lets users access and download Microsoft help files from the Web -- doesn't properly parse the "hcp" protocol handler, Microsoft said in an advisory issued Thursday afternoon. Attackers can leverage the vulnerability by enticing users to malicious or hacked Web sites, or by convincing them to open malformed e-mail messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Vista, Windows 7 , Windows Server and Windows Server 2008 R2 are not vulnerable to the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to produce a patch, but has not set a release date. "Microsoft is currently working to develop a security update for Windows to address this vulnerability," the advisory stated. July 13 is Microsoft's next scheduled Patch Tuesday, but it sometimes issues patches outside its monthly plan. The last time it did so was in late March when it fixed a bug in Internet Explorer that attackers were aggressively exploiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisory was prompted by the bug's disclosure early Thursday , and the release of proof-of-concept attack code. Tavis Ormandy, a security engineer who works for Google in Switzerland, defended the decision to reveal the flaw only five days after reporting it to Microsoft. But Microsoft and other researchers questioned the quick publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft made no distinction between Ormandy and his employer in a blog post Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This issue was reported to us on June 5, 2010 by a Google security researcher and then made public less than four days later, on June 9, 2010," said Mike Reavey, the director of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC). "Public disclosure of the details of this vulnerability and how to exploit it, without giving us time to resolve the issue for our potentially affected customers, makes broad attacks more likely and puts customers at risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the time stamp on Ormandy's message to the Full Disclosure mailing list, he posted it at 1:46 a.m. Swiss time on June 10, or 4:46 p.m. PT on June 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies have traded blows this year that have included public arguments about the quality of each other's software suites -- Google Docs and Microsoft Office -- and about reports that Google wants to phase out Windows inside the company over security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some security researchers blasted Ormandy for going public when Google's policy is to not reveal a bug until the affected vendor has a chance to fix the flaw. "Google can't have their cake and eat it too," said Robert Hansen, the CEO of SecTheory, in an interview yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ormandy declined to comment when contacted by e-mail. In a message on Twitter late Thursday, however, he said, "The HelpCtr bug today was intended as a personal project. It sucks that work has been dragged into it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Help and Support Center vulnerability was the eighth zero-day -- the term used to describe a threat for which there is no patch -- that Microsoft has faced so far this year, according to data provided by Andrew Storms, the director of security operations at nCircle Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six of those vulnerabilities have been patched, with fixes released an average of 43 days after Microsoft acknowledged the bug. The fastest turnaround was seven days for an emergency IE patch Microsoft closed in January. Hackers had exploited the bug to break into Google's corporate network . The longest cycle so far this year was 125 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Microsoft handled 10 zero-days, also patching them in an average of 43 days, with a shortest time-to-fix of eight days and a longest of 151 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite the fact that Microsoft has made progress in getting researchers to report vulnerabilities, they're not immune to zero-days," said Storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the current pace, Microsoft will have to deal with 18 zero-days during 2010, nearly double the number in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;Communities Urge Ecuadorian Prosecutors to Interview Chevron Contractor Diego
Borja over Massive Fraud by Oil Giant
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
A Chevron contractor bragged that he participated in a wide-ranging fraud by
Chevron to pay bribes, fake court-ordered soil samples and doctor evidence to
cover up the company`s culpability in a $27.3 billion environmental lawsuit,
according to sworn testimony from a key government witness. 

Santiago Escobar, the whistleblower who recently released taped conversations
with long-time Chevron contractor and friend Diego Borja, testified on June 8
before the Ecuadorian equivalent of a Grand Jury that Borja admitted that test
results submitted by Chevron to the court were doctored. Escobar and Borja, both
now in their 30s, are childhood friends from Quito. 

Escobar appeared with his father at a press conference in Quito on Wednesday to
say he had received a death threat contained in an email sent the day he
testified. The prosecutor`s office is investigating an incident in 2009 where
Borja secretly taped the trial judge overseeing the case - an act that the
plaintiffs charged was part of Chevron`s "dirty tricks" operation to undermine a
trial it is losing. 

Escobar said that Borja told him that, during dozens of court-supervised
inspections of Chevron well sites that took place from 2004 to 2008, he and
technicians on Chevron`s trial team conspired to submit fake samples. Borja told
his friend that the Chevron team would lift soil samples from contaminated well
sites and put them in bottles. They would then drive 10 to 30 kilometers away
from the sites and replace the bottles with clean soil taken from areas that had
nothing to do with oil production. 

Chevron`s technical team would then turn in the clean samples to a laboratory
with markings indicating they had been lifted from the contaminated well sites,
Escobar said. 

"If true, this testimony is powerful proof of Chevron`s ongoing fraud in the
Ecuador trial - fraud that appears to have been orchestrated by Chevron`s legal
team given that Borja was paid by that legal team and worked under its control,"
said Steven Donziger, an American legal advisor to dozens of indigenous and
farmer communities suing the oil giant. 

"The kind of scientific fraud, if committed by Chevron, would be the equivalent
of BP taking water samples in the Indian Ocean to determine if the Gulf of
Mexico is being polluted," Donziger said. 

Chevron is accused in the lawsuit of dumping more than 18.5 billion gallons of
toxic waste directly into the rainforest, abandoning more than 900 unlined toxic
waste pits, and leaving a legacy of poisoned air and water that has led to an
outbreak of cancer and the decimation of indigenous groups. 

The potential liability has been a major irritant to Chevron for years,
threatening to consume 20% of its market value and prompting new CEO John Watson
to order the arrest of five critics at the company`s annual meeting last month.
Watson himself has been embroiled in charges he did not perform adequate due
diligence when Chevron bought Texaco in 2001. 

Experts estimate that the amount of oil waste deliberately discharged by Chevron
to cut costs when it ran an oil concession in Ecuador surpasses the BP spill by
at least ten times. An area of rainforest roughly the size of Rhode Island and
home to five indigenous groups has been poisoned, according to the lawsuit. 

According to Escobar`s testimony, Borja said he was involved in a series of
"clandestine operations" on behalf of Chevron to pay bribes, manipulate the
court and undermine the trial. One bribe was paid in 2005 to Ecuadorian military
officials to produce a false report that alleged a security "threat" to Chevron
lawyers. 

That report was then presented by Chevron`s lawyers to the trial judge, who
immediately used it as a basis to suspend a critical judicial inspection of
Chevron`s Guanta well site where indigenous Cofan leaders were set to testify.
Several international media outlets, including The New York Times and the Los
Angeles Times, were in the Amazon to cover the inspection as was Chevron`s chief
American lawyer overseeing the trial, Ricardo Reis Veiga. 

An investigation by Ecuador`s high military command later revealed the security
threat was fabricated and the report was false, and sanctioned the local base
commander. During the investigation, it was disclosed that Chevron had signed a
private contract with the base commander to pay him a monthly fee without
revealing it to the trial court; uniformed and armed soldiers from the same base
were often seen carrying equipment for the Chevron lawyers during the trial. 

Borja also told Escobar that he had arranged the "biggest business deal of his
life" and that he had received a "ton of money" for his actions on behalf of
Chevron in undermining the lawsuit. Chevron has admitted paying Borja a large
salary and moving him and his family to a luxury house in California, where he
cannot be questioned by Ecuadorian investigators. 

Borja has refused to answer demands from the Ecuadorian government that he
testify regarding his role in Chevron`s scam. He is being represented by a
prominent Bay Area criminal defense attorney Chris Arguedes, whose fees are
being paid by Chevron. 

"It is now clear that what the plaintiffs have long alleged is true: Chevron has
systematically lied, falsified scientific testing results, and engaged in
malfeasance to try to undermine the trial because it knows that the actual
evidence shows the extent of the contamination in the region," said Pablo
Fajardo, the lead Ecuadorian attorney for the plaintiffs. 

"Borja is clearly at the center of a massive fraud. If he refuses to return to
Ecuador, he should be extradited to answer the critical questions about the
fraud being committed by Chevron`s legal team," Fajardo said. "Chevron needs to
stop hiding Borja and make him available to the investigating authorities." 

Escobar was ordered to testify in Ecuador after he provided over six hours of
audio recordings and more than 25 pages of chat transcripts of conversations
between Borja and himself. Escobar said he made the recordings because he was
disgusted that Borja was accepting money to try to undermine Ecuador`s justice
system. 

At one point in the recordings, Borja is heard laughing and says "crime does
pay" before detailing that Chevron is paying $6,000 a month in rent for his
large home with a swimming pool that abuts a golf course in a gated community
near Chevron's headquarters in San Ramon. 

On the audiotapes, Borja told Escobar that Chevron hired him to create four
dummy companies so his work would appear "independent." He went on to state that
he was paid by Chevron to collect samples from contaminated sites while working
Chevron`s supposedly independent testing laboratory for the trial, Severn Trent
Laboratory (STL), at the same time. 

On those recordings, Borja indicated that he and Reis Veiga lied to gain entry
into the independent laboratory that was processing the soil and water samples
for the plaintiffs during the trial. Reis Veiga, who works for Chevron in Miami,
was indicted in Ecuador in 2008 for his part in a fraud connected to a 1995-98
sham remediation carried out by the company. 

See this press release for more information on Borja and the secret recordings.

&lt;p&gt;Award recognizes NCR`s innovation in transforming customer experiences with
interactive digital signage applications built on Microsoft Windows Embedded
Standard 7
DULUTH, Ga.--(Business Wire)--
NCR Corporation (NYSE: NCR) today announced that it has won a Microsoft Windows
Embedded OEM Partner Excellence Award for its innovation in enhancing consumer
experiences and leveraging Windows Embedded platforms and technologies to build
new applications, such as the latest version of the NCR Netkey management
software. 

Introduced in March 2010, this new version supports Windows Embedded Standard 7
and includes many enhancements to simplify digital signage content management
and deliver richer content, which helps companies connect better with consumers
and offer a more dynamic experience. 

The NCR Netkey management software is the first to bring together in-store
digital advertising and self-service kiosks under a single platform, enabling
companies to leverage rich multimedia content across digital signs and kiosks.
For example, a business could opt to use digital advertising to promote their
loyalty program and then make it easy for customers to enroll at self-service
kiosks. 

These innovations mean that NCR customers can introduce a growing range of
interactive kiosk and digital signage applications faster across multiple
industries on disparate hardware platforms. Examples include Gift Registry,
which provides consumers with a convenient, self-service means of creating and
purchasing from wish lists and Endless Aisle, which helps retailers integrate
their e-commerce and bricks-and-mortar operations by providing a means for
consumers to view a retailer`s extended inventory on a kiosk in the store. 

"We are pleased to recognize NCR`s contribution and commitment to building
innovative digital signage applications that improve the in-store customer
experience," said Pascal Martin, general manager of OEM Embedded Sales for
Microsoft Windows Embedded. "NCR has a proven track record of delivering a wide
range of high-quality, complementary solutions that will help our mutual
customers build their next generation, smart, connected digital signage devices
based on Windows Embedded platforms and technologies." 

The award recognizes Microsoft partners who bring innovative solutions to market
using the Windows Embedded portfolio of platforms and technologies. NCR is a
Microsoft Gold Certified Partner. 

"Our relationship with Microsoft plays a key role in helping NCR deliver
innovative solutions to our customers and enabling them to deliver a seamless
and rich experience to their customers," added Dusty Lutz, general manager, NCR
Netkey digital signage and kiosk applications. "Windows Embedded includes many
technology innovations that allow us to quickly build the cutting-edge digital
signage and self-service applications our customers demand to reach consumers in
a more personalized and compelling manner."

--  Power edit mode -- make edits across an entire document or spreadsheet
    with a multi-edit toolbox. Quickly format text, numbers, paragraphs,
    backgrounds and cells without opening and closing multiple menus.
--  Single-screen viewing -- an intuitive way to navigate horizontally and
    vertically through folders and files, and conveniently review file
    information within a single-screen view.
--  Advanced touch controls -- manage files with simple-to-use touch, tap
    and drag controls with an advanced connected file manager. Scroll in
    any direction and drag and drop to email, move, copy and delete files
    on the iPad or on supported remote storage accounts.
--  Smooth page scrolling -- single-touch navigation to preview page
    thumbnails and jump to any page in any size document.

    

"As a company, we have made a fundamental commitment and investment
to our iPad app to deliver a new and innovative Office experience to
match the elegant design of the iPad," said Alan Masarek, CEO at
Quickoffice. "We are excited to be launching a robust, customized iPad
application that meets consumers' Office needs through an exciting and
interactive app that is responsive to their touch. This new product
launch is strategically very important for the company, as we look to

countries with nine more to start selling the device in July, the market
and number of users continue to grow. Targeting this growing user base,
Quickoffice Connect Mobile Suite for the iPad also allows users to
retrieve information, view, edit and save back to their preferred storage

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL/SINGAPORE, June 11 (Reuters) - The head of JPMorgan
Chase's South Korean unit, Steve Lim, is being investigated by
local authorities probing insider trading allegations, an
official at the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) said on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We probed JPMorgan and its chief over unfair trading and
referred the issue to prosecutors," the official told Reuters,
asking not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the
media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ernst Lee, spokesman for the Financial Services Commission
(FSC), said Lim was under investigation for suspicious
transactions conducted last year. "We have not been informed of
the result," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lim, one of the longest serving chiefs of a foreign bank
operating in South Korea, was quizzed by prosecutors this week
over allegations of unfair trading involving two to three firms
including building materials firm KCC Corp (002380.KS), the
Money Today newspaper reported earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Money Today quoted Lim as denying all allegations, saying
he was not investigated by prosecutors. He noted one of his
relatives was investigated over KCC stock trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan declined comment.

&lt;p&gt;VIENNA, June 11 (Reuters) - A reduction in clients's risk
appetite could affect JPMorgan's (JPM.N) second-quarter
performance, its investment banking chief Jes Staley said on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Client activity has reduced. Clients are taking risk off
... People are a little more wary, and that may have an impact
on Q2, but I think it's way too early to tell right now," Staley
told reporters on the sidelines of a financial industry
conference in Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment banks are experiencing more difficult markets
than in the first quarter, and Switzerland's UBS
(UBSN.VX)(UBS.N) on Thursday said it faces weaker second quarter
earnings after capital markets turbulence. [ID:nLDE65911O]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staley said JPMorgan would also be affected by a drop-off in
primary issuance and said while the bank had enjoyed market
share gains, its top priority was serving clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you get overly focused on market share you may lose
sight of your clients -- and that's the surest way to lose
market share," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's very hard to hypothesise what the economic impact" of
proposed derivatives regulation would be, Staley added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Quentin Webb; editing by Simon Jessop)

SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This news release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the federal securities laws. Statements regarding future events, developments,
the Company's future performance, as well as management's expectations, beliefs,
intentions, plans, estimates or projections relating to the future (including,
without limitation, statements concerning revenue and net income), are
forward-looking statements within the meaning of these laws and involve a number
of risks and uncertainties. Management believes that these forward looking
statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions and forecasts,
however, undue reliance should not be placed on such statements that speak only
as of the date hereof. Moreover, these forward-looking statements are subject to
a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outlined below. As a
result, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated by the
forward-looking statements. Among the important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking
statements are: the volume and timing of systems sales and installations; length
of sales cycles and the installation process; the possibility that products will
not achieve or sustain market acceptance; seasonal patterns of sales and
customer buying behavior; the development by competitors of new or superior
technologies; the timing, cost and success or failure of new product and service
introductions, development and product upgrade releases; undetected errors or
bugs in software; product liability; changing economic, political or regulatory
influences in the health-care industry; changes in product-pricing policies;
availability of third-party products and components; competitive pressures
including product offerings, pricing and promotional activities; the Company's
ability or inability to attract and retain qualified personnel; possible
regulation of the Company's software by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration;
uncertainties concerning threatened, pending and new litigation against the
Company including related professional services fees; uncertainties concerning
the amount and timing of professional fees incurred by the Company generally;
changes of accounting estimates and assumptions used to prepare the prior
periods' financial statements; general economic conditions; and the risk factors
detailed from time to time in the Company`s periodic reports and registration
statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A significant
portion of the Company's quarterly sales of software product licenses and
computer hardware is concluded in the last month of the fiscal quarter,
generally with a concentration of such revenues earned in the final ten business
days of that month. Due to these and other factors, the Company's revenues and
operating results are very difficult to forecast. A major portion of the
Company's costs and expenses, such as personnel and facilities, are of a fixed
nature and, accordingly, a shortfall or decline in quarterly and/or annual
revenues typically results in lower profitability or losses. As a result,
comparison of the Company's period-to-period financial performance is not
necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future
performance. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said on Sunday that operations at its 45,000 barrel per day (bpd) Salt Lake City refinery were unaffected by a crude pipeline shut on Saturday due to a leak into a creek that feeds Utah's Great Salt Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10-inch (25-cm) pipeline, which carries mid-grade crude to the refinery north of Salt Lake City, was shut on Saturday morning after oil was discovered leaking from it into Red Butte Creek, which is part of a system of waterways feeding Utah's Great Salt Lake, said a fire department spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're estimating 500 barrels were spilled," said Salt Lake City Fire Department spokesman Scott Freitag in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temporary dams were built along Red Butte Creek to prevent the crude spilled from spreading further, Freitag said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said the pipeline has stopped leaking since it halted the flow of oil through the pipeline on Saturday morning until repairs can be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokesman said the company was working to determine the amount of oil released from the leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have no estimate on how long cleanup will take, but we won't quit until the job is done," said Chevron's Sean Comey in a statement.

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, June 15 (Reuters) - Australian law firm Slater 
Gordon is looking at a possible class-action suit on behalf of
investors in the failed Basis Yield Alpha Fund, which made
heavy losses on a debt instrument marketed by Goldman Sachs
(GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Slater  Gordon (SGH.AX), which sayd its has won
settlements in class-action suits over asbestos-poisoning and
breast implants over the past 20 years, said on Tuesday that
about 100 investors had already contacted the firm about the
fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The fund was being promoted as a product that was a
stable, low-risk and fixed-interest investment, but in reality
it was a high risk with exposure to products that were not
necessarily suitable for retail investors, retirees and
charities," litigation lawyer Mark Walter said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Up to 700 Australian investors are estimated to have
suffered a capital loss of more than A$300 million ($258
million) because of the fund's collapse in 2007, the statement
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Basis Yield filed a law suit this month
accusing Goldman of misrepresenting the value of a
collateralised debt obligation (CDO) known as Timberwolf, which
garnered a lot of attention during a recent congressional
hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Basis Yield sued Goldman to recoup $56 million it lost on
the CDO, said Eric Lewis, a Washington-based lawyer for the
fund. The suit also seeks $1 billion in punitive damages.
[ID:nN09150585].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs has called the suit a misguided attempt by
Basis Yield to shift its investment losses to Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slater  Gordon said it was investigating financial
advisors that recommended the Basis Yield fund to investors,
not Goldman Sachs.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft began offering on Monday guidance intended to help developers make secure applications for the company's Windows Azure cloud platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidance is being offered in the form of a technical paper accessible on Microsoft's site that's entitled, "Security Practices for Developing Windows Azure Applications." It is intended for developers, designers, architects and testers and is based on the company's Security Development Lifecycle practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ In February, InfoWorld reported that Microsoft  offered atemplate for applying Securty Development Lifecycle concepts  to agile software development. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Issues related to the security of the cloud are becoming increasingly important for businesses and consumers. As a result, it's important that people delivering products to the cloud understand that they must build applications with security in mind from the start," a Microsoft representative said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper focuses on practices for secure design, development, and deployment, including service layer/application security considerations and protections provided by Azure and underlying network infrastructure. Sample design patterns for hardened/reduced-privilege services are covered as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the topics featured are identity management and access control, data security, Active Directory Federation Services 2.0, and Windows Azure Platform Access Control service. Developers, the paper states, must consider potential threats to Azure applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Computing solutions that use Windows Azure are very compelling to companies wishing to trim capital expenditure," the report concludes. "However, security remains an important consideration. Software architects and developers must understand the threats to software developed for 'the cloud' and use appropriate secure design and implementation practices to counter threats in the cloud environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The progression from client-server to Web to cloud applications has changed the boundary of applications and these shifts make understanding threats to Azure-based software "all the more important," the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First announced in October 2008, Azure became generally available earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, "Microsoft offers security guidance for Azure cloud," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

 (Adds price cut on lower-end Xboxes, Electronic Arts games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Franklin Paul and Gabriel Madway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, June 14 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
will begin selling its "Kinect" motion-sensing game system on
Nov. 4, before the crucial holiday season, hoping to lure new
and casual players to the Xbox and steal a march on rivals
Nintendo Co Ltd 7974.OS and Sony Corp (6758.T) (SNE.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software vendor, which has ambitions of
making its Xbox 360 not just a gaming device but a hub of home
video and Web entertainment, will also begin selling a smaller,
same-priced version of the console this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft would not say how much Kinect -- which plugs into
Xboxes and lets players control games with body and hand
gestures -- will sell for, though analysts' estimates range
from $50 to $200. Executives said 15 titles from developers
including Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O and Ubisoft
Entertainment SA (UBIP.PA) will be available at the time of
launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ahead of this week's Electronic Entertainment Expo
convention in Los Angeles, Microsoft offered sneak peaks of
upcoming titles, including a LucasArts game in which Jedi
Knights do battle with light sabers, and a fitness program that
lets players compete in sports from bowling to sprinting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's leading gaming hardware makers, hoping to
reignite the slumping $60 billion industry, will unveil a
plethora of futuristic gadgets at the E3 convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rush of technology comes just as the video game
industry, which dwarfs the $10 billion domestic movie box
office, needs it. U.S. industry sales -- hardware, software and
accessories -- are down more than 10 percent at $4.7 billion
this year through April, according to research firm NPD Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; E3 FACTBOX              [ID:nN14206793]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Graphics showing share performance of games industry:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; link.reuters.com/tab99k&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also said on Monday it had struck a deal with
Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) ESPN network to broadcast live
sporting events into U.S. living rooms through the Xbox 360
games console, bypassing traditional cable providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Live games will be broadcast through Microsoft's Xbox Live
service, and will be offered at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It already offers Netflix (NFLX.O) movies and Zune music
and videos through its Xbox Live online subscription service.
There has been talk that it will announce a deal to add Hulu TV
shows to the service at E3. [ID:nN0899538]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The arrival of Kinect may pressure Nintendo, which
pioneered motion-sensing gaming through an all-purpose
controller with its Wii system. Nintendo is expected to unveil
more details on its 3D games system that requires no glasses at
E3 [ID:nN09169766].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This year's E3 gives the gaming industry the first real
opportunity to prove that it's not just about making
shoot-em-up games for testosterone-fueled boys," Forrester
Research analyst James McQuivey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is because the secret to the gaming industry's future
is the realization that game consoles are the most powerful
device in the living room," he wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A HIGH BAR?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a surprise announcement, Microsoft also showed off a
more compact, higher-capacity Xbox console that will ship to
retailers on Monday and be available to consumers this week.
With a 250-gigabyte hard drive, the console will carry the same
price tag of $299.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the same time, Microsoft will slash $50 off the price of
lower-capacity Xbox models -- the Xbox 360 Arcade and Xbox 360
Elite -- to $149.99 and $249.99, respectively. That makes them
more affordable than the roughly $300 PlayStation -- though it
comes with more capacity -- and in good shape against the
roughly $199 Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Electronic Entertainment Design and Research analyst Jesse
Divnich said Microsoft set a high bar ahead of announcements
from Nintendo and Sony this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This presentation was a great sign of how Microsoft is
transforming the Xbox into being a real entertainment
platform," he said. "In a sense, they are trying to reinvent
the Xbox 360, have it appeal to a broader audience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sony is expected to unveil its "Move" platform, which will
compete with Kinect and Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft fell 0.64 percent to close at $25.50 on
Nasdaq. Disney fell 0.9 percent to $33.93 and Sony slipped 0.7
percent to $28.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's Kinect is a three-camera system that plugs into
Xbox and allows for hands-free games and controlling the
console with voice commands. The platform, if it works well,
takes gamers a step beyond Nintendo's Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some may have been disappointed by the lack of blockbuster
franchises -- such as Activision Blizzard Inc's (ATVI.O) "Call
of Duty" -- in the initial wave of releases for Kinect, but
executives said that was a conscious decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Electronic Arts also announced on Monday it was developing
a fitness game called Active 2 for Kinect, due for release in
November. At a news conference, the company outlined updates to
its Medal of Honor, Madden NFL and Need for Speed franchises,
with an appearance by football great Joe Montana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The last thing I want to do is take a franchise that's
strong and shove something in it too quickly," said Phil
Spencer, vice president of Microsoft Game Studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We want to put Kinect in the hands of creators (of Call of
Duty and so on) and see what magic they come up with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Janco Partners' analyst Mike Hickey said, "The fitness and
dance games are both potential killer applications, driving a
reasonably strong Kinect attach rate to the existing installed
base and early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The ESPN deal is huge, and the social networking
applications Kinect offers are potentially powerful for driving
initial adoption and loyalty," he said.

Executives said 15 titles, including one from Ubisoft, will be available at the time of launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of this week's E3 convention, Microsoft offered sneak peaks of upcoming titles, including a LucasArts game in which Jedi Knights do battle with light sabers, and a fitness program that lets players compete in sports from bowling to sprinting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's leading gaming hardware makers, hoping to reignite the slumping $60 billion industry, will unveil a plethora of futuristic gadgets at the E3 convention this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rush of technology comes just as the video game industry, which dwarfs the $10 billion domestic movie box office, needs it. U.S. industry sales -- hardware, software and accessories -- are down more than 10 percent to $4.7 billion this year through April, according to research firm NPD Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said on Monday it had struck a deal with Walt Disney Co's ESPN network to broadcast live sporting events into U.S. living rooms through the Xbox 360 games console, bypassing traditional cable providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live games will be broadcast through Microsoft's Xbox Live service, and will be offered at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It already offers Netflix movies and Zune music and videos through its Xbox Live online subscription service. There has been talk that it will announce a deal to add Hulu TV shows to the service at E3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of Kinect may pressure Nintendo, which pioneered motion-sensing gaming through an all-purpose controller with its Wii system. Nintendo is expected to unveil more details on its 3D games system that requires no glasses at E3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This year's E3 gives the gaming industry the first real opportunity to prove that it's not just about making shoot-em-up games for testosterone-fueled boys," Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is because the secret to the gaming industry's future is the realization that game consoles are the most powerful device in the living room," he wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A HIGH BAR?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a surprise announcement, Microsoft also showed off a more compact, higher-capacity Xbox console that will ship to retailers on Monday and be available to consumers this week. With a 250-gigabyte hard drive, the console will carry the same price tag of $299.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electronic Entertainment Design and Research analyst Jesse Divnich said Microsoft set a high bar ahead of announcements from Nintendo and Sony this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This presentation was a great sign of how Microsoft is transforming the Xbox into being a real entertainment platform," he said. "In a sense, they are trying to reinvent the Xbox 360, have it appeal to a broader audience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony is expected to unveil its "Move" platform, which will compete with Kinect and Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft fell 0.64 percent to close at $25.50 on Nasdaq. Disney fell 0.9 percent to $33.93 and Sony slipped 0.7 percent to $28.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Kinect is a three-camera system that plugs into Xbox and allows for hands-free games and controlling the console with voice commands. The platform, if it works well, takes gamers a step beyond Nintendo's Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some may have been disappointed by the lack of blockbuster franchises -- such as Activision Blizzard Inc's "Call of Duty" -- in the initial wave of releases, but executives said that was a conscious decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The last thing I want to do is take a franchise that's strong and shove something in it too quickly," said Phil Spencer, vice president of Microsoft Game Studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to put Kinect in the hands of creators (of Call of Duty and so on) and see what magic they come up with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janco Partners' analyst Mike Hickey said, "The fitness and dance games are both potential killer applications, driving a reasonably strong Kinect attach rate to the existing installed base and early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ESPN deal is huge, and the social networking applications Kinect offers are potentially powerful for driving initial adoption and loyalty," he sadded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Franklin Paul and Gabriel Madway; Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Richard Chang, Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

Nov. 4, before the crucial holiday season, hoping to lure new
and casual players to the Xbox and steal a march on rivals
Nintendo Co Ltd 7974.OS and Sony Corp (6758.T) (SNE.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software vendor, which has ambitions of

Ubisoft (UBIP.PA), will be available at the time of launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ahead of this week's E3 convention, Microsoft offered sneak
peaks of upcoming titles, including a LucasArts game in which
Jedi Knights do battle with light sabers, and a fitness program
that lets players compete in sports from bowling to sprinting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's leading gaming hardware makers, hoping to
reignite the slumping $60 billion industry, will unveil a
plethora of futuristic gadgets at the E3 convention this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rush of technology comes just as the video game
industry, which dwarfs the $10 billion domestic movie box

GE Introduces New Technology

General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE), a leading worldwide supplier of power
generation and energy delivery technologies, has become the first gas engine
manufacturer to use two-stage turbocharging technology. The innovation addresses
the rising worldwide demand for high-efficiency power generation. 

The company will apply this new technology initially to its Jenbacher J624 gas
engine, GE`s largest gas engine. The usage of the technology will increase the
existing product`s energy output by 10% and electrical efficiency by 1%. 

The new Jenbacher J624 engine is especially designed for operation in warm and
moist environments. It offers greater efficiency and flexibility to customers,
providing option for combined heating and power generation (CPH). The new engine
is expected to be available to its customers by the summer of 2011. 

The new system was developed in collaboration with ABB Turbo Systems Ltd., a
group company of ABB Ltd. (NYSE: ABB). GE received positive response on the new
system from one of its pilot customers, Red Harvest. The technology is believed
to provide the company prospects for future growth in the gas engine business. 

GE had first introduced the J624 gas engine in 2007 and was the world`s first
24-cylinder multi-purpose gas engine for commercial power generation. 

Operating in more than 100 countries globally and employing about 300,000 people
worldwide, GE is a diversified infrastructure, finance and media company. Within
energy sector, the company aims to develop and install technology for the
efficient use of natural resources. The major competitors of GE are Honeywell
International Inc. Co. (NYSE: HON), Siemens (NYSE: SI) and United Technologies
Corp. (NYSE: UTX). 

We currently maintain our Outperform rating on General Electric.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Apple Attracts Antitrust Scrutiny

Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) has attracted an antitrust scrutiny from U.S.
regulators by restricting its largest competitors -- Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG),
Nokia Corp. (NYSE: NOK) and Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) from advertising on
AAPL`s mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad and iPod, according to a
report in the Financial Times. 

Apple released its own mobile advertising network, called the iAd which brings
interactive advertisement to apps on the iPhone and iPod touch devices running
on the iOS 4 software platform. iAd will go live on July 1. 

iAd will enable developers to earn revenue by serving ads in applications on the
iPhone and other mobile devices. AAPL plans to generate over $60 million in
revenue from iAd for 2010, representing 50% of the total estimated U.S. mobile
ad spending for the second half of 2010. 

Apple`s new developer rules restrict third party apps such as an independent ad
service provider with the main business of serving mobile ads, to collect ad
analytics (how ads perform on the iPhone and iPad) from the iPhone, iPad and
iPod. 

If imposed, the proposed terms would prohibit users and developers from using
Google's AdMob service or advertising products on the iPhone and iPad, thereby
reducing competition in the ad mobile space. Google acquired AdMob for $750
million in late May (Apple had also planned to acquire AdMob). 

Google's representative said that the artificial barriers to competition set by
Apple will come in the way of technological progress and affect users and
developers in the long run. Moreover, Apple's developers` agreement would lower
Google's advertising revenue generated over the iPhone. 

According to the Financial Times report, U.S. regulators will scrutinize Apple`s
actions versus third parties such as Google and Microsoft to see if it is
barring them from advertising on the iPhone and iPad. 

We believe this action will greatly alleviate competition and generate higher
sales and profits for AAPL. This move should give AAPL a toehold in the emerging
mobile search market, which is so far dominated by Google, Microsoft and Yahoo
(Nasdaq: YHOO). 

AAPL has reportedly adopted new policies to restrict third parties from using
its exclusive software. Last month, Apple announced a new policy requiring iPad
and iPhone software developers to use only Apple programming tools, according to
sources. This had also attracted the attention of antitrust regulators.

Up to one hundred AIDS activists are expected at a protest tomorrow, Tuesday,
June 15th at 10:00 AM, hosted by AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF),targeting New
York-based Bristol Myers Squibb Co. (BMS) over the pricing and policies for its
key HIV/AIDS drug, Reyataz, one of the most expensive first-line AIDS treatments
in the US. The protest is scheduled to take place outside the Hyatt Regency
Century Plaza Hotel in Century City just prior to an 11:30 AM presentation by
Lamberto Andreotti to investors-his first as BMS` CEO-at the Goldman Sachs
Global Healthcare Conference 2010. Protestors are expected to take over Avenue
of the Stars, carrying oversized $100 bills symbolizing the BMS` greed, as well
as posters and banners including several featuring the phrase "Shame on BMS"
accompanied by an image of Andreotti stuffing a bill in his pocket while
surrounded by piles of cash. Activists will chant slogans including "Drug
company greed kills" and "How do you spell Greed? BMS!" and will christen the
company with a new name: "BMS=Big Money Scheme." 

As federally-funded, state-run ADAPs try to provide AIDS drugs to an increasing
number of low-income people in need, the steep price of such lifesaving drugs is
becoming a more crucial issue. The Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for Reyataz
(atazanavir) stands at $13,046 per-year. By contrast, other commonly prescribed
first-line AIDS drugs are priced $3,000 to $5,400 less. Moreover, BMS has
increased the price of Reyataz year over year; since it was first approved in
2003, the price of Reyataz has increased by over 25%. AHF officials note that
Reyataz must be taken with at least two other HIV/AIDS drugs as part of an
effective antiretroviral (ARV) treatment regimen. 

Bristol-Myers Squibb is currently one of the only major AIDS drug manufacturers
that has refused to offer additional discounts to ADAPs, despite the current
dire circumstances of the state programs-including twelve states with patient
waiting lists. ViiV Healthcare, Gilead Sciences Inc., Merck and Company, Johnson
&amp; Johnson`s Tibotec Therapeutics and Abbott Labs are among the AIDS drug makers
that have recently offered significant price cuts, freezes, price rebate
adjustments and other concessions on the pricing of their lifesaving AIDS
medications to ADAP. 

"By pricing Reyataz up to two and a half times more than other AIDS drugs-and
refusing to budge while nearly every other major AIDS drug company has offered
additional discounts-, Bristol Myers Squibb is placing greed above people`s
lives," said Michael Weinstein, AIDS Healthcare Foundation President, in a
statement from South Africa. "As incoming CEO, Andreotti should be leading the
way toward ensuring that BMS` lifesaving product is being accessed by people who
need it most. Instead, it appears his company is trying to squeeze every last
dime out of government programs like ADAP, threatening to bankrupt such programs
and placing AIDS patients` lives at risk. We call on BMS, and in particular
incoming CEO Lamberto Andreotti, to do the right thing and immediately lower the
price of Reyataz." 

AHF recently sent postcards to thousands of BMS employees and neighbors in the
Princeton area, where BMS operates a site consisting of 1.67 million square feet
of office space situated on 280 acres. The mailer included an image of Andreotti
standing among piles of cash accompanied by the words "Shame on BMS." In
addition, banner ads are currently running at the Princeton Junction Station
targeting BMS employees and surrounding community with the message: "BMS, Do the
Right Thing!" along with AIDS Healthcare Foundation`s web address,
www.aidshealth.org. An e-letter campaign launched last week has already
generated hundreds ofe-letters from AIDS advocates from all areas of the country
to BMS CEO Andreotti asking him to do the right thing and immediately lower the
price of Reyataz. 

"All of AHF`s efforts, including this protest, are designed to let people know
that BMS is causing great harm to people with HIV/AIDS with its unwarranted
pricing of Reyataz," said Jessie Gruttaudaria, Public Affairs Director for AIDS
Healthcare Foundation. "At $13,000 per patient per year, it is the cost of drugs
like Reyataz that threatens to bankrupt state programs like ADAP, harming the
patients who rely on such programs for the lifesaving medications they need.
ADAP is the lifeblood for thousands of people with AIDS who are uninsured and
cannot afford their medications. This cannot continue. BMS should lower the
price of Reyataz immediately." 

AHF has seen firsthand the impact of high priced AIDS drugs like Reyataz. In
California, for example, since 2000 the number of new ADAP clients has only
increased by 50%, but AIDS drug spending has increased by 165%. New data from a
recent report released by the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS
Directors (NASTAD) yesterday regarding the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP),
supports the need for drug company price cuts. The National ADAP Monitoring
Project Annual Report notes: "Drug spending by ADAPs has increased more than
seven-fold (617%) since 1996, more than twice the rate of client growth over
this same period." This startling statistic demonstrates that a large percentage
of ADAP funding increases are being applied toward rising drug costs, instead of
to increasing the number of patients accessing lifesaving AIDS medication. 

Background on AHF Advocacy on BMS` Drug Pricing

In addition to the postcard, banner ad and e-letter campaigns describe above,
AHF hosted a protest last month in New York City-where BMS is
headquartered-during the Bank of America-Merrill Lynch 2010 Health Care
Conference in advance of an investment presentation delivered by BMS executives
at the conference. 

Previously, AHF reached out directly to BMS asking the company to lower the
price of Reyataz. In a letter to BMS` CEO dated March 30, 2010, AHF President
Michael Weinstein states: "Across the country, states have been forced to make
cuts to ADAP services and enrollment because of high cost AIDS drugs like
Reyataz. States can no longer afford to provide treatment to many of their
current ADAP clients, and as costs increase more people will be put at risk of
losing access to services. Ultimately, this means that the more people who go on
high-priced Reyataz, the fewer who can receive services." 

In addition, AHF officials brought their concerns to the attention of the
California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS)-one of the largest public
pension funds in the nation and a long-term owner of BMS stock, with more than 7
million shares currently worth over $190 million dollars. The investment fund
sent a letter of inquiry to BMS regarding concern about the impact of the price
of Reyataz. 

In the letter, CalSTRS` director of corporate governance states: "&#8230;we would
appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter with BMS as well as the
accommodations that your company makes to the many state programs that provide
this drug to this patient population. AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs) are
a lifeline for low income patients in the State of California and elsewhere in
the country and the ADAP programs necessarily depend on companies like BMS to
support them in their efforts to reach the greatest number of patients in the
HIV/AIDS community." 

Today AHF officials are in Sacramento requesting similar action from the
California Public Employees` Retirement System (CalPERS), provider of retirement
and health benefits to more than 1.6 million public employees, retirees, and
their families and more than 3,000 employers. 

AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), the largest global AIDS organization,
currently provides medical care and services to more than 130,000 individuals in
23 countries worldwide in the US, Africa, Latin America/Caribbean the
Asia/Pacific region and Eastern Europe. www.aidshealth.org

&lt;p&gt; * Burden on defense to show troops were right-plaintiffs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Plaintiffs must show "police" force excessive-defense&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, June 14 (Reuters) - An appeal of a major
case brought by Nigerians against Chevron Corp (CVX.N) hinges
on where the burden of proof lies: with forces that landed on
an occupied oil platform or the occupiers harmed by them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In late 2008, a jury in federal court cleared the company
of liability arising from the clash a decade earlier between
Nigerian state forces and protesters on Chevron's Parabe oil
platform, 9 miles (14 km) off Nigeria's coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theresa Traber, representing the villagers who brought the
case against the U.S. oil company, argued before the U.S. Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday that the federal trial court
erred by putting the burden of proof on the plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawyers for the villagers said Judge Susan Illston set the
bar too high in requiring the plaintiffs to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the Nigerian soldiers acted improperly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The occupation of Parabe, by about 100 local villagers who
were protesting environmental damage and demanding compensation
and jobs, ended in a violent clash in May 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traber said it should be the defense -- including Chevron
since it fed and housed the soldiers -- that should demonstrate
the troops acted reasonably when firing on the protesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Craig Stewart, representing Chevron, argued it was a
"police" action that broke up the three-day occupation, so it
was up to the other side to show "excessive force" was used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The burden rests on plaintiffs in that case," he told the
court in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit, brought by injured protester Larry Bowoto, was
watched closely by multinational companies facing similar
challenges in resource-rich countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case was brought against San Ramon, California-based
Chevron under the Alien Tort Claims Act, a law that dates back
to 1789 and allows foreigners to sue over human rights abuses
committed by or on behalf of U.S. organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A key decision a decade earlier found another California
oil company, Unocal Corp, could be sued in a U.S. court for its
alleged role in human rights abuses in Myanmar. Unocal settled
in 2005, just weeks before agreeing to be bought by Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) faced a similar trial in New
York just over a year ago on charges of human rights violations
and racketeering in Nigeria, but Shell then settled and agreed
to pay $15.5 million to the victims, without admitting or
denying any wrongdoing. [ID:nL91002110]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the five-week case in late 2008 had given the
Bowoto plaintiffs a "full and fair opportunity" to try their
case. "We are confident in the strength of our arguments and
the integrity of the jury's decision," it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is "Bowoto v. Chevron Corp" in the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals, No. 09-15641.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp christening its new motion-sensing game system "Kinect," on Sunday offered a sneak peek of upcoming titles it hopes will help draw a new generation of casual players into the 40 million-strong Xbox game console fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a performance conceptualized by Cirque du Soleil, the company staged enactments of how games would be played. Those included a track and field tournament, a driving simulation in which passengers rock their bodies to toss the car into cartwheels, and a Star Wars game with enhanced control of a Jedi knight - which drew cheers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not announce game publishers for Kinect -- previously dubbed Project Natal -- nor divulge any other details. LucasArts releases Star Wars titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's leading gaming hardware makers, hoping to reignite the slumping $60 billion industry by expanding it beyond hardcore games to more casual players, will unveil at the E3 Exposition in Los Angeles this week a range of futuristic gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is expected to flesh out details of its Kinect system at the annual games convention, which along with Nintendo's 3D-without-glasses platform is expected to generate the most buzz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp will show off its competing Move motion-sensor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft -- which recently lost its mantle as world's largest technology company to Apple Inc -- unveiled Natal at last year's E3. Analysts estimate the three-camera device, which will be in stores by this holiday season, will range from $50 to $200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The set-up -- which allows for completely hands-free games and controlling the console with voice commands -- is designed to appeal to casual players and newcomers who may not be aware of the product, rather than hardcore gamers, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's only so much headway you can make until you bring moms into the equation. There's lots of kids and moms who want to have an interactive experience together," said Mike Delman, vice president of global marketing for Microsoft's interactive entertainment division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rush of new technology comes just as the video game industry, which dwarfs the $10 billion domestic movie box office, needs it. Total U.S. industry sales -- hardware, software and accessories -- are down more than 10 percent to $4.7 billion this year through April, according to retail research firm NPD Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delman estimates that, of the 40 million Xbox gamers around the world, up to 30 million were considered "hardcore," with another 10 million drawn by more mainstream games such as "Madden" football. Microsoft hoped to draw in tens of millions more with Kinect, which relies almost exclusively on body motions and gestures, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other games demonstrated on Sunday were a full-interactive instructional dance video, a virtual pet simulation featuring four furry felines including tiger and lion cubs that players can stroke and train, and a serenity-inducing yoga-taichi exercise game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years after its launch, there are more than 40 million Xbox 360s in homes and 23 million paying subscribers for Xbox Live, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a best-case scenario, Natal could extend the lifespan of the machine another four or five years, potentially boosting the number of installed consoles to 60 million to 70 million, Wedbush Morgan estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically by the fifth year of sales, hardware demand crests, but software sales are fueled by a base of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's ambition -- despite its spotty track record of engaging consumers outside of gaming -- is to make the Xbox the nexus of household entertainment. It already offers Netflix movies and Zune music and videos through its Xbox Live online subscription. There has been talk that it will add Hulu TV shows to the service at E3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Edwin Chan; Editing by Hans Peters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cities of Los Angeles, Long Beach Join Effort to Drive Economic Growth, Create
Jobs

$20 Million in Small Business Loans to be Provided Through Local Community
Development Financial Institutions, including Valley Economic Development Center

Business Education Partners to Include Los Angeles Community College District,
Long Beach Community College District
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) today announced the greater Los Angeles
10,000 Small Businesses initiative. Throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan
area, the program will offer a unique combination of three resources to help
small business grow and create jobs:

* Business and Management Education: Small business owners will have access to a
high quality business education developed in partnership with leading national
business schools. Through the program, they can develop a business growth plan
through a practical business and management education offered by Los Angeles
City College, one of the nine campuses in the Los Angeles Community College
District (LACCD), and The Long Beach Community College District. The education
will be free to accepted business owners selected through a competitive
application process administered by the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City
(ICIC) in partnership with City College and The Long Beach Community College
District. 10,000 Small Businesses is also partnering with LACCD`s Los Angeles
Southwest College to support the needs of small businesses with a particular
focus on minority and low-income business owners in the South Los Angeles
region. Southwest College will build its capacity to enhance its small business
curriculum and associated business support services. 
* Access to Capital: Goldman Sachs will commit $20 million of lending capital,
in addition to philanthropic support to Community Development Financial
Institutions (CDFIs) in Los Angeles County. The investment will increase the
amount of growth capital available to small businesses in underserved
communities and expand the capacity of the CDFIs to deliver enhanced technical
assistance to small businesses. The first CDFI that will be receiving financing
from Goldman Sachs will be the Valley Economic Development Center. Additional
CDFI partners will enter the program in the future. 
* Business Support Services: Business advice, technical assistance, and
networking will be offered to participating small business owners through
partnerships with the community colleges and national and local business
organizations, as well as the people of Goldman Sachs.

"My number one priority is getting the people of Los Angeles back to work, and
the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Business Initiative is the type of program we
need in Los Angeles," Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said. "Not only will this
investment set in motion job creation at the most grassroots level, but it will
have a real impact on the lives of the 70% of Angelenos that are employed by
small businesses by granting them the opportunity to expand their
entrepreneurial enterprise through education, loans, and networking." 

"Los Angeles is home to many very talented small business owners," said Lloyd C.
Blankfein, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs. "Working with local community
development financial institutions and community colleges, we aim to give
selected local businesses the resources they need to grow and create jobs." 

10,000 Small Businesses began operations in New York in 2010 where LaGuardia
Community College is offering education and Seedco Financial Services is
providing access to capital. 

The program will begin in Los Angeles in August, 2010. Interested small
businesses should apply for the education portion directly through the local
community colleges and CDFIs.

Bob Foster, Mayor of Long Beach

"The City of Long Beach is pleased that The Long Beach Community College
District has been selected to host the 10,000 Small Businesses Initiative," said
Mayor Bob Foster. "It is critical that we do everything in our power to support
and encourage small business growth in the region." 

Roberto Barragan, President of Valley Economic Development Center

"VEDC is extremely proud to partner with Goldman Sachs at this time of severe
credit crunch when small businesses still cannot find capital to expand their
businesses and create jobs" said Roberto Barragan, President of the Valley
Economic Development Center (VEDC). "Over the past year, small business owners
have become increasingly disillusioned and, in some cases, given up looking.
Small businesses can now come to VEDC, thanks to Goldman Sachs support, to
secure the financing they need." 

Dr. Jamillah Moore, President of Los Angeles City College

"Los Angeles City College is honored to host one of the first Goldman Sachs
10,000 Small Businesses programs in Los Angeles," said Dr. Jamillah Moore,
President of Los Angeles City College. "Our college is committed to offering
services that will help small businesses participating in the program to build
their network of resources and to increase their knowledge of business
operations." 

Eloy Ortiz Oakley, President of The Long Beach Community College District

"The Long Beach Community College District is thrilled and honored to have been
selected as a partner with the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses
Initiative," said LBCC President Eloy Ortiz Oakley. "Our college is committed to
economic development and we are ready through this new partnership to further
assist our local small businesses." 

Dr. Jack Daniels, President of Los Angeles Southwest College

"We are excited about being a participant in the 10,000 Small Businesses
Initiative. This planning grant will allow us to build a foundation that will
address small business needs in South Los Angeles that will impact their
sustainability while at the same time strengthening our college programs that
will provide on-going support to businesses in South Los Angeles." 

Who Should Apply

The program is designed for owners of small businesses with limited financial
resources, and with few opportunities to otherwise access a business education
designed to enhance small business success. Broad characteristics of business
owners targeted to participate include, but are not limited to: business
revenues between $150,000 and $4 million in 2009; business in operation for at
least two years; at least four employees; operations in economically underserved
areas; and a business model that could scale to create more jobs. 

Similar selection criteria are used by CDFIs to select small businesses for
financing and will vary slightly by loan product and program, but are based on
sound underwriting criteria. 

Program Background

10,000 Small Businesses is a $500 million initiative that will unlock the growth
and job-creation potential of 10,000 small businesses across the United States
through greater access to business education, financial capital, and business
support services. It is based on the broadly held view of leading experts that a
combination of education, capital, and support services best addresses the
barriers to growth for small businesses. It is now operating in New York and Los
Angeles and will continue to expand to communities across the country. 

10,000 Small Businesses is modeled on the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women initiative,
which creates partnerships between academic institutions and non-profit entities

Women is currently operating in 20 countries, where it is helping women
entrepreneurs create jobs and growth in their communities.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released late last week a prototype of its jQuery Globalization Plugin for adding globalization to JavaScript applications, a Microsoft official said in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin works with the jQuery JavaScript library, which is supported in Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ InfoWorld's Paul Krill reported last week that in a recent poll of  developers and others by the Eclipse Foundation, jQuery  was the top-rated framework for rich Internet application development.  ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This plugin includes globalization information for over 350 cultures ranging from Scottish Gaelic, Frisian, Hungarian, Japanese, to Canadian English.nbsp; We will be releasing this plugin to the community as open-source," said Scott Guthrie, corporate vice president in the Microsoft Developer Division, in his blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downloadable from Microsoft's Github repository, the prototype plugin lets developers parse and format numbers, currencies, and dates for different cultures in JavaScript, Guthrie said. The plugin uses language tags defined in the RFC 4646 and 5646 standards to identify cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The download includes a folder called "globinfo," which contains information for each of the 350 cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persons commenting on Guthrie's blog were mostly positive about the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will definitely save me some time on our next project. Globalization/Localization is a major point in our ASP.net applications and there was a lack in the availability of appropriate libs on the client-side," said one commenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recently made available internationalized versions of Visual Studio 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, "Microsoft offers globalization for JavaScript apps," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO--(Business Wire)--
PharmaTrust has been invited to participate in the Private Company forum of the
Goldman Sachs 31st Annual Healthcare Conference in Los Angeles, June 14th to
17th. The company will demonstrate its revolutionary Healthcare&#8230;Everywhere
MedCenter which will connect conference `patients` in Los Angeles to PharmaTrust
pharmacists in Toronto. 

The PharmaTrust MedCenter is a remote pharmacy dispensing technology that allows
people to have access to multi-lingual pharmacy services 24-hours a day, seven
days a week. It uses state-of-the-art remote and scanning technologies to
provide patients with a remote, face-to-face consultation with a pharmacist and
to have their prescriptions filled quickly and safely. The MedCenter is the
safest, most comprehensive and first economically viable at scale, healthcare
pharmacy system developed globally to date. 

"Pharmacy`s margins are getting tighter, governments are seeking lower costs and
increased accessibility, and the population is aging with a commensurate demand
on healthcare resources," said Peter Suma, President and COO of PharmaTrust.
"These are global trends that the PharmaTrust MedCenter technology was built to
mitigate by creating a safe, cost effective remote alternative to the
traditional pharmacy." 

Pharmacies, pharmacy-benefit-managers (PBMs), health-maintenance-organizations
(HMOs), and employers and insurance carriers can now consider labor costs as
globally flexible and scalable according to demand. It frees them from being
tied to retail locations and allows them to deliver new service and information
offerings over the platform which was created to lower their operating costs and
allow them to capture more market share. 

The PharmaTrust Network's first product, the PharmaTrust MedCenter is a complete
pharmacist controlled, automated pharmacy dispensing system. It can dispense
over 2,000 different medications whether they be pill-counted, box-picked,
refrigerated or packed in bottles. Remotely pharmacist controlled and audited,
the MedCenter puts 24-hour pharmacies anywhere without the time, distance,
language or costs of traditional pharmacies. Employers deploying MedCenters in
their workplaces can achieve lower costs from the reduced overhead of pharmacy
and lower distribution costs than mail-order delivered drugs while making their
pharmacy benefits more accessible to their employees. Employers no longer need
to pay more for the urgent medications that cannot be contracted through
home-delivery because both urgent and chronic medications can be delivered using
MedCenters and home-delivery. Pharmacy chains and PBMs can deploy MedCenters to
offer new savings, extend their store footprints, increase market share and
deliver more chronic disease management services to patients whenever and
wherever they need it: in the workplace; the clinic; the hospital; or the
shopping mall. 

About PharmaTrustTM Inc.: 

PharmaTrustTM is the developer, manufacturer and operator of the PharmaTrust
line of remote healthcare technologies and services. The PharmaTrust Network and
devices are as innovative as the new business models that they are designed to
enable. Similar to the effect of the ATM's emergence to banking, the PharmaTrust
MedCenter creates a new strategic choice for healthcare industries to deliver
innovative telemedicine and pharmacy services. 

The PharmaTrust MedCenter is a complete pharmacist controlled, automated
pharmacy dispensing system. It can dispense over 2,000 different medications, is
100% remotely pharmacist controlled and audited and can put 24-hour pharmacies
anywhere without the time, distance, language or costs of traditional
pharmacies.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE, India &amp; EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Wipro Technologies, the global IT services business of Wipro Limited (NYSE:WIT),
today announced that its Business Process Outsourcing division has partnered
with Microsoft Corporation to provide global Legal Process Outsourcing (LPO) for
Microsoft`s Intellectual Property (IP) portfolio. 

In July 2008, Wipro began providing U.S. Patent and Trademark filing and
docketing services to Microsoft`s Intellectual Property &amp; Licensing group.
Microsoft previously had used a mix of in house resources, outside law firms and
offshore vendors to perform these IP services. Moving to Wipro, with its
extensive BPO experience, international reach and global delivery capabilities,
ensured not only efficiency but also consistency in the way Microsoft does
business. 

Microsoft facilitated the transition of processes to Wipro by leading domain
training for Wipro`s team. Wipro correspondingly developed the LPO framework,
tools, trainings, controls and metrics required to drive high productivity and
reduced costs for Microsoft. Wipro`s operational rigor, application of tools and
various quality improvement methodologies has led to significant gains in both
quality and efficiency of the transferred processes. These results have led
Microsoft to add international docketing and filing processes to the original
US-only processes at Wipro. 

Over the past two years, Wipro has developed an impressive IP domain expertise
and ability to work on a scale required for Microsoft`s vast IP portfolio. Wipro
and Microsoft continue to jointly develop improved domain expertise, processes
and case management and work allocation tools to further streamline IP
processes. 

"The dedicated Microsoft team at Wipro has become a fundamental component of our
global Patent operations function," said Martin Shively, GM of Patent Operations
at Microsoft. "The Wipro team works closely with our in-house team to manage one
of the world`s largest and most valuable patent portfolios." 

"The success of this partnership is testament to the innovation and dedication
demonstrated by Microsoft's IP team and Wipro's LPO solutions professionals,"
said Saju A. Joseph, General Manager KPO &amp; LPO solutions, Wipro Technologies.
"Wipro will continue to integrate legal expertise with process and technology to
reduce overall legal cost for its clients," he added. 

Today Wipro and Microsoft continue to work together to expand their global
delivery partnership.

&lt;p&gt;JOHANNESBURG--(Business Wire)--
South Africa saw a 34 percent increase in inbound tourism spending during the
first quarter of 2010, and anticipates additional growth opportunities around
the 2010 FIFA World Cup, according to Tourism Outlook: South Africa, an annual
report released today by Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) that analyzes Visa cardholder
spending for the past two years. 

VisaVue&#174; Travel data indicates that South Africa weathered the economic
headwinds which impacted international tourism during 2009 better than most
countries around the world. While many countries saw double-digit drops in
inbound tourism spending, Visa cardholder spending by international visitors to
South Africa decreased only 2.7 percent from $1.84 billion in 2008 to $1.79
billion in 2009. Despite a challenging climate in 2009, 2010 has already shown
reasons for the country`s continued optimism. During the first quarter of 2010,
Visa cardholder spending increased to nearly $566 million, up from $423 million
during the first quarter of 2009. 

The top contributors to South Africa`s inbound tourism spending in 2009 include:
The United Kingdom (26 percent), United States (15 percent), Mozambique (5
percent), Germany (4 percent) and France (4 percent). While travelers from
Western Europe and the U.S. continue to be the strongest contributors to South
African tourism, significant increases in spending by cardholders from emerging
markets is indicative of South Africa`s growing stature as a tourism
destination. Visa data revealed double- and triple-digit growth in spending by
cardholders originating from: Malawi (168 percent), Mozambique (118 percent),
Angola (115 percent), China (28 percent) and Botswana (18 percent). This
significant growth can also be attributed to developments in payments
infrastructure and increased adoption and use of digital currency by consumers
in developing markets. 

2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa

As host of the 2010 FIFA World Cup,TM South Africa is uniquely positioned to
further enhance its visibility globally. The tournament will provide South
Africa with a significant opportunity to showcase its unique assets and culture
to the world and attract visitors and tourism revenues for months and years to
come. This year alone, South Africa expects to welcome more than 370,0001
international visitors for this global competition. The month-long 2010 FIFA
World Cup is expected to add 93 billion rand to the South Africa economy,
translating to a 0.54 percent boost to gross domestic product, a significant
contribution given that the total South Africa GDP growth in 2010 is estimated
at 2.0 to 2.5 percent2. 

"The influx of international tourism surrounding the 2010 FIFA World Cup 
      TM has helped to support continued infrastructure developments and
economic growth within South Africa," says Charles Niehaus, General Manager,
Visa Sub-Saharan Africa. "As a longtime partner to FIFA and the tourism
industry, Visa is committed to delivering a secure, reliable and convenient
payments system to South Africa consumers and merchants, and providing current
spending information that can help businesses and the government to enhance
inbound tourism arrivals and revenues." 

Retail Purchases Top South Africa Inbound Tourism Spending

Consistent with tourism spending trends over the past three years, retail
purchases continued to account for the largest share of tourism spend on Visa
cards in South Africa in 2009, followed by travel-related purchases such as
lodging, airlines and travel agencies. 

During the first quarter of 2010 the largest merchant segments for South Africa
inbound tourism spending, based on transaction volume, were general retail
related purchases, such as clothing and food related transactions. Several
merchant segments showed significant growth over first quarter 2009 levels: Visa
cardholder spending in the restaurant segment increased 48 percent, lodging
purchases increased 41 percent, general retail purchases increased 32 percent,
auto rentals increased 29 percent and airlines saw a 19 percent increase. 

Tourism Outlook: South Africa is based on VisaVue&#174; Travel Data, a strategic tool
for the tourism industry that analyzes Visa cardholder spending patterns
worldwide. Visa`s network of 29 million merchants and 1.8 billion cards provides
an unrivaled perspective into international tourism spending. Visa will be
providing updates on inbound cardholder spending throughout the 2010 FIFA World
Cup 
      TM. For more information, please contact globalmedia@visa.com. 

About Tourism Outlook: South Africa

Visa cardholder spending data cited is based upon VisaVue&#174; Travel data, which
reviews tourism spending on Visa-branded payment cards by international visitors
from key source countries while visiting South Africa during the first quarter
of 2010 (Jan. 1 - March 31, 2010) and calendar years 2009 (Jan. 1 - Dec. 31,
2009) and 2008 (Jan. 1 - Dec. 31, 2008).

&lt;p&gt;Press release

StoneGate IPS provides protection against 
the latest Adobe and Microsoft vulnerabilities

 

Helsinki, Finland, 14 June 2010 - Stonesoft, an innovative provider of integrated
network security and business continuity solutions, has today announced its StoneGate
IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) provides efficient protection against the latest
critical vulnerability that exists in Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Reader and Acrobat as
well as the Microsoft vulnerability. 

 

According to the Adobe security advisory last updated on 10 June 2010 
http://www.adobe.com/support/security/advisories/apsa10-01.html  , 
the recent vulnerability (CVE-2010-1297) could cause a crash and potentially allow an
attacker to take control of the affected system. The user is coaxed to open a PDF
document that contains malicious code. The code attacks the user client via the web
browser and can cause a lot of damage. There are reports that this vulnerability is
being actively exploited in the wild against both Adobe Flash Player, and Adobe Reader
and Acrobat. 

 

Similarly, in the Microsoft vulnerability 
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2219475.mspx  , the user is led to
download a web page, which then uses the Windows help program to break into the client.
Upon successful exploitation, the remote attacker is able to execute arbitrary commands
with the privileges of the user. 

 

StoneGate IPS offers efficient protection against both of the above-mentioned
vulnerabilities. StoneGate IPS is capable of identifying and terminating the attacks
when the web page or PDF document is opened and/or downloaded. The system can also stop
emails that carry the PDF file as an attachment, or, in cases where the strongest
possible protection is required, even prevent the downloading of any Adobe Flash
content. Thus, all Stonesoft customers that use StoneGate IPS to protect their networks
are not affected by these vulnerabilities.

 

"The latest Adobe and Microsoft vulnerabilities are examples of so-called client side
attacks, which are becoming increasingly common. Client side attacks are particularly
harmful as they can penetrate through traditional firewalls, and a huge number of users
are affected by these vulnerabilities. When successfully exploited, these
vulnerabilities allow the attacker to read and modify any files and steal personal
information such as user IDs and passwords. The compromised hosts are also usually
joined into botnets. These vulnerabilities were also disclosed and exploited before
patches became available, so it is extremely difficult to protect hosts from these
attacks without external security devices, such as StoneGate IPS", explains Olli-Pekka
Niemi , Vulnerability Expert and team leader of the Vulnerability Analysis team at
Stonesoft.

 

"Malware is spreading in the Internet regardless of the financial crisis, and
organizations should not save in the wrong places. Cleaning up after damage is always a
lot more expensive than attack prevention. In practice, organizations who do not have an
adequate intrusion prevention system in place, will first pay for cleaning up and then
for the implementation of the system. StoneGate IPS customers have full protection
against dynamic vulnerabilities and can focus on their business", said Klaus Majewski,
Vice President of Marketing at Stonesoft.

&lt;p&gt;-Will Demonstrate eClinical Technology Innovation at 46th DIA Annual Meeting,
June 13-17 -
NEWTOWN, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
BioClinica, Inc., (NASDAQ: BIOC), a global provider of clinical trial management
services, will exhibit at the 46th Drug Information Association (DIA) Annual
Meeting from June 13-17, 2010 in Washington, D.C., where it will showcase the
BioClinica eClinical Technology Suite as well as introduce the BioClinica
Integrated Operations Platform (BIOP). This advancement in clinical support
technology leverages the power, the familiarity, and the ubiquity of Microsoft
Office and SharePoint platforms to deliver a real world window on clinical
operations -- across studies and across clinical technologies. 

This far-reaching development will enable BioClinica to make mission-critical
operational data accessible in Microsoft Office and SharePoint applications that
most customers already use. 

"We are eager to share details about our integration with the Microsoft platform
during the DIA, as we believe it represents the future of clinical information
accessibility," said Mark Weinstein, CEO of BioClinica. "Our customers told us
that they needed a simpler way to centralize and share their operational data
for managing clinical trials. Through our work with Microsoft we are embracing
the SharePoint and Office tools that many customers already have and use. Unlike
other solutions, this platform untethers the clinical data, making the data more
easily accessible and therefore more usable." 

SharePoint is one of the fastest growing server products in Microsoft history,
with more than 100 million licenses sold. The platform delivers increased
workflow efficiencies among life sciences colleagues, partners and customers. At
DIA, BioClinica will feature its full-service eClinical suite, including the
BioClinica Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS). BioClinica CTMS utilizes
SharePoint, creating customer oversight to eClinical workflow and access to data
and reports through the Microsoft Office platform. 

"To keep up with market demands, life sciences companies are under increased
pressure to speed the pace of clinical trials and quickly bring new drugs to
market," said Michael Naimoli, director of life sciences industry solutions,
Microsoft. "With the integration of our Office and SharePoint platforms,
BioClinica customers can liberate their data for a comprehensive, real-time view
into studies and pertinent information, with Office Smart clinical trial
management systems." 

Learn more about BioClinica and their Microsoft integration by visiting the
BioClinica booth (#111) or at the Microsoft booth (#711).

&lt;p&gt; * Project Natal renamed Kinect, aims to draw casual players&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Some games previewed, details scant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, June 13 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
christening its new motion-sensing game system "Kinect", on
Sunday offered a sneak peek of upcoming titles it hopes will
help draw a new generation of casual players into the 40
million-strong Xbox game console fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a performance conceptualized by Cirque du Soleil, the
company staged enactments of how games would be played. Those
included a track and field tournament, a driving simulation in
which passengers rock their bodies to toss the car into
cartwheels, and a Star Wars game with enhanced control of a Jedi
knight - which drew cheers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft did not announce game publishers for Kinect --
previously dubbed Project Natal -- nor divulge any other
details. LucasArts releases Star Wars titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's leading gaming hardware makers, hoping to
reignite the slumping $60 billion industry by expanding it
beyond hardcore games to more casual players, will unveil at the
E3 Exposition in Los Angeles this week a range of futuristic
gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is expected to flesh out details of its Kinect
system at the annual games convention, which along with
Nintendo's 7974.OS 3D-without-glasses platform is expected to
generate the most buzz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sony Corp (6758.T) will show off its competing Move
motion-sensor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft -- which recently lost its mantle as world's
largest technology company to Apple Inc (AAPL.O) -- unveiled
Natal at last year's E3. Analysts estimate the three-camera
device, which will be in stores by this holiday season, will
range from $50 to $200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set-up -- which allows for completely hands-free games
and controlling the console with voice commands -- is designed
to appeal to casual players and newcomers who may not be aware
of the product, rather than hardcore gamers, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's only so much headway you can make until you bring
moms into the equation. There's lots of kids and moms who want
to have an interactive experience together," said Mike Delman,
vice president of global marketing for Microsoft's interactive
entertainment division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rush of new technology comes just as the video game
industry, which dwarfs the $10 billion domestic movie box
office, needs it. Total U.S. industry sales -- hardware,
software and accessories -- are down more than 10 percent to
$4.7 billion this year through April, according to retail
research firm NPD Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Delman estimates that, of the 40 million Xbox gamers around
the world, up to 30 million were considered "hardcore", with
another 10 million drawn by more mainstream games such as
"Madden" football. Microsoft hoped to draw in tens of millions
more with Kinect, which relies almost exclusively on body
motions and gestures, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among other games demonstrated on Sunday were a
full-interactive instructional dance video, a virtual pet
simulation featuring four furry felines including tiger and lion
cubs that players can stroke and train, and a serenity-inducing
yoga-taichi exercise game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Five years after its launch, there are more than 40 million
Xbox 360s in homes and 23 million paying subscribers for Xbox
Live, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a best-case scenario, Natal could extend the lifespan of
the machine another four or five years, potentially boosting the
number of installed consoles to 60 million to 70 million,
Wedbush Morgan estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Typically by the fifth year of sales, hardware demand
crests, but software sales are fueled by a base of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's ambition -- despite its spotty track record of

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will begin selling its "Kinect" motion-sensing game system on November 4, before the crucial holiday season, hoping to lure new and casual players to the Xbox and steal a march on rivals Nintendo Co Ltd and Sony Corp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software vendor, which has ambitions of making its Xbox 360 not just a gaming device but a hub of home video and Web entertainment, will also begin selling a smaller, same-priced version of the console this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft would not say how much Kinect -- which plugs into Xboxes and lets players control games with body and hand gestures -- will sell for, though analysts' estimates range from $50 to $200. Executives said 15 titles, including one from Ubisoft, will be available at the time of launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of this week's E3 convention, Microsoft offered sneak peeks of upcoming titles, including a LucasArts game in which Jedi Knights do battle with light sabers, and a fitness program that lets players compete in sports from bowling to sprinting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's leading gaming hardware makers, hoping to reignite the slumping $60 billion industry, will unveil a plethora of futuristic gadgets at the E3 convention this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rush of technology comes just as the video game industry, which dwarfs the $10 billion domestic movie box office, needs it. U.S. industry sales -- hardware, software and accessories -- are down more than 10 percent to $4.7 billion this year through April, according to research firm NPD Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said on Monday it had struck a deal with Walt Disney Co's ESPN network to broadcast live sporting events into U.S. living rooms through the Xbox 360 games console, bypassing traditional cable providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live games will be broadcast through Microsoft's Xbox Live service, and will be offered at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It already offers Netflix movies and Zune music and videos through its Xbox Live online subscription service. There has been talk that it will announce a deal to add Hulu TV shows to the service at E3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of Kinect may pressure Nintendo, which pioneered motion-sensing gaming through an all-purpose controller with its Wii system. Nintendo is expected to unveil more details on its 3D games system that requires no glasses at E3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This year's E3 gives the gaming industry the first real opportunity to prove that it's not just about making shoot-em-up games for testosterone-fueled boys," Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is because the secret to the gaming industry's future is the realization that game consoles are the most powerful device in the living room," he wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A HIGH BAR?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a surprise announcement, Microsoft also showed off a more compact, higher-capacity Xbox console that will ship to retailers on Monday and be available to consumers this week. With a 250-gigabyte hard drive, the console will carry the same price tag of $299.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electronic Entertainment Design and Research analyst Jesse Divnich said Microsoft set a high bar ahead of announcements from Nintendo and Sony this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This presentation was a great sign of how Microsoft is transforming the Xbox into being a real entertainment platform," he said. "In a sense, they are trying to reinvent the Xbox 360, have it appeal to a broader audience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony is expected to unveil its "Move" platform, which will compete with Kinect and Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft fell 0.64 percent to close at $25.50 on Nasdaq. Disney fell 0.9 percent to $33.93 and Sony slipped 0.7 percent to $28.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Kinect is a three-camera system that plugs into Xbox and allows for hands-free games and controlling the console with voice commands. The platform, if it works well, takes gamers a step beyond Nintendo's Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some may have been disappointed by the lack of blockbuster franchises -- such as Activision Blizzard Inc's "Call of Duty" -- in the initial wave of releases, but executives said that was a conscious decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The last thing I want to do is take a franchise that's strong and shove something in it too quickly," said Phil Spencer, vice president of Microsoft Game Studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to put Kinect in the hands of creators (of Call of Duty and so on) and see what magic they come up with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janco Partners' analyst Mike Hickey said, "The fitness and dance games are both potential killer applications, driving a reasonably strong Kinect attach rate to the existing installed base and early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ESPN deal is huge, and the social networking applications Kinect offers are potentially powerful for driving initial adoption and loyalty," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Franklin Paul and Gabriel Madway; Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Richard Chang, Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

experience, from its televisions to specially designed content

the PlayStation 3, which has a base of some 35 million users,
by March of 2011.

&lt;p&gt;Hackers are now exploiting the zero-day Windows vulnerability that a Google engineer took public last week, Microsoft confirmed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft did not share details of the attack, other researchers filled in the blanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A compromised Web site is serving an exploit of the bug in Windows' Help and Support Center to hijack PCs running Windows XP, said Graham Cluley, a senior technology consultant at antivirus vendor Sophos. Cluley declined to identify the site, saying only that it was dedicated to open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a classic drive-by attack," said Cluley, referring to an attack that infects a PC when its user simply visits a malicious or compromised site. The tactic was one of two that Microsoft said last week were the likely attack avenues. The other: Convincing users to open malicious e-mail messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft, the exploit has since been scrubbed from the hacked Web site, but it expects more to surface. "We do anticipate future exploitation given the public disclosure of full details of the issue," said Jerry Bryant. Microsoft's group manager of response communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability was disclosed last Thursday by Tavis Ormandy, a security engineer who works for Google . Ormandy, who also posted proof-of-concept attack code, defended his decision to reveal the flaw only five days after reporting it to Microsoft -- a move that Microsoft and other researchers questioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Cluley called Ormandy's action "utterly irresponsible," and in a blog post asked, "Tavis Ormandy -- are you pleased with yourself?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five-day stretch between the day Ormandy reported the bug to Microsoft and when he publicly disclosed the flaw stuck in Cluley's craw. "Five days isn't enough time to expect Microsoft to develop a fix, which has to be tested thoroughly to ensure it doesn't cause more problems than it intends to correct," Cluley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a message on Twitter last week, Ormandy said that he released the information because Microsoft would not commit to producing a patch within 60 days. "I'm getting pretty tired of all the '5 days' hate mail. Those five days were spent trying to negotiate a fix within 60 days," Ormandy said on Saturday .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft confirmed that its security team had discussed a patch schedule with Ormandy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were in the early phases of the investigation and communicated [to him] on 6/7 that we would not know what our release schedule would be until the end of the week," said Bryant. "We were surprised by the public release of details on the 9th."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft issued a security advisory on the vulnerability last Thursday that acknowledged the bug and offered up a manual workaround it said would protect users against attack. The next day, it posted a "Fix it" tool that automatically unregisters the HCP protocol handler, a move Microsoft said "would help block known attack vectors before a security update is available."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The in-the-wild attack code is very similar to the proof-of-concept that Ormandy published last week, said Cluley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That didn't surprise another security expert. "Given the amount of detail that was released, it's a 'script kiddie' kind of exploit at this point," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that an exploit based on Ormandy's code was published June 10 for the open-source Metasploit hacking toolkit probably was also a factor, said Storms in an instant message exchange. "No surprise at all there," he said. "There is a large community of people submitting to the Metasploit project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said that the current exploits work against Windows XP machines, but added that Windows Server 2003, the other OS containing the flaw, was safe for the moment. "Windows Server 2003 customers are not currently at risk from the Win Help issue based on the attack samples we have analyzed," the company's security team wrote on Twitter at 1.30 p.m. ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next regularly-scheduled Microsoft security updates are to ship July 13, but the company occasionally departs from its monthly practice with so-called "out-of-band" emergency updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to comment on whether it would now step up its patch process to produce a fix before July 13. "We continue to monitor the threat landscape and will keep customers updated via our blog at and our Twitter handle ," said Bryant in an e-mail to Computerworld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Video Games Face Tough Times

The video game industry continues to see the after effects of the recession, as
revealed by the latest data from market research group NPD. According to the NPD
research data, software game sales were down 8.0% from the beginning of the
year, down more than $200.0 million from the comparable year-ago period. 

Year to date, total revenue from software game sales stands at $2.5 billion.
Nintendo Company Ltd. leads the video game industry with five titles in the top
10, while Electronic Arts (Nasdaq: ERTS) holds the second spot with two titles.
Sony Corporation (NYSE: SNE), Square Enix and Activision Blizzard (Nasdaq: ATVI)
hold the third position with one title each. 

Although the video game industry was in the red in the first half of 2010, new
titles like Red Dead Revolver from Take Two Interactive (Nasdaq: TTWO), Medal of
Honor from Electronic Arts, Alan Wake and Halo: Reach from Microsoft, Call of
Duty from Activision Blizzard and Epic Mickey from Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) are
expected to boost revenue in the second half of 2010. 

The gaming industry is experiencing a major paradigm shift, as console makers
and software publishers are delivering their content directly to the consumers,
bypassing retailers. 

Due to higher development costs for new game titles and considerable lead time
on game development, publishers continue to depend on safe franchises to sell
games. However, the introduction of consoles, such as Sony`s PlayStation 3,
Microsoft`s Xbox 360 and Nintendo`s Wii enabled publishers to release their
content digitally. 

Digital downloads are growing at a rapid pace. Sony said total downloads on the
PlayStation Network increased 60% from 2009 to 2008, while digital-only revenue
rose 155% in 2009 from 2008. 

However, the aggressive use of digital media has intensified competition, as
smaller players are also entering the video game market. It has become easier
and cheaper for smaller companies to market their products with the help of
digital distribution. 

But it is not all that easy for publishers. Industry analysts and executives
believe the transition to digital remains sluggish, as the industry continues to
rely on subsidizing consoles in the hope of selling software to make up the
loss. The analysts believe that by going digital, the retail side of the
business will completely die. 

Additionally, mobile gaming is an upcoming business wherein a complete
transition to digital distribution is possible going forward.

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE: CCE) today provided an update on its 2010 business
outlook in advance of an analyst presentation at the Deutsche Bank Global
Consumer Conference in Paris. 

The company said full year earnings per share will grow in a range of 10 to 12
percent in 2010, on a comparable and currency neutral basis. In addition, at
current rates currency is now expected to have a negative full year impact of
approximately 10 cents on comparable earnings per share. 

"A strong first quarter, coupled with positive second quarter trends, in-line
expectations in North America and a modestly improving outlook in Europe, give
us increased confidence in the full year outlook," Mr. Brock said. "Outstanding
field level execution of key strategies and initiatives is helping counter
persistent economic weakness in our territories." 

Mr. Brock also said that the pending transaction with The Coca-Cola Company
remains on track. "Even as we work to complete this transaction, we remain fully
engaged in delivering strong full year 2010 results," Mr. Brock said.

John F. Brock live via the company`s website, www.cokecce.com, on June 16, at 10
a.m., EDT.

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta--(Business Wire)--
Walton International Group Inc. and Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 (the
"Partnership") announced today the completion of land acquisition as outlined in
the Partnership`s prospectus filed January 28, 2010. 

As outlined in the prospectus, the net proceeds of the Partnership`s
recently-completed initial public offering and private placement were used to
purchase and will be used to manage parcels of land comprised of 155 acres of
land located near Toronto in Alliston, Ontario, and 300 acres of land located in
the southwest quadrant of the City of Ottawa. The Partnership`s investment
objective is to maximize returns to limited partners through the acquisition,

projects, providing returns to investors from the profit made on the sale of the
lands. In business for 30 years, the Walton Group currently manages
approximately $2.5 billion of real estate assets, comprised of approximately

&lt;p&gt; * Offshore spills so far involve small amounts of oil&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Government concerned at frequency of spills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Camillus Eboh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABUJA, June 15 (Reuters) - Nigeria cautioned Exxon Mobil on
Tuesday about oil spills off the Niger Delta, saying while the output
lost was minor it was worried by their frequency and the damage they
could do to fragile coastal communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Africa's biggest energy producer has had just over 2,400 oil
spills involving its foreign oil partners since 2006, according to
the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), most
of them onshore in the Niger Delta's creeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many are caused by militant attacks or saboteurs seeking to tap
into pipelines and siphon off oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Environment Minister John Odey summoned Exxon Mobil (XOM.N)
to a meeting with NOSDRA officials to discuss what the government
said were a series of spills far offshore, where militant attacks and
sabotage are infrequent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are concerned about the operations of Exxon Mobil because
once it is offshore, any spillage could of course affect the
shoreline and it could go far beyond their areas of operation," Odey
told reporters after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon Mobil needs to show more caution in terms of the
management of oil spills," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The disaster seen in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where millions of
gallons of oil have spilled after an offshore rig blast blew out a BP
Plc (BP.L) well, have heightened concerns about the environmental
safety of offshore drilling around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria's NOSDRA said the last spill, on May 1, had occurred at
an Exxon platform some 20-25 miles (32-40 km) offshore which feeds
the Qua Iboe oil export terminal. Previous spills had occurred last
December and in February, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil declared force majeure last month on Qua Iboe oil
shipments due to what it said was damage to a pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. energy firm acknowledged there had been a spill on May 1
but disputed some of the claims made against it in a presentation
during the Abuja meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Yes we had a spill ... but some of the things said and shown are
not correct. Perhaps there is a communication gap and we will work
towards bridging this gap," Aniefiok Etuk, Exxon Mobil's general
manager for safety, health and environment in Nigeria, told
reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria has struggled to produce much above two thirds of its
installed production capacity of 3 million barrels per day (bpd),
most of it onshore, because of unrest in the Niger Delta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil spills in the delta's creeks have been left to fester for
decades, polluting the air, soil, and water of impoverished
communities. [ID:nLDE65E0YZ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria sees its future output growth largely in offshore fields
and does not want spills there to compound its environmental woes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOSDRA's director of oil spill detection, Idris Musa, said the
offshore spills so far had involved relatively small amounts of
production but that it was starting to become a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Some of the spills are not large but the frequency is becoming a
source of concern and worry to the agency," he said.

BURBANK, Calif. &amp; SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--

released globally in Dolby&#174; Surround 7.1 this June. WDSMP also plans to release
Step Up 3D in both 2D and 3D formats with Dolby Surround 7.1 this August. 

"We are always looking for ways to push the cinematic envelope and bring more
realistic and exciting sensory experiences to our audiences," said Gary Weaver,
Senior Vice President, Administration, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. "By
collaborating with Dolby Laboratories we have raised the bar for moviegoers by
delivering a superior audio format that complements both 2D and 3D digital
cinema. Dolby Surround 7.1 will provide audiences around the globe with the most
immersing audio entertainment experience available."

Latin America, New Zealand, North America, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United
Kingdom. 

"This year Dolby cinema celebrates 40 years of helping filmmakers realize their
artistic vision through continued innovation in audio and visual technologies,"
said Page Haun, Senior Director, Marketing, Cinema Market Segment, Dolby

About Dolby Surround 7.1

The latest innovation from a pioneer in cinema sound, Dolby Surround 7.1
improves the spatial dimension of soundtracks and enhances audio definition. The
result: full-featured audio that better matches the visual impact of movies. 

With the ability for content creators to mix in a discrete 7.1 format, Dolby
Surround 7.1 provides four surround zones to better orchestrate audio channels
in a movie theatre environment. The four surround zones incorporate the
traditional Left Surround and Right Surround with new Back Surround Left and
Back Surround Right zones. The addition of the two Back Surround zones enhances
directionality in panning 360 degrees around the theatre. 

Dolby Surround 7.1 format comprises eight channels of audio and has the
following channel layout: Left, Center, Right, Low-Frequency Effects (LFE), Left
Surround, Right Surround, Back Surround Left (new), and Back Surround Right
(new).

Some new initiatives will involve middleware software used to support mobile users, but the crux of the event will be about collaboration and "using mobile devices to manage your business," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several analysts said they welcomed IBM's input, given some concerns about IBM's direction in the mobile space, especially when compared with the company's historic role in many prominent software products, such as Websphere for application integration that first appeared in 1998, and Lotus software products including Notes for e-mail that started with desktop computers in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, with the emergence of multiple smartphone operating systems such as the iPhone OS and Android, and their tens of thousands of smartphone apps, the timing would seem right for IBM to play a bigger role than it has, several analysts told Computerworld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM, except for its professional services side, has lost its way in mobile," said Jack Gold, an analyst at J. Gold Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the implementations of WebSphere inside enterprises has been costly, and a partnership with Research in Motion to extend Notes e-mail and instant messaging to BlackBerry users through Lotus Notes Traveler and Sametime, had only achieved limited success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM does not have a strong presence in mobility on a standardized product basis and must modernize to support multiple [mobile] platforms to gain share," Gold said. "It has to be seen as offering a compelling solution to the market at a reasonable cost, but has a lot of work to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ken Dulaney, an analyst at Gartner, said that given IBM's pivotal role in creating landmark software for decades, it "should be doing much better than they are in mobility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said IBM has been late with mobile products and has made promises it hasn't kept, but he didn't elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither of the analysts have been briefed so far about IBM's expected announcement, but said it could involve Websphere application integration for mobile devices or extension of Lotus Quickr, Lotus Sametime or Lotus Connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold said that one highly speculative guess is that IBM could be entering the business of outsourcing the hosting of mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl Howe, an analyst at Yankee Group, said that he expects IBM to announce more tools and apps for the IBM Lotus series, along with more mobile development tools for its Eclipse software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howe was more generous in judging IBM, noting the company doesn't make smartphones or provide an OS for them. "Their mobility strategy is entirely about software and services for mobility, which is higher up the value stack" than an OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Apple , Google and RIM are in the mobile horse race, then IBM is running the stables that keeps the horse fed and watered. They get paid no matter which horse wins," Howe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some extent, IBM competes with Hewlett-Packard in the mobile software space, as well as Sybase, which SAP is in the process of acquiring . But IBM's Lotus products offer direct functions that users deploy, something more than tools used by IT for managing mobile devices, or building and managing mobile applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM makes basic meat and potatoes software and it's not glitzy like iPhone apps and mobile moviemaking," Howe said. "But IBM has a multi-billion dollar business in meat and potatoes software. It's not glamorous, but it does pay the bills."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM appears to be prepared to address mobile computing more directly, but noted it already has a central role with more than 1 billion phone subscribers using IBM software daily, and that 80% of smartphone software was developed with IBM technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many analysts have noted, IBM recognizes that more users will reach the Internet via mobile devices than desktop computers within five years, although some industry observers say they believe that mark will be reached in only two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM spokeswoman said Wednesday's announcement follows the company's efforts in mobile software for many years and would "reassure any attendees of IBM's continuing interest in the mobile software space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Hamblen covers mobile and wireless, smartphones and other handhelds, and wireless networking for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;Gresham Storage Solutions, the Owner of Enterprise DistribuTape, Adds Extensive
Reporting Capabilities with Servergraph from Rocket
AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Gresham Storage Solutions (www.greshamstorage.com) and Rocket Software
(www.rocketsoftware.com) today announced a strategic relationship that will
allow managers of enterprise tape storage systems using IBM`s Tivoli Storage
Manager (TSM) to improve resource allocation and cost efficiency across their
data storage infrastructure through enhanced tape library reporting leveraging
Rocket`s Servergraph products. 

Christopher Young, Executive Vice President of Gresham, says: "The partnership
between Gresham and Rocket will benefit EDT and Servergraph customers alike. We
are committed to making ongoing enhancements to our product lines providing
richer and more meaningful information about the tape environment to our
customers. The costs of managing an extensive tape library can easily run
hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. Partnering with Rocket means we now
offer the business intelligence needed to proactively allocate resources on a
predictable basis as opposed to reacting to shortages and paying top dollar for
new media such as tapes or drives. By simplifying TSM management with enhanced
reporting, we help make TSM easier to maintain and use, and, critically, to
avoid overspend." 

Don Becker, Business Area Executive for Servergraph, says, "With the combination
of the information provided by Servergraph and Gresham`s EDT, the critical
information backup administrators require to successfully manage their
environment just got significantly richer. Administrators need key pieces of
information to proactively manage their environments, and now they have it." 

Young also sees other benefits from a relationship with Rocket Software. "Our
Enterprise DistribuTape software is the industry standard for enhancing tape
library management in TSM environments among Global 2000 companies. The
introduction of support for SCSI libraries in our Gresham Enterprise Media
Manager (GEMM) product later this year significantly enhances our solution. Our
products excel at streamlining, optimizing and simplifying tape management, and
they deliver high performance through features like HBA load balancing.
Reporting, though, has been a weakness of our products in the past. Partnering
with Rocket Software gives us the tools we need to deliver a complete management
experience."

&lt;p&gt;California Company Facing Renewed Charges of Human Rights Abuses on Eve of
Hearing
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
BP`s executives will be joined by Chevron CEO John Watson as oil men on the
Congressional hot seat today. 

Chevron`s Watson will testify today before the House Subcommittee on Energy and
the Environment as he faces withering criticism for the mishandling of an oil
disaster in Ecuador`s Amazon that is considered far larger and more devastating
than the tragic BP spill in the Gulf. Watson`s predecessor, David O`Reilly,
reportedly was ousted for his mishandling of the Ecuador liability, which
threatens to eat up 20% of Chevron`s market value. 

Watson also has suffered recently from his ham-fisted handling of a shareholder
revolt over his company`s environmental practices, has been criticized for
snubbing his nose at Interior Department officials investigating Chevron`s
corruption over Alaska oil and gas royalties, and recently had five prominent
company critics arrested at the annual meeting when challenged about Chevron`s
poor human rights record. 

"Watson has shown a shockingly cavalier attitude toward human safety and
environmental problems around the world," said Maria Ramos, who monitors the
company for the Rainforest Action Network (RAN). 

RAN campaigners say they plan to confront Watson at the hearing today over
Chevron`s various problems, including:

* Ecuador: Chevron is accused by indigenous groups of deliberately dumping more
than 345 million gallons of pure crude into the rainforest when it operated a
large oil concession from 1964 to 1990. The resulting disaster has devastated
indigenous groups and is far larger than the BP spill in the Gulf, according to
experts. 
* Congressional criticism over Ecuador: Rep. James P. McGovern, the
vice-chairman of the House Rules Committee, visited Ecuador in 2009 and blasted
the company in a letter to President Obama. McGovern wrote: "As an American
citizen, the degradation and contamination left behind by [Chevron] in a poor
part of the world made me angry and ashamed&#8230; I also saw the infrastructure
Texaco/Chevron created that allowed the wholesale dumping of formation water and
other highly toxic materials directly into the Amazon and its waters." 
* Nigeria killings: A federal appeals court heard arguments yesterday that
Chevron should stand trial yet again in U.S. federal court in San Francisco on
charges it violated international law by conspiring with the Nigerian army to
assault local villagers protesting its environmental practices. 2 Nigerians were
killed in the action in 1998. 
* Shareholders: Watson faced a veritable shareholder revolt over Ecuador at the
company`s annual meeting last month. More than 25% of all shareholder votes cast
defied Watson over Ecuador, representing an estimated $38 billion in shareholder
value. Five shareholders who tried to challenge him on Ecuador and other human
rights problems were arrested. Author Antonia Juhasz was carried out of the
meeting by four police officers and held in jail for 24 hours. 
* Corruption found by Interior Department: Chevron remains the only oil major to
refuse to cooperate with an Interior Department probe of several energy
companies over corruption related to oil and gas royalties in Alaska. A report
by the Interior Department Inspector General in 2007 found Chevron employees
traded sex and drugs for favors from government employees.

Watson has faced fierce criticism by shareholders for a personal conflict of
interest related to a failure to do adequate due diligence over Chevron`s
purchase of Texaco in 2001 for $31 billion, given that the Texaco merger has
produced a potential $27 billion clean-up liability for Chevron in Ecuador.
Watson oversaw the integration of the two companies at a time the lawsuit was
pending in U.S. federal court. 

"BP`s actions on the Gulf Coast are abhorrent, but we should not fool ourselves
into thinking that BP is alone in creating a large environmental disaster," said
Ramos. "In Ecuador, Chevron and Texaco have closed their eyes for almost 50
years as thousands of people have had their lives devastated." 

Chevron has admitted to dumping more than 18.5 billion gallons of toxic waste
directly into the Ecuador rainforest, abandoning more than 900 unlined toxic
waste pits, and leaving a legacy of poisoned air and water that has led to an
outbreak of cancer and the decimation of indigenous groups. The company claims
it was given a "release" by Ecuador`s government after a limited remediation,
which locals have claimed was fraudulent. 

Recently, a Chevron contractor bragged that he participated in a wide-ranging
fraud by Chevron in the Ecuador lawsuit to pay bribes, fake court-ordered soil
samples and doctor evidence to cover up the company`s culpability, according to
sworn testimony from a key witness.

&lt;p&gt;StoragePoint 3.0 dramatically decreases SharePoint storage costs
WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Metalogix Software, the leading provider of solutions for Microsoft SharePoint
content storage management, archiving and migration tools today announced the
release of StoragePoint 3.0. StoragePoint 3.0`s revolutionary SharePoint-based
software actively manages the entire storage lifecycle of content while
dramatically decreasing storage costs. 

StoragePoint enables organizations to seamlessly move content to lower-cost
tiers (i.e. levels) of storage as it ages, becomes less relevant or inactive
based on simple-to-configure rules. Customers can utilize multiple tiers
consisting of virtually any mix of NAS, SAN and or Cloud storage platforms,
leveraging the most appropriate storage based on their particular performance,
compliance or budgetary requirements. Completely installed and configured within
SharePoint Central Administration, StoragePoint also optimizes SharePoint
manageability, scalability, and security without sacrificing functionality,
performance or the end-user experience. 

"The core, or guiding, principal of 3.0 was to dramatically improve SharePoint
Storage Economics," said Rob D`Oria, Metalogix Development CTO. "We see
customers hesitating to migrate content from expensive, yet underutilized,
legacy ECM platforms into SharePoint because they are concerned about the cost
of storing that content in often-expensive, primary tier-1 storage. StoragePoint
3.0 removes that barrier and gives SharePoint Admins, SQL DBAs, and Storage
Architects unmatched flexibility and control over when, where, why, and how
SharePoint content is stored and managed throughout its lifecycle." 

D`Oria continues, "Combining StoragePoint 3.0 with our industry-leading suite of
migration tools provides a customer with what they need to consolidate a wide
array of content sources into SharePoint, where it will be managed efficiently
and cost-effectively throughout its lifecycle. It sounds good in theory but
works even better in reality." 

Christine Taylor, anAnalyst from the Taneja Group (www.tanejagroup.com)
comments; "StoragePoint makes the storage ROI of SharePoint extremely
compelling. It sets an entirely new standard for SharePoint storage management,
enabling clients to cost-effectively manage large volumes of content by
leveraging a variety of storage platforms." 

Winner of Microsoft`s SharePoint 2010 Innovation Award, StoragePoint software is
100% .NET and leverages only published Microsoft APIs (Application Program
Interfaces). StoragePoint 3.0 is available now and clients may request a trial
version at: www.storagepoint.com.

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing Company Chooses FalconStor`s Data Protection Solution Over 11
Other Vendors to Increase Efficiency While Decreasing Cost and Server Deployment
Time to Less Than an Hour
MELVILLE, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
FalconStor Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: FALC), the provider of TOTALLY Open data
protection solutions, today announced that Austin Powder is using
FalconStor&#174;Network Storage Server (NSS) to virtualize primary storage in its
Microsoft Hyper-V virtual server environment. FalconStor NSS helps Austin Powder
improve storage efficiency and reduce costs with storage virtualization and
application-aware data protection capabilities, including real-time, synchronous
mirroring and volume snapshots. 

Austin Powder manufactures industrial explosives and accessories and provides
blasting services to customers worldwide. The company`s goal was to create a
highly efficient, virtualized pool of storage for its virtual servers, improve
its data backup and disaster recovery (DR) processes and lay the foundation for
a remote DR site in the near future. In addition, the open architecture of
FalconStor NSS allowed Austin Powder to purchase the best storage arrays
available at the lowest cost. With the help of Chi Corporation, a FalconStor
channel partner, FalconStor NSS, in concert with Symantec Backup Exec, now
provides backup for Austin Powder and data recovery for all business-critical
applications, including Sybase and Microsoft SQL Server databases and e-mail. 

"FalconStor NSS significantly improved our data backup process and now allows us
to recover an entire machine with applications up and running often within just
minutes of beginning the process," said Chris Benco, network administrator of
Austin Powder. "In addition, FalconStor NSS has reduced our server deployment
time to less than an hour, and also increased virtual server performance - we
have created a true testing environment that allows us to clone virtual servers
in minutes." 

Austin Powder considered solutions from 11 other vendors, including Dell
EqualLogic, and ultimately chose FalconStor NSS because of the flexibility,
customization and control it provides. Austin Powder uses two FalconStor NSS
appliances for its primary storage area network (SAN) where Austin Powder stores
three terabytes of data from its 60 remote sites and three data centers. The
company has plans to deploy the WAN-optimized remote replication capability of
FalconStor NSS when the new DR site is established. 

"FalconStor is dedicated to helping customers realize the full benefit of server
virtualization with virtual storage that enables flexible server deployment and
the latest in disk-based data protection and recovery processes," said Wendy
Petty, vice president of North American sales at FalconStor Software. "With
FalconStor NSS, new disk resources for virtual machines can be created on the
fly and entire DR sites can be built on virtual server technology, significantly
reducing the cost of disaster recovery." 

Please visit the FalconStor library to review the full case study.

the US. The protest is scheduled to take place outside the Hyatt Regency Century
Plaza Hotel in Century City just prior to an 11:30 AM presentation by Lamberto
Andreotti to investors-his first as BMS` CEO-at the Goldman Sachs Global
Healthcare Conference 2010. Protestors are expected to take over Avenue of the
Stars, carrying oversized $100 bills symbolizing the BMS` greed, as well as
posters and banners including several featuring the phrase "Shame on BMS"
accompanied by an image of Andreotti stuffing a bill in his pocket while
surrounded by piles of cash. Activists will chant slogans including "Drug
company greed kills" and "How do you spell Greed? BMS!" and will christen the
company with a new name: "BMS=Big Money Scheme." 

As federally-funded, state-run ADAPs try to provide AIDS drugs to an increasing
number of low-income people in need, the steep price of such lifesaving drugs is
becoming a more crucial issue. The Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for Reyataz
(atazanavir) stands at $13,046 per-year. By contrast, other commonly prescribed
first-line AIDS drugs are priced $3,000 to $5,400 less. Moreover, BMS has
increased the price of Reyataz year over year; since it was first approved in
2003, the price of Reyataz has increased by over 25%. AHF officials note that
Reyataz must be taken with at least two other HIV/AIDS drugs as part of an
effective antiretroviral (ARV) treatment regimen. 

Bristol-Myers Squibb is currently one of the only major AIDS drug manufacturers
that has refused to offer additional discounts to ADAPs, despite the current
dire circumstances of the state programs-including twelve states with patient
waiting lists. ViiV Healthcare, Gilead Sciences Inc., Merck and Company, Johnson
&amp; Johnson`s Tibotec Therapeutics and Abbott Labs are among the AIDS drug makers
that have recently offered significant price cuts, freezes, price rebate
adjustments and other concessions on the pricing of their lifesaving AIDS
medications to ADAP. 

"By pricing Reyataz up to two and a half times more than other AIDS drugs-and
refusing to budge while nearly every other major AIDS drug company has offered
additional discounts-, Bristol Myers Squibb is placing greed above people`s
lives," said Michael Weinstein, AIDS Healthcare Foundation President, in a
statement from South Africa. "As incoming CEO, Andreotti should be leading the
way toward ensuring that BMS` lifesaving product is being accessed by people who
need it most. Instead, it appears his company is trying to squeeze every last
dime out of government programs like ADAP, threatening to bankrupt such programs
and placing AIDS patients` lives at risk. We call on BMS, and in particular
incoming CEO Lamberto Andreotti, to do the right thing and immediately lower the
price of Reyataz." 

AHF recently sent postcards to thousands of BMS employees and neighbors in the
Princeton area, where BMS operates a site consisting of 1.67 million square feet
of office space situated on 280 acres. The mailer included an image of Andreotti
standing among piles of cash accompanied by the words "Shame on BMS." In
addition, banner ads are currently running at the Princeton Junction Station
targeting BMS employees and surrounding community with the message: "BMS, Do the
Right Thing!" along with AIDS Healthcare Foundation`s web address,
www.aidshealth.org. An e-letter campaign launched last week has already
generated hundreds ofe-letters from AIDS advocates from all areas of the country
to BMS CEO Andreotti asking him to do the right thing and immediately lower the
price of Reyataz. 

"All of AHF`s efforts, including this protest, are designed to let people know
that BMS is causing great harm to people with HIV/AIDS with its unwarranted
pricing of Reyataz," said Jessie Gruttaudaria, Public Affairs Director for AIDS
Healthcare Foundation. "At $13,000 per patient per year, it is the cost of drugs
like Reyataz that threatens to bankrupt state programs like ADAP, harming the
patients who rely on such programs for the lifesaving medications they need.
ADAP is the lifeblood for thousands of people with AIDS who are uninsured and
cannot afford their medications. This cannot continue. BMS should lower the
price of Reyataz immediately." 

AHF has seen firsthand the impact of high priced AIDS drugs like Reyataz. In
California, for example, since 2000 the number of new ADAP clients has only
increased by 50%, but AIDS drug spending has increased by 165%. New data from a
recent report released by the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS
Directors (NASTAD) regarding the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), supports
the need for drug company price cuts. The National ADAP Monitoring Project
Annual Report notes: "Drug spending by ADAPs has increased more than seven-fold
(617%) since 1996, more than twice the rate of client growth over this same
period." This startling statistic demonstrates that a large percentage of ADAP
funding increases are being applied toward rising drug costs, instead of to
increasing the number of patients accessing lifesaving AIDS medication. 

Background on AHF Advocacy on BMS` Drug Pricing

In addition to the postcard, banner ad and e-letter campaigns describe above,
AHF hosted a protest last month in New York City-where BMS is
headquartered-during the Bank of America-Merrill Lynch 2010 Health Care
Conference in advance of an investment presentation delivered by BMS executives
at the conference. 

Previously, AHF reached out directly to BMS asking the company to lower the
price of Reyataz. In a letter to BMS` CEO dated March 30, 2010, AHF President
Michael Weinstein states: "Across the country, states have been forced to make
cuts to ADAP services and enrollment because of high cost AIDS drugs like
Reyataz. States can no longer afford to provide treatment to many of their
current ADAP clients, and as costs increase more people will be put at risk of
losing access to services. Ultimately, this means that the more people who go on
high-priced Reyataz, the fewer who can receive services." 

In addition, AHF officials brought their concerns to the attention of the
California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS)-one of the largest public
pension funds in the nation and a long-term owner of BMS stock, with more than 7
million shares currently worth over $190 million dollars. The investment fund
sent a letter of inquiry to BMS regarding concern about the impact of the price
of Reyataz. 

In the letter, CalSTRS` director of corporate governance states: "&#8230;we would
appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter with BMS as well as the
accommodations that your company makes to the many state programs that provide
this drug to this patient population. AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs) are
a lifeline for low income patients in the State of California and elsewhere in
the country and the ADAP programs necessarily depend on companies like BMS to
support them in their efforts to reach the greatest number of patients in the
HIV/AIDS community." 

AHF officials are in Sacramento requesting similar action from the California
Public Employees` Retirement System (CalPERS), provider of retirement and health
benefits to more than 1.6 million public employees, retirees, and their families
and more than 3,000 employers. 

AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), the largest global AIDS organization,
currently provides medical care and services to more than 130,000 individuals in
23 countries worldwide in the US, Africa, Latin America/Caribbean the
Asia/Pacific region and Eastern Europe. www.aidshealth.org

&lt;p&gt;ARLINGTON, Va.--(Business Wire)--
The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) heeft vandaag aangekondigd dat haar windbedrijf
een overeenkomst heeft getekend met de Poolse windontwikkelaar Jan Reichert
(Reichert)voor de aankoop van een ontwikkelingspijplijn van 353 MW. Door middel
van deze transactie verkreeg AES Wind Generation een aandeel van 51 procent in
de pijplijn. Het bedrijf zal voor 90 tot 95 procent eigenaar hiervan worden, als
Reichert zekere mijlpalen overbrugd heeft. Verwacht wordt dat voor 158 MW van de
totale pijplijn volgend jaar de bouwprojecten van start zullen gaan. Hiervoor
moet ongeveer $80 miljoen kapitaal van AES aan het eind van 2011 beschikbaar
gekomen zijn. De voltooiing van de hele pijplijn vereist ongeveer $175 miljoen
aan AES-kapitaal tegen het einde van 2014. 

"Het verhogen van onze aanwezigheid op de Poolse windmarkt ligt in &#233;&#233;n lijn met
onze strategie om snel groeiende, vernieuwbare energiemarkten na te streven. Met
775 MW in onze ontwikkelingspijplijn, zijn wij ons sterk aan het maken op &#233;&#233;n
van Europa's meest aantrekkelijke markten voor windgeneratie," zei Paul
Hanrahan, president en Chief Executive Officer van AES. 

De Reichert investering bouwt verder op het recente binnenkomen van AES Wind
Generation op de Poolse windmarkt door middel van haar aankoop van 3E`s 422 MW
ontwikkelingspijplijn, die in april 2010 werd aangekondigd. Met deze nieuwe
investering telt AES Wind Generation een totale ontwikkelingspijplijn van 775 MW
in Polen. Van de globale pijplijnprojecten in ontwikkeling voor ongeveer 6.000
MW die AES Wind Generation in haar bezit heeft, bevindt bijna &#233;&#233;nderde zich in
Europa. 

Polen heeft haar vernieuwbare energiedoelstellingen overeen laten stemmen met
die van de Europese Commissie. Er zijn plannen om 10,4 procent in 2010 te halen
en 15 procent in 2020. Vandaag komt ongeveer 90 procent van de
generatiecapaciteit in Polen uit thermische bronnen. De groeiende windgeneratie
is een belangrijk onderdeel van de pogingen van het land om aan haar
vernieuwbare doelstellingen tegemoet te komen. De huidige Poolse
windcapaciteitbasis is 725 MW., waarbij geprojecteerd wordt om tegen 2020 6.000
MW te bereiken. Volgens de Europese Commissie is Polen een van de snelst
groeiende economie&#235;n van de Europese Unie. 

AES Wind Generation heeft 288 MW aan windcapaciteit in activiteit in heel Europa
en ongeveer 1.700 MW in de hele wereld. Hier komt nog 50 MW extra
windgeneratiecapaciteit van het pijplijnproject in China bij, dat tegen het
einde van 2010 zal worden toegevoegd.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will begin selling its "Kinect" motion-sensing game system on November 4, before the crucial holiday season, hoping to lure new and casual players to the Xbox and steal a march on rivals Nintendo Co Ltd and Sony Corp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software vendor, which has ambitions of making its Xbox 360 not just a gaming device but a hub of home video and Web entertainment, will also begin selling a smaller, same-priced version of the console this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft would not say how much Kinect -- which plugs into Xboxes and lets players control games with body and hand gestures -- will sell for, though analysts' estimates range from $50 to $200. Executives said 15 titles from developers including Electronic Arts Inc and Ubisoft Entertainment SA will be available at the time of launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of this week's Electronic Entertainment Expo convention in Los Angeles, Microsoft offered sneak peaks of upcoming titles, including a LucasArts game in which Jedi Knights do battle with light sabers, and a fitness program that lets players compete in sports from bowling to sprinting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's leading gaming hardware makers, hoping to reignite the slumping $60 billion industry, will unveil a plethora of futuristic gadgets at the E3 convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rush of technology comes just as the video game industry, which dwarfs the $10 billion domestic movie box office, needs it. U.S. industry sales -- hardware, software and accessories -- are down more than 10 percent at $4.7 billion this year through April, according to research firm NPD Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said on Monday it had struck a deal with Walt Disney Co's ESPN network to broadcast live sporting events into U.S. living rooms through the Xbox 360 games console, bypassing traditional cable providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live games will be broadcast through Microsoft's Xbox Live service, and will be offered at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It already offers Netflix movies and Zune music and videos through its Xbox Live online subscription service. There has been talk that it will announce a deal to add Hulu TV shows to the service at E3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of Kinect may pressure Nintendo, which pioneered motion-sensing gaming through an all-purpose controller with its Wii system. Nintendo is expected to unveil more details on its 3D games system that requires no glasses at E3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This year's E3 gives the gaming industry the first real opportunity to prove that it's not just about making shoot-em-up games for testosterone-fueled boys," Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is because the secret to the gaming industry's future is the realization that game consoles are the most powerful device in the living room," he wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A HIGH BAR?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a surprise announcement, Microsoft also showed off a more compact, higher-capacity Xbox console that will ship to retailers on Monday and be available to consumers this week. With a 250-gigabyte hard drive, the console will carry the same price tag of $299.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Microsoft will slash $50 off the price of lower-capacity Xbox models -- the Xbox 360 Arcade and Xbox 360 Elite -- to $149.99 and $249.99, respectively. That makes them more affordable than the roughly $300 PlayStation -- though it comes with more capacity -- and in good shape against the roughly $199 Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electronic Entertainment Design and Research analyst Jesse Divnich said Microsoft set a high bar ahead of announcements from Nintendo and Sony this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This presentation was a great sign of how Microsoft is transforming the Xbox into being a real entertainment platform," he said. "In a sense, they are trying to reinvent the Xbox 360, have it appeal to a broader audience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony is expected to unveil its "Move" platform, which will compete with Kinect and Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft fell 0.64 percent to close at $25.50 on Nasdaq. Disney fell 0.9 percent to $33.93 and Sony slipped 0.7 percent to $28.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Kinect is a three-camera system that plugs into Xbox and allows for hands-free games and controlling the console with voice commands. The platform, if it works well, takes gamers a step beyond Nintendo's Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some may have been disappointed by the lack of blockbuster franchises -- such as Activision Blizzard Inc's "Call of Duty" -- in the initial wave of releases for Kinect, but executives said that was a conscious decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electronic Arts also announced on Monday it was developing a fitness game called Active 2 for Kinect, due for release in November. At a news conference, the company outlined updates to its Medal of Honor, Madden NFL and Need for Speed franchises, with an appearance by football great Joe Montana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The last thing I want to do is take a franchise that's strong and shove something in it too quickly," said Phil Spencer, vice president of Microsoft Game Studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to put Kinect in the hands of creators (of Call of Duty and so on) and see what magic they come up with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janco Partners' analyst Mike Hickey said, "The fitness and dance games are both potential killer applications, driving a reasonably strong Kinect attach rate to the existing installed base and early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ESPN deal is huge, and the social networking applications Kinect offers are potentially powerful for driving initial adoption and loyalty," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Franklin Paul and Gabriel Madway; Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Richard Chang, Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 15 (Reuters) - Nigerian energy company Sunrise has
offered $4.8 billion to buy a stake in Exxon Mobil's (XOM.N)
joint venture in the country, the Financial Times said, citing
people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company is aiming at a 29 percent stake in the venture
-- with estimated reserves of 1.6 billion to 2 billion barrels
and potential for more -- in which Exxon holds a 40 percent
stake and the rest by the Nigerian government, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the government is willing to part with a 19 percent
stake in the venture, Sunrise is said to be attempting to gain
an additional 10 percent from Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon could not immediately be reached for comment by
Reuters, outside regular U.S. business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sunrise has previously acted as representative for CNOOC Ltd
(0883.HK)(CEO.N), China's no. 3 oil and gas producer, one of
several Chinese companies engaged in discussions with Nigeria
about Beijing's search for proven reserves.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will begin selling its "Kinect" motion-sensing game system on November 4, before the crucial holiday season, hoping to lure new and casual players to the Xbox and steal a march on rivals Nintendo Co Ltd and Sony Corp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software vendor, which has ambitions of making its Xbox 360 not just a gaming device but a hub of home video and Web entertainment, will also begin selling a smaller, same-priced version of the console this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft would not say how much Kinect -- which plugs into Xboxes and lets players control games with body and hand gestures -- will sell for, though analysts' estimates range from $50 to $200. Executives said 15 titles, including one from Ubisoft, will be available at the time of launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of this week's E3 convention, Microsoft offered sneak peeks of upcoming titles, including a LucasArts game in which Jedi Knights do battle with light sabers, and a fitness program that lets players compete in sports from bowling to sprinting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's leading gaming hardware makers, hoping to reignite the slumping $60 billion industry, will unveil a plethora of futuristic gadgets at the E3 convention this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rush of technology comes just as the video game industry, which dwarfs the $10 billion domestic movie box office, needs it. U.S. industry sales -- hardware, software and accessories -- are down more than 10 percent to $4.7 billion this year through April, according to research firm NPD Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said on Monday it had struck a deal with Walt Disney Co's ESPN network to broadcast live sporting events into U.S. living rooms through the Xbox 360 games console, bypassing traditional cable providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live games will be broadcast through Microsoft's Xbox Live service, and will be offered at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It already offers Netflix movies and Zune music and videos through its Xbox Live online subscription service. There has been talk that it will announce a deal to add Hulu TV shows to the service at E3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of Kinect may pressure Nintendo, which pioneered motion-sensing gaming through an all-purpose controller with its Wii system. Nintendo is expected to unveil more details on its 3D games system that requires no glasses at E3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This year's E3 gives the gaming industry the first real opportunity to prove that it's not just about making shoot-em-up games for testosterone-fueled boys," Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is because the secret to the gaming industry's future is the realization that game consoles are the most powerful device in the living room," he wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A HIGH BAR?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a surprise announcement, Microsoft also showed off a more compact, higher-capacity Xbox console that will ship to retailers on Monday and be available to consumers this week. With a 250-gigabyte hard drive, the console will carry the same price tag of $299.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electronic Entertainment Design and Research analyst Jesse Divnich said Microsoft set a high bar ahead of announcements from Nintendo and Sony this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This presentation was a great sign of how Microsoft is transforming the Xbox into being a real entertainment platform," he said. "In a sense, they are trying to reinvent the Xbox 360, have it appeal to a broader audience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony is expected to unveil its "Move" platform, which will compete with Kinect and Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft fell 0.64 percent to close at $25.50 on Nasdaq. Disney fell 0.9 percent to $33.93 and Sony slipped 0.7 percent to $28.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Kinect is a three-camera system that plugs into Xbox and allows for hands-free games and controlling the console with voice commands. The platform, if it works well, takes gamers a step beyond Nintendo's Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some may have been disappointed by the lack of blockbuster franchises -- such as Activision Blizzard Inc's "Call of Duty" -- in the initial wave of releases, but executives said that was a conscious decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The last thing I want to do is take a franchise that's strong and shove something in it too quickly," said Phil Spencer, vice president of Microsoft Game Studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to put Kinect in the hands of creators (of Call of Duty and so on) and see what magic they come up with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janco Partners' analyst Mike Hickey said, "The fitness and dance games are both potential killer applications, driving a reasonably strong Kinect attach rate to the existing installed base and early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ESPN deal is huge, and the social networking applications Kinect offers are potentially powerful for driving initial adoption and loyalty," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Franklin Paul and Gabriel Madway; Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Richard Chang, Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toy-Car Customizing Shop Opens Newly Expanded Shop and Celebrates Father`s Day
ANAHEIM, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
RIDEMAKERZ, the first-ever customizing shop for one-of-a-kind radio control
cars, is gearing up to welcome kids and kids-at-heart back to Downtown Disney
District in Anaheim, CA. Today the company unveiled a newly designed and
expanded shop that delivers the ultimate immersive entertainment experience for
toy and automotive enthusiasts alike. 

RIDEMAKERZ debuted in Downtown Disney in Anaheim in October of 2009 with a
limited engagement shop that won recognition by Chain Store Age magazine as
Worldwide Retail Store of the Year in the "Pop-up" Category. The shop has since
been expanded and upgraded to serve as the company`s permanent installation in
Downtown Disney. 

The RIDEMAKERZ experience invites guests into the ultimate car customizing shop
where they can build a one-of-a-kind 1:18 scale car or "RIDE". Between
bodystyles and colors, tires and wheels, lights and sounds, accessories and
decals, RIDEMAKERZ estimates there are more than 649 million possible build
combinations, not including individual decal placement. 

"The RIDEMAKERZ experience is all about having fun an inspiring creativity. We
think this, our newest and most engaging shop, will deliver on that promise,"
says RIDEMAKERZ ZEO (CEO) Larry Andreini. Janet Knox, General Manager, Downtown
Disney agrees, adding "We`re thrilled to welcome RIDEMAKERZ back to Downtown
Disney as this unique and entertaining experience for kids and kids-at-heart is
a perfect fit for our venue." 

In a nod to real-world car culture, RIDEMAKERZ has agreements with several
automotive manufacturers to offer versions of today`s most popular cars in its
line-up. Guests, or "Customizers", can choose from the Ford Mustang and F-250
Super Chief Alternative Fuel Concept Truck, Chevrolet Corvette C6.R and C6RS,
Dodge Ram, Challenger, and Viper, MINI Cooper S, and Scion xB. Retro hot rods,
fire engines, racecars, cab-over tow and dump trucks, and many more favorites
are also available. 

Complete RIDEZ range in price from $10 to $32, depending on body and paint style
chosen. Radio remote control can be added for an additional $25, and custom
accessories range in price from $2 for grill guards, spoilers and hoods scoops
to $15 for themed kits that include a wide range of complementary accessories.
RIDEZ measure approximately 12 inches long and are easy to assemble with
snap-in, snap-on components that do not require glue. 

An intense focus on detail and authenticity has won RIDEMAKERZ praise from
real-world car customizers such as Chip Foose and Fireball Tim Lawrence, both of
whom will make appearances at the new shop on Sunday, June 20th from 10 am - 3
pm to celebrate Father`s Day. 

About RIDEMAKERZ

RIDEMAKERZ` mission is to have great fun making cool RIDEZ - with the ultimate
vision of contributing to the positive development of kids. Inspired by
Build-A-Bear Workshop&#174;, a partner and investor, and the increasingly popular car
customizing movement, RIDEMAKERZ is about the joy and fun of creating something
great, something artistic, and something unique.

&lt;p&gt;To help address the explosion in mobile devices, IBM today announced new software, services and research projects at the opening of new software development lab in Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One research prototype, called Mail Triage, was shown as an iPhone application that helps workers inundated with e-mails to more quickly assess what e-mails need immediate action and those that can be deleted or handled later. Other software announced at the event was devoted to helping wireless network providers manage cell phone towers and the data running through them. A beta of an Android-based Lotus Notes Traveler was also launched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grand opening of the new lab, which has dual sites in Littleton and Westford, Mass., will house 3,400 IBM researchers and developers. IBM wouldn't disclose how many of the 3,400 employees were recent hires, but said the bulk are longtime employees located in other facilities or people who had worked for companies acquired by IBM recently, including Ounce Labs and Guardian Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick attended the opening, calling the work at the new lab the kind of "yeastyness" that can lead to great technology innovations and economic prosperity. IBM employees in Massachusetts alone have been awarded 2,950 patents since 1995, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the work at the new IBM Mass Lab will focus on software for enterprise mobile computing, but some workers will work more generally on collaboration, social networking, cloud computing and analytics. They will also develop software to automate and run electronic medical records, fraud detection and energy management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new lab is one of 70 IBM software labs globally. The building in Littleton occupies renovated space that was used by former information technology companies, including Digital Equipment Corp. and Compaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new software and services announced includes IBM Intelligent Site Operations, available now, which is focused on helping wireless carriers manage data and physical assets at cell tower sites. The software tool will help technicians in central offices diagnose and resolve problems without traveling to a site. Pricing was not announced for any of the products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also announced today it has extended a beta version of Lotus Notes Traveler collaboration software to Android-based smartphones and other Android mobile devices. Traveler had previously been available on BlackBerry, Nokia Symbian and Windows Mobile devices, as well as the Apple iPhone and the iPad .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another new software product is IBM Websphere CEA (Communications Enabled Applications) Mobile Widgets, which can be added to the Websphere application integration platform to allow businesses and consumers to bridge voice and mobile Web communications. IBM didn't provide many details, but said in a statement that the software could speed up business processes, such as insurance claim filings or Web retail sales, by 25% or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one example, a company's customer service agent could use the widget to help a customer on a phone call to navigate over a mobile device to a specific Web page with the needed product or other information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM Mail Triage prototype will be tested by IBM workers in about two weeks, according to an IBM researcher who worked on the project and demonstrated the application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the application is opened, a single screen shows how many e-mails are "triaged" or "untriaged." Those that are untriaged are generally new e-mails that can be assigned to someone else, deferred, or responded to immediately. Those e-mails that are assigned can be moved from e-mail into a company's business application, said Alistair Rennie, general manager of Lotus Software and WebSphere at IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rennie said the Mail Triage application is designed to help fast-working mobile users who need to quickly decide to delete e-mails right away, or respond to an e-mail right away. Those that are deferred can easily be found on a desktop or laptop, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such software research, Rennie said, adds greater depth to a large mobile software portfolio at IBM that includes dozens of products. "I think we've really put together a pretty impressive mobile arsenal," Rennie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Hamblen covers mobile and wireless, smartphones and other handhelds, and wireless networking for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer says Mylan application infringes Sutent patents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Seeks injunction, judgment against Mylan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Says Sutent patents valid until 2020 and 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Berkrot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) has sued
Mylan Inc (MYL.O), accusing the generic drugmaker of infringing
patents on its cancer drug Sutent, according to court papers
filed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Delaware, was
in response to Mylan last month seeking approval with the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration to sell a generic version of
Sutent prior to the expiration of patents Pfizer holds on the
drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sutent, known chemically as sunitinib, is approved to treat
gastrointestinal stromal tumors and advanced kidney cancer. It
has annual sales of about $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, in court papers, argues that Mylan's intent to sell
generic Sutent infringes on three patents held by the world's
biggest drugmaker. The patents Mylan is challenging do not
expire until 2020 and 2021, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer contends that unless Mylan is stopped from
infringing on its Sutent patents that it "will suffer
irreparable injury," the courts papers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once a branded drug faces competition from cheaper generics
it quickly loses upward of 80 percent of sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first company granted permission to sell a generic
version of a branded drug is typically awarded six months of
exclusivity before other generic companies can flood the market
with cheap copies of a branded medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer is seeking a judgment that Mylan has infringed its
patents and by doing so "will contribute to the infringement by
others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drugmaker is also seeking a judgment ordering that the
date of any FDA approval of a generic Sutent be no earlier than
the latest expiration date of the patents in dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is also looking for a preliminary and permanent
injunction halting Mylan from infringing its patents and a
judgment declaring that making or selling a generic Sutent in
the United States prior to patent expiration will constitute
infringement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By filing its lawsuit within 45 days of notification of a
generic application, Pfizer would qualify for an automatic
30-month stay to allow time for resolution of the patent
dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Mylan spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuit.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Nelnet (NYSE: NNI) as the Bull of the Day and
Northern Trust Corporation (Nasdaq: NTRS) the Bear of the Day. In addition,
Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on News Corp. (Nasdaq: NWSA), Time
Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX) and Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Nelnet's (NYSE: NNI) first quarter earnings were well ahead of the Zacks
Consensus Estimate, primarily reflecting a decrease in interest expenses and the
benefits of a diversification of revenue through fee-based businesses. 

In recent years, Nelnet has expanded products and services generated from
businesses that are not dependent upon a new federal program which forbids
private sector companies from making new federal student loans. We believe that
increasing revenues from its fee-based business and servicing of loans for the
Education department coupled with restructuring initiatives should support its
earnings. 

As such, we have an Outperform recommendation on the stock. Our six-month target
price of $24.00 equates to 5.9X our earnings estimate for 2010. With a quarterly
dividend of $0.07 per share, this price target implies an expected total return
of 22.9% over that period. 

Bear of the Day: 

Northern Trust Corporation's (Nasdaq: NTRS) first quarter earnings of $0.64 per
share were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate attributed to lower net interest
income and higher non-interest expenses. Low interest rates, which appear poised
to stay for much of 2010, continue to restrain earnings, impacting net interest
income, securities lending and mutual fund fees. 

Credit quality also continues to remain a concern. The company continues to
suffer from weakness in the broader economic environment. Credit metrics such as
non-accrual loans, nonperforming assets and net charge-offs have increased over
the prior-year levels. 

Our six-month target price of $45.00 per share equates to about 15.3X our
estimate for 2010. Combined with the $1.12 per share annual dividend, this
target price implies an expected negative return of 7.7% over that period. This
is consistent with our Underperform recommendation on the shares.

News Corp Proposes, BSkyB Disposes

News Corp. (Nasdaq: NWSA) on Tuesday declared its intention to acquire a 61%
stake in British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSkyB) for &#163;7.8 billion (US$11.5
billion) or 700 pence per share. The Rupert Murdoch-led News Corp. already owns
a 39% stake in BSkyB. 

However, BSkyB`s management has rejected the offer as too low and stated that
they may support an offer of more than 800 pence per share. Nevertheless, BSkyB
has entered into an agreement with News Corp. to work together to obtain the
required approvals from regulatory authorities in the event of a merger.
Moreover, both companies have decided to discuss on a valuation, which benefits
all shareholders. 

News Corp.`s offer of 700 pence per share represents a premium of 16.7% over
BSkyB`s closing price of 600 pence on Monday. According to News Corp, the offer
also values BSkyB at approximately 11.8X the latter`s EBITDA (earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of &#163;1.1 billion (US$1.7 billion)
for the preceding twelve months ended Mar 31, 2010. News Corp. plans to finance
the deal by utilizing its cash hoard of US$8.1 billion as of Mar 31, 2010 and
borrowed funds. 

News Corp. also disclosed that it made an initial offer of 675 pence per share
to BSkyB last Thursday. The initial offer represented a premium of 17.6% over
BSkyB`s closing price of 574 pence per share on Wednesday. 

British Sky Broadcasting together with its subsidiaries operates the leading pay
television service in the UK and Ireland as well as broadband and telephony
services. The company had approximately 9.8 million customers and 16,000
employees as of Mar 31, 2010. 

News Corp.`s offer for BSkyB is targeted at its strategy of further diversifying
its revenue streams, trimming exposure to cyclical advertising revenues and
bolstering direct consumer subscription revenues. The acquisition, if it
materializes, is expected to significantly boost News Corp.`s reach and will
provide it the necessary scale to compete effectively with other media giants,
such as Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX) and Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS).

Machines (NYSE: IBM) and Cisco Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO).

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Titanium Metals Downgraded

We are downgrading Delaware-based Titanium Metals Corporation (NYSE: TIE) from
Outperform to Neutral. 

Titanium Metals is the world's largest supplier of high quality titanium metal
products. All of the company`s revenues are generated from titanium operations,
mainly in the US and Europe. The company has three sub-segments: Mill Products
(billet, bar, plate, sheet and strip), Melted Products (ingot, electrodes and
slab) and Other Titanium Products. 

In the first quarter of 2010, Titanium Metals` net earnings of 9 cents per share
were significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. We
expect a strong pick-up in titanium demand in the long term, driven by higher
defense spending from the government. The aerospace sector, Titanium`s key
consumer market, has started showing signs of recovery. After a two-year delay,
the Boeing 787 model from Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) completed its first flight
in December 2009, which should drive demand for Titanium`s products. 

Additionally, Titanium Metals` products are finding new areas of growth in
commercial aerospace, defense, energy and several other industries. Titanium is
also being adopted in geothermal energy extraction and oil &amp; natural gas
production. Chemical processing, consumer and sporting goods are some of the
other areas of growth. 

Geographically, the rapid growth of China and other Southeast Asian economies
has brought with it an unprecedented demand for titanium-intensive industrial
equipment. We believe the aggregate demand from emerging markets could grow at a
double-digit rate in the long term. 

However, Titanium Metals` margins remain under pressure due to low capacity
utilization levels and downward price pressures. In 2009, the company`s major
production facilities operated at less than 50% of its installed capacities.
These plants operated at around 88% of capacity in 2006 and 2007 and 81% in
2008. The cyclical nature of the commercial aerospace industry, which represents
a significant portion of Titanium Metals` business, creates uncertainty
regarding its future profitability. 

HP Grabs Phoenix Technologies

Right after making headlines for a lawsuit against New Jersey-based Turbon
International Inc., the largest personal computer (PC) manufacturer
Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ) has hit the headlines again for acquiring
three virtualization software lines from software maker Phoenix Technologies
Ltd. 

The deal is valued at $12.0 million and will give Phoenix the opportunity to
focus on the core systems software market. We believe that, in keeping with the
revival in demand for software and IT products, the demand for virtualization
software will increase in an attempt to improve the productivity of each server.
The software lines that will be acquired by HP include HyperSpace, HyperCore and
Phoenix Flip products. 

HP has always grown through strategic acquisitions. During fiscal 2008, the
company acquired nine companies, the largest of which was Electronic Data
Systems ("EDS") for approximately $13.9 billion. The company`s Technology
Solutions Group ("TSG") segment shifted its outsourcing services operations and
a part of its consulting and integration activities to EDS. We believe the EDS
acquisition will give the services portion of the TSG business a stronger
foothold to compete against its largest rival, International Business Machines
(NYSE: IBM). 

This apart, in November 2009, the company declared that it will be acquiring
networking major 3Com. This $2.7 billion acquisition has put HP in open
competition with networking leader Cisco Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO). It also
strengthened its position in the Chinese market, as 3Com has good exposure to
China, both in terms of manufacturing and sales. 

After overtaking all its competitors in the PC market, the tech major`s
aggressive measures have now enabled it to capture the top slot in the server
business. As per the recent report published by the technology research firm
Gartner, HP generated $3.4 billion in server revenues during the first three
months of the current year, up 16.0% compared with the year-ago period. 

On the other hand, during the same period, the server revenues of IBM dipped
2.1% to $3.05 billion. The performances of the two companies in the last quarter
put HP in the leadership position, with a 31.5% market share, exceeding IBM`s
market share of 28.4%. The virtualization software acquired from Phoenix may
further enhance the potential of HP`s server segment, as the company may
strategically bundle these software with its servers, which may offer better
value to end customers.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Lincoln Raises Funds to Exit TARP

In an attempt to repay its $950 million government bailout fund, Lincoln
National Corp. (NYSE: LNC) announced its intention to raise money through equity
and debt offering. As a result, on Monday, the company publicly offered its
common stock of about 12.3 million at a purchase price of $27.25 per share. The
company expects to raise approximately $335 million from the offer. 

While this equity stock offering is projected to be closed by June 18, 2010,
Lincoln has offered its underwriters a 30-day optional purchase of an additional
15% or 1.8 million shares. 

Taking its Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) repayment a step further,
Lincoln has planned to raise an additional $750 million through a senior note
offering. The company aims to utilize $250 million of these note offering
proceeds, along with holding company cash, to repay the entire TARP amount as
soon as possible. Previously, Lincoln had planned to exit the TARP program by
the end of 2010 or early 2011. 

While J.P. Morgan of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) served as global
coordinator for the equity stock offering, Credit Suisse Group (NYSE: CS),
Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Wells Fargo Securities, a wing of Wells Fargo &amp;
Co. (NYSE: WFC) acted as joint book-running managers. 

Also, Lincoln is vigorously seeking initiatives not only to repay the TARP
amount but also to generate operating efficiencies in order to accelerate its
core business growth. Toward this end, the company intends to utilize the
remaining $500 million from its debt offering to provide financial support its
long-term universal life reserves. 

Moreover, as a result of its strong capital leverage, efficient debt
restructuring and rating upgrades, Lincoln is poised to return the capital to
its shareholders in the near future, thereby retaining investors` confidence.
Further, the complete repayment of TARP money liberates the life and property
insurer from government involvement in its internal affairs and pay
restrictions, even though the Treasury will still hold Lincoln`s warrants
post-repayment.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

CSC Launches CloudLab

Leading information technology (IT) and business process outsourcing (BPO)
company Computer Sciences Corporation (NYSE: CSC) is taking aggressive measures
to enhance its cloud computing services. The company recently introduced
CloudLab, a new development and test service mechanism, operational on the cloud
computing platform. 

This technology is expected to provide on-demand access to the end customer
within a secure networking environment, which is expected to speed up the
workflow process while maximizing productivity, without incurring additional
capital expenses and development costs. 

As per a report published by Market Research Media, the U.S. government has laid
out broad plans for the implementation of cloud computing in the federal
government's infrastructure. The research firm has forecasted that U.S.
Government spending on cloud computing will grow at around a 40% CAGR over the
next six years, whereby the expenditure is expected to surpass $7.0 billion by
2015. As CSC has a large portfolio of government customers, we believe the
CloudLab technology offered by the company will find many takers. 

CSC is one of the oldest players in the cloud computing segment. Apart from the
newly launched CloudLab, CSC offers Trusted cloud service, which needs special
mention. These are services that allow companies to avoid the headaches and
pitfalls of software licensing, installation and upgrades by moving programs to
the cloud. 

In the Trusted Cloud, concerns about up-to-date operating systems or desktop
processing power required for particular software programs disappear. These
broad-range services offered by the company help it cater to customers belonging
to different industries, thereby helping to increase the customer base and lend
stability to the business model. 

Cloud computing is the buzzword among the big information technology players, as
the entire enterprise segment is going through a transformation based on
changing customer demand. So this powerful technology provides a big business
opportunity to established IT players, but requires service providers to adapt
to the change. Small and big companies like Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT),
Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ), Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) and Salesforce.com
(NYSE: CRM) are focused on the segment, although the success of some of the new
smaller players is doubtful, given the stiff competition from the larger
players. 

CSC is constantly growing through acquisitions that enhance its services
portfolio and expand its operations in new markets. It has a steady flow of new
business, especially in the government vertical and is financially sound. On the
other hand, the tough competition that the company faces in the IT and cloud
computing space, is expected to rationalize the growth prospects to some extent.

&lt;p&gt;Anatomy of a Global Brand Packaging Assignment
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
How do you create an engaging packaging experience that resonates with users
across the globe? This was the challenge faced by brand design and interactive
firm, Hornall Anderson, when they partnered with Microsoft, the world`s largest
software developer, to design the global brand packaging for the newly launched
Microsoft Office 2010 cohesive line of products. 

More than a typical packaging request, this project came with an added twist. In
addition to designing product packaging for the software aisle, Hornall Anderson
was also tasked to design the messaging and packaging for a new method of
installation called Office 2010 Product Key Cards (sans disc) which, when
purchased, would be used to activate Office 2010 software sold pre-loaded on PC
computers. 

But before the design phase could begin, the Hornall Anderson team needed to
understand how consumers shop for Office software. In-depth, strategic
foundational research was invested in the project, as they sought to uncover
insights on how to best elevate shopability of the portfolio, and simplify
consumer comprehension across the entire shopping experience - online, in the
software aisle and in the PC aisle. How did consumers engage with the packaging
on-shelf? Would they get the difference between the product key and the
traditional disc installation? How would consumers react to opening the package
and finding no disc inside? 

"No matter where you go, people have the same need for clear information," said
Andrew Wicklund, Creative Director at Hornall Anderson. "However, shopping
environments and packaging expectations can be totally different. People move
fast. So when it comes to packaging, every element needs to have a valuable and
well-defined role." 

Strategic exploration shaped the design opportunity, which was to use fewer
words to communicate more on the package, while inviting product exploration
with simple, relevant messages, providing consumers with elements of discovery
as they handle the package. The team focused their creative lens on a
universally accepted approach for engaging with the box, and the creation of an
experience that wraps from front to back, emphasizing consumer recognition
through familiar visual cues and color-coding leveraged with bundled Suite
products. 

"Hornall Anderson leveraged key insights and developed a perceptive design
concept and execution that helps drive equity toward the Office brand with
greater product differentiation, translating the new Office 2010 positioning
into an intuitive and emotional, branded packaging experience," said Katie
Jordan, Senior Product Manager at Microsoft Corporation. 

The final creative is a healthy balance of brand-building consistency with
flexibility aimed at the needs of the medium and the audience.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - The proposed U.S. financial reforms will hurt Goldman Sachs Group the most, followed by Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America, analysts at Citigroup said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule and the over-the-counter derivatives rules are expected to take the biggest toll on profits of these banks, Citigroup analysts said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule proposes a ban on proprietary trading by bank-owned units and potentially requires divesting private equity and hedge fund businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OTC rules seek to redirect the $615 trillion OTC derivatives market to a centralized clearing house, and even require banks to spin off their swaps-trading units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup analysts said Goldman's profit could be hurt by 23 percent annually from the new rules, while Morgan Stanley's profit could see a hit of 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the timing of EPS hits, however, will take longer than most investors expect, with multi-year transitions, and minimum of 12 months to see the application of rules by regulators," analysts led by Keith Horowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysts said the regulations would impact Bank of America, JPMorgan, Goldman, and Morgan Stanley the most with a 2 percent impact on average for OTC derivatives rules and a 4 percent impact on average for the Volker rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, uncertainty remains on how regulators are going to interpret the rules, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the end it is possible that regulators develop more nuanced views on the topics, dampening the ultimate impact," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, the uncertainty and potential leaking out of rule interpretations over time may prevent complete visibility for some time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bigger banks are pressing the U.S. Congress for exemptions to a part of the proposed Volcker rule under Wall Street reform legislation, which would curtail their ties to private equity and hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial giants such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Credit Suisse and Citigroup have been deeply involved in private equity deals, according to a recent study by professors at Harvard University and INSEAD, an international graduate business school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uncertainty regarding the regulations have been a drag on the banks' stocks, and has in fact created an attractive buying opportunity, Citigroup analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see most upside potential in American Express, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and State Street Corp."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIMITED IMPACT TO STOCKS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the impact on profits have already been factored into the stocks and finality of regulatory reforms should be a modest positive catalyst for the sector, the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express Co, Bank of New York Mellon, BBT Corp Comerica Inc and New York Community Bancorp will be the least impacted by the reforms, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some amendments to the rules will be made, but it is unlikely that all trust preferreds and preferred stock under the bailout program would immediately be excluded from Tier 1 capital, Citigroup analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new bills propose raising capital requirements on firms as they get bigger and riskier. Bank holding companies could no longer count trust-preferred securities and other hybrids as Tier One capital, a key measure of a bank's strength, if the rules are approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anurag Kotoky; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The come-on is enticing: Replace that expensive, high-maintenance Microsoft Exchange platform -- and maybe some of your other Microsoft software -- with Google's Apps Premier service for a low, low price of $50 per user per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google will host your email, calendars, documents, and more in their cloud. You can get at everything through a Web browser using the well-regarded Gmail interface, and you may be able to keep using your own client software, even Outlook. Google promises 99.9 percent uptime, and its support includes telephone access to real people. SSL encryption is required to be on, and Google uses the services of its Postini unit to provide malware protection. Google Apps Premier also supports shared contact lists and more sophisticated contact migration, such as LDAP synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ The InfoWorld Test Center reveals whether Microsoft's Office for Web apps has what it takes. | Discover J. Peter Bruzzese's 8 key tips for moving to Exchange 2010. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds good, but can Google Apps Premier really deliver on what businesses need?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever you're paying for Exchange and other Microsoft servers, I guarantee it's more than what Google Apps Premier costs, but that's not the only issue. A major platform change is disruptive, and you may have come to rely on Exchange features that either have no equivalent in Google Apps or will require some conversion work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the quandary I faced for my own small business and personal domain. Only a few people use it, but we all love Outlook and the power we get from our hosted Exchange server at AppRiver. Although I'm very happy with AppRiver and I'm paying a fair price, I need to save some money -- just like a lot of larger companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I gave it a shot. Here's what I found and what you need to know before you make your decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile support is equivalent Google has a plug-in for BlackBerry Enterprise Server, but it doesn't run BlackBerry Enterprise Server. You'll need to run BES yourself or find a provider that will host it with the plug-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google does offer Microsoft ActiveSync support, which iPhones, Palm Pres, Windows Mobile, and some Android smartphones use to enforce security and access policies. It worked well on my Droid device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to mobile, you won't save any effort with Google Apps, though you get the same capabilities as you would with Exchange -- including the burden of dealing with BES yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migration testing is incomplete, slow I have just two real users on my domain, but I made sure to learn and test at least some of the tools for larger organizations. Google has put together a wide variety of options for migrating your email installation from Exchange (and from Lotus Notes, which I did not test) to Google Apps Premier. If you have more than a handful of users, your main migration tool from Exchange will be Google Apps Migration for Microsoft Exchange (GAMME), which performs bulk migrations of users from the Exchange Server to Google Apps through an intermediary system running the migration app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Administration Guide for GAMME made a great impression on me. Google has the approach to this exactly right. The guide stresses the importance of pilot migrations and phasing in the actual transfer, and provides extensive guidance for this approach. In fact you'd be nuts to try this without a test migration. Even I did one for my puny domain. Fortunately, you can test Google Apps Premier for free for 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tricky part is that you can't change the MX records on your mail domain until you do the real migration. Because the test users won't have their real email domain in their address (otherwise, their email is down while you are testing), testing can be awkward. For example, I had to use the test account larry@larryseltzer.net, but my normal mail comes in to larry@larryseltzer.com. I finessed the mismatch by forwarding larry@larryseltzer.com to larry@larryseltzer.net and using a reply-to on the .net address, but that of course means testing under abnormal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came time to do my actual GAMME migration, parts of it failed, returning errors that Google's support staff wasn't entirely able to explain. On Google's advice, I switched to the command-line version of GAMME to specify particular parameters. It still didn't work quite right, but running it twice migrated all my data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GAMME is a slow process. As the docs recommend, you want to shut off email for a weekend -- maybe a long weekend -- when running it. You could scale the performance and decrease the total downtime by running multiple GAMME systems to port different groups or users, or perhaps in different virtual machines on the same computer, or even different sessions on a Terminal Server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For smaller installations or special cases, GAMMO (Google Apps Migration for Microsoft Outlook) migrates a single Outlook user profile from a client to Google Apps. This tool worked flawlessly for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have a choice of email clients -- which you'll appreciate After the migration is complete, you have some choices for how to handle email: You can work in Gmail or you can work in Outlook, using GASMO (Google Apps Sync for Microsoft Outlook). This tool has a pretty bad reputation, but it works surprisingly well for me. Google also supports IMAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of the users in my installation (that would be my wife) were adamant about keeping Outlook. GASMO is both a local MAPI provider and a tool for creating Outlook profiles for synchronizing the Outlook account with a Google Apps account. There is a slow, one-time process to synchronize the Google Apps mail, contacts, and calendar data with the Outlook equivalents. It took many hours each time I ran it, but the further you get from that initial sync, the faster Outlook feels -- as fast as with Exchange, I'd say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Folders don't work the way you're used to Unlike  most conventional mail clients, Gmail doesn't have hierarchical folders, but instead uses labels. You can work on all messages with a particular label and treat them as if they were in a folder. Labels don't have a hierarchy as such, but a message can have more than one label and thus appear in both label views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To map labels into Outlook's hierarchical folders, GASMO turns folder locations into fake hierarchical labels: A message in the InfoWorld folder will have a label of Inbox\InfoWorld. This makes it possible for a message to appear in more than one folder in Outlook. If you delete one of the messages, all the instances are deleted, which is not what you'd expect if you're Outlook-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The messiness of the hierarchical labels could make it difficult to get used to Gmail after a migration; you start getting a lot of backward slashes in label names to simulate folder hierarchy, rather than the clean names of Exchange folders. If you decide you want to use the Gmail interface instead of GASMO, you may find it worthwhile to restructure your labels to the friendlier, folder-style names it supports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the Google interfaces is not an easy adjustment At first I wanted to use the Gmail interface, figuring I'd make a clean break with Outlook, but using it wasn't so easy. I missed features in Outlook that are weak or absent in Google Apps, such as Outlook's powerful rules. And the fact that GASMO was working so well for my wife led me to give it a shot; I'm still with it. The Gmail interface can be tolerable for short periods of time when I need it, such as on my Droid smartphone, but it is a chore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Calendar is less capable than Exchange I had also heard of problems with using the Google Calendar interface when compared with Exchange's and Outlook's. No question about it, Google Calendar is no match for the Microsoft product, but it has been good enough for me so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Calendar in Google Apps Premier is strong in many areas. It supports resource calendars, such as for conference rooms, but GAMME doesn't migrate them from Exchange. Making multiple calendars and checking them is easy, but Google Calendar lacks many of the complex features for meeting setup, such as optional versus required meeting invites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest Exchange features not supported by Google Apps is Public Folders. As a replacement, you could create a Google Group (basically a Usenet-like newsgroup). They are archived and searchable, but not as well integrated as public folders, especially if you're using Outlook. As an alternative, you can also share any file on Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that Google is creating APIs for all its features, so you can write your own apps. And you may be able to find third-party modules for a missing feature in the Google Apps Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Apps can work differently as time passes Unlike typical Exchange hosting, Google Apps is a dynamic environment. Don't be too surprised if you wake up one morning and some feature operates differently. At one point during my brief test period, the online documentation changed in a way that affected my tests, but it's not clear if the product itself changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are good aspects to this dynamism, but if you treasure stability and being able to test changes before implementing them, Google Apps may be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Apps doesn't play with other Google apps I was surprised to discover that you cannot use your Google Apps login to access Google services not provided in Google Apps, such as Google Reader. The work-around -- to use a regular Google account to access those services -- is not at all satisfying, because you can't log in to more than one Google account at a time in the browser. You realistically have to use one browser for Google Apps and another for other Google services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your compliance needs may or may not be met As with any hosted service, you may be concerned about the fact that you no longer directly manage potentially sensitive data. Google Apps Premier's Terms of Service agreement (section 1.2) essentially says that Google will guard your data with the same measures and vigilance with which it guards its own. I find this reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you or your lawyers may have a problem with the terms' statement: "Google may store and process customer data in the United States or any other country in which Google or its agents maintain facilities." Welcome to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Apps Premier can replace Exchange, but it's no given There's no way around the fact that by migrating from a mature, stable, and well-understood platform like Outlook and Exchange to an evolving newbie like Google Apps, you're a pioneer. You may discover gold in California or ruination in Death Valley based on your combination of needed capabilities, users' adaptability, compliance requirements, and degree of cost savings needed to justify the disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It'll work for me, but I have a really small office. But don't forget if you're tired of managing Exchange yourself, you have the option of hosted Exchange. It will cost more than Google Premier Apps, but it also will maintain familiarity and be less disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, "here"&gt;Can you really replace Microsoft Exchange with Google Apps Premier?," originally appeared at here"&gt;InfoWorld.com.

ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
It sounds like a dream college course description: embark on cultural adventures
against the backdrop of the world`s biggest sporting event. No prerequisites, no
professor, no syllabus, no books and no tests required. But for 21 students from
12 historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), this "dream" is a real
once-in-a-lifetime journey to South Africa later this month. 

The students are winners of the Coca-Cola "Open Happiness Tour," a video contest
that sought creative and inspirational answers to the question: How does the
Coca-Cola RAIN program inspire you? As part of a multifaceted sponsorship
program inspired by the first FIFA World Cup being held in Africa, Coca-Cola is
inviting consumers to join its football-themed, global Coca-Cola RAIN "Water for
Schools" initiative to help provide safe drinking water for schoolchildren in
Africa and around the world. 

"The Open Happiness Tour allows Coca-Cola the opportunity to engage and inspire
young African Americans while connecting them with their roots," said Yolanda
White, assistant vice president, African American Marketing, Coca-Cola North
America. "We hope experiencing the diverse culture and meeting people who will
be in South Africa for World Cup will inspire these students to view the world
differently and make a commitment to creating a better place for everyone to
live." 

The 21 winners will head to South Africa on June 25, where they will spend five
days soaking up the South African culture and learning more about Africa`s water
crisis. During their visit, the students will meet with executives from
Coca-Cola South Africa, who will share what the Company is doing in support of
the RAIN project as well as learn about other initiatives throughout Africa,
including HIV/AIDS and malaria prevention, access to education, job creation and
humanitarian assistance. In addition, the students will see first-hand the
extreme need for potable water when they visit a local orphanage whose water
system is in dire need of repairs. The Company will make a donation to assist
with the repairs of the water system and, once the project is completed, the
orphanage will have clean running water for cooking, bathing and other
necessities. 

The students also will have the opportunity to explore more facets of South
African culture when they take a trip to the Nelson Mandela National Museum, go
on a Safari and attend a FIFA World Cup match. The students will get another
perk during their time in South Africa - meeting with actor Idris Elba, whose
father is from Sierra Leone and mother is from Ghana. Elba will spend time with
the students throughout the trip, discussing water stewardship and its
importance to Africa and his passion for the World Cup, as well as providing his
unique perspective on the local culture. 

"I look forward to sharing my love for Africa with the students," said Elba.
"Through experiencing Africa`s rich history and the wonderful diversity of its
culture, the students will be amazed and enriched. I hope they grow to love
Africa as much as I do." 

"This tour, just like drinking a Coca-Cola, is a refreshing and simple moment of
pleasure that we`re able to give to these students. To be able to have this
once-in-a-lifetime experience during FIFA World Cup is something they will never
forget," said White.

&lt;p&gt;  CHICAGO, IL, Jun 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer met with students at the Chicago Academy of
Advanced Technology (CAAT) on June 10, 2010. Mr. Ballmer affirmed
Microsoft's commitment to support the school, providing software,
hardware, and a cash grant. "Microsoft is grateful for the opportunity to
support the Chicago Academy of Advanced Technology, where innovative
teaching strategies and access to technology are changing today's
approach to education," he said.

    CAAT was founded in 2009, created through the joint efforts of the
Illinois Technology Association (ITA), the outreach organization of the
ITA, the Illinois Technology Foundation (ITF), the City of Chicago,
Chicago Public Schools, and The Center for Polytechnical Education. The
Chicago Public School, run by the Center for Polytechnical Education,
provides underprivileged students with a full high-school curriculum and
the development of technology skills. 

    The program provides students with the necessary skills to compete in the
workforce of the future. Mike Porter, General Manager -- Central Region,
Microsoft, serves on the ITA Board of Directors. "Microsoft is dedicated
to education and ensuring graduates possess the skills needed to compete
in our technologically evolved workplace."

    "We anticipate CAAT students will be the Chicago area's future leaders,"
Mr. Ballmer stated. "By supporting students and programs like these,
Microsoft hopes to expand the pipeline of future technology talent in the
United States."

    "A key part of the approach we're developing at CAAT is the involvement
of mentors into the classroom and curriculum. Having Steve visit as we
close our first freshman year was like bringing an uber mentor into the
school," said Terry Howerton, Chairman of the ITA and co-chairman of the
high school.

    Mr. Ballmer presented the new Surface technology to the students, giving
them a chance to see the latest technology under development. Microsoft

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman: Call is regularly scheduled client event&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Firm is fighting backlash after SEC charges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - The Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) charm offensive continues, this time with President Gary
Cohn taking part on Wednesday in a conference call with the
firm's wealth management customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The call with the firm's wealthiest individual clients
comes as Wall Street's most powerful firm fights a backlash
stemming from its subprime mortgage-linked security business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cohn's call would be the latest in a series of meetings
with privately wealthy clients. On May 5, Goldman Chief
Executive Lloyd Blankfein told those clients that Goldman must
deal with the "doubts" surrounding the firm, according to a
rebroadcast of the call on CNBC. [ID:nN05150075]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokeswoman said the Cohn call is "a client event
and we regularly schedule these types of meetings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman executives have been acutely aware of the concerns
of their clients since the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission charged the firm with civil fraud in connection with
its marketing and packaging of the Abacus collateralized debt
obligation in 2007. A CDO is a bundle of subprime
mortgage-linked securities that are sold to investors in
pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cohn, speaking last week at a regulatory conference in
Montreal, told reporters that there is "no indication" a
settlement with the SEC is near. [ID:nN10240096]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein met with former Goldman partners on Tuesday,
assuring them that clients are still standing behind the firm,

&lt;p&gt;  REDWOOD SHORES, CA, Jun 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 

Company News


--  Zuora, the company that defined and continues to lead the subscription
    billing industry, today announced that it will join the Microsoft
    Windows Azure Technology Adoption Program (TAP) and help in the
    advancement of Microsoft's cloud computing platform. Zuora is the
    first on-demand billing and subscription management provider to be
    chosen by Microsoft from among 300 ISV partners.
--  As part of the Windows Azure TAP program, Zuora is making immediately
    available its Zuora Toolkit for Windows Azure.
--  Zuora Toolkit for Windows Azure helps developers and ISVs meter,
    price, and bill for their Windows Azure platform cloud-based
    applications and services.

    

The New Face of Cloud Commerce -- Metering, Pricing, Billing 


--  As the world quickly moves to cloud computing, developers, ISV
    partners and enterprises need the right tools to build, run, and scale
    their solutions in the cloud and reduce the time-to-market and to
    support the changing subscription economy. Microsoft created the
    Windows Azure TAP to ensure the world's most innovative companies not
    only adopt Windows Azure platform, but also help drive its success.
--  Concurrently, the shift to cloud computing is also driving substantial
    changes to the software market including how ISVs sell and charge for
    access. Customers are demanding software solutions on a subscription
    basis, using on-demand, pay-for-what-you-use models that mirror the
    elastic nature of the cloud itself. This is the new face of cloud
    commerce.
--  Unless vendors of cloud solutions -- IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS -- also have
    the right tools needed to meter, price, and bill for their offerings,
    cloud computing will not achieve its full potential.

    

Introducing the Zuora Toolkit for Windows Azure


--  To drive success and adoption for the Windows Azure ecosystem, Zuora
    has delivered the Zuora Toolkit for Windows Azure in conjuncture with
    Microsoft to enable developers and ISVs to easily automate commerce
    from within their Windows Azure application and/or website in a matter
    of minutes. With the Zuora Toolkit for Windows Azure, Windows Azure
    developers and ISVs can:
    --  create flexible price plans and packages;
    --  support usage and pay-as-you-go pricing models;
    --  initiate a subscription order online;
    --  accept credit cards with PCI Level 1 compliance; and
    --  manage the customers, recurring subscriptions, and invoicing.
--  The Zuora Toolkit for Windows Azure can be accessed at
    http://developer.zuora.com/. Zuora is also providing a Z-Commerce for
    the Cloud code sample for developers to embed in their cloud solutions
    at http://developer.zuora.com/samplecode.html.

    Commentary

--  "Cloud computing is poised to change the way our customers do
    business, and we're working to ensure that Windows Azure will enable
    these companies to quickly develop and deploy cloud-based
    applications," said Michael Maggs, senior director, Windows Azure
    partner strategy at Microsoft. "The importance of Zuora's solution is
    that it helps give developers and ISVs the flexibility to monetize
    their applications based on any pricing variables."
--  "The single most important service for ISVs in the cloud is the
    ability to monetize, and Zuora removes the friction of building a
    payment ecosystem and manages the constant changes that come with
    subscription management," said Shawn Price, president and general
    manager at Zuora. "We are excited to be chosen by Microsoft and to
    offer our expertise in cloud-based billing and commerce so the 10,000
    Azure developers and customers will be able to launch and monetize
    their applications quickly."

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Electronics hardware makers on Tuesday showed off snazzy new devices enabling motion-sensing play and 3D effects, intensifying a battle to introduce video-gaming to a new generation of casual users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of Microsoft Corp's full-body motion-sensing Kinect, Japan's Nintendo Co Ltd on Tuesday took the wraps off a new version of its DS handheld device that can play games and show movies in 3D without glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Sony Corp introduced the "Move" -- which like Nintendo's popular Wii employs a wand-like controller to double as everything from a tennis racket to a baseball bat in games -- and promised up to a score of 3D titles soon for its PlayStation 3 console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launches and demonstrations from the triumvirate of gaming hardware makers at this week's E3 expo in Los Angeles -- the $60 billion industry's most important annual showcase -- set the stage for a pitched battle to bring players beyond the hard-core fanbase into the fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said Microsoft made the biggest splash with a seemingly revolutionary platform that employs no controller, and a clear mandate to target casual players. And Nintendo's move to add a third dimension to its market-leading DS mobile handled device will shore up its market position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The triumvirate that rules the market for gaming devices is stepping up their battle just as the industry is beginning to recover from a two-year slump. Analysts say laggard Sony, the erstwhile consumer electronics leader that has seen Nintendo surge ahead with the well-received Wii, has a potential winner in Move but that the jury was still out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony's Move appeared to mimic a gaming system that Nintendo pioneered with the controller-operated Wii a couple years ago, but Sony argued the precision of its technology -- which captures every twist and contortion of arm actions -- and the ability to employ combinations of buttons will continue to please hard-core players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may well be more versatile than Kinect, but the challenge there is demoing it. Sony does have the biggest challenge ahead of them -- they have the furthest to go," said M2 Research analyst Billy Pidgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's still possible that Sony could knock them off, but they didn't make the case for doing that this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another innovative technology highlighted was cloud gaming -- the hosting and playing of games on servers without the need to buy and store a game from a home device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud service OnLive announced titles including Ubisoft Entertainment SA's Assassin's Creed and Electronic Arts Inc's Mass Effect 2, stored on Dell Inc servers and played -- via ATT connections on computers and eventually TVs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a very ambitious project. We will see how it goes," Take Two Interactive Chairman Strauss Zelnick said. "You are talking about a very complex situation, where even small amounts of latency or incompatibility will create a problem. They feel they have solved these problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PIVOTAL POINT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. industry sales -- hardware, software and accessories -- are down more than 10 percent at $4.7 billion this year through April, according to research firm NPD Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But new technology is expected to drive spending on games. PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimates the overall games market -- excluding hardware -- climbing 6.5 percent annually on average to $20.7 billion in 2014, from $15.1 billion in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The success or failure of these technologies will determine the health and growth of our industry over the next three years," said EEDAR analyst Jesse Divnich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the creator of Super Mario games and the Wii offered a peek at its 3DS. The device comes with two screens -- one a touch screen -- and three built-in cameras, enabling the machine to snap digital photos in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo, which has seen growth in sales of its industry-leading Wii slow as rivals slash prices, did not say when sales begin or give a retail price, except that it will hit store shelves sometime before March 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing competition from Apple Inc's iPhone, smartphones and social networks is also starting to pose a threat to Nintendo's DS portable player, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electronics makers hope that interest in 3D -- sparked in part by blockbuster "Avatar" -- will power a new era of growth for an industry still recovering from the 2008-2009 downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looked good and seems promising. Its keeping Nintendo on their game and their game is really good. They own the handheld market," said M2's Pidgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives are pondering newfangled options for the 3DS, including potentially 3D movies on the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Nintendo and movie studios it can provide a unique business opportunity," President Satoru Iwata said through a translator. "3DS is expecting to sell a lot in a relatively short time period after the launch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3DS comes after Nintendo forecast a second straight year of smaller profits, as sales of Wiis slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It rode strong demand for the Wii and DS to three straight years of record profits through March 2009, but growth slowed last year after Sony and Microsoft cut console prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime countered that more software was sold for the Wii in 43 months on the market than on any platform over the same time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WE'RE NOT ALONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo is not alone in taking the wraps off a hot new gizmo. On Monday, Microsoft said it will begin selling its "Kinect" motion-sensing game system on November 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Tuesday, Sony announced that its Move motion-sensing platform -- which will compete with the Wii and Kinect -- will begin selling on September 15 in Europe, followed a few days later in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony executives said the Move's wand -- which has buttons for in-game functions -- ensures the platform appeals to as wide a range of players as possible, both casual and hardcore users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony is making a huge bet on 3D gaming, as it is on 3D televisions, arguing it is unique in offering an end-to-end experience, from TVs to content via its entertainment division. It will have over 20 3D titles available for the PlayStation 3, which has a base of 35 million users, by March of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaz Hirai, head of Sony Computer Entertainment, said gamers are key to the demand equation for the company's new 3D-enabled TVs, which are being rolled out to consumers this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To a certain extent gaming is really going to drive the 3D TV adoption," he told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Sofina Mirza-Reid and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Jun 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Procter &amp; Gamble has already rocked the pet food industry in May 2010 by
announcing plans to buy Natura Pet Products, a privately held producer of
natural and organic pet food under brands including Innova, Evo,
California Natural, Healthwise, Mother Nature, and Karma. But David
Lummis, senior pet market analyst for Packaged Facts and author of the
all-new market study Natural, Organic and Eco-Friendly Pet Products in
the U.S., 3rd Edition, believes the big news may be yet to break. "Based
on Procter &amp; Gamble's core distribution strengths and past history with
Iams, I suspect that 2010 will see a key Natura brand cross over into
mass channels, which would be a very big deal."

    During 1999, Procter &amp; Gamble purchased Iams. And shortly thereafter P
expanded the brand from pet specialty to mass with tremendous success.
According to Lummis' market analysis, the timing is right for a similar
move with a Natura brand, for a number of reasons. Among these, some pet
food consumers traded down during the recession and are now ripe for more
affordable options in premium pet food, including organic and natural.

    Bearing out this assessment is a survey of 1,881 consumers conducted by
Packaged Facts in May/June 2010. According to the survey:


--  Approximately one-third (34%) of pet owners agree (strongly or
    somewhat) that they are "spending less on pet products these days
    because of the economy." However, the same percentage also agree with
    the statement "I anticipate spending more on pet products over the
    next 12 months."
    
    
--  Natural dog and cat food purchasers are even more likely than dog or
    cat owners overall to plan to spend more -- perhaps partially a
    function of the natural segment's often upscale demographics bouncing
    back more quickly.
    
    
--  A little price adjustment may be just what the doctor ordered for
    bringing more consumers into (or back into) the natural camp. "If
    natural/organic pet products were more affordable where I shop, I
    would buy them more often," agree over half of pet owners (51%), with
    only 23% disagreeing with this statement.
    
    
--  39% of pet owners agree that they would buy natural/organic pet
    products more often if these products were more available where they
    shop, compared with 29% who disagree.

    

"What these figures tell me is that the time is ripe for a 'true'
natural brand to enter the mass channel," Lummis says. "And now that
Natura is, pending regulatory approval, under Procter &amp; Gamble's wing,
P is the perfect company to make that happen. If P does take a Natura
brand mass, it would broaden the consumer base for natural pet food
virtually overnight. It could also spur Mars to follow a similar path
with its Nutro brand, and Nestle Purina to consider acquiring a 'true'
natural band of its own."

    The complete findings of this survey -- which also details usage and
consumer demographics of natural pet products across categories including
dog food, cat food, natural/alternative litter, and natural flea and tick
care products -- are presented in Natural, Organic and Eco-Friendly Pet
Products in the U.S., 3rd Edition.

    Natural, Organic and Eco-Friendly Pet Products in the U.S., 3rd Edition
divides the market into two classifications -- pet food and pet care --
with the latter defined as encompassing all nonfood pet supplies (cat
litter, grooming products, pet supplements, clean-up products, etc.). For
each classification, coverage includes historical and projected retail
sales estimates from 2005 through 2014, competitive strategies and trends
among key players, and trends in new product development including
organic, human-grade, U.S. sourced, raw/frozen, and sustainable. For

(Adds spokeswoman's quotes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said
Wednesday that routine unit maintenance reported earlier at its
complex in Baytown, Texas, was in the chemical plant and did
not affect production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It was on the Chemical side and was just routine
maintenance of blowing out a line. Not a big deal, no impact on
production," Neely Nelson, a spokeswoman for the refinery, said
in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A message recorded earlier by a refinery official on a
community telephone information line reported that routine unit
maintenance was underway at the Baytown complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The message did not specify which unit was undergoing the
work or the nature of the maintenance but noted that the
complex was operating under normal operations. [ID:nN16130111]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Baytown complex comprises the chemical plant as well as
a 562,500-barrel-per-day oil refinery, the largest in the
United States.

&lt;p&gt;Company Details Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Progress in Latest
CRS Report


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE: CCE) announced today that the company improved
water efficiencies, increased internal recycling rates and reduced its reported
carbon footprint in 2009. The progress is detailed in the company`s fifth
company-wide Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability (CRS) Report, Clear on
Our Commitments: Our Journey to 2020. The report provides a comprehensive look
at the company`s progress towards "Commitment 2020," the set of goals CCE
announced last year in each of its five strategic CRS focus areas - Energy
Conservation/Climate Change, Water Stewardship, Sustainable Packaging/Recycling,
Product Portfolio/Balanced and Active Lifestyle, and Diverse and Inclusive
Culture. 

"Last year, we set ambitious goals that we are committed to achieving by the
year 2020," said John F. Brock, chairman and chief executive officer. "This
report demonstrates the steady progress we are making on our journey as we
strive to become a sustainability leader in the Coca-Cola system and across the
beverage industry." 

CCE calculated its global operational carbon footprint at 5.4 million metric
tons, a reduction of 11.5 percent from its previously reported 2007 footprint.
While the company acknowledges that a proportion of this reduction is the result
of refined data gathering processes, it shows that its considerable investment
in energy-efficient technology is paying dividends. CCE has implemented a wide
range of environmentally-friendly technologies in its production plants, fleet,
and sales and marketing equipment, as well as invested in renewable energy such
as solar panels and fuel cells. Through internal recycling initiatives, the
company achieved an average of 92 and 99 percent waste recycling rates at its
North American and European facilities, respectively. CCE also reduced its water
use ratio to 1.67 liters of water used to make one liter of product using
water-saving technologies and monitoring and targeting systems, which is an
improvement of more than 3.5 percent from 2008.

guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), please visit the company`s
website at http://www.cokecce.com. Comments and feedback related to the Report
are welcome at crs@cokecce.com. 

In 2009, CCE was recognized for its CRS progress by several third-party sources,
including being named #1 in the food and beverage industry in Newsweek`s Green
Rankings. CCE`s CRS reports have also received a variety of awards. Its 2008 CRS
Report won the Creativity in Communications Award from CorporateRegister.com,
which is CCE`s third consecutive win in that category, and was shortlisted for
the Ceres-ACCA Sustainability Reporting Awards. Other CRS report awards include
two Golden Peacock Awards (corporate social responsibility reporting) and Best
Overall Report Runner-up from CorporateRegister.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEWTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Rocket Software (www.rocketsoftware.com), a leading developer of enterprise
modernization and SOA integration products, today announced support for IBM
Rational Open Access: RPG Edition for the IBM i platform. Open Access: RPG
Edition decouples application business logic from the 5250 screen layer and
enables RPG developers to create new, non-screen-based access to RPG application
functions. 

Rocket leverages this new functionality in LegaSuite Integration, the company`s
SOA integration development tool for IBM i and other critical business systems.
The combination of LegaSuite and Open Access: RPG Edition enables RPG developers
to turn traditional RPG applications into high-performance, strategic SOA
services that can be used by any SOA-compliant application or platform. 

"Open Access: RPG Edition creates tremendous opportunity for our IBM i clients
to extend their existing applications to new devices and services. Rocket`s
LegaSuite Integration products provide the development tooling to put Open
Access: RPG Edition to work," said Ian Jarman, IBM manager for IBM i. 

"We have a significant installed base of customers who rely on the IBM i
platform, so enhancing our LegaSuite products to support Open Access: RPG
Edition is key to helping organizations offer new, high-performance SaaS and
cloud capabilities while preserving their investment in the IBM i," said Sam
Elias, Business Area Executive Worldwide for Seagull products at Rocket
Software. "We are excited about IBM`s Open Access: RPG Edition offering because
it brings RPG into the future." 

LegaSuite now provides a roadmap for making existing RPG functions accessible to
SaaS and cloud environments by selectively SOA-enabling application functions.
LegaSuite with Open Access: RPG Edition takes the buffer of information from the
RPG program and hands it off to the LegaSuite Integration runtime environment -
which can be deployed natively to the IBM i or to a variety of distributed
platforms, including a virtualized or cloud infrastructure running Windows or
Linux.

&lt;p&gt;June 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) Chief
Executive Lloyd Blankfein assured his firm's retired partners
at a meeting that clients are standing behind the company, the
Wall Street Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Blankfein also said the two months since the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Goldman of fraud have been
"very difficult," according to the Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 110 retired Goldman partners attended the meeting on
Tuesday, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein did not directly address the SEC civil suit
during the meeting, the paper said, citing people who heard the
comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC has accused Goldman of creating and marketing a
debt product linked to subprime mortgages without telling
investors that a prominent hedge fund helped choose the
underlying securities and was betting against them.
[ID:nN16123404] [ID:nLDE63K10N]. Goldman has denied wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein declined to comment to the Journal as he was
leaving the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman could not immediately be reached for comment by
Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours. (Reporting by

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will release a new mobile OS for enterprise handheld devices later this year as it tries to simplify the Windows Mobile upgrade cycle for customers, the company said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Windows Embedded Handheld OS will come out later this year and be based on the Windows Mobile 6.5 technology, said David Kelley, product unit manager for Windows Embedded at Microsoft, at an event in New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the company will release a new version of Windows Embedded Handheld, which will be based on Windows Embedded Compact 7 OS, Kelley said. The OS will feature a richer and immersive user experience, and improve on reliability and security features, Kelley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company wants to provide backward compatibility and a clear upgrade path from Windows Mobile 6.5 to the upcoming operating systems, Kelley said. That should extend the lifecycle of devices such as smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced Windows Embedded Compact 7 last month as the next generation of the Windows Embedded CE platform. The OS can be used in embedded systems such as in set-top boxes and slates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has announced the Windows Phone 7 OS for smartphones. Microsoft's focus on consumer mobile devices will continue through the Windows Phone brand, Kelley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement came at the launch of Motorola's ES400 Enterprise Digital Assistant, which is a smartphone designed for enterprise use. It runs on the Windows Mobile 6.5 OS.&lt;/p&gt;

 By Gleb Bryanski

 NOVO-OGARYOVO, Russia, June 17 (Reuters) - Oil major
Chevron (CVX.N) and Russia's largest oil producer Rosneft
(ROSN.MM) agreed on Thursday to invest $1 billion in a Black
Sea oil exploration project whose total cost may reach $32
billion.

 The agreement is the biggest energy deal in Russia
involving a foreign major in 2010. It also marks Chevron's
biggest foray into the Russian market since a failed attempt to
buy a stake in the now defunct oil firm YUKOS in 2003.

 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin oversaw the signing ceremony
in his country residence, stealing the show from President
Dmitry Medvedev, who is due to address a crowd of international
investors at the St. Petersburg Economic Forum on Friday.

 "I am very pleased that you are entering a different level
of cooperation -- we are talking about production of
hydrocarbons," Putin told Chevron Chief Executive John Watson,
asking him to ensure the environmental safety of the project.

 YUKOS, whose owners promised "lifelong litigation" against
the Kremlin after the company collapsed under back-tax claims,
previously held a licence to the Val Shatskogo (Shatsky Ridge)
deposit, which was later transferred to Rosneft.

 "What I am paying a particular attention to is that you are
taking certain risks, I also mean geological exploration. That
implies for us (the government) certain tasks linked to support
for such projects," Putin said without elaborating.

 IMPORTANT BUT RISKY ENDEAVOUR

 Russia's top energy official, Igor Sechin, told reporters
the initial investment will amount to $1 billion. The firms
said in a statement that Chevron will finance exploration
activities, with the drilling expected to begin in the end of
2011.

 Sechin said Chevron will help Rosneft raise required funds
for the project, which will be operated by a holding company,
with stakes distributed "in accordance with competence and
financing." Rosneft will hold the licence to the field.

 Sechin said that if exploration is successful, total
investment for exploration and production at the field could
amount to as much as 1 trillion roubles ($32.07 billion). He
gave no timeframe for the investment.

 Troika Dialog analyst Valery Nesterov said the venture may
resemble Rosneft's joint venture with China's state oil firm
CNPC, Vostok Energy, in which Rosneft has 51 percent and CNPC
49 percent. He called the project "an important but risky
endeavour."

 The licence covers an area of 8,600 square kilometres,
located (3,300 sq miles) in the eastern part of the Black Sea,
whose maximum depth reaches 2,200 metres (7,200 ft) and which
is considered difficult for deep water drilling.

 Chevron shares traded 0.5 percent higher while Rosneft
stock closed 5.5 percent down on speculations that oil major BP
(BP.L) may sell its 1.3 percent stake in the Russian firm due
to its financial woes. [ID:nLDE65G1PM]

 BP's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has highlighted the
risks of offshore oil exploration. The Black Sea is lined with
resorts including Sochi, the Russian city hosting the 2014
Winter Olympics.

 "Chevron has successfully drilled 375 deep water wells in
complex environments... We are confident that we will continue
to drill deep water wells safely," Watson told Putin, raising
the issue of tax benefits for the field.

 "It is a highly prospective area, it does have geological
risks and high costs. We will need to work closely with the
government to ensure that proper fiscal terms are in place to
allow this project to develop rapidly," Watson said.

 Russia's oil industry is heavily taxed through the mineral
extraction tax and oil export duty, but firms operating
difficult projects have in the past successfully lobbied for
tax breaks.

 In July 2009, Russia government scrapped the mineral
extraction tax for Black Sea shelf deposits until production
from the fields reaches 20 million tonnes, but the oil that is
produced remains subject to export duty.

 The government also lifted export duty on oil extracted at
22 remote East Siberian fields prompting firms to lobby for a
similar breaks at offshore projects. Sechin said that reducing
the duty for the Black Sea project has not yet been discussed.

 Sechin said that under a new tax regime for East Siberian
fields, in place from July 1, the firms will pay only 45
percent of the normal duty if the oil price is above $50 until
the internal rate of return (IRR) of a project exceeds 15
percent, at which point the normal rate will be applied.

 "A similar tax regime will not necessarily be applied to
this project. But during its realisation, we will have an
opportunity to evaluate the (tax) burden on the partners,"
Sechin said.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com Analyst Blog features: CBOE Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: CBOE), Goldman
Sachs Group (NYSE: GS), Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group Inc. (NYSE: CME), NYSE
Euronext Inc. (NYSE: NYX) and InterContinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE: ICE).

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

CBOE: New Kid on the Bourses

The much awaited initial public offering (IPO) of Chicago Board Options Exchange
"CBOE" Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: CBOE) raised $339 million from the sale of 11.7
million shares. Shares fetched $29 each, at the upper end of its expected range
of $27&#8722;$29. 

The IPO was underwritten by Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE: GS). The shares of CBOE
are trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "CBOE." 

Founded in 1973, CBOE`s IPO plan had been devised long back but was held up by a
legal hassle with the members of the former Chicago Board of Trade ("CBOT").
CBOT is the futures exchange from which CBOE Holdings was originally spun off
and which was bought by Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group Inc. (NYSE: CME) in
August 2008. 

The newly traded company will utilize the net proceeds of the IPO for its
business operations and pay its settlement dues to the former members of the
CBOT. 

CBOE Holdings plans to pay regular quarterly dividends, anticipating an annual
dividend target of approximately 20% to 30% of the prior year's net income,
adjusted for unusual items. 

Previously, when the exchange had declared to go public on March 11, 2010, CBOE
had projected the IPO to be worth $300 million and further discounted it due to
the ongoing debt crisis in Europe that followed the plummeting of the U.S. stock
prices. 

Conversely, the stock soared 12% on its debut, valuing the exchange at a
whopping $2.97 billion. The CBOE IPO was valued at a higher multiple of future
earnings than rival exchanges such as CME, NYSE Euronext Inc. (NYSE: NYX) and
InterContinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE: ICE), given its history of rapid growth,
exclusive products and potential to be acquired. Consequently, the already
strong domestic peers in the industry such as NYSE, ICE and CME as well as the
overseas companies such as Germany's Deutsche Boerse AG and Brazil's BM
Bovespa SA eye CBOE as an acquisition partner. 

CBOE Holdings has a smaller market capitalization of about $450 million. In
contrast, its rival CME has a market capitalization of about $20.4 billion, NYSE
has $7.7 billion and NASDAQ has $4.1 billion, making CBOE an affordable buyout
target.

&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft is going to tell large global enterprises how to roll out a social networking platform, the folks in Redmond sure as heck better do it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the company's tradition of "eating your own dog food" (using your own products in-house), Microsoft has been using SharePoint 2010: MySites for individual profile pages and teamsites for product groups spread out around the world to share documents and collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has also built various internal Web sites on SharePoint, such as a You Tube-like site for posting podcasts and videos (called "Academy Mobile" inside the company).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Steve Ballmer has been known to shoot a video segment from his desk about how the company is doing and post it to Academy Mobile. The same goes for CIO Tony Scott's "fireside chat" videos enlightening salespeople on the needs of today's CIOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the past two years, the number of Microsoft employees uploading content to the Academy Mobile site has more than quadrupled and the percentage of employees viewing podcasts on the site has gone from 10 percent to 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's YouTube-like internal podcasting site, called Academy Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's experience building a social networking critical mass within the company has put it in a sharing mood. And at the Enterprise 2.0 conference this week in Boston, Christian Finn, Microsoft's Director for Collaboration and Enterprise Social Computing, shared advice for IT managers on how to roll out SharePoint sites make employees more productive, how to prove cost-savings to executives and how to get execs blogging (and maybe even podcasting like Steve B.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are Finn's seven truths Microsoft has discovered about becoming a socially connected enterprise:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the User's Solution, Not Yours&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social networking is a democratic process, and you need to get feedback from users before deploying. Within Microsoft, the first feedback from employees was that they did not want the social networking platform to be VPN-based. They needed to have access to it without having to go through the corporate network. So Microsoft IT integrated its SharePoint sites with Windows Directory Services and placed some of them outside the firewall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees also wanted to be able to flag for inappropriate content, so that feature was added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any social network should be rolled out in steps, says Finn, and companies should frequently get user feedback and adjust accordingly. Do not implement a whole platform upfront before you know what users want and need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solve a Problem, Don't Deploy a Technology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of implementing a YouTube-like site for your company just because everyone else is doing it, pinpoint what business problem these tools could solve, such as helping a global workforce share more information faster through podcasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then the users themselves start to see the value of connecting with employees easier and having an immersive experience," says Finn. "You get the users' attention, and it builds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tackle Distributed Knowledge Problems First&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social networking can help in places where knowledge is unevenly distributed within your company. This is likely a geography problem, says Finn, where people in corporate headquarters have information, but the employees who need it are distributed around the world and don't know who to contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ For complete coverage on Microsoft's SharePoint collaboration software -- including enterprise and cloud adoption trends and previews of SharePoint 2010 -- see CIO.com's SharePoint Bible. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A social networking platform can also help people in the field who come up with a great idea and need a way to broadcast it to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market the Need, Not the Consumer Phenomenon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be careful how you pitch a social networking platform to the higher-ups. Calling something "A Facebook or YouTube for the Enterprise" can have a negative connotation, because of privacy issues or the reputation those sites have as time wasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to use the consumer technologies of Facebook or YouTube, says Finn, but avoid advertising it that way if you have an older, skeptical executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a Distinct Identity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give your social site its own name and design, so it looks different from the rest of your intranet. The aim: get users excited about something that's unique and not just another SharePoint site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some examples: Microsoft's Academy Mobile podcasting site and (Microsoft customer) British TeleCom's social networking site called "Dare to Share." Both have catchy names and distinctive designs, which Finn says can "create positive word-of-mouth buzz."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slideshow: Windows 7 Hardware in Pictures: The Latest and Greatest Laptops Slideshow: In Pictures: Pro Sports Teeming with Tech Partnerships Slideshow: Fighting the Dark Side: Tech's Heroes and Villains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of creating a distinct identity, he adds, is that it "doesn't appear as if 'The Man' is mandating all the content."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start Small, Grow Quickly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not base a social networking roll-out on the notion of "Build it and they will come," says Finn. Even the most amazing social sites will fall on deaf ears if they don't solve business problems, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, find groups of people - be it developers, designers or salespeople - and start small by creating online communities for them based on common interests and goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you create all these new communities and too many people aren't part of those communities, they will ask: 'Why do i need this'?" says Finn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultivate Participation of All Kinds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allowing users to blog and podcast is no good unless other users can rate, tag and comment on the content, Finn says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A video site without comments and ratings is like a ghost town," says Finn. "You want a site to feel like a living place with lots of people present."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, you want to get C-level executives participating in social media to build trust and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You might not start with the execs," says Finn. "Within Microsoft, social networking had value because it benefited one user peer-to-peer to another user, but once our podcasting network got larger, people like Ballmer and [CIO] Tony Scott realized that's a good way to reach people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

&lt;p&gt; ST JOHN'S, Newfoundland, June 17 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) does not think it will be required to drill a relief
well at its Orphan Basin exploration site off Newfoundland, a
company official said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company will abide by any regulations prompted by
British Petroleum's (BP.L) massive oil spill in the Gulf, but
requiring a relief well could actually increase the risk of an
accident, said Mark MacLeod, Chevron's Atlantic Manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I will have to say as you're drilling a second well you're
exposing people to the risk of drilling each well, so you're
effectively doubling the risk," MacLeod said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is drilling the Lona 0-55 exploration well in the
Orphan Basin, some 430 kilometers (270 miles) northeast of
Newfoundland's capital St. John's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Canadian regulators announced last month that Chevron must
take additional safety measures, including new test results on
its blowout preventer and undergo more safety inspections of
its drillship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe all wells can be drilled incident free. We
believe this well will be drilled incident free and we won't
need a relief well," MacLeod said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is drilling a well in more than 2,600 meters (8,530
feet) of water off the Canadian coast, making it twice as deep
as the BP well that has been fouling the Gulf of Mexico with
oil since April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The April 20 explosion on an offshore rig leased by BP
killed 11 workers and ruptured a deep-sea well, creating what
U.S. President Barack Obama has called the worst environmental
disaster America has ever faced. [SPILL]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting Claire Sibonney, Writing Allan Dowd, editing by

&lt;p&gt;  PALO ALTO, CA, Jun 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW), the global leader in virtualization solutions
from the desktop through the datacenter to the cloud, today announced
that VMware vSphere(TM) 4 was named as a Winner in the Microsoft Best of
TechEd 2010 awards program in the Best Virtualization Product category by
Penton Media's Windows IT Pro(R) and SQL Server Magazine(R).
Additionally, vSphere 4 was honored as Microsoft Best of TechEd 2010
Attendees' Pick, selected by the over 10,000 customers, partners, and
staff that attended the conference.

    The Best of TechEd 2010 awards recognize companies who offer innovative
Microsoft partner products. The Penton Media judges reviewed 298 products
and services submitted for the contest and chose 46 finalists to be
interviewed at the Microsoft TechEd North America 2010 IT pro conference
in New Orleans, Louisiana on June 9, 2010. Winners were announced at an
evening reception at the Hard Rock Cafe on June 9th.

represent highly distinguished products and services in their
categories."

&lt;p&gt;IBM unveiled plans this month for an open source Eclipse project based on the company's EGL business application programming language, in an effort to boost backing for EGL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project has been labeled nbsp;EGL (Enterprise Generation Language) Development Tools Project and was submitted to the Eclipse Foundation. EGL itself will be open-sourced as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ IBM last year offered its EGL  CE (Community Edition) tool to aid developers coding in  languages such as JavaScript. The Eclipse proposal is seeded with code  for EGL CE. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The project aims to develop and evolve a set of Eclipse-based tools for the EGL language," said William Smythe, a product line manager for IBM Rational, in an email. "Just like there is a C/C++ project on Eclipse for building tools for C/C++, there is now going to be a project on Eclipse for building tools for the EGL language. All the tools will be written in Java, just like everything else on Eclipse," Smythe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EGL is a modeling language that borrows from Unified Modeling Language. It is designed for building portable, cross-platform applications and services that can be deployed to runtime environments based on the evolving needs of business, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is open-sourcing the EGL language, compiler, generators for Java and JavaScript, as well as tools. By open-sourcing EGL, IBM looks to expand its reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Developing EGL in the open allows the EGL language and tools to evolve and mature in a way that is not possible if developed only by IBM. EGL is a unique technology that is designed to be extended. Opening it will spur others to add new capabilities, which benefits everyone using the technology," according to an IBM FAQ."Opening the technology also opens EGL to a new audience of developers -- developers who would have been hesitant to try EGL before," IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"EGL is a programming language designed for developing business applications. EGL code compiles into other languages (Java, Cobol, and JavaScript), which allows developers to code in a single language but deploy into different environments," Smythe said. "One nice benefit of EGL is that developers can build JavaScript-based RIAs, but not actually have to code in JavaScript."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eclipse was selected as the home for the EGL open source project because EGL tools already are built on Eclipse and EGL integrates with other Eclipse technologies such as BIRT (Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools), Web Tools, and Data Tools, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, "IBM EGL business language moves to open source," was originally published  at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;A 13-year relationship with IBM and its Websphere application integration server has been critical in helping ING Direct of Canada quickly build and operate a mobile banking application, a bank official said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ING Direct launched a mobile banking application and a mobile banking Web site for Canadians nearly three months ago on BlackBerry and iPhone and on June 7 added the iPad , Charaka Kithulegoda, vice president of software development at ING Bank of Canada, told Computerworld. The application relies on Websphere application servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banking application has been a resounding success, with nearly 50,000 unique visitors so far, he said. It was relatively simple to develop, since ING Bank of Canada, based in Toronto, had been using IBM services and Websphere a long time, Kithulegoda said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our relationship with IBM goes back 13 years and with applications on the Websphere platform we have a partnership that helped us go from the mobile banking idea to implementation in only six weeks," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I was not already with IBM, I would certainly consider putting in Websphere to mobilize an application," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mobile rollout is in its infancy, but Kithulegoda said he feels the application's return on investment is already worth more than the costs involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can check account balances, review transactions transfer funds, locate ATMs, and buy and sell investment funds with the application. ING Direct has no physical bank locations, so the mobile application has been a way of personalizing the ING banking experience, Kithulegoda said. "It's good for business," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Kithulegoda's praise for IBM and Websphere, the use of Websphere for application integration to mobile devices has been criticized by some analysts, including Jack Gold of J. Gold Associates, as an expensive approach that can hold customers captive to IBM for the newest software features, while also requiring them to rely indefinitely on IBM services consultants for integration help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold attended an analyst conference sponsored by IBM at the opening of the new IBM Mass Lab near Boston on Wednesday, and asked an IBM executive whether it would continue to require most of its enterprise customers to rely on IBM Websphere for mobile deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Mills, senior vice president of IBM Software, answered Gold by saying that enterprise customers are free to build back-end application servers on their own, but said IBM will not open up Websphere intellectual property in its software to allow certain connections to some other software products, including from competitors such as Oracle , which makes the Weblogic application server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not doing enablement for [Oracle's] Weblogic," he said. "Oracle can do that themselves. For session control [and other functions]... I'm not going to share that technology with anybody."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mills said IBM has done well with Websphere, having deployed 50,000 installations in businesses with 1,000 or more employees, with thousands more installations in companies with fewer than 1,000 workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Gold said IBM could have a bigger presence in the mobile software world if it didn't tie so many mobile functions to Websphere. He said IBM middleware is used by about 10% of the enterprise market, a number that could be higher for a company as large and influential as IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Hamblen covers mobile and wireless, smartphones and other handhelds, and wireless networking for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Jun 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Editors Note: There are three videos associated with this Press Release.

    Since Windows(R) 7 launched in October of 2009 it has seen phenomenal
growth with more than 100 million licenses sold to date. This
extraordinary growth includes Canadian businesses and organizations such
as Ricoh Canada, Bombardier Aerospace, MMM Group and the City of London
which are all reaping the benefits of the adoption of Windows 7.

    Windows 7 delivers value across all sectors to businesses both big and
small which is why Canadian organizations have been so quick to adopt it:

    The City of London (Ontario) began to roll out Windows 7 at the
beginning of the year to improve the level of service we delivered to
citizens. Even in the face of tightening budgets, the performance and
flexibility of Windows 7 has enabled us to continue to reduce the cost of
supporting desktop PC users, deliver services with enhanced security and
efficiently, says Barry Heathers, Manager, Data Centre and Hardware
Services, City of London.

    Rather than purchase new computers for Meadow Green Academy,
ranging from $400 to $1,000 a piece, we upgraded the existing PCs with
memory and video cards that cost roughly $100 per machine to support the
move from Windows XP to Windows 7. Students and faculty immediately
started to provide positive feedback around the speed of the new
operating system which ran very smoothly on old hardware. We are still
seeing solid ROI around giving our students an opportunity to grow their
skills and allowing faculty to be more productive, Mitch Garvis, IT
Consultant, Meadow Green Academy.

    Microsoft Canada and Gartner Quotes:

    Elliot Katz, Senior Product Manager of Windows Client, Microsoft Canada 

    Windows 7 is ready to deploy - customers like The City of London,
Meadow Green Academy, MMM Group and Ricoh are doing it, Microsoft has the
tools and infrastructure ready to make it fast and easy. At Microsoft we
believe in the power of innovation. We believe in technology. Where the
real magic happens is when this innovation happens in lockstep with
technology partners and customers- and I think that's why we continue to
see so much excitement for Windows 7.  

    Steve Kleynhans, Research Vice President, Gartner

    As companies begin planning for emerging from the recession, they
are examining their all aspects of their IT operations. Most are

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Recognizes Merck`s Industry-First Scientific Poster Session Held in
ProtonMedia`s ProtoSphere 3-D Virtual Environment
LANSDALE, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Microsoft Corp. has named Merck and Company, Inc. and ProtonMedia winners of the
company`s Life Sciences Innovation Awards 2010. The awards, announced at the
Drug Information Association`s (DIA) 46th annual meeting in Washington, D.C.,
were given in recognition of innovative solutions in the pharmaceutical and life
sciences industry. The awards honor companies that have demonstrated the
successful application of available software and devices to revolutionize
medicine, bring therapeutic breakthroughs to market faster, fight serious
ailments, improve health, and enhance people`s quality of life. Microsoft
recognized Merck`s innovative use of ProtonMedia`s ProtoSphere 3-D virtual
environment to hold the pharmaceutical industry`s first virtual scientific
poster session. 

"Between pressure to bring new drugs and therapies to market faster and the
persistent and pressing need to cut costs, life sciences companies today are
facing tremendous challenges," said Michael Naimoli, U.S. Life Sciences Industry
Solutions Director, Microsoft Corp. "This year`s awards recognize companies that
have developed innovative technology solutions based on the Microsoft software
platform to achieve significant benefits, whether speeding discovery, time to
market, or enhancing collaboration." 

Merck partnered with ProtonMedia to develop a 3-D virtual poster session
environment in ProtoSphere for employee collaboration, learning and training.
Results measured after the poster session event demonstrated that virtual
environments for scientific meetings are well accepted by the current generation
of scientists, suggesting that these environments can be used to deliver
immediate value. 

ProtoSphere is the first and only virtual collaboration environment to integrate
with Microsoft SharePoint services and content. By adding ProtonMedia`s
SharePoint Media Carousel to their ProtoSphere environment, companies extend
their SharePoint investment and processes while they improve product lifecycle
management (PLM) and speed collaborative decision-making in ProtoSphere.
ProtonMedia is a Microsoft Life Sciences partner. 

"Microsoft is the world`s software leader, and together with its partners, its
Life Sciences division forms the foundation of organizations` technology
infrastructures," says Ron Burns, CEO of ProtonMedia. "Merck`s virtual poster
session measurably demonstrates how life sciences companies can combine
Microsoft`s technology with an enterprise virtual collaboration environment like
ProtoSphere to extend their Microsoft platform and accelerate decision making
around all phases of their product lifecycle. We thank Microsoft for recognizing
our joint development innovation with Merck." 

Merck`s use of ProtoSphere also earned recognition from the editors of Bio-IT
World, who gave Merck its Best Practice Award in the Editors` Choice Award
category in April. The project was also detailed in a recent Nature Chemistry
article. 

Microsoft Life Sciences Innovation Award participants consisted of worldwide
life sciences corporations in drug discovery, scientific research and basic
science, medical devices, clinical trials, document and records management,
knowledge management, manufacturing and bioprocessing, mobile workers, supply
chain, sales and marketing, digital marketing and social networking,
personalized medicine, infostructure and desktop and application virtualization.
Winners were selected by an esteemed panel of industry experts and will be
highlighted on the Microsoft website at http://www.microsoft.com/lifesciences.

 It said Chevron will finance initial exploration activities,
including seismic surveys and exploration drilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is a highly prospective area, it has geological risks

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Stonesoft, an innovative provider of integrated network security and business
continuity solutions, today announced that its StoneGate IPS (intrusion
prevention system) provides efficient protection against the latest critical
vulnerabilities that exist in Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Reader, Adobe Acrobat
and Microsoft Windows. Due to Stonesoft`s advanced next generation IPS
capabilities, companies currently using the StoneGate IPS to protect their
networks are not affected by these vulnerabilities.

According to the Adobe security advisory last updated on June 10th, the recent
vulnerability (CVE-2010-1297) can cause the user`s system to crash while
potentially allowing an attacker to take control of the affected system. At that
point, the user is coaxed to open a PDF document that contains malicious code.
The code attacks the user client via a Web browser resulting in tremendous
damage. This vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild against both
Adobe Flash Player, and Adobe Reader and Acrobat. Similarly, in the Microsoft
vulnerability, the user is led to download a web page, which then uses Windows`
help program to break into the client. Upon successful exploitation, the remote
attacker is able to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user. 

StoneGate IPS offers efficient protection against both of these critical
vulnerabilities. The StoneGate IPS is capable of identifying and terminating the
attacks when the web page or PDF document is opened and/or downloaded. The
system can also stop emails that carry the PDF file as an attachment as well as
prevent the downloading of any Adobe Flash content. 

"These newest vulnerabilities are representative of the sophisticated,
client-side attacks that have become increasingly common in the network. They
also reiterate the need for solutions like the StoneGate IPS that automatically
protect against these threats. In Adobe and Microsoft`s case, the threats were
disclosed and exploited before patches became available making it extremely
difficult to protect hosts without external security devices," said Jeff Hajek,
senior vice president of operations at Stonesoft, Inc.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, June 17 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
gained EU regulatory clearance on Thursday for its $1.7 billion
purchase of the non-U.S. assets of commodities joint venture RBS
Sempra from Royal Bank of Scotland and Sempra Energy (SRE.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, keen to expand its commodities arm, will take the
RBS Sempra global oil and metals and European power and gas
assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sempra has said it may buy RBS's (RBS.L) stake in the U.S.
operations of the joint venture, in which it holds a 49 percent
stake and RBS the remaining shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The (European) Commission's examination of the deal showed
that the horizontal overlaps between the activities of JPMorgan
and those of Sempra are limited," the European Union executive
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EU competition watchdog said the combined company would
continue to face strong rivals with significant market shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Partly-nationalised RBS is selling off assets in return for

              Movie Opening Marks First IMAX 3D PIXAR Title


LOS ANGELES, June 18, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IMAX Corporation (Nasdaq:IMAX)
(TSX:IMX) and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures today announced that Toy Story
3, the third installment of the blockbuster hit franchise Toy Story, will open
in 180 IMAX(R) domestically theatres simultaneously with its wide release on
June 18, 2010. The film will also open in 76 IMAX theatres internationally, with
48 of those opening this week starting on June 16.

Toy Story 3 has been digitally re-mastered into the unparalleled image and sound
quality of The IMAX Experience(R) with proprietary IMAX DMR(R) (Digital
Re-mastering) technology.

"We're very excited to once again unite Disney Digital 3D with The IMAX
Experience, and to do it for the long-awaited release of Toy Story 3 is a real
treat," Chuck Viane, President, Distribution, Walt Disney Studios Motion
Pictures. "A film like this is designed to take audiences on an exciting
thrill-ride adventure, making it a perfect match for both 3D and IMAX."

"We have always envisioned the Toy Story franchise as an ideal fit for The IMAX
Experience and we're very happy to finally turn that vision into a reality,"
said IMAX CEO Richard L. Gelfond. "This film also fits nicely into our 2010
lineup, ensuring that families will be able to start the summer holidays with a
fun Disney release in IMAX."

"In IMAX(R) 3D and through the power of Randy Newman's incomparable music,
audiences will be able to see and hear Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the larger
than life characters of Toy Story in a whole new way," added Greg Foster,
Chairman and President of IMAX Filmed Entertainment. "Pixar's beloved films have
changed the way people go to the movies, and IMAX is proud to be working with
both Pixar and Disney, who like IMAX, strive to transport moviegoers to
incredible places that people only dream about visiting," added

The creators of the beloved "Toy Story" films re-open the toy box and bring
moviegoers back to the delightful world of our favorite gang of toy characters
in TOY STORY 3. As Andy prepares to depart for college, Buzz, Woody and the rest
of his loyal toys are troubled about their uncertain future. Directed by Lee
Unkrich (co-director of "Toy Story 2" and "Finding Nemo"), TOY STORY 3 is a
comical new adventure in Disney Digital 3D(TM) that lands the toys in a room
full untamed tots who can't wait to get their sticky little fingers on these
"new" toys. It's pandemonium as they try to stay together, ensuring "no toy gets
left behind." Meanwhile, Barbie comes face to plastic face with Ken (yes, that
Ken).  Pixar veteran Darla K. Anderson ("Cars," "Monsters, Inc.") produces,
while Michael Arndt, Academy Award(R)-winning screenwriter of "Little Miss
Sunshine," brings his unique talents and comedic sensibilities.

Toy Story 3: An IMAX 3D Experience is scheduled to play day-and-date at the
following IMAX(R) theatres beginning June 18th.

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria cautioned Exxon Mobil on Tuesday about oil spills off the Niger Delta, saying while the output lost was minor it was worried by their frequency and the damage they could do to fragile coastal communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa's biggest energy producer has had just over 2,400 oil spills involving its foreign oil partners since 2006, according to the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), most of them onshore in the Niger Delta's creeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many are caused by militant attacks or saboteurs seeking to tap into pipelines and siphon off oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Environment Minister John Odey summoned Exxon Mobil to a meeting with NOSDRA officials to discuss what the government said were a series of spills far offshore, where militant attacks and sabotage are infrequent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are concerned about the operations of Exxon Mobil because once it is offshore, any spillage could of course affect the shoreline and it could go far beyond their areas of operation," Odey told reporters after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon Mobil needs to show more caution in terms of the management of oil spills," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disaster seen in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where millions of gallons of oil have spilled after an offshore rig blast blew out a BP Plc well, have heightened concerns about the environmental safety of offshore drilling around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria's NOSDRA said the last spill, on May 1, had occurred at an Exxon platform some 20-25 miles offshore which feeds the Qua Iboe oil export terminal. Previous spills had occurred last December and in February, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil declared force majeure last month on Qua Iboe oil shipments due to what it said was damage to a pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. energy firm acknowledged there had been a spill on May 1 but disputed some of the claims made against it in a presentation during the Abuja meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes we had a spill ... but some of the things said and shown are not correct. Perhaps there is a communication gap and we will work toward bridging this gap," Aniefiok Etuk, Exxon Mobil's general manager for safety, health and environment in Nigeria, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria has struggled to produce much above two thirds of its installed production capacity of 3 million barrels per day (bpd), most of it onshore, because of unrest in the Niger Delta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil spills in the delta's creeks have been left to fester for decades, polluting the air, soil, and water of impoverished communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria sees its future output growth largely in offshore fields and does not want spills there to compound its environmental woes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOSDRA's director of oil spill detection, Idris Musa, said the offshore spills so far had involved relatively small amounts of production but that it was starting to become a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of the spills are not large but the frequency is becoming a source of concern and worry to the agency," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Nick Tattersall; editing by Jim Marshall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, June 18 (Reuters) - One Equity Partners, a unit of
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), gained EU regulatory approval on
Friday for its takeover of Austria's Constantia Packaging
CVER.VI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; One Equity Partners, which unveiled the deal in October last
year, had said it would acquire 66 percent of Constantia with
Dutch holding company Constantia B.V. keeping a stake of up to
25 percent. [ID:nLC468608]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Commission said the deal does not create
competition concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The portfolio of companies controlled by One Equity
Partners and JPMorgan Chase are not active in the same markets,
and there are no significant vertical links with these
companies," the EU competition watchdog said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Constantia Packaging makes aluminium, plastic packaging,
corrugated board base paper for the food, beverage,
pharmaceutical, auto and aerospace industries.

&lt;p&gt;  NEUBIBERG, GERMANY, Jun 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Infineon Technologies AG (FRANKFURT: IFX) (OTCQX: IFNNY) today announced
that IBM will manufacture Infineon-designed highly-secure integrated
circuits (ICs) used for secure identification applications, including
electronic passports compliant with international travel regulations and
the U.S. Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards. The planned
production at IBM's chip fabrication plant in Burlington, Vermont,
provides U.S. manufactured components for suppliers to U.S. government
electronic identification programs.

    Infineon and IBM began a collaboration in 2007 that included licensing of
the 130nm embedded Flash technology used to produce advanced security
ICs. This established technology base will be used to manufacture
security microcontrollers based on the Infineon SLE 78 architecture,
which features 'Integrity Guard' hardware security technology.

    "As the long-time top ranked supplier of security ICs to commercial and
government customers worldwide, Infineon is committed to providing a
trusted supply chain that protects the integrity of every ID program that
uses our products," said Dr. Helmut Gassel, President of the Chip Card &amp;
Security Division at Infineon Technologies. "Our continued investment in
the development of state-of-the-art security technology and expansion of
our own supply base are driven by this focus on meeting the needs of our
customers." 

    "Manufacturing at the IBM Trusted Foundry enables us to meet the specific
needs of the U.S. government for in-country production from a security
certified high-volume, high-quality source," said Dr. Joerg Borchert,
Vice President of the Chip Card &amp; Security Division at Infineon
Technologies North America Corp. "Our plant in Dresden, Germany, has
provided ICs for the U.S. ePassport since 2006. We now have a U.S. site
that is fully-qualified to supply security microcontrollers and related
products with the highest levels of security available in a production IC
today." 

    Infineon specifically developed the SLE 78 family and 'Integrity Guard'
security technology for use in demanding chip-based high-end security
identification and payment areas with their need for long-term security
as well as for robust, high-quality products with excellent contactless
performance. The SLE 78 products received the Common Criteria EAL5+
(high) security certification for use in electronic ID documents and chip
card applications by German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)
certifying the high standard of security achieved by Infineon. Moreover,
in 2008, the chip card industry recognized the SLE 78 architecture with
its highest award, the Sesame Award in the category of Best Hardware
Innovation, at the annual Cartes &amp; Identification conference in Paris,
France. 

    Both the IBM Trusted Foundry and Infineon's Dresden plant are security
certified according to "Common Criteria," an international standard
designation for the integrity of manufacturing and the supply chain from
producer to end-customer. This provides Infineon customers with two
fully-qualified sources for advanced security chip technology.

    In Government ID applications, roughly every other Government ID document
(not including the China ID project) issued in 2009 incorporated a
security chip produced by Infineon. Government ID applications include
electronic documents, such as passports, national ID, health cards,
drivers licenses and social security cards. Today, Infineon's products
are used in the public domain of about one-third of the 192 UN member
states, which represent a total population of more than three billion
people.

    Together with energy efficiency and communication, security is one of the

risks and steady cash flow from exploration and production
(EP) assets of the natural gas producer and pipeline company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "An investment in WMB provides a superior growth  income

&lt;p&gt;EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Five photos of Disney*Pixar`s "Toy Story 3" toys from Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) are

Disney*Pixar`s "Toy Story 3"! Collect your favorite characters like Buzz, Woody,
Rex and Jessie - and look for all-new friends!

interactive, adventurous Disney*Pixar`s "Toy Story 3" world. Once connected a
simple push of a button triggers an exciting chain reaction where characters fly
through the air, zip line to safety and more - just like in the movie! Available
in five collectible stunt sets.

Photo four:

* This cool Buzz Lightyear inspired forearm cuff is the ultimate space gadget

Photo five:

* Be like Buzz! Once kids slip into the backpack-styled Wing Pack, a simple push

tipped horizontally, the Wing Pack's sensors know kids are "flying" and makes
corresponding flying sounds!

&lt;p&gt;   * Improves arthritis pain, function at 3 tested doses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Well-tolerated, but some tissue swelling seen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Could be first biotech drug for pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - A new type of biotech
arthritis drug being developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) was
significantly better at reducing knee pain than a placebo at
all three tested doses in a late-stage trial, according to data
presented on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug, tanezumab, which is administered by infusion
every eight weeks and works by blocking a protein called nerve
growth factor that is associated with pain, could become the
first biotechnology drug for pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What we've seen so far in terms of Phase II trials and
this first Phase III trial has impressed upon us that this drug
has some extraordinary efficacy benefits," said Mark Brown, who
is heading up the drug's arthritis clinical development program
for Pfizer, and led the study being presented at the European
League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) meeting in Rome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several injectable biotechnology medicines are used to
treat rheumatoid arthritis, a potentially crippling immune
system disorder. More traditional oral pain killers are
typically used to treat osteoarthritis, which is damage to the
joints caused by wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe this drug will ultimately prove itself to be
superior to exiting therapies for osteoarthritis," Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said tanezumab would not have the high price
generally associated with biotech drugs, which can cost tens of
thousands of dollars per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 690 patients in the Phase III study were either
unwilling or unable to take standard pain killers -- such as
NSAIDs like aspirin and ibuprofen, and Pfizer's own Celebrex, a
member of a class of drugs called Cox-2 inhibitors. The trial
also included patients who did not get sufficient relief from
those drugs or those who were candidates for knee surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patients in the study received tanezumab at doses of either
2.5 milligrams, 5 mg, 10 mg or a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After 16 weeks, patients in all three tanezumab groups had
statistically significant improvement compared with placebo in
the primary goals of pain measurement and physical function,
Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pain was rated on a scale of zero to 10, with 10 being most
extreme pain. Most of the patients began the trial with a pain
rating of about 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those taking the lowest does of tanezumab on average
reported pain reduced by 3.15 points, while the 5 mg group had
pain cut by 3.26 points and the pain level fell by 3.62 points
in the 10 mg group. The placebo patients reported an average
drop of 2.42 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a similar zero to 10 physical function measure, the
improvement was 2.8 points, 3.02 points and 3.29 points for the
three tanezumab doses versus 2.04 on placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When you see a high degree of pain relief you will see a
high improvement in function; they were both equally
impressive," Ken Verburg, Pfizer's team leader for the
medicine, said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patients were also asked for a general assessment of how
they were feeling on a 5-point scale with zero being very good,
three representing fair and five very poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All groups started the trial at around 3.4, which would be
between fair and poor. Those taking the highest dose of
tanezumab moved a full point down the scale, with the lower
doses coming down 0.83 point and 0.87 point. That compared with
a reduction of only 0.51 in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer is also testing tanezumab against the pain drug
naproxen, which is sold under the brand name Aleve, with data
expected later this year. It is also being tested against more
powerful opioid pain drugs to better prove its clinical worth
compared with commonly used arthritis treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tanezumab was deemed to be generally well-tolerated, Pfizer
said. But more patients taking it suffered peripheral edema, or
swelling of the limbs, than those who got a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brown said the condition was mild to moderate and tended to
be temporary and was not necessarily the type of edema
associated with heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "From this study we don't have these concerns," Brown
said.

&lt;p&gt;PEBBLE BEACH, California (Reuters) - Unheralded Spaniard Rafael Cabrera-Bello fired an opening 70 to lie a shot off the lead at the U.S. Open on Thursday following a week of visa and baggage trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After missing his original flight due to visa problems and having to wait a day for his clubs to arrive in California, the 26-year-old made a dream major championship debut at Pebble Beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Canary Islands-native carded four birdies and three bogeys to walk off the Pacific coast course one behind co-leaders Paul Casey of Britain, Zimbabwe's Brendon de Jonge and American Shaun Micheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cabrera-Bello said he allowed himself a peek at the leaderboard just for fun and was thrilled to see his name on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I could only dream about a day like this," a grinning Cabrera-Bello told reporters. "I maybe imagined it when I was eight or nine years old but never expected something like this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cabrera-Bello, who won his maiden European Tour event last year with a final-round 60 at the Austrian Open, had to overcome some tiresome red tape to begin his Pebble Beach adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After arriving at Madrid airport from the Canary Islands, visa problems kept him from his scheduled flight. After a night at his uncle's house, he continued his journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MISSING CLUBS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Spaniard landed in San Francisco, his clubs were missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My clubs spent the night in Philadelphia," he said after using borrowed wedges to casually explore the course on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He launched his U.S. Open quest in the first group to tee off from the 10th tee at 0700 local time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I started off there were some guys, surprisingly a few guys," the slender Spaniard said about the Pebble Beach gallery. "I don't think they came to see me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cabrera-Bello, who won the Spanish national championship every year from the under-seven to under-18 level, is determined to enjoy himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was just a pleasure. Just stay calm like it's any other round," said Cabrera-Bello, who went four under par over the last seven holes of European qualifying for a U.S. Open berth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked what he expected of himself, he said: "Absolutely nothing. I would be a fool to expect anything. I'm just going to learn a lot just from being here and do as good as I can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Alastair Himmer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RealD is Highest Grossing Platform Across 2D and 3D
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
RealD Inc. announced today that theatres outfitted with RealD 3D cinema systems
generated approximately $47 million of the total domestic box office for
Disney&#9679;Pixar`s "Toy Story 3," which opened #1 with an estimated total domestic
box office of $109 million. RealD-equipped theatres made up the weekend`s
highest grossing cinema platform, generating the majority of 3D box office and a
larger box office than all 2D screens combined. 

"RealD box office performance demonstrated that moviegoers of all ages
experienced the newest addition to the beloved `Toy Story` series in RealD 3D
more than any other platform," said Michael V. Lewis, chairman and CEO of RealD.
"We congratulate Disney&#9679;PIXAR on this record setting opening and wish them
continued success." 

In conjunction with the release of "Toy Story 3" RealD introduced kid-sized 3D
glasses in the USA and Canada. Sealed in individual packaging to ensure they are
sanitary and quality assured, kid-sized RealD 3D glasses are smaller versions of
standard RealD 3D glasses and designed to fit children 8 years of age and under.
Kid-sized RealD 3D glasses are also available in select international markets. 

"Toy Story 3" welcomes Woody (voice of Tom Hanks), Buzz (voice of Tim Allen) and
the whole gang back to the big screen as Andy prepares to depart for college and

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Drugmaker Pfizer Inc is pulling a decade-old leukemia medicine off the U.S. market after a study found a higher death rate and no benefit for patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mylotarg won approval under an abbreviated process to help bring treatments for serious diseases to patients more quickly. Medicines cleared in that way must pass follow-up tests to confirm they work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration said on Monday it asked Pfizer to withdraw the drug after a recent clinical trial raised new concerns about the product's safety and the drug "failed to demonstrate clinical benefit to patients enrolled in trials."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mylotarg's first-quarter sales were $8.8 million, making it a small product for the world's largest drugmaker. The company reported first quarter revenue of $16.8 billion. Pfizer acquired Mylotarg when it bought Wyeth in October 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it was voluntarily withdrawing the drug after a study showed adding Mylotarg to chemotherapy did not extend survival for patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive bone marrow cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are disappointed that the study did not confirm the clinical benefit of Mylotarg," Dr. Mace Rothenberg, a Pfizer senior vice president, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial also showed more deaths in the first couple months of treatment. The fatality rate was 5.7 percent for Mylotarg patients, compared with 1.4 percent without the drug, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mylotarg is the first drug approved under the FDA's abbreviated process to be withdrawn for failing to show effectiveness, agency officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The injectable drug was approved for treating certain patients age 60 and older with recurrent AML who were not candidates for other chemotherapy. Patients with AML have few treatment options and may die within months of a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA cleared Mylotarg for sale in 2000 on the basis of trials involving 142 AML patients. About one-quarter of patients saw their disease go into remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency required a follow-up study to confirm Mylotarg helped patients live longer. The trial started in 2004 and was stopped ahead of schedule last year when researchers saw no benefit and the higher death rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AML affects about 13,000 new patients in the United States each year. Fewer than 2,500 are treated with Mylotarg annually, Pfizer estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug will be withdrawn October 15, but Pfizer recommends that no new patients be prescribed it in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People already taking Mylotarg may continue their course of therapy after consulting with their doctors, the company said. Mylotarg is given in two doses typically two weeks apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the withdrawal, new patients can only be treated under an FDA process for testing of experimental drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mylotarg is sold in nine other countries. Pfizer will work with authorities there "to determine the best action forward," Rothenberg said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug was designed to be less toxic than other drugs by delivering cancer-killing effects straight to tumors, thereby minimizing damage to other cells and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no other medicines approved for treating relapsed AML. "The number one option for people with relapsed disease is a clinical trial" of an experimental medicine or a drug already sold for treating another disease, said Dr. Alison Walker, a hematologist and oncologist at The Ohio State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mylotarg's withdrawal "is an example of the need to support the scientifically-rigorous post-marketing capability of the FDA for long-term study" of risks and benefits from medicines, said Ryan Hohman, a spokesman for Friends of Cancer Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 0.7 percent to close at $15.10 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; editing by John Wallace and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law Office of Brodsky &amp; Smith, LLC Announces Class Action Against The Goldman
Sachs Group, Inc. -- GS

BALA CYNWYD, Pa., June 21, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Law Office of Brodsky &amp;
Smith, LLC announces a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York seeking to recover damages on behalf of purchasers
of the common stock of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) ("Goldman" or the
"Company") between February 6, 2007 and April 30, 2010, inclusive (the "Class
Period"). Goldman is a global investment banking and financial services firm
headquartered in New York City.

The Complaint alleges that Goldman and certain of its officers and directors
failed to disclose and misrepresented material adverse facts which were known,
or were recklessly disregarded, in connection with the marketing of synthetic
collateralized debt obligation ("CDO") and other products including, among
others, ABACUS 2007-AC1, by issuing materially misleading: (i) statements about
Goldman's client-focused business model, risk controls and business practices;
and (ii) statements made in an effort to downplay profits Goldman made from
shorting the housing market. Additionally, the defendants failed to reserve for
probable losses stemming from the Company's illicit actions, and thus
understated expenses and inflated Goldman's reported financial results. The
defendants also failed to disclose that the SEC had opened an investigation into
Goldman's activities since mid-2008.

If you purchased or acquired Goldman common stock during the Class Period, and
lost money on the transaction, you may wish to serve as the lead plaintiff. You
may, no later than June 25, 2010, request that the Court appoint you as the lead
plaintiff. A lead plaintiff is a representative that acts on behalf of other
class members throughout the litigation. To be appointed lead plaintiff, the
Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of
all class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the
class. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision
whether or not to serve as lead plaintiff. If you want to discuss your legal
rights, you may e-mail or call the law office of Brodsky &amp; Smith, LLC who will,
without obligation or cost to you, attempt to answer your questions. You may

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court said on Monday it would hear JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) appeal over a lawsuit accusing the bank of violating federal law by failing to notify credit card holders before raising interest rates due to late payments or defaults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lead plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit, James McCoy, had accused Chase Manhattan Bank of violating the Truth in Lending Act by raising interest rates retroactively to the beginning of his payment cycle after his account was closed after a late payment to Chase or another creditor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chase said that in its card member agreement, it disclosed the conditions that McCoy had to comply with to remain eligible for the lower interest rate, as well as the maximum interest rate that could apply if he violated those terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At issue is whether a federal regulation required notice when a creditor increased the rate on a credit card in response to a cardholder default and in accord with a contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in California dismissed the lawsuit, which was filed in 2006, but a federal appeals court reinstated it last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeals court ruled that McCoy can proceed with the lawsuit if Chase failed to notify him of the rate increase because of a delinquency or default, or if his card member contract did not spell out specific terms for an increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeals court said a Federal Reserve Board regulation required contemporaneous notice in cases of discretionary rate increases that occur because of a cardholder's default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed amended the regulation last year to require advance notice of 45 days for higher interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case during its upcoming term that begins in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by James Vicini.

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, Jun 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The latest analyst report by Goldman Small-Cap Research lists four
reasons why shares of Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE Amex: RNN)
continue to be a "buy" at current price levels.

    Rexahn recently hired Fred Frank, perhaps the most well known major
pharmaceutical industry banker over the last 25 years, as a consultant to
the company. BioMedReports is reporting that this development means the
company is getting close to final negotiations for licensing either or
both of their Phase IIb drugs, Zoraxel(TM) (sexual disfunction) and
Serdaxin(R) (for depression). Both drugs have tremendous breakthrough
potential and the company has publicly stated that they are actively
engaged in discussions with at least six different large pharmaceutical
companies.

    Wall Street believes the potential deal to be nearly $1 billion and to be
made up of milestone payments and double digit royalties with at least
$50 million upfront. Company officials have said they expect the deal to
be valued at 3 to 4 times the value of the current deal they have with
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries for an experimental cancer-fighting
compound, RX-3117, a small molecule, new chemical entity nucleoside
compound being developed by Rexahn for treating a broad range of cancers.

    That drug was only in the pre-clinical stages when it was licensed by
Teva, but the data was compelling enough to cause Teva to invest nearly
$4 million in Rexahn (at 20 percent over market), pay for all development
costs and to take on $200 million in milestone payments thus far. The
Zoraxel(TM) and Serdaxin(R) drugs are substantially further along in
development (Phase IIb versus preclinical). Teva is also expected to pay
a $4 million milestone payment when RX-3117 moves into Phase I in the
coming months. Company officials expect that event to take place during
the last quarter of this year according to BioMedReports.

&lt;p&gt;June 22 (Reuters) - Debt-ridden Japan Airlines Corp
JALFQ.PK will terminate a 10-year-old information technology
partnership with IBM Japan Ltd, as part of its cost-cutting
efforts, the Nikkei business daily reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The airline might buy IBM Japan's 51 percent stake in JAL
Information Technology Co for billions of yen to take charge of
business planning duties at the company and have more control
of system development, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The high costs associated with developing proprietary
systems through the joint venture have weighed on JAL's
earnings, the Nikkei said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JAL's group workforce is likely to increase by around 1,000
if JAL Information Technology becomes a subsidiary, but the
airline expects to save tens of billions of yen in costs over
the long haul, the paper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, JAL is unlikely to alter its goal of cutting
around 16,000 jobs in fiscal 2010, the daily said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though the main lenders are concerned that the move could
hamper JAL's streamlining efforts, the airline would seek their
understanding by playing up the savings expected from such
measures as adopting standard software and outsourcing
operations, the Nikkei said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The airline, now rebuilding after having filed for
bankruptcy protection earlier this year, will include these
cost-cutting measures in a rehabilitation plan being crafted.

&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones on Monday approved an order that gives Goldman until July 19 to file its answer to the lawsuit, filed in April by the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had been scheduled to file its initial response to the suit by today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the SEC and Goldman both asked the judge to approve the extension, which is not uncommon in civil litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order signed by the judge noted that Goldman bond salesmen Fabrice Tourre, the lone individual defendant named in the suit, previously had been given until July 19 to file his answer to the SEC fraud charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC contends that Goldman and Tourre misled institutional investors about some of the terms of a subprime mortgage-linked collateralized debt obligation called Abacus 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reported by Matthew Goldstein; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman now has until July 19 to respond to suit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman had been scheduled to file its response by today&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - A federal judge agreed to
give Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) more time to respond to a
lawsuit filed by U.S. securities regulators accusing the Wall
Street bank of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones on Monday approved an
order that gives Goldman until July 19 to file its answer to
the lawsuit, filed in April by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman had been scheduled to file its initial response to

approve the extension, which is not uncommon in civil
litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The order signed by the judge noted that Goldman bond
salesmen Fabrice Tourre, the lone individual defendant named in
the suit, previously had been given until July 19 to file his
answer to the SEC fraud charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC contends that Goldman and Tourre misled
institutional investors about some of the terms of a subprime
mortgage-linked collateralized debt obligation called Abacus
2007.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court rejected Pfizer Inc's appeal of a ruling that ordered a retrial on how much punitive damages should be awarded to a woman who developed breast cancer after taking the company's hormone replacement therapy drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in its appeal argued that a retrial limited to just punitive damages had violated its constitutional right to a jury trial and that the trial judge in the case had improperly admitted the testimony of a scientific expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Arkansas jury in 2008 sided with Donna Scroggin in her lawsuit against two Pfizer units -- Wyeth and Upjohn. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000, after taking hormone replacement therapy drugs for 11 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury awarded her compensatory damages of $2.7 million and punitive damages of $19.4 million against Wyeth, and $7.8 million against Upjohn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. appeals court upheld the jury's award of compensatory damages and said a federal judge had correctly set aside the punitive damages award against Upjohn as a matter of law. The appeals court ordered a new trial on punitive damages involving Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in its appeal opposed a partial retrial limited to punitive damages, saying it would lead to confusion and uncertainty for the jury and would be a denial of its right to a fair trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical company and legal groups supporting it said the appeals court should have ordered an entirely new trial. On Monday, the Supreme Court rejected the company's appeal without any comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002, the National Institutes of Health published the results of its study that linked the use of hormone replacement therapy to breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares were little changed at $15.19 in late morning trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In New York, Pfizer said it was disappointed by the court's decision not to hear the case, but said the plaintiff ultimately must prove that punitive damages are warranted against Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to believe that Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn acted responsibly by conducting or supporting more than 180 studies on hormone therapy's benefits and risks, keeping the U.S. Food and Drug Administration fully informed and providing proper, accurate and science-based information to patients and doctors," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it has prevailed in the vast majority of hormone therapy cases set for trial through a combination of rulings by judges, verdicts by juries, and dismissals by plaintiffs themselves to avoid going to trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Appeals court ruled lawsuit can go forward&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan Chase appealed to Supreme Court&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Federal Reserve changed the regulation on advance notice
 (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - The Supreme Court said on
Monday it would hear JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) appeal over
a lawsuit accusing the bank of violating federal law by failing
to notify credit card holders before raising interest rates due
to late payments or defaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lead plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit, James
McCoy, had accused Chase Manhattan Bank of violating the Truth
in Lending Act by raising interest rates retroactively to the
beginning of his payment cycle after his account was closed
after a late payment to Chase or another creditor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chase said that in its cardmember agreement, it disclosed
the conditions that McCoy had to comply with to remain eligible
for the lower interest rate, as well as the maximum interest
rate that could apply if he violated those terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At issue is whether a federal regulation required notice
when a creditor increased the rate on a credit card in response
to a cardholder default and in accord with a contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A federal judge in California dismissed the lawsuit, which
was filed in 2006, but a federal appeals court reinstated it
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The appeals court ruled that McCoy can proceed with the
lawsuit if Chase failed to notify him of the rate increase
because of a delinquency or default, or if his cardmember
contract did not spell out specific terms for an increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The appeals court said a Federal Reserve Board regulation
required contemporaneous notice in cases of discretionary rate
increases that occur because of a cardholder's default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fed amended the regulation last year to require advance
notice of 45 days for higher interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case during
its upcoming term that begins in October.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/f15b5f/vendor_focus_rec) has
announced the addition of the "Vendor Focus - Recent IT Developments - Issue 5,
2010" report to their offering. 

These Vendor Focus reports keep you up to date on the latest developments in the
IT market 

In this edition, we look at a collection of 9 Vendor Focus - Recent IT
Developments in May 2010 

1. CA World 2010 Mainframe Announcements: Customer-Driven Innovation Shapes the
Future of Mainframe Management 

This report centers around key announcements at CA World 2010 in the application
management space. Although there were multiple announcements related to
virtualization, Cloud, and mainframe, this report centers on the mainframe. It
is still the platform of choice for the majority of applications running in
today's mid- to enterprise-sized companies, and sorely in need of modernized
management products. 

Today's companies are well-aware that many mainframe specialists are nearing
retirement. The new generation of IT specialists largely lacks mainframe skills,
putting a host of critical applications at risk as baby boomers retire from the
workforce. CA's mainframe-related announcements address this problem with a
collaborative workspace, an installation/maintenance platform that reduces cost
of ownership by streamlining tools administration, and a modernized Graphical
User Interface (GUI). 

EMA sees CA's investments in the mainframe space as being clear differentiators
against competitors who have not invested in updating mainframe toolsets.
Discussions with customers indicate the new products are generating significant
interest within the mainframe community. 

2. HP Unifies Network Fault, Availability and Performance Management with NNMi9 

On April 21, 2010, HP Software announced a major upgrade to its network
management solutions offerings with the release of Network Node Manager i-Series
(NNMi) version 9.0. In parallel, HP released extensions and enhancements across
its full line of NNM Smart Plug In (iSPI) add-on modules, including the new iSPI
Performance for QA. HP also announced the availability of its Automated Network
Management solutions bundle, a combination of products which encompasses the
vast majority of network management functionalities required by todays network
engineering and operations practitioners. 

These new releases represent a major refresh across HPs network management
portfolio with a focus on unifying network fault, availability and performance
management while extending the solution with new features for dealing with
virtualized infrastructures. 

3. Integrating with the Cloud: IBM Acquires Cast Iron Systems 

IBM recently announced the acquisition of Cast Iron Systems, an application
integration vendor, for an undisclosed sum. The acquired company is a leader in
its respective space and well positioned with a product line spanning physical
and virtual appliances, as well as the cloud. Cast Iron Systems was one of the
first to market with connectors for cloud-based solutions such as Salesforce.com
and RightNow.com. This is high-demand functionality, since many IT organizations
are seeking to integrate cloud-based services with a variety of enterprise
applications. 

EMA sees this as a win for IBM and one that will provide additional traction in
the Small to Medium-sized Business (SMB) and enterprise cloud markets. However,
companies should be aware that this product does not replace, but rather
supplements, traditional Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) and Enterprise
Service Bus (ESB) products. 

4. What Terma Labs can Teach the Industry about Business Service Management 

The role of automation in service management is continuing to rise in importance
both with the ascendant interest in Cloud Services and virtualization, and with
the growing recognition that automation is central to enabling and solidifying
best practices across domains. Automation does this last in two respects: it
hardens processes into a more consistent workflow, but it also provides IT
professionals and managers with more time to focus on the dialogs and
value-oriented initiatives that are so central to business-aligned IT services. 

Within the automation pantheon, Workload Automation (WLA) too often gets
marginalized as a fairly well defined area with roots in job scheduling, despite
its pervasiveness and rapid ROI. The need to place WLA in context with larger
automation and service management capabilities is so far not well understood
both by the industry in general, and by many WLA vendors themselves. 

This report looks at WLA in that larger context and presents a true service
management vision of what WLA can and should become. The report also introduces
Terma Software Labs JAWS, as the only solution in the market today that
meaningfully bridges that gap, with both an eye to present integrations and
future possibilities as a unifying system for job automation from a service
impact perspective. 

5. CloudSleuth: An Independent, Open Approach to Cloud Performance Monitoring 

In April, 2010, beta availability was announced for CloudSleuth - an innovative
new open community focused on measuring and reporting the health and performance
of cloud service providers. CloudSleuth has been created as a collaborative
platform for developing best practices around cloud ecosystems while also
delivering an independent voice and viewpoint which can help IT organizations
select and monitor providers. The initiative has initially been conceived and
sponsored by Compuware and Gomez (a Compuware subsidiary) with the stated intent
to welcome any practitioners and technology providers who have an interest in
promoting the long-term reliability, predictability, and maturity of cloud
services. 

6. Microsoft Releases SQL Server 2008 R2 Aimed at Delivering Pervasive Insight 

The Microsoft Server 2008 R2 release brings new features and upgrades to the SQL
Server platform. The new offerings include Master Data Services, Complex Event
Processing and PowerPivot the free ad-on module that enables Excel to become an
application development tool and scale to millions of rows of data for more
powerful analytics. Coupled with other technologies in the Microsoft suite SQL
Server 2008 R2 makes significant strides towards enabling mass adoption of
business intelligence across the enterprise. 

7. SAS Delivers Enterprise Social Media Analytics 

SAS delivers Version 1.0 of their Enterprise Social Media Analytics. The
solution combines best of breed technologies from SASs data integration, web
analytics, text analytics, data mining and predictive analytics suites to
deliver insights into social media based conversations and communities. 

8. Infoblox Acquires Netcordia, Takes Aim at Network Infrastructure Automation 

On May 4, 2010, Infoblox announced it had closed the acquisition of Netcordia,
provider of the NetMRI family of advanced Network Change and Configuration
Management (NCCM) solutions. 

Infoblox, a leader in the DNS/DHCP/IPAM (DDI) sector, will keep the Netcordia
team intact and plans product integrations to advance the state of the art in
DDI solutions through improved discovery, compliance, and automation. Infoblox
will also introduce the NetMRI solution to their existing global customer and
channel base. This combination reflects the fact that DDI and NCCM, typically
parallel areas of concern and responsibility for the network engineering and
operations team, are converging around the need for broader network
infrastructure automation to effectively deal with the runaway rates of change
evoked by virtualization and cloud services. 

9. OpTier Announces Experience Manager Plus BTM Starter Edition 

In April of 2010, OpTier introduced a new product bundle combining OpTier
CoreFirst and OpTier Experience Manager. The combined products were introduced
to the market as Experience Manager Plus BTM (Business Transaction Management)
Starter Edition. Starter Edition provides a scaled-down BTM option for
medium-sized companies, or a departmental and/or 'try before you buy' path for
larger companies. The product bundle includes single licenses for OpTier
Experience Manager (end-user experience monitoring) and BTM Server (transaction
analytics), up to five dual-core licenses of CoreFirst for web servers (back-end
visibility), and ten days of deployment services. It supports up to 1,000
concurrent users. With this announcement, OpTier plans on extending its
distinctive transaction management offerings to companies in the Global 5000 or
smaller range. 

OpTier has had impressive success in the business transaction management market,
particularly in companies and industries with transaction-intensive
environments. This offering extends the company's considerable value proposition
to a new set of prospective customers, giving them the opportunity to build a
monitoring foundation that can be extended over time on an as-needed basis.

&lt;p&gt; * Would involve all the Spanish ports of Dragados-source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * ACS shares lose ground, up 1.2 pct &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds ACS no comment, shares, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BARCELONA, June 21 (Reuters) - A JPMorgan (JPM.N)
infrastructure fund deal to buy the Spanish ports of Dragados
SPL, a subsidiary of builder ACS (ACS.MC), could close at
between 700 to 800 million euros, subject to debt financing, a
source directly involved in the negotiations said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The enterprise value of the deal is between 700 to 800
million euros. What has to happen is that the sources of debt
financing have to sort out whether they are available or not,"
the source said on Monday, on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Obviously with the sovereign debt crisis giving banks in
Europe some difficulty, that question remains open," the source
said, adding that all of the Spanish ports of Dragados would be
included in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An ACS spokesman said the company could not immediately
comment. The company's shares were up 1.16 percent at 31.9 euros
at 1344 GMT, underperforming Spain's Ibex index of 35 blue-chip
companies .IBEX, and off from a day's high of 32.4 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ACS entered talks with JPMorgan last year to sell the ports
unit as part of a drive to cut down on its net debt pile,
equivalent to 6.3 times 2009 its core earnings, but concerns
over the state of world trade and Spain's financial woes have
prevented any deal from closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Although Dragados's Spanish port division includes several
ports, including those of Bilbao, Malaga and Las Palmas, sources
familar with the matter have previously told Reuters that a key
asset in the portfolio was the port of Valencia, which had
revenue of 114.3 million euros in 2008. [ID:nLDE61A2H0]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Infrastructure port deals have struggled in the financial
downturn. Last month a consortium of infrastructure funds said
it would not make a formal bid for Britain's only listed ports
company, Forth Ports FPT.L, citing economic uncertainty as a
reason for not improving on a 640 million pound approach.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court said
on Monday it rejected an appeal by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) of a
ruling that ordered a retrial on how much punitive damages
should be awarded to a woman who developed breast cancer after
taking the company's hormone replacement therapy drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer in its appeal argued that a retrial limited to just
punitive damages violated its jury trial rights protected by
the Constitution, and that the trial judge in the case had
improperly admitted the testimony of a scientific expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A jury in Arkansas in 2008 sided with Donna Scroggin in her
lawsuit against two Pfizer units -- Wyeth and Upjohn. She was
diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000, after taking hormone
replacement therapy drugs for 11 years.

materials, energy consumption and maintenance costs. 

Wind River Hypervisor was developed from the ground up to support real-time
system requirements and virtualization on single and multi-core processors, and
leverages Wind River`s deep expertise in advanced partitioning and safety and
security critical systems from the aerospace and defense and industrial and
medical sectors. With the addition of Windows XP as a guest operating system,
device and systems manufacturers serving the industrial and medical market
segments can integrate Windows XP alongside real-time operating systems into
their projects to deliver a broader set of capabilities and develop innovative
solutions to differentiate them from the competition. Examples include using
Windows XP to create a graphical user interface for patient monitoring consoles
or industrial control platforms while also implementing an RTOS to manage
sensors and control with real-time performance, determinism and high
reliability, both on the same physical single- or multi-core chip. 

"Wind River is seeing significant growth in embedded virtualization adoption,
among device and systems manufacturers," said Cory Bialowas, senior director of
product management for multi-core and virtualization at Wind River. "Embedded
virtualization creates compelling new opportunities for embedded designers,
paving the way for significant cost savings through consolidation, additional
feature content and greater performance when developing advanced single or
multi-core systems. With the addition of Windows XP support, we expect
accelerated adoption of embedded virtualization, especially in industrial and
medical markets, where rich user interfaces alongside a real-time operating
system are required." 

According to ARC Research Director Larry O`Brien, "Virtualization is finding
many adherents in the world of automation today because it has great potential
to reduce total cost of ownership. What Wind River is doing with embedded
virtualization, however, creates some unique opportunities that exist beyond the
current offerings of virtualizing desktop applications. Wind River is bringing
the world of virtualization into a realm where it can exist side by side with
real-time control applications. In many ways, this is unexplored territory with
many new possibilities to generate business value." 

With a long track record of delivering proven multi-core and embedded
virtualization technologies, Wind River`s solutions help customers reduce the
risk and costs associated with developing the complex embedded systems of
tomorrow. Wind River Hypervisor allows customers to adopt multi-core processors
using embedded virtualization technology with reduced risk and time-to-market.
To help customers manage the complexities that arise with multi-core software
development, Wind River offers a comprehensive suite of tools designed to
effectively develop, test and debug software and simulate systems in complex
multi-core environments. 

Separately, Wind River also announced the latest version of Wind River Tilcon
Graphics Suite, now with OpenGL 3D graphic support, an additional offering that
expands Wind River`s portfolio of vertical industry solutions. Additional detail
about Wind River Tilcon Graphics Suite 5.8 news is available at
www.windriver.com/news/press/pr.html?ID=8222. 

Availability

Windows XP support for Wind River Hypervisor will be available in July 2010 for
single and multi-core Intel platforms that support Intel`s virtualization
technology, VT-x. Additional details can be found at

&lt;p&gt;BARCELONA, June 21 (Reuters) - A JPMorgan (JPM.N)
infrastructure fund deal to buy the Spanish ports of Dragados
SPL, a subsidiary of builder ACS (ACS.MC), could close at
between 700 to 800 million euros, subject to debt financing, a
source directly involved in the negotiations said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The enterprise value of the deal is between 700 to 800
million euros. What has to happen is that the sources of debt
financing have to sort out whether they are available or not,"
the source said on Monday, on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Obviously with the sovereign debt crisis giving banks in
Europe some difficulty, that question remains open," the source
said, adding that all of the Spanish ports of Dragados would be
included in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ACS entered talks with JPMorgan last year to sell the ports
unit as part of a drive to cut down on its net debt pile,
equivalent to 6.3 times 2009 its core earnings, but concerns
over the state of world trade and Spain's financial woes have
prevented any deal from closing.

&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
Qchex.com has released Word-Check-FormTM check templates for Microsoft Word and
PDF-Check-FormTM check templates for Adobe Acrobat. These innovative check
templates allow millions of consumers and businesses nationwide a quick and
convenient means to create, print and/or deliver checks via email. Substantial
time and money is saved by expanding consumer and business choices to include
free email check delivery, avoiding the use of costly wire transfers, overnight
letters or other services with high per transaction fees. Word-Check-Form and
PDF-Check-Form can be downloaded for free via www.Qchex.com and allow users to
enter check book information for an unlimited number of bank accounts with
ultimate privacy and without any need to disclose sensitive financial and
personal information to third parties - a popular and risky data gathering
practice applied by electronic fund transfer providers that exposes consumers to
becoming ID theft victims. Once created in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat,
checks can immediately be printed at the desktop printer and/or delivered as a
regular PDF email attachment to the destination recipient. 

"Checks are the #1 non-cash payment method in the US with over 30 billion
transactions annually. Physical check transportation costs alone amount to an
estimated $30+ Billion annually. The convenience, ease of use and widespread
availability of Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat combined with free electronic
email transmission through major email service providers make a perfect platform
to move check delivery from the freeways and skies to the Internet. Now,
attaching and sending a check via email is as easy as sending a spreadsheet or
photograph," said James Danforth, President of iProlog Corporation, the creators
of the free check templates published on Qchex.com. 

"I would like to briefly comment on `safety.` The free and unrestricted access
to easy to use check templates makes clear to the public, that anyone can create
and send checks without verification and therefore it cannot be assumed that all
checks are valid. Checks are only as trustworthy as the parties involved in the
transaction. Fraudulent creation of a printed check CANNOT be prevented because
technology available to everyone has made check creation a trivial task. Clear
visibility of the obvious risks will allow the American public to develop a new,
more responsible relationship to check transactions and thereby take advantage
of more privacy protection and incredible savings by avoiding high fee
electronic alternatives. Harm from `check fraud` can become a matter of the
past, if the transaction parties are aware of risks and engage in
self-protecting, careful practices when agreeing on payment settlement by check.
We, as technicians, only provide the tools necessary for the public to enhance
user experience and help ensure checks meet layout and scanning standards
necessary for flawless processing through the automated check clearing system,"
said Thomas Villwock, Ph.D./CEO of iProlog Corporation, who continued in saying,
"An informed, mature audience will undoubtedly find the concept of self printing
checks intriguing and be more open to favoring paper checks over other more
expensive non-cash payment methods. We are positioned to help users make the
next step into more productive, integrated solutions, allowing the handling of
higher check volumes, business workflow needs, and expansion into mobile device
markets where check printing solutions are not yet well developed." 

In free user guides available at www.Qchex.com, visitors will find valuable
recommendations on how to best create and print checks to avoid processing
rejects and to achieve bank compliance. The new check templates demonstrate the
ease with which checks can be created and delivered electronically by a large
segment of the population without having to pay any fees for the service.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

JPMorgan to Buy Hedge Fund...Maybe

On Monday, the Financial Times reported that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE: JPM) is
undergoing preliminary negotiations to acquire a large Brazilian investment and
hedge fund with G&#225;vea Investimentos. The company is going ahead with the talks
despite the fact that the impending Volcker Rule will limit the participation of
U.S. banks in such activities. The Volcker Rule would restrict banks from making
speculative investments like investing in a hedge fund and private equity if
these are not on behalf of their customers. 

JPMorgan's plan to move ahead with the discussions reflects its confidence that
the Volcker Rule will not stop the banks from buying and owning hedge funds.
However, the deal has not been finalized and could still fall apart. 

The language of the proposed Volcker Rule regulation, which is expected to be
discussed later this week, is vague and some interpret it as regulation that
would disallow banks to own hedge funds and private equity. However, JPMorgan
and other major U.S. banks like Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC), Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) believe that they could
be allowed to keep these high risk activities, provided they do not invest their
own money into them. 

However, JPMorgan is awaiting the details of the reforms before finalizing the
deal with G&#225;vea. The deal could be finalized as early as next month, if talks
are successful. 

G&#225;vea is an independent asset management company with $5.3 billion in assets and
is regulated by the Brazilian Central Bank and the Comiss&#227;o de Valores
Mobili&#225;rios (equivalent to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S.). 

JPMorgan's asset management segment will get a boost in revenue base with the
addition of G&#225;vea. The company has already completed the acquisition of
Highbridge Capital Management (alternative investment management firm) in June
2009 and One Equity Partners (a private equity business) in 2004. 

While expanding its geographic presence to enter emerging markets globally in
recent weeks, JPMorgan has announced its foray into the Chinese market through a
joint venture with First Capital and has received the approval from European
Union (EU) to acquire Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc's (NYSE: RBS) non-U.S.
commodities joint venture RBS Sempra Commodities LLP for $1.7 billion. 

JPMorgan continues to diversify its business and expects to enhance its revenue
base and market share. The proposed acquisition of G&#225;vea will further strengthen
the company's existing business strategy. 

While we anticipate continued synergies from JPMorgan's diversification and
strong capital position, stressed credit quality and reduced levels of client
activity is expected to drag future earnings. However, we are impressed to see
some improvement in credit quality during the last couple of quarters.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Electronic Arts in Deal With Gaika

Video game manufacturer and publisher Electronic Arts Inc. (Nasdaq: ERTS)
recently signed a multi-year deal with online video streaming company Gaikai
Inc. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 

Gaikai, a privately held company owned by venture capital firms Benchmark
Capital, TriplePoint Capital and Rustic Canyon Partners, among others, allows
users to play major PC and console games through its server based cloud
computing technology without any downloading or installation. 

Users can have easy access through any standard Web browser that supports Flash
and Java, without any special hardware or extra computing power. 

This deal will provide worldwide game players access to Electronic Arts titles
such as The SimsT, Medal of Honor, Need for Speed and other titles straight to
any Web browser. 

The gaming industry is going through a major transition. With the advent of
smartphones, the iPad, the iPhone and PDAs, buying and installing games and
applications have become quite simple for the gamers. 

According to a research firm, eMerketer, the total number of mobile Internet
users is expected to reach 134 million by 2013 as a result of increasing usage
of smartphones. 

According to another research firm, DFC Intelligence, the mobile gaming industry
is expected to grow to $11.7 billion by 2014. The iPhone alone is estimated to
constitute 24% of the total gaming software sales. 

Similarly, casual games on social networking sites such as Facebook have added
millions of users by making it hassle free to start playing instantly. The
success of online and social gaming is anticipated to have a major impact on
gaming companies, as they prepare themselves to transition to Internet-based
gaming as compared with the conventional gaming. 

We believe Electronic Arts with the help of this deal will bring that same ease
of use to traditional console and PC games. The deal is expected to boost
audience participation at a lower cost for Electronic Arts titles, as Gaikai`s
streaming technology eliminates the need for excessive online marketing. 

Electronic Arts faces stiff competition from Activison Blizzard (Nasdaq: ATVI),
Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (Nasdaq: TTWO) and privately held Sony Online
Entertainment LLC. 

We have a neutral recommendation on Electronic Arts. 

Chevron Signs Project in Russia

U.S oil major Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Russia`s top oil producer Rosneft joined
hands for the development of a Russian oil field in the Black Sea. The agreement
involves future exploration activity intended for Rosneft's Shatsky Ridge
off-shore license, covering an area of approximately 3,300 square miles in the
Black Sea. 

The deal was signed by Rosneft President Sergey Bogdanchikov and Chevron CEO
John Watson in the presence of Russia`s Prime-Minister Putin and Rosneft
Chairman and First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin. 

Both companies have settled for a $1 billion initial investment in the
exploration project. However, with the success of the exploration program, the
total cost of the project may rise to $32 billion. Chevron is expected to
finance the initial exploration activities, including seismic surveys and
exploration drilling. The drilling of the first exploration well is scheduled by
the end of 2011. 

Initial research identified 10 potential hydrocarbon structures in the area, of
which 5 are promising as they contain approximately 80% of the license area's
resources, or approximately 860 million tons of oil. 

The venture is Russia`s largest energy deal in 2010 involving foreign
collaboration and is Chevron's major foray into the Russian market since the
failed attempt to buy a stake in the now defunct oil firm YUKOS in 2003. 

Chevron management is confident about the success of the project and looks
forward to receiving tax benefits for the field from the Russian government.
Shatsky Ridge, being a highly prospective area, is vulnerable to environmental
hazards and high costs. Hence, management hopes to work together with the
government so that the financial terms are fulfilled to ensure rapid development
of the project. 

Medco Forms European JV

Medco Health Solutions (NYSE: MHS) and German Based pharmaceutical distribution
company Celesio AG have formed a joint venture to combine their operations in
Europe with the aim to improve patient health and lower healthcare-related
costs. 

This is significant since an aging population and rising healthcare costs have
raised healthcare spending in many European countries to 10% of national GDP. 

The joint venture, which is expected to be operational in Germany in 2010, will
target patients suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, asthma,
high-cholesterol and heart disease. Subsequently, operations will spread to the
major European markets of UK, France, Spain and Italy. Gradually, the joint
venture plans to include all 27 EU member states along with Switzerland and
Norway. 

Regular monitoring of patients is necessary since proper care at early stages of
the disease saves on hospitalization expenses. It has been observed that in the
US, more than half of all patients do not follow their prescribed therapy within
the first year of treatment. The situation is similar in Europe where costs of
poor patient compliance are quite high at &#8364;200-300 billion per year. The joint
venture is obviously a welcome move since rising healthcare costs is a problem
in almost every country. 

The joint venture is an important step forward for Medco, which is one of the
leading pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the US. An aging population coupled
with higher incidence of chronic diseases continues to drive demand and add to
the escalating cost of new drug therapies. As a result, we expect the outlook
for the PBM industry to remain positive. Medco, being the nation`s largest
mail-order pharmacy operation, is therefore well positioned to benefit from both
favorable demographic trends and increasing acceptance of more efficient mail
order and Internet-related distribution channels. 

We have a Neutral recommendation on the stock.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Pier 1 Tops Expectation

Pier 1 Imports Inc. (NYSE: PIR) recently reported fiscal 2011 first-quarter net
income of $7.7 million, compared to $29.3 million in the prior-year quarter.
Earnings per share came in at 7 cents, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate at a
loss of 2 cents, but well below the year-ago earnings of 32 cents per share. The
year-over-year decline was primarily caused by a $47.8 million gain on debt
repayment in the year-ago period. 

During the quarter, Pier 1 recorded an 8.9% growth in net sales to $306.3
million from $281.1 million in the year-ago period. The increase was mainly
attributable to a 14.3% growth in comparable store sales, partially offset by
the net closure of 23 stores over the past year. The company exited the quarter
with 1,050 stores, including 971 stores in the U.S. and 79 stores in Canada. 

Gross profit in the quarter rose by 34.9% year-over-year to $114.4 million,
while gross margin expanded 720 basis points (bps) to 37.4%. The strong
expansion was primarily driven by reduced clearance activity and vendor and
supply chain costs, as well as lower occupancy costs due to reduced store count
and rentals in existing stores. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter fell 4.3%
year-over-year to $101.1 million, primarily as a result of reduced lease
termination costs. However, higher top-line and robust growth in gross margin
more than offset the increase in operating expenses. Consequently, Pier 1 swung
to an operating income of $8.3 million, compared to an operating loss of $26.7
million in the prior year quarter. 

Pier 1 ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $204.8 million,
compared to $135.8 million in the year-ago quarter. During the quarter, the
company generated $10.3 million from operating activities, received $10.6
million from disposal of properties and deployed $6.3 million towards capital
expenditure. 

Looking ahead, Pier 1 continues to expect opening 3 to 5 stores and shuttering
10 to 15 underperforming stores in fiscal 2011. Moreover, the company plans to
utilize $25 million towards capital expenditure in the fiscal year, which would
largely be funded from operating cash. 

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Pier 1's fiscal year ending February 2011 is
currently 52 cents per share, which has moved up 7 cents over the past month as
5 of 6 covering analysts raised expectations. For the next fiscal year, the
Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped 7 cents over the past month to 68 cents per
share, as 3 of 6 covering analysts lifted projections. 

Lockheed Targets Missile Defense

Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) recently teamed up with Alaska Aerospace Corp.
intending to win the U.S. Missile Defense Agency's Ground-Based Midcourse
Defense (GMD) Development and Sustainment Contract. The Ground-Based Midcourse
Defense (GMD) program uses land-based missiles to intercept incoming ballistic
missiles. 

This is a chance for Lockheed Martin to win back the contract that was awarded
to Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) in 1998. Boeing, however, was mainly responsible for
system development work. Subsequently, the Missile Defense Agency decided to
combine system development and operations &amp; sustainment work for GMD into a
single contract. As a result, the Missile Defense Agency on May 14, 2010 issued
an amended draft request for proposals. The agency will issue a final request
for proposals this summer and award the five-year contract in 2011. Conservative
estimates put the total value of the contract to approximately $3 billion. 

Lockheed Martin along with Alaska Aerospace will have a better chance at winning
the contract with their proven experience. The GMD Development and Sustainment
Contract will entail development, manufacturing, test, training, operations and
sustainment support. Alaska Aerospace would take care of the operations and
maintenance services. 

Lockheed Martin is a world leader in systems integration and development of air
and missile defense systems and technologies, including the first operational
hit-to-kill missile. The company makes significant contributions to most major
U.S. missile defense systems and is a part of several global missile defense
programs. 

Headquartered in Anchorage, Alaska, Alaska Aerospace Corporation provides
satellite launch and missile defense services. The State of Alaska established
the corporation in 1991 to stimulate the growth of the high-technology aerospace
industry. 

Headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin is a global security
company and is principally engaged in the research, design, development,
manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems,
products and services. 

Lockheed Martin remains a key player within the military space and continues to
benefit from strong defense spending. The company's customer base includes the
U.S. government, foreign governments and other commercial buyers. Lockheed's
traditional defense focus appears strong, with increasing interest from domestic
and international customers. 

We currently have a long-term "Neutral" recommendation on the Lockheed Martin
stock. 

CVS, Walgreen Reach Agreement

Recently, CVS Caremark (NYSE: CVS) and Walgreens (NYSE: WAG) reached an
agreement under which Walgreens will participate in CVS` pharmacy benefit
management (PBM) plan. However, financial terms of the new contract were not
disclosed. 

Earlier this month, Walgreens, with more than 7,500 drugstores, had announced
that it will not serve as a pharmacy provider for any new and renewed
prescription drug plan awarded to CVS` PBM segment. At the end of the March
quarter, CVS had approximately 7000 retail drug stores. 

The settlement of the issue is positive for both CVS and Walgreens as severance
of ties would have hampered their revenue growth. Moreover, many patients who
fill their prescriptions at Walgreens would have suffered. 

This is all the more significant for CVS since it is likely to benefit in the
long term from healthcare reform, which is likely to include more than 32
million people under the insurance bracket. Since PBM is aimed at lowering
health care costs over the long term, increased coverage would benefit the
company. 

The reform has eliminated the tax advantage enjoyed by employers related to
Retiree Drug Subsidy (RDS) from 2013. This subsidy was let out so that it could
act as an incentive for employers to keep offering drug coverage rather than
shifting the retirees to Medicare Part D. Although changes are expected to
appear gradually, CVS is well positioned to help its clients in determining the
future roadmap. 

CVS Caremark`s retail growth is based on geographic expansion, while improving
operations through efficient product and cost management initiatives. Expansion
has been achieved through the construction of new stores and through
acquisitions. The company`s strong balance sheet bodes well for acquisitions in
addition to rewarding shareholders in the form of share repurchases and regular
dividends.

Zacks.com Analyst Blog features: Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C),

Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) and MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA).

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Lobbying Charges Shrink for Visa

On Friday, Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) reported that it spent $1.12 million during the
first quarter 2010 on issues related to credit card regulations. The lobbying
charges were down 27% from the $1.54 million spent during the first quarter of
2009 and declined 30% from $1.6 million spent in the fourth quarter of 2009. 

Visa lobbied Congress, the Federal Reserve System and Federal Trade Commission
for multiple issues such as credit card regulations, fees charged to merchants
for accepting card payments and the creation of a consumer protection agency. 

The credit card regulations were enforced by The Credit Card Accountability,
Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, known as the CARD Act, which was
passed by Congress on May 22, 2009. It included several provisions aimed at
regulating the fees levied on customers by credit card companies such as Visa. 

This financial reform restricts Visa and its peer group from raising interest
rates on existing balances, and caps the late payment fee at $25 and the penalty
fees charged by them. In contrast, it provides credit card users with more time
to pay their monthly bills, regular advance notice of changes in credit card
terms and the right to opt out of significant changes in terms of their
accounts. 

Visa also lobbied for the interchange fees that card issuers charge merchants
for using the card. This forms a major component of card issuers' revenues. 

The Act aims at protecting the average consumer. However, we believe that this
law is expected to eat into the profits of major card issuers such as Citigroup
Inc (NYSE: C), Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:
JPM), as issuing credit now at a rate suited to customers` risk will be a
complex process. 

Additionally, the Act is expected to make credit cards costlier and inaccessible
for low-income families and consumers with bad credit. Also, the CARD Act`s
restrictions on finance charges and fees have resulted in reduced interest
income and loan fee income. This is expected to put continuous downward pressure
on the yield of Visa and its peer group with the implementation of the CARD Act,
which partly started on February 22, with the rest expected to take effect from
August, 2010. 

In addition to Visa, Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) spent $220,000 in
advocacy costs and MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) spent $820,000 in the
first quarter to lobby the federal government for Wall Street reform and
consumer protection legislation. In addition, the Consumer Bankers Association
spent $390,000 lobbying the federal government in the first quarter for the
financial overhaul legislation and on measures affecting credit cards, mortgage
lending, student loans, overdrafts on checking accounts and data privacy.

</body></entry><entry author="None" date="2010-06-22T18:05:33+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/idgSmallBusiness/idUS141278886120100622"><headline>IBM courts finance market with new framework</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;IBM unveiled on Tuesday a new package of pre-integrated software applications, called the Financial Markets Industry Framework, configured for the financial services market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package is designed for financial firms, such as a Wall Street stock trading company, that want to speed their processes, said Guy Tagliavia, who is IBM's director of Websphere front office and low latency messaging, part of the software group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's all about speed. The key is to get this market data to the algorithmic trading applications as fast as possible," Tagliavia said. The industry is driving the speed of message transfer between two systems down to a matter of a few microseconds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The framework is the latest addition to a growing number of pre-integrated packages that IBM has created for specific industries. The company has already developed frameworks for the fields of health care, petroleum, retail and government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's WebSphere application server will serve as the cornerstone of the offering. The framework will be able to ingest feeds from over 100 data feeds. A stream computing platform can then filter these feeds to look for specific events, or triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The framework will also offer market surveillance and trade monitoring software, using IBM's Cognos business intelligence software, its iLog business rules management software and other applications. Over time, more applications, both from IBM as well as from partners, will be folded into the framework, Tagliavia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the financial market, companies are fiercely competitive, and use software to gain an edge, Tagliavia said. "The financial market is constantly evolving. It is extremely dynamic: There is an arms race in this industry where customers are seeking the latest and greatest technology," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies may renew their systems in as little as every two years. IBM is making the pitch that its platform, through its enterprise service bus, is easily extensible, and so can easily accommodate upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The framework can be built on either commodity servers running x86-based processors, or run on IBM's own System P Power-based servers. IBM could install the framework or it could be installed by other integrators, Tagliavia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joab Jackson covers enterpise software and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

&lt;p&gt;  LAKE BUENA VISTA, FL, Jun 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Resort, a leader in Orlando hotels
and individual hotel technology, has introduced Apple's iPad into its
sales function. This innovative new technology will now accompany sales
professionals during meeting planner site visits, serving as a useful
tool to help planners more thoroughly evaluate the property's 329,000
square feet of meeting space. As an added bonus, planners can also take
home a free iPad after their site visit. 

    Meeting planners can tour the property with a sales team member equipped
with an iPad. While on the tour, planners will be able to view diagrams
and dimensions of meeting space, photos and menus of the restaurants, a
map of the property, lists of amenities at the Swan and Dolphin Orlando
hotels and much more from any location on property. 

    Planners on site visits presenting an RFP for 500 room nights or more can
receive complimentary use of the iPad for the duration of their stay.
Those who contract the meeting will get to keep their iPad and can
receive another for every additional 500 room nights booked. 

    "Apple's iPad provides us with the perfect means to access resort images,
diagrams and information remotely during a site visit," said Eric Opron,
director of sales and marketing for the 2,265-room resort. "This is a
major benefit to a planner viewing a property of our size and scope, and
is also useful when viewing a space being utilized in a different
configuration by another group."

    The resort's technology team has developed a customized iPad application
which offers simple-touch screen navigation for several categories of
information including: arrival details, guest room configurations,
meeting space layouts, restaurant overviews, hotel amenities, Disney
services and information on partner companies available for
sub-contracting needs. 

    The Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Resort is a nationally respected
and recognized leader in the convention resort arena. One of the most
ideally located hotels near Disney, situated in the heart of Walt Disney
World Resort, the resort offers 2,265 Orlando hotel rooms and over
329,000 square feet of meeting space and award-winning banquets and
catering services.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/e12d83/technology_sector) has
announced the addition of the "Technology Sector " report to their offering. 

The technology sector in the US includes more than 140,000 companies with
combined annual revenue of about $900 billion. Major companies include AT,
IBM, Intel, and Microsoft. Industry concentration is high in many segments: the
largest 50 participants often generate more than 60 percent of segment revenue. 

The technology sector includes telecommunications, IT services, semiconductor
manufacturing, software, Internet services, biotechnology, and scientific
research, including aerospace research. Related manufacturing industries covered
in separate profiles include aerospace products and parts, computer hardware,
pharmaceuticals, and telecommunications equipment. 

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

Demand often depends on the income of consumers or the profitability of business
customers, because many technology products and services are expensive. The
profitability of individual companies is driven by their ability to develop and
market new products. Large companies often have advantages in access to capital
and marketing. Small companies can compete successfully if they have expertise
in a particular field of knowledge. The industry is capital-intensive: average
annual revenue per worker is nearly $300,000. 

PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS &amp; TECHNOLOGY 

Companies in the technology sector take advantage of scientific discoveries and
turn them into marketable products. Of the several distinct fields within the
technology sector, most are based on computer technology. Even biotech and
aerospace rely heavily on computers.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) reshuffled three top executives, including its chief financial officer, as part of an effort to ensure a deep bench of executives who could eventually succeed CEO Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. bank by assets said on Tuesday that it had replaced Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh with Doug Braunstein, the company's head of investment banking for the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh, CFO since 2004, will become the bank's chief executive of treasury and securities services, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shuffle is part of the bank's effort to broaden the experience of its executives, Dimon said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It follows a reorganization in September, when the bank named former asset management head Jes Staley as chief executive of its investment bank in a promotion that was widely seen as anointing him a frontrunner to succeed Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 54, has been CEO of JPMorgan since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh is now getting a chance to show what he can do in a line position, said Gary Townsend, chief executive of Hill-Townsend Capital. Cavanagh was chief administrative officer of the commercial bank at Bank One in 2004 when it combined with JPMorgan. He then headed middle market banking before becoming CFO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's very young still and (the move) certainly doesn't hurt his prospects," said Townsend. Cavanagh, who has also in the past been tipped to replace Dimon, is 44, while Staley is 53.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury and securities services is an important business in the bank and one that JPMorgan likely wants to develop, added Nancy Bush, analyst at NAB Research. "Treasury services is underdeveloped there for a bank of their size and prominence," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is certainly not the profit-driver that the investment bank has been lately for JPMorgan. In the first quarter, the investment bank reported net income of $2.5 billion, up from $1.6 billion a year earlier, helped by a pickup in trading revenue and scooping up advisory business from rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braunstein, 49, worked on JPMorgan's 2008 acquisitions of troubled investment bank Bear Stearns Cos and failed Seattle thrift Washington Mutual Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with other JPMorgan investment banking heads globally, he has helped the bank rise in the rankings for advisory business -- as well as debt and equity underwriting -- during the financial crisis. In the first quarter, JPMorgan was ranked fourth by global mergers and acquisitions deal value, behind Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh now replaces Heidi Miller, who was named to a newly created role as president of international business. In this role, Miller will be responsible for boosting JPMorgan's businesses outside of the United States, with a focus on finding opportunities in emerging markets and speeding up the bank's expansion in China, Brazil, India and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller will chair a new international operating committee made up of the bank's senior business heads globally, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braunstein will also join the bank's operating committee.

Heidi Miller Named President of International; Michael Cavanagh Appointed CEO of
Treasury &amp; Securities Services; Doug Braunstein Named Chief Financial Officer
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today announced new responsibilities for three
members of its senior leadership team:

* Heidi Miller, head of Treasury &amp; Securities Services (TSS), has been named
President of International. 
* Michael Cavanagh, Chief Financial Officer, will succeed Ms. Miller as Chief
Executive Officer of TSS. 
* Doug Braunstein, head of Investment Banking, Americas, will succeed Mr.
Cavanagh as Chief Financial Officer.

"Over the years at JPMorgan Chase we have worked hard to build a highly talented
senior management team," said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO. "In developing
great leaders and building a strong company, we focus on continually broadening
the experience of our executives and working to deploy their talents and
expertise across the organization. Our firm has developed an excellent
management bench, and today`s moves reflect our goal of building on our team`s
experience and providing them with new opportunities to make our company even
better." 

As part of today`s announcement, the company has created the new role of
President of International. JPMorgan Chase has built a world-class international
banking franchise, but the company believes prospects for further growth in all
of our businesses outside the United States are significant. This important new
role will augment - not replace -- business lines around the world, helping them
accelerate and prioritize their efforts and their investments for growth. 

Working with her senior colleagues, Ms. Miller will develop a comprehensive and
coordinated international business strategy and growth plan - ensuring that the
company identifies opportunities for growth all over the world; accelerates its
expansion in countries like China, Brazil, India, and Russia; seeks out
opportunities in other emerging economies; properly resources and governs lines
of business and functions; continues the build-out of local branches; and cuts
out any bureaucracy and inefficiencies. 

Ms. Miller will take the lead in further expanding our global Corporate Bank,
managing it in close coordination with Investment Bank CEO Jes Staley as well as
with TSS Head Mike Cavanagh. As part of her new responsibilities, Ms. Miller
will also chair a newly formed International Operating Committee, consisting of
the firm`s senior global leaders, and she will focus on growing our
international branches across lines of business. 

Jamie Dimon said, "The breadth and depth of Heidi`s international business and
leadership expertise are virtually unmatched in our industry, and I`m very
excited about her taking on this important new role." Regarding her new
responsibilities, Ms. Miller added, "JPMorgan Chase is uniquely positioned for
extraordinary success and growth globally if we work together and execute well,
and I`m very fortunate to be leading this effort." 

Mike Cavanagh, who has been the company`s Chief Financial Officer since 2004,
will become CEO of the TSS business. As CFO, Mr. Cavanagh provided broad
leadership throughout the company`s major merger integration efforts, and he
played a key role in helping the company successfully navigate the financial
crisis over the past few years. 

"Mike Cavanagh has done an outstanding job as CFO of our company and has built
one of the most respected financial teams in banking," said Jamie Dimon, adding,
"Mike is well-suited to build on Heidi`s success as the new head of TSS, one of
our six major businesses." 

Mr. Cavanagh said, "I am grateful for the opportunity I`ve had to be CFO of
JPMorgan Chase through such interesting and tumultuous times, and I want to
thank all of my Finance colleagues for their hard work and support over the past
six years. At the same time, I couldn`t be more excited about the opportunity to
succeed Heidi in leading our TSS business, and I look forward to building upon
her success." 

Doug Braunstein, who has served as head of Investment Banking for the Americas,
will become Chief Financial Officer and a member of the firm-wide Operating
Committee. Prior to heading Investment Banking, Americas, Mr. Braunstein served
in a number of senior Investment Banking roles, including as head of Global
Mergers and Acquisitions. He has been a member of the firm`s Executive Committee
since 2005. 

"Doug is a tremendous leader and has helped build our leading client franchise
within the Investment Bank over the past decade. I`m very proud of the talent we
have developed at our firm, and it`s great news that we have someone with Doug`s
exceptional client experience, seniority and seasoned financial thinking to take
on the critical role of CFO," Dimon said. 

Mr. Braunstein added, "I am truly honored to take on this important role. I am
committed to working closely with our entire Operating Committee to continue to
maintain our fortress balance sheet, including our focus on risk management,
capital strength and liquidity, strong loan-loss reserves, and clear and
transparent reporting and accounting." 

The company will shortly announce a successor to Mr. Braunstein as head of
Investment Banking, Americas.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN MATEO, CA, Jun 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IntelePeer Inc. (http://www.intelepeer.com/), a leader in the delivery of
communications via cloud-based infrastructure, today announced a
partnership with GeniSys Global
(http://www.genisysglobal.com/services-unified-communications.php) to
provide hosted Microsoft Unified Communications (UC) solutions utilizing
IntelePeer's cloud-based Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) network
infrastructure.

solution that combines IntelePeer's SIP trunking services with Microsoft
Office Communications Server (OCS) 2007 Release 2 (R2), Microsoft
Exchange and Microsoft Sharepoint, delivered as on-demand services for
business customers. 

    "Our fully hosted and managed unified communications services help
businesses realize significant cost savings while unlocking huge
productivity gains by giving their employees seamless access to
everything they need to communicate and collaborate, wherever they are,"
said David Spears, CEO of GeniSys Global. "With SIP trunks from
IntelePeer, we can roll out high-quality Microsoft UC connections and
services in days, without the disruption and delays they would face from
other service providers." 

    Using IntelePeer, GeniSys Global offers a complete suite of Microsoft UC
services delivered via SIP trunks, including local, long-distance and
international calls, Direct inward dialing (DID) connections, toll-free
phone numbers, number porting, directory listings and caller ID. As a
Microsoft Certified Gold Partner, GeniSys has developed a unique,
multi-tenant Secure Cloud hosting platform to deliver a single-sourced
Microsoft UC solution that can be deployed in their facilities, at the
customer premise, or by other hosting providers as a white label
solution. In addition, GeniSys provides flexible pricing terms based on
monthly subscriptions so the service offering can be completely adapted
to deliver the features and services to suit each business customer, at a
cost that fits individual budget needs.

    "GeniSys has used our capabilities to create a unique hosted Microsoft
OCS solution that supports multi-tenancy and partitioned services over a
shared, cloud-based infrastructure, which gives them tremendous service
flexibility," said Margaret Norton, general manager, Enterprise for

advanced network infrastructure, IntelePeer delivers carrier-quality
service over public or private Internet Protocol (IP) connections,
sparing customers from the need to change their current data provider or
existing communications equipment.

us make great products." 

TRON: Legacy Toy Line

Every product in Disney`s TRON: Legacy toy line lights up and is designed to

4 &amp; up).

they both light up. The Deluxe model features launching projectiles, tri-color
light changes, pop-up air brakes (pop-up blasters on the Light Runner) and

TRON Zero Gravity Light Cycle: The TRON Zero Gravity Light Cycle features
six-foot light-emitting trails and legendary Air Hogs technology allowing the
vehicle to be driven on a wall or even upside down. Includes controller (SRP
$34.99, ages 8 &amp; up).

Disney`s TRON: Legacy electronics line is designed to appeal to discerning
gamers and audiophiles who seek out products that offer high quality and
innovative design. Key licensees include Monster, PDP and Razer. 

TRON Headphones, iPod Dock from Monster: DCP and Monster, a leading manufacturer
of high-performance headphones and A/V accessories, have collaborated to bring
the ultimate set of headphones designed for the TRON fan, music enthusiasts and
serious gamers. The new TRON Headphones capture the design aesthetic of the
world of TRON. The Monster Tron T1 over-ear headphones feature Advanced Noise
Suppression Technology and ControlTalk, which enables easy and clear hands-free
calling (SRP $349.99). The Monster/Disney Tron line will also feature an iPod
dock inspired by the iconic data disk from TRON: Legacy ($249.99) and high
quality in-ear headphones that will feature ControlTalk Universal and
crystal-clear Monster Headphone signature sound technology ($99.99).

peripherals from Razer include: an ergonomic gaming mouse incorporating Razer`s
5600dpi 3.5g gaming grade sensor, a gaming keyboard with programmable keys and
macro capabilities as well as a detachable keypad, and a high precision mouse
mat - all designed to create the ultimate gaming experience featuring highly
detailed finishes and lighting effects. The product line will range in price
from SRP $79-139. 

TRON Game Controllers and Apple Accessories from PDP: Unique multiplatform TRON
game controllers from PDP bring the look and feel of TRON: Legacy directly into
the hands of gamers with light-up accents, perforated details and
performance-enhancing contours and design. Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
controllers are corded with precision parts and vibration support; the Wii
controller is wireless. Available in tandem with the TRON: Evolution video game
release, the SRP for each is $49.99. PDP will also offer a line of iPod, iPhone
and iPad cases inspired by the world of TRON.

and accessories for men and women, publishing and the new TRON: Evolution video

About TRON: Legacy

TRON: Legacy is a 3D high-tech adventure set in a digital world that`s unlike
anything ever captured on the big screen. Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), a
rebellious 27-year-old, is haunted by the mysterious disappearance of his father
Kevin Flynn (Oscar- and Golden Globe-winner Jeff Bridges), a man once known as
the world`s leading video-game developer. When Sam investigates a strange signal
sent from the old Flynn`s Arcade-a signal that could only come from his
father-he finds himself pulled into a digital world where Kevin has been trapped
for 20 years. With the help of the fearless warrior Quorra (Olivia Wilde),
father and son embark on a life-or-death journey across a visually-stunning
cyber universe-a universe created by Kevin himself that has become far more
advanced with never-before-imagined vehicles, weapons, landscapes and a ruthless
villain who will stop at nothing to prevent their escape. Presented in Disney
Digital 3D and scored by Grammy Award-winning electronic music duo Daft Punk,
TRON: Legacy hits U.S. theaters on Dec. 17, 2010 in Disney Digital 3D and IMAX
3D.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Jun 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SPYRUS, Inc. today announced that their Hydra Privacy Card(R) (Hydra
PC(TM)) Personal Encryption Device has acquired additional approval by
the US National Security Agency (NSA) for protecting data at rest when
used with a PC running Microsoft Windows 7. 

    The patented Hydra PC Personal Encryption Device was the first and is
still the only commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) USB encryption device
approved to protect tactical data in accordance with CNSS Instruction
4009 at the SECRET level and below, when used with the approved
operational security doctrine. 

    The Hydra PC Personal Encryption Device is validated to FIPS 140-2 Level
3, and exceeds the new security requirements recently issued by the US
Department of Defense (DoD) on the Joint Task Force Global Network
Operations (JTF-GNO) Computer Task Order (CTO) for encrypted flash drives
approved for use on DoD networks.

    Need more storage? Insert a microSD card from any source. Because the
security is built into the base unit, the Hydra PC Personal Encryption
Device offers infinite memory expandability. Without the base unit to
decrypt it, the encrypted information is fully protected even if the card
is moved to a generic card reader or to a different Personal Encryption
Device.

    The Hydra PC Personal Encryption Device, like its big brother the Hydra
PC Digital Attache, protects your data no matter where it is stored -- on
the drive, on your PC, or in the cloud, because every file is encrypted
with a unique AES-256 bit CBC key. Think of it like a bank vault with
individual safe deposit boxes.

    Both Hydra PC devices offer secure data containment by limiting the use
of a specific device to administrator-authorized computers within a
defined security domain, preventing both removal of sensitive data and
unauthorized access to the Hydra PC or its data, and blocking the use of
non-approved "rogue" USB storage devices. Even with the correct password,
the encrypted data cannot be decrypted outside of the security domain. 

    The Hydra PC Digital Attache adds the capability to securely share
encrypted files and the removable micoSD memory with other designated
Hydra PC Digital Attache devices. No other encrypting drive has this
capability.

    A third member of the Hydra Privacy Card family is the Kingston
DataTraveler(R) 5000 Secured By SPYRUS(TM). Designed as a high-security
replacement for conventional secure flash drives from IronKey, MXI, and
SanDisk, this device can be used on any PC.

    Hydra PC devices protect your data with advanced hardware security by
drawing upon XTS-AES 256, AES 256 CBC, ECDH, ECDSA, ECC P-384, and
SHA-384, which make up the National Security Agency's Suite B
cryptography.

    "Once again, we are extremely proud to have worked closely with NSA to
qualify the commercial Hydra Privacy Card Personal Encryption Device for
use on the latest operating systems to safeguard tactical data at the
SECRET level," said Tom Dickens, SPYRUS Chief Operating Officer. "Because
we know that one size does not fit all, we offer a family of USB
encryption drives. Whether you need a works-anywhere secure encrypting
drive like the Kingston DataTraveler 5000, want to move classified data
between systems, or need to share data among a group of authorized users,
we have a solution for you, all based on the same hardware security
platform. Since that platform is secure enough to protect classified
data, it's more than secure enough to protect commercially sensitive or
personally identifiable data."

    The Hydra Privacy Card Personal Encryption Device and other Secured by
SPYRUS(TM) USB encryption devices can be ordered through several
government contracts. Email sales@spyrus.com for more information.

    About SPYRUS, Inc. 
 SPYRUS holds patents in the U.S. and abroad that
enable solutions for secure authentication, secure communication, and
full disk encryption, as well as patents relating to data protection and

    The National Security Agency's USB Flash Drive Program has developed
specifications for physically transferring SECRET data between secure
enclaves. SPYRUS, Inc. asserts that the Hydra PC meets NSA's USB Flash
Drive specifications, documented in the "Universal Serial Bus (USB) Flash
Drive Personal Token for Tactical SECRET Minimum Essential Requirements
1.0," and as such, is acceptable for use in national security systems.

&lt;p&gt; * Tanezumab osteoarthritis trials halted immediately&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Some patients worsened, needed joint replacement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * FDA requested trials suspension&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer shares down 0.8 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst, Pfizer comment, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Berkrot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said it suspended
clinical trials of its experimental biotech arthritis drug,
tanezumab, at the request of U.S. health regulators after some
patients taking the medicine experienced a worsening of their
condition that required joint replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The worldwide suspension of the clinical osteoarthritis
program is effective immediately, Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The announcement was the latest in a long list of setbacks
for the world's biggest drugmaker, which has been stung by
criticism it has been unable to develop important new medicines
on its own, despite an annual research and development budget
in excess of $7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The clinical hold includes both suspension of recruitment
of new patients and of the dosing of existing patients in the
osteoarthritis program, as well as patients with osteoarthritis
in other tanezumab studies, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The halt comes less than a week after Pfizer presented
positive tanezumab data at a European medical meeting showing
it significantly reduced knee pain better than a placebo in
patients with osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tanezumab, which is administered by infusion every eight
weeks and works by blocking a protein called nerve growth
factor that is associated with pain, has the potential to
become the first biotechnology drug specifically for pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several injectable biotechnology medicines are used to
treat rheumatoid arthritis, a potentially crippling immune
system disorder. More traditional oral pain killers, such as
aspirin, ibuprofen and Pfizer's own Celebrex, are typically
used to treat osteoarthritis, which is damage to the joints
caused by wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The worsening seen in a small number of osteoarthritis
patients leading to surgery has so far not been observed in
non-osteoarthritis patients taking tanezumab, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which requested the
arthritis trials program halt, has asked Pfizer to present its
assessment of the potential implications of the adverse events
for the other tanezumab clinical programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug is also being tested as a treatment for cancer
pain, interstitial cystitis, chronic low back pain and
diabetic nerve pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think it's definitely over for this product, but
this is a potential big red flag for some of those other
indications," said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover, who
added it is often difficult to get pain drugs approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer is trying to produce lucrative new drugs that can
help replace lost revenue when its $12 billion a year
cholesterol fighter Lipitor goes off patent late next year.
Branded drugs quickly lose 80 percent or more of their sales
once faced with competition from cheap generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company bought smaller rival Wyeth for $67 billion last
year in large part to gain control of its vaccines and
promising pipeline of drugs in development as a hedge against
the loss of Lipitor revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer executives had expressed excitement about
tanezumab's potential only last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe this drug will ultimately prove itself to be
superior to existing therapies for osteoarthritis," Mark Brown,
who is heading up the drug's arthritis clinical development
program for Pfizer and presented the data last week, had said
in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it is working with the FDA to determine the
appropriate course of action for the drug going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The company is coordinating closely with regulatory
authorities and investigators to implement the clinical hold in
the osteoarthritis studies and for patients with
osteoarthritis in the chronic pain program," Pfizer spokesman
MacKay Jimeson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares were down less than 1 percent to $14.75 in
extended trading from their New York Stock Exchange close at
$14.88.

&lt;p&gt;EAST FISHKILL, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
IBM (NYSE: IBM), Samsung Electronics, Co., Ltd., GLOBALFOUNDRIES and
STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM) said today that the four companies are
collaborating to synchronize semiconductor manufacturing facilities for the
production of advanced chips based on 28nm process jointly developed by IBM
Technology Alliance. 

The synchronization process helps ensure that customers` chip designs can be
produced at multiple sources in three different continents with no redesign
required. The technology alliance, based at IBM`s facility in East Fishkill, New
York, includes GLOBALFOUNDRIES, IBM, Infineon Technologies, Renesas Electronics,
Samsung Electronics, STMicroelectronics and Toshiba. 

IBM, Samsung and GLOBALFOUNDRIES - members of the Common Platform alliance - are
working with STMicroelectronics to develop and standardize advanced, 28nm
process technology to ensure consistent production worldwide for electronics and
device manufacturers. 

The low-power, 28nm process technology is designed for the next generation of
smart mobile devices, enabling designs with faster processing speeds, smaller
feature sizes, low standby power and longer battery life. The 28nm process
technology is slated to become the foundation for a new generation of portable
electronics that are capable of handling streaming video, data, voice, social
networking and mobile commerce applications. 

The 28-nanometer chips will use bulk complementary metal oxide semiconductor
(CMOS), and high-k metal gate (HKMG) processes. Members of the alliance are
driving the global standard for HKMG with their unique "Gate First" technology.
The approach is superior to other HKMG solutions in both scalability and
manufacturability, offering a smaller die size and compatibility with design
elements and process flows from previous technology nodes. 

"IBM has extensive experience synchronizing multiple fabs, where we match
rigorous manufacturing specifications to critical design parameters," said Gary
Patton, vice president for IBM's Semiconductor Research and Development Center.
"The result is that our advanced technology can be implemented in many fabs
around the world and produce the same results, providing clients with multiple
suppliers for their product designs." 

"Samsung has done extensive fab synchronization work with Chartered and IBM in
the past and welcomes the expansion of this activity with GLOBALFOUNDRIES and
STMicroelectronics at 28nm. We expect our customers will gain significant
benefits in accelerated time to volume production and assurance of supply from
the synergy of this collaboration," said Jay Min, vice president, Samsung
Electronics` Foundry business. 

"Today`s announcement is further proof of the importance of collaboration to
enabling advanced technology foundry innovation," said Suresh Venkatesan, vice
president of alliance technology development at GLOBALFOUNDRIES. "Along with our
partners in the Common Platform alliance, we are committed to delivering to
customers a robust 28nm technology implementation that breaks new ground in
performance and power efficiency. By collaborating to align production
capabilities we provide customers with maximum flexibility in foundry selection
at the leading edge." 

The members of the Common Platform alliance and STMicroelectronics will optimize
the processes and tooling at all the respective manufacturing lines, or fabs, to
ensure the chip designs can be produced with the same functional and electrical
results at each of the companies. 

"ST`s work with the Common Platform alliance continues our longstanding
tradition of partnering with leaders for the benefit of our customers and the
development of the 28nm low-power technology is yet another success," said Joel
Hartmann, Technology R Group VP and General Manager Advanced CMOS, Derivatives
and eNVM technology, STMicroelectronics. "We are working to make this technology
available to our customers for portable, consumer, computer-peripheral and other
applications as soon as possible and will extend its capabilities through the
use of application-specific CMOS-derivative technologies." 

The companies have released common 28nm circuits in their respective facilities
to enable the synchronization. Details such as transistor performance are being
measured, benchmarked and optimized across the fabs. The first fab to complete
synchronization of the 28nm low-power technology process is targeted for late
2010, with product introduction to follow soon after. 

The Common Platform alliance has been collaborating with ARM and Synopsys on the
development of a comprehensive 32/28nm Systems-on-a-Chip (SoCs) design platform
based on HKMG technology. ARM has developed an intellectual property (IP)
portfolio integrating leading edge HKMG process technology with ARM advanced
microprocessor cores and physical IP including logic, memory and interface
products for distribution to their customers. Synopsys has developed a 32/28nm
optimized design enablement solution, IP, design tools and methodology optimized
for the alliance`s HKMG technology. 

"The early parallel 32nm development work between ARM and the Common Platform
alliance leverages our respective industry-leading expertise in processor IP,
physical IP and technology development," said Simon Segars, executive vice
president and general manager, ARM, Physical IP division. "This collaboration
coupled with the fab synch announced today will facilitate design scaling and
accelerate the market availability of next generation mobile devices with
unmatched performance, outstanding battery life and reduced cost." 

"Synopsys has worked closely with IBM and its technology alliance on common IP
ports, design tools and flow enablement, including silicon validation at 90nm,
65nm and 45nm at IBM, Samsung, GLOBALFOUNDRIES (formerly Chartered) fabs and
continues at 32/28nm," said John Chilton, Senior Vice President &amp; Strategic
Development at Synopsys. "The Galaxy-enabled production flow in Lynx and
supporting DesignWare Interface IP for Common Platform`s 28nm HKMG process
combined with this new four-way 28nm fab manufacturing synchronization offering,
will provide our customers with the ultimate design choice, coupled with
multi-source chip production flexibility for their next-generation consumer
devices."

&lt;p&gt;The Pomerantz Firm Charges Goldman Sachs (GS) With Securities Fraud On Behalf of
Bond and Note Investors

NEW YORK, June 23, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz Haudek Grossman &amp; Gross
LLP (www.pomerantzlaw.com) ("Pomerantz") is filing a class action lawsuit in the
United States District Court, Southern District of New York, against The Goldman
Sachs Group, Inc. ("Goldman" or the "Company") (NYSE:GS) and certain of its top
officers and directors. The class action was filed on behalf of persons who
purchased or otherwise acquired Goldman notes and/or bonds. The Complaint
alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Currently, class action complaints have
been filed in federal court in New York with the longest operative Class Period
of December 14, 2006 and June 9, 2010.

The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants issued
materially false and misleading statements regarding Goldman's business model
and reasons for Goldman's business success during the Class Period. Goldman also
failed to disclose its receipt of a Wells notice from the SEC in July 2009
indicating that charges against the Company were probable. As a result of
Defendants' false statements, Goldman's securities traded at artificially
inflated prices during the Class Period. After revelations of Defendants' fraud,
the price of the Company's securities declined significantly from its Class
Period high.

If you are a shareholder who purchased the securities of Goldman during the
Class Period, you have until June 25, 2010 to ask the Court to appoint you as
lead plaintiff for the class. Shareholders outside the United States may join
the action, regardless of where they live or which exchange was used to purchase
the securities. A copy of the complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com.

U.S. Bank Failures Rise to 83

U.S. regulators on Friday shuttered Reno, Nevada-based Nevada Security Bank,
pushing up U.S. bank failures to 83 so far in 2010. This compares with a total
number of 140 bank failures in 2009, 25 in 2008 and only 3 in 2007. 

Although the economy is showing signs of a gradual recovery with the
stabilization of large financial institutions, tumbling home prices, soaring
loan defaults and a high unemployment rate continue to impact small banks. 

While we expect the overall economic recovery to gain momentum soon, lingering
concerns remain in the banking industry. Failure of both residential and
commercial real estate loans as a result of the credit crisis has hurt banks. As
the industry absorbs bad loans made during the credit explosion, the trouble in
the banking system goes even deeper, increasing the possibility of more bank
failures. 

Nevada Security Bank had total assets of about $480.3 million and total deposits
of about $479.8 million. 

The recent failure represents another blow to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation`s (FDIC) fund meant for protecting customer accounts, as it has been
appointed receiver for the bank. 

When a bank fails, the FDIC reimburses customers for their deposits of up to
$250,000 per account. The outbreak of bank failures has significantly stretched
the regulator`s deposit insurance fund. However, the FDIC has about $66 billion
in cash and securities available in reserve to cover losses arising from bank
failures. Also, the FDIC has access to the Treasury Department`s credit line of
up to $500 billion. 

The failure of Nevada Security Bank is expected to cost the federal deposit
insurance fund (DIF) about $80.9 million. 

Roseburg, Oregon-based Umpqua Bank will assume all of the deposits and assets of
Nevada Security Bank. The FDIC entered into a loss sharing agreement with Umpqua
Bank for $368.2 million of Nevada Security Bank`s loans and other assets. 

In the first quarter of 2010, the number of banks on the FDIC's list of problem
institutions grew to 775 from 702 in the fourth quarter of 2009. This is the
highest since the savings and loan crisis in the early 1990s. 

Following the worst part of the economic downturn, the banking industry`s
profits soared during the first quarter of 2010. However, this was primarily led
by the big banks, while small banks remained strained by deteriorating credit
conditions. 

Increasing loan losses on commercial real estate are expected to cause hundreds
more bank failures in the next few years. The FDIC anticipates bank failures to
cost about $100 billion over the next three years. 

The failure of Washington Mutual in 2008 was the largest in the U.S. banking
history. WaMu was acquired by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). The other major
acquirers of failed institutions since 2008 include Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq:
FITB), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), Zions Bancorp (Nasdaq: ZION), SunTrust Banks
(NYSE: STI) and PNC Financial (NYSE: PNC).

&lt;p&gt;FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Entelos, Inc. announced today that it has agreed to the terms of a non-exclusive
perpetual license to its Metabolism Physiolab platform for Pfizer Inc. The
perpetual license will include access for Pfizer to Entelos` PhysioLab Modeler
software and its PhysioLab Simulation Server. 

Entelos` Metabolism PhysioLab combines physiology and individual behavior to
support research on two metabolic disorders whose incidence continues to
increase worldwide-obesity and diabetes. Through its scientific and technical
staff and patented technologies, Entelos provides its customers, such as Pfizer,
with expert knowledge in these areas. The Metabolism PhysioLab platform
reproduces many of the behaviors and underlying biological attributes of
metabolism in diverse patient types. Entelos` "virtual patients" are used for
testing a compound or target`s efficacy in the platform, individually or in
combination with other targets, compounds or the current standards of care. Due
to the vast heterogeneity of these diseases, virtual patients have been created
that span the disease continuum and progression, from lean, insulin-sensitive to
severely obese, type 2 diabetes. 

The expanded license terms will further advance the translation of Pfizer`s
preclinical data to clinical response, integrate and guide experimental work
which may lead to an improved quantitative understanding of target and disease
mechanisms, and provide a platform for assessing different combination
strategies to support partnering and competitive differentiation strategies. 

"Pfizer has been one of our most ardent supporters over the years, both as a key
customer and as an early investor" said Julie Thomas Goggin, Entelos` Chief
Executive Officer. "We are thrilled that our highly predictive, established
Metabolism Physiolab platform will be available to Pfizer on a perpetual basis
to help accelerate its compound development. We look forward to continuing to
expand our long-standing and successful relationship with such an important and
valued stakeholder."

&lt;p&gt;Infor will be relying on Microsoft technology for the next generation of its line of ERP (enterprise resource planning) products, in the wake of a deal the companies announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Infor and Microsoft already had a partnership, the new announcement takes the relationship much further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's SharePoint collaboration product will serve as a foundation for "portal based, unified interfaces for all Infor applications," Infor said in a statement. The vendor will also use Microsoft's Silverlight RIA (rich Internet application) platform; Microsoft Reporting Services for BI (business intelligence); and Microsoft Single Sign-On for identity management. It has also named SQL Server and Windows Server as its "preferred" infrastructure components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privately held Infor is one of the world's largest ERP vendors after Oracle and SAP, with reported revenues in the neighborhood of US$2 billion. It has grown through a long series of acquisitions, most notably the 2006 deal for SSA Global.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the new Microsoft partnership will help Infor develop products faster and standardize its product line, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, using more Microsoft technology helps Infor position itself as an easy-to-migrate alternative to Redmond's own Dynamics family of ERP applications, as well as help link ERP with desktop applications, said 451 Group analyst China Martens via e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of other manufacturing-oriented ERP vendors, such as Consona and Epicor, also have products based on Microsoft, Martens added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's picked up some manufacturing-focused technology, but not going as deep as some of the more manufacturing-focused ERP vendors," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a another announcement Wednesday, Infor announced ION, a new set of software services for integrating data from Infor and other applications. ION will be used to build out reports and analytics that surface ERP data through SharePoint, Infor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Kanaracus covers enterprise software and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co will release three 3D movies to IMAX Corp theaters in 2011, including the next "Pirates of the Caribbean" film, under an agreement between the two companies revealed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VIENNA (Reuters) - The world's $88 billion cocaine market is shifting toward Europe and is severely destabilizing transit countries in West Africa even as total production falls, a United Nations report said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift in demand has altered trafficking routes, with more cocaine flowing from Andean countries to Europe via Africa rather than to the United States, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is causing regional instability," the UNODC said in its wide-ranging annual World Drug Report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People snorting coke in Europe are killing the pristine forests of the Andean countries and corrupting governments in West Africa," UNODC Executive Director Antonio Maria Costa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of cocaine users in Europe has doubled in the last decade and the market is now worth $34 billion, almost as much as that in North America, the world's biggest consumer of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe's around 4 million cocaine users consumed about one quarter of global production in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World cocaine production has fallen 12-18 percent in the past three years and the North American market is shrinking thanks in part to police crackdowns in producer Colombia and transit corridor Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's other main "problem drug," heroin, is also seeing a decline in production and will continue to do so, the report said, citing expected declines in crop yields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran and Turkey had done well to tackle the heroin flow out of Afghanistan, which produces most of the world's supply, but Russia, Central Asian and Balkan countries had performed poorly, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the two main substances are seeing declines, overall abuse has risen in developing countries, many of which lack the means to treat their addicts properly, the UNODC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More West Africans are taking cocaine as the drug passes through their countries on the way to the larger European market and more people in East Africa are taking heroin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will not solve the world drugs problem by shifting consumption from the developed to the developing world," Costa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Alex Lawler and Peter Graff)&lt;/p&gt;

Inc.'s ("Visa") June 14, 2010 "Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a

defendants to answer."

&lt;p&gt; * Disney to release three 3D films to IMAX in 2011&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * 3D boom has helped drive box-office growth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, June 23 (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N)
will release three 3D movies to IMAX Corp (IMX.TO) theaters in
2011, including the next "Pirates of the Caribbean" film, under
an agreement between the two companies revealed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chuck Viane, president of distribution for Disney, said in
a statement the recent performance of the studio's movies in
IMAX theaters has "demonstrated that the combination of IMAX
and Disney resonates with moviegoers worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movies covered under the new agreement are "Pirates of
the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides" with Johnny Depp and Penelope
Cruz; the animated "Mars Needs Moms" with voice work from Seth
Green and John Cusack; and the Disney/Pixar cartoon "Cars 2."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IMAX has emerged as a major player in 3D exhibition, taking
advantage of an audience appetite for a more in-depth visual
experience that has helped drive box office growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Toy Story 3," Disney's latest 3D release from its Pixar
animation division, played in more than 4,000 theaters in the
United States and Canada when it opened this past weekend. Of
those, 180 were IMAX theaters, which contributed $8.4 million
to the film's overall gross of $110 million.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Four days after U.S. securities regulators charged Goldman Sachs Group with civil fraud, Ash Williams, the top administrator for Florida's $138 billion in public investments, wanted to talk to someone at the Wall Street firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he didn't want to speak to just anyone. He asked specifically for Gary Cohn, Goldman's president and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein's top lieutenant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams got his wish. Cohn, whose firm manages $2.7 billion of Florida's investments, called soon after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former hedge fund manager, Williams would not discuss the substance of the call. But he said the conversation eased any lingering concerns he had over the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was very pleased," said Williams, executive director of the Florida State Board of Administration. "If it were me in that same situation, that is what I would have done. It is a good policy, when times are tough, to talk to your clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Goldman with civil fraud over the packaging and sale of a subprime-mortgage linked security, Blankfein and Cohn have been working overtime to save the storied franchise from the worst blow to its reputation in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's top brass, along with other executives, are scurrying around the globe to meet with jittery corporate clients. They are holding phone calls with anxious customers and taking hedge fund trading partners out to sushi lunches, all in a bid to prevent business from going to one of its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm has already taken some hits. Goldman didn't make the cut as a lead underwriter on a $300 million initial public offering for consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, said people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Carlyle Group, the private equity firm which acquired Booz Allen in a $2.54 billion buyout, was worried about the public perception of Goldman leading an IPO for a company with close ties to the U.S. Department of Defense. Instead, Carlyle, whose vice chairman of global buyouts is a Goldman alum, went with Morgan Stanley and Barclays to lead the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to comment for this story. A Carlyle spokesman said the private equity firm had no comment on the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rightly or wrongly, Goldman Sachs has become a symbol of a pernicious Wall Street, a firm that helped create -- and then profited from -- the subprime meltdown. For more than a year, it has been trying to fend off populist outrage, but the tin ear of its leaders to the pain the financial crisis has caused on Main Street has often made matters worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is also facing a spate of shareholder lawsuits stemming from the big plunge in its stock in the wake of the SEC lawsuit over the Abacus 2007 collateralized debt obligation. The firm has lost $25 billion in market value since regulators charged Goldman with failing to disclose that a hedge fund client had helped package the Abacus CDO and was betting on the security's collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, an Australian hedge fund that lost money on another controversial subprime-mortgage linked security called Timberwolf -- which Goldman arranged and was betting against -- is suing the firm for $1 billion in damages. A now defunct hedge fund sponsored by Carlyle also lost money in the Timberwolf CDO, said people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE RED CARPET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Goldman continues to be among the most profitable financial companies in the world. Determining just how big an impact Goldman's political and regulatory woes are having on clients, particularly corporate ones, is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One investment banker with another big Wall Street firm said he is working on an upcoming IPO for a company that likely would have tapped Goldman to manage the deal if not for the SEC lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any lost advising or underwriting work comes at an inopportune time for Goldman. The financial crisis has forced it and other big Wall Street banks to look further down market for deals in a quest for fees and to remain near the top of all-important league rankings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, for instance, is underwriting far smaller stock offerings than it has in the past. So far this year, the average Goldman-led IPO has raised $218 million, compared with $685 million a decade ago, according to data complied by Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And since the SEC filed its lawsuit, the average IPO underwritten by Goldman has shrunk even more. The three offerings that Goldman has brought to market in June have raised on average $189 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dwindling size of IPOs is no doubt a reflection of diminished appetite for stock offerings in the aftermath of the financial crisis. But for Goldman to go scraping for small deals is not what one would expect for a firm that in the past routinely turned away business from mid-market clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FULL COURT PRESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full court press Blankfein, Cohn  Co. are putting on clients and customers to stick with the firm appears for the most part to be working. Even with its down market moves, Goldman continues to rank at the top of the charts when it comes to advising on corporate mergers or stock and bond offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the thousands of hedge funds that rely on Goldman's prime brokerage operation for loans and executing trades are showing few signs they will bolt to other firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Goldman, the toughest sells have been public pension funds or companies with strong ties to the government that don't want to be seen to be in bed with the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters has learned that the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest U.S. public pension fund, has decided not to use Goldman as a real estate investment adviser after the Wall Street firm did not disclose that it was facing potential SEC charges when bidding for the contract in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The run-in with the SEC is reinforcing the perception that Goldman -- despite claims to the contrary -- sometimes puts its own interests ahead of its clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even supporters say the allegation merely confirms what they've long suspected --- that Goldman is no more or less self-interested than any other Wall Street investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The allegations have caused some to question whether Goldman's clients still come first, as the firm's vaunted 14 guiding business principles suggest they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is the smartest guy out there, but it doesn't seem to be bound by any ethical guidelines, at least that we can see," said Michael Vogelzang, the chief investment officer at Boston Advisors, a $1.7 billion money manager, which owns shares of Goldman. "The individuals there are great. We love working with our contacts. But it is very frustrating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's a sentiment that more than a dozen clients and customers expressed in recent conversations, although none would comment on the record. And it's one reason Goldman finds itself on the defensive not only with regulators but with some of its most valued clients as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN TLC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, soon after the SEC charged Goldman, the firm quickly moved to patch things up with Paulson  Co. Goldman had arranged the now controversial Abacus 2007 CDO that is at the center of the SEC's fraud case for the benefit of that giant hedge fund, run by John Paulson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Paulson's $30 billion fund hasn't been charged by regulators, its name has been somewhat muddied. A person close to Paulson said a Goldman official called within days of the SEC lawsuit to make it clear that the firm didn't have any problem with the hedge fund and would like to continue doing business with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds in general have been the recipients of the extra personal touch Goldman executives have been demonstrating lately. Traders said they've noticed that Goldman's prime brokerage operation, which provides loans to hedge funds and executes trades for funds, is going out of its way of late to show clients the firm cares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUSHI LUNCHES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hedge fund trader whose firm uses Goldman as a prime broker said a Goldman executive called a few days after the SEC lawsuit and offered to treat some of the fund's trading team to a sushi lunch. Other fund customers have been similarly feted, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides wining and dining, Goldman's prime brokerage teams are sending out regular updates on the firm's response to the SEC lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hedge fund that a year ago turned down Goldman for a prime brokerage assignment was recently contacted again by the Wall Street firm to see if it would reconsider. A person close to the hedge fund, who declined to be identified, said the incident was surprising since Goldman rarely comes back begging for business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the SEC announced its charges, Blankfein and Cohn also have participated in conference calls with wealthy clients, reassuring them about the direction of the firm. Cohn, for instance, took part in a June 16 call with Goldman's wealth management customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former Goldman partner, who left the firm more than a decade ago but still advises a number of Goldman clients, said the firm's sudden TLC is a clear response to the SEC lawsuit and the pounding the firm suffered during an especially harsh hearing on Capitol Hill in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everything Goldman is doing now is related to the lawsuit," the former partner said. "It is about brand identity and preserving the brand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"BETTER BEHAVED"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A constant refrain from Goldman clients, even ones who are more wary of the firm now, is that to stop doing business with the Goldman out of principle or fear of getting taken advantage of would be foolish. The clients said the firm's ability to get deals done, even in the most difficult of market environments, makes it hard to put Goldman on any do-not-call list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why one European hedge fund manager, despite having qualms about how Goldman treats its clients, said he's still giving serious consideration to hiring the firm as a prime broker for a new fund. The manager said it's hard to overlook Goldman's unrivaled ability to bring quality deals and trading opportunities to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, he figures the SEC suit should serve to humble the firm a bit. "Well, they will probably be a little better behaved for the next few years as a result of everything," the manager said. "And they still have the best capital introduction in the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLITICAL HOT POTATO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for some, the cost of doing business with Goldman, at least right now, is simply too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firms that got billions of dollars in the U.S. government's bailout of the banking industry have been among the corporate clients that are steering clear of Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Goldman itself got a $10 billion bailout, which it repaid in 2009. But it's been criticized for profiting from the massive taxpayer assistance to American International Group Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-standing relationship between the insurer and Goldman now appears strained. AIG CEO Robert Benmosche said last month that AIG was reviewing its dealings with Goldman. And the firm recently canceled a plan to hire Goldman for restructuring advice, instead turning to Citigroup Inc and Bank of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad Hintz, a former Morgan Stanley treasurer and an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said Goldman's battered name is making it easier for vulnerable clients -- ones facing political pressure -- to take a pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a decision maker for any client, if you are under pressure, your response will be to pull away to the extent you can without hurting yourself," Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTERNATIONAL AFFAIR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the news spread that Goldman was facing fraud charges, rivals across the world seized on it as an opportunity to move in on some of the firm's prestigious clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, investment bankers lobbied executives at state-owned Agricultural Bank of China to drop Goldman as an underwriter for its more than $20 billion IPO. But the Chinese bank rebuffed those efforts and decided to keep Goldman as part of the underwriting team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the advisory side, I suppose it is conceivable for someone to say they are bunch of bad guys because the SEC is suing them, but I don't think it is hurting their franchise," said one corporate attorney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clients in places like London are fully aware of what Goldman is facing, but say they are continuing to do business with the firm because they know what to expect. "What you get when you work with Goldman is a well-oiled process," Novexel SA Chief Executive Iain Buchanan told Reuters in a telephone interview. "That brings comfort not just to management but also to investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman recently advised Novexel on its sale to British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc, a 352 million euro deal that closed in March. Based in a Paris suburb, the firm develops antibiotics to combat treatment-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buchanan said bankers from Goldman, which had previously helped Novexel evaluate an initial public offering, were available "24-7". "You have a team of people who can do a lot of heavy lifting in a short space of time. It didn't matter whether it was 3, 4 o'clock in the morning -- there was a Goldman BlackBerry whizzing in the night," Buchanan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SLIGHTLY WOUNDED"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the surface, Goldman's woes should be a boon to competitors. But it is not so simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street also has a what goes around, comes around culture, an etiquette that deters big firms from poaching clients when the going gets tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, chief rivals like Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase  Co are unlikely to raise Goldman's problems when they are making sales pitches to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, of course, clients often raise Goldman's issues unprompted, especially when they are considering using them on a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, bankers from Goldman and Jefferies Group, a mid-sized investment bank, advised Valeant on its $3.3 billion sale to drugmaker Biovail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jefferies Chief Executive Richard Handler, in an interview, said it is often difficult to tell why clients pick one firm over another for advising work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a very competitive business," Handler said. "Even larger competitors that are even slightly wounded, given what's going on, are still formidable competitors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOVERNMENT TIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For government and other public clients, there are political ramifications for doing business with Goldman that now come into play. Perhaps that's why Cohn, Goldman's president, was so quick to respond to Ash Williams and the Florida system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said Cohn asserted that Goldman had done nothing wrong and was trying to be as "transparent" as possible with its clients about the SEC case. After talking to Cohn, Williams said he saw no need for the state to look elsewhere for a Wall Street money manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclosure concerns, however, have already landed Goldman in hot water with one major pension fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 16, Calpers notified Goldman that it would not use the firm in its pool of real estate investment consultants, according to a document obtained by Reuters. The pension fund's decision came after officials there said they planned to question Goldman about its failure to disclose that it was facing an investigation from the SEC when bidding for the contract in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC served Goldman with a so-called Wells Notice last September, signaling potential charges, which the firm did not mention in its March bid for the Calpers contract. Goldman has maintained that it was not required to publicly disclose the notice it received from the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calpers also has a brokerage relationship with Goldman and there is no indication that will change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other pension funds are keeping a closing eye on Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System voted in April to put Goldman Sachs Asset Management "on alert" for 90 days as it reviewed the fraud allegations against the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in May, the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority cut its ties with Goldman, which had served as its financial adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"OUR CLIENTS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evolving from its partnership culture, Goldman has always been seen as secretive, so the disclosure concerns were less surprising to some in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has been harder to swallow for some former Goldman executives is a shift in culture that shortchanges clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Goldman became public, employees often would keep a copy of the firm's 14 business principals near their desks. The principles include items like "Our clients' interests always come first" and "Integrity and honesty are at the heart of our business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the last ten years that fell by the wayside," said a former Goldman managing director with more than 20 years experience with the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cultural changes have come as the firm has rapidly grown as a public company. It has also coincided with the evolution of more complex products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with outsiders questioning the firm's integrity, Goldman is finding it can't take any clients for granted. And many of the firm's clients expect nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their efforts to make sure that whatever questions we have get answered, have to be speeded up a little bit these days," said Howard Bicker, executive director of the Minnesota State Board of Investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bicker, who oversees $50 billion in state pension money, said he always found Goldman to be responsive in the past. But now it just seems the firm is more eager to please, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, it seems the SEC has managed to bring a bit of humility to Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matthew Goldstein and Steve Eder; Additional reporting by George Chen and Fiona Lau in Hong Kong and Quentin Webb in London; editing by Jim Impoco and Claudia Parsons)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Would Have Opportunity to Submit Information Before Court Issues Final
Decree in Ecological Disaster Case
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Lawyers representing the victims of a massive ecological disaster caused by
Chevron`s oil explorations in the Amazon rainforest have called on the company
to end its reckless campaign to sabotage the Ecuadoran court system. 

In a document submitted to the Ecuadoran court yesterday, the victims also
proposed that the court give Chevron and the Amazonian communities a final
opportunity to submit material that could assist the court in deciding the case.


"This case is being litigated in Ecuador because Chevron fought to have it moved
here from the United States," said Steven Donziger, a lawyer for the victims.
"But instead of defending the case, Chevron has waged war against the legal
system, alleging fraud while essentially boycotting the proceedings. Their
reckless and improper tactics must stop." 

Donziger said it was ironic that Chevron has attacked the expert report
concluding the company is responsible for more than $27 billion in damages
because, from the outset, Chevron has refused to participate in the expert`s
assessment. Donziger called on the company to submit material to aid the court
in reaching its final decision, which is expected soon. 

In their submission, the victims said that "even though Chevron failed to
participate meaningfully in the damages assessment process in the past, [the
victims propose] giving both parties the opportunity to submit this
supplementary information will satisfactorily resolve the outstanding
controversy &#8230; and thereby permit this judicial proceeding to have a normal
development leading to the issuance of a final ruling." 

"Because of the catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico, which has yet to reach the
proportions of the vast amount of oil contaminating the Amazon, it`s apparent
that cleanup costs can be very large. So it is possible that the $27 billion
amount in the expert`s report may be insufficient to remediate the harm in
Ecuador," Donziger said. "Under these circumstances, it`s appropriate that both
parties be given one last chance to submit information to the court." 

Chevron has admitted to discharging more than 18 billion gallons of toxic
"produced water" into Amazon waterways and forests from 1964 to 1990, when it
was the sole operator of a large oil concession. The contamination has decimated
indigenous groups and caused an outbreak of cancer that has accounted for at
least 1,400 deaths, according to a damages assessment submitted to the court. 

The amount of pure crude and contaminated oil discharged in Ecuador far
surpasses the size of the BP disaster, Donziger said. 

The lawsuit was originally filed in 1993 in U.S. federal court, but it was moved
to Ecuador in 2002 on a motion from Chevron. To induce dismissal of the case,
Chevron at the time submitted 14 sworn affidavits praising the fairness of
Ecuador`s courts.

&lt;p&gt;  ATLANTA, GA, Jun 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Infor, the leading provider of business software for mid-market
companies, today announced that it will closely align its key business
applications with a wide range of complementary Microsoft products,
forming software solutions that are easier for mid-market companies to
deploy and use.

News


--  Next-generation Infor software solutions that use Microsoft tools and
    technologies will be designed to:
    --  Use a unified, intuitive graphical interface running on Microsoft
        SharePoint 2010 for an improved end-user experience across all
        applications.
    --  More tightly integrate widely adopted Microsoft server-based
        products and industry-standard technologies, enabling IT to deploy
        Infor solutions faster and manage them more easily.
    --  Use Infor ION(TM) for application interoperability, data sharing
        and management for a more seamless and secure flow of information.
--  The Microsoft products and technologies that will be integrated with
    Infor applications include:
    --  Microsoft SharePoint(R) 2010 acting as the foundation for
        portal based, unified interfaces for applicable Infor
        applications.
    --  Microsoft Silverlight(R) for dynamic graphical interface
        elements.
    --  Microsoft SQL Server(R) as the preferred Infor database.
    --  Microsoft Reporting Services as a part of the foundation for the
        Infor Business Intelligence strategy across its portfolio.
    --  Microsoft Single Sign-On service for storage and mapping of
        credentials across applicable Infor applications.
    --  Microsoft Windows Server(R) as the preferred on-premise
        operating system.
--  Infor also plans to deliver pre-built reports, dashboards and
    analytics that run within Microsoft SharePoint 2010 to help reduce
    customers' cost to build and upgrade their reporting environments.
    These will combine rich backbone data from Infor applications via
    Infor ION, with proven Microsoft Reporting Services and analysis
    capabilities.
--  Infor also expects to accelerate the introduction of new products
    through increasing alignment with Microsoft technologies because it
    will allow greater code re-use, more standardization of technologies
    across applicable Infor applications, and decreased overall design
    complexity.

    

What Microsoft Says
 "In Infor we see a leading partner that is
using the Microsoft platform to provide simplicity and flexibility for
great customer value," said Walid Abu-Hadba, corporate vice president,
Developer and Platform Evangelism, Microsoft Corporation. "Companies want
simplified, integrated solutions to help manage their business processes,
and by integrating Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2, Silverlight and
SharePoint 2010 into their solutions, Infor will help companies of all
sizes -- from SMBs to Fortune 500 companies -- improve their efficiencies
and reduce costs by simplifying how they use business software." 

    What Altimeter Group Says
 "The perception of Microsoft according to more
than 74.6% of business and IT leaders recently polled is one of neutral
and trusted supplier," said R "Ray" Wang, founding partner and analyst at
Altimeter Group. "As Microsoft's technology offerings are enjoying a
renewed interest and reinvestment among customers, partners and critical
OEMs, Infor's customers should be pleased to see the close integration
with the company as it will simplify software deployment and ease of use."

    What We Say
 "The business software industry is at a crossroads," said
Jim Schaper, chairman and chief executive officer of Infor. "For too
long, business software vendors have failed to meet the needs of mid-size
companies that are increasingly frustrated with the high cost and
complexity of traditional enterprise applications that were designed for
multi-billion dollar corporations. By integrating the rich functionality
of Infor's applications with Microsoft's intuitive technologies, we will
be able to provide mid-size businesses with fast and affordable solutions
that meet their functionality needs and are easy to use. This combination
of power and simplicity is the direction our industry is headed."

Exam
ELKRIDGE, Md.--(Business Wire)--
Global performance improvement solutions provider General Physics Corporation
(GP), a subsidiary of GP Strategies Corporation (NYSE: GPX), has been selected
to be the independent validation provider for Microsoft Corp.`s new Microsoft
Project 2010certifications. Over 100 publishers produce more than 300 training
books and courses to help professionals around the world become certified in
either Project Desktop, Project Server or the combined Microsoft Enterprise
Project Management suite. Application users often turn to these publishers to
prepare for the certification exams. 

In order to prepare users effectively for exams, the publications must address
the correct objectives of the certification. Therefore, Microsoft has chartered
GP to validate the publications and ensure that they cover the material and
objectives addressed in the Microsoft Project 2010 certification exams. 

GP will work directly with each publisher to validate their training materials
or identify shortcomings to be overcome. As a result, each publisher who
successfully passes the validation will receive a GP seal of validation that can
be applied to their publication and training materials. They will also receive
preferred placement on the Microsoft Training Catalog. 

"This is a unique privilege for GP to receive Microsoft`s trust with this
charter," states William West, a vice president in GP`s Learning Solutions
Division. "GP brings the depth of instructional design expertise to conduct a
legitimate validation program and support the expected millions of Project 2010
users." 

"We are very excited about the Project 2010 release and the great project
management capability these tools will offer our users," states Doug McCutcheon,
Senior Product Manager, Microsoft Corporation. "Training is an excellent way of
quickly learning new capabilities of this release. We are pleased to partner
with GP, who are offering our users a `GP seal of validation` with reference to
our certifications."

&lt;p&gt;Version 5.5 Enables Unified Management of Heterogeneous Virtual Infrastructures,
Including VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V; Automates Problem Resolution
COLUMBUS, Ohio--(Business Wire)--
Veeam Software, innovative provider of data protection, disaster recovery and
systems management solutions forVMware virtual datacenter environments and a
2010 Microsoft Partner of the Year Award finalist, today released version 5.5 of
its nworks Management Pack (MP) for VMware. In addition to several enhancements
that are particularly beneficial to enterprises with mission-critical VMware
deployments, version 5.5 features a brand-new PRO Pack that provides
organizations using Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) with
automated problem resolution for their VMware infrastructures. 

"The Veeam nworks MP and PRO Pack complement Microsoft technologies to enable
unified monitoring and management of a heterogeneous virtual infrastructure,
including VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V," explained Ratmir Timashev,
Veeam President and CEO. "Not only have we closed the loop on VMware monitoring,
but we`ve also leveraged and protected the investments that enterprises have
made in Microsoft System Center. Our MP and PRO Pack embody our deep VMware
expertise, which is an ideal complement to Microsoft`s monitoring and management
framework." 

The enhancements made in version 5.5 are a direct result of customer feedback
and Veeam`s continued close partnership with VMware and Microsoft and include
the following: 

2x scalability and performance

The nworks MP 5.5 provides optimized user-configurable data publication methods.
Each data class can have its own publication interval, and data handling can be
tuned to more than double scalability and performance, without sacrificing the
resolution of key monitoring data or the availability of drilldown metrics. 

Improved high availability and load balancing

Version 5.5 also provides improved high availability and load balancing. New
failover groups in nworks Enterprise Manager (the new name for nworks Management
Center) allow for complete control of failover between collectors. In addition,
a new load-balancing algorithm provides for smarter monitoring job placement
during failover or when a vCenter is added to the monitored environment. 

New deployment toolkit

The new toolkit assists with initial deployment and subsequent growth of the
virtual environment. It includes an online calculator for pre-deployment
planning that recommends the number of collectors, as well as a built-in wizard
for ongoing analysis as the monitored environment grows. 

Veeam nworks MP maximizes virtualization outcomes

When Albany International Corp., a global advanced textiles and materials
processing company, wanted to monitor and manage its VMware ESX hosts and
leverage its investment in Microsoft System Center, Jeff Pardi, the company`s
manager for enterprise data services, turned to SRS Technology LLC, which
specializes in the design, implementation and configuration of Microsoft
infrastructure and System Center technologies. "SRS Technology recommended the
Veeam nworks MP because it is ideal for organizations like ours that want to
centralize systems management," Pardi explained. "The MP enables us to tie
infrastructure health to virtual machine health, and view both worlds on a
single management console, which has saved the company money because we don`t
have to train anyone on a new platform." 

Certification, pricing and availability

The Veeam nworks MP is certified by VMware as VMware Ready on both vSphere 4 and
VMware Infrastructure 3. In addition, the nworks MP is part of the System Center
MP Catalog on Pinpoint, signifying that it has passed Microsoft`s MP best
practice analysis and guidelines. 

The nworks MP 5.5 is available immediately, with North American MSRP unchanged
at $450 per CPU socket. This includes the PRO Pack, which will be generally
available in July as a free add-on to the nworks MP. More information is
available at http://www.veeam.com/mp and during free public webinars about the
new release on Thursday, June 24:

&lt;p&gt;Private Online Community Drives Insights, Innovation and Ambassadorship for KIN
Phone
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Passenger, a leading provider of private online community and Social CRM
software and services, today announced Microsoft Corp. tapped the company for
Project KIN, a private online community built to gain insight into the lifestyle
and mobile communication preferences of Generation Y. With more than 2,000
members, the Passenger-powered community contributes insights, creative ideas
and brand advocacy that directly impact the product development and marketing of
the KIN phones. 

"Microsoft`s Project KIN proves how private online communities can not only
deliver real-time customer insight and cost-effective innovation, but also
inspire passionate brand advocacy," said Steve Howe, CEO, Passenger. "By showing
customers how their input affected the ultimate outcome of important product
design elements, Microsoft fostered a stronger connection with their core
audience and the KIN brand. As a result, Microsoft built an army of ambassadors
spreading the gospel of KIN directly among their peers." 

Beginning in 2008, Microsoft has used Passenger`s robust community application
to design activities and events to engage members of Generation Y. With no
monetary or product incentives, and initially no indication of the brand behind
the project, the community has grown to 2,000 members. Many community members
contribute on a daily basis, using Passenger`s media-rich community software to
upload photos and video segments of their daily lives and provide feedback on
features and functionality. Input from the community has affected the outcome of
important design element, including the QWERTY keyboard, camera and flash, the
Zune player and length of battery life. In fact, the signature feature of KIN
phones, the Studio - a Web service that automatically synchronizes messages,
pictures and videos from KIN phones - is the direct result of input from Project
KIN participants. 

Passenger`s easy-to-use application and experienced services team have helped
Microsoft create more intimate connections with the Project KIN members.
Community managers can initiate direct conversations with the most loyal and
vocal members, called "favorites," and reward their participation with access to
insider information and special brand experiences. By starting small and
building real one-on-one relationships, Microsoft has cultivated ambassadors now
spreading their enthusiasm for the KIN brand throughout their larger social
networks.

&lt;p&gt;    * Growth seen in emerging markets &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Online video key for digital ad growth &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds executive comments, detail) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Cyril Altmeyer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    CANNES, France, June 23 (Reuters) - Digital advertising will continue to grow strongly for the next four to five years, driven by online video and emerging markets, a Microsoft (MSFT.O) executive said on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The rise of mobile devices such as computer tablets and smartphones is creating opportunities for advertisers who are now able to follow their customers throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I am quite optimistic that for the next four to five years there will be pretty strong growth in digital advertising in emerging markets and elsewhere," said Darren Huston, corporate vice president, global consumer and online for Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He cited Latin America, Turkey and southeast Asia as growth areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft, which recently signed agreements with Facebook and microblogging site Twitter, expects to see social networks and online video ads to keep developing, Huston said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Online video is very hot. It's gone from when nobody wanted to advertise on it to now (when) there is not enough online video inventory for a lot of the big advertisers," Huston told Reuters at the Cannes Lions international advertising festival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft is working with Hewlett-Packard (HP) (HPQ.N) and other technology companies to create a tablet computer to rival Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPad and sees offering more functionality as key.   "We believe that ultimately people are going to want ... something with full computer functionalities versus partial computer functionalities," Huston said, adding no launch date had been set yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Smart devices generally are a good opportunity for Microsoft: they need better software and that's what we do," Huston said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The head of UK chip designer ARM Holdings (ARM.L), whose chip designs power 90 percent of the world's smartphones and a quarter of its electronic devices, said last week he expects to see a wave of tablet computers beyond the iPad as the new devices begin to eat into traditional notebook PC sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Writing by James Regan; Editing by Sharon Lindores) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((james.regan@thomsonreuters.com; +33 1 49 49 53 84; Reuters Messaging: james.regan.reuters.com@reuters.net))   Keywords: MICROSOFT/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2010.

&lt;p&gt;    * Says competitive pressure from Verizon to abate &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Keeps positive bias on cable sector &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    June 23 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities started coverage on Cablevision Systems Corp (CVC.N) with an "overweight" rating, saying the cable operator's service penetration levels are the best in the industry despite tough competition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cablevision's video average revenue per user (ARPU) is roughly 23 percent higher than its closest large-cap cable peer, the brokerage said. The company's competitors include Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable Inc (TWC.N). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Despite intense competition from Verizon Communications (VZ.N) since the launch of its FiOS Internet and television service in 2005, Cablevision has seen only a minor video share loss while growing its broadband and voice base, J.P. Morgan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Notwithstanding aggressive marketing tactics, competitive pressures from Verizon are likely to abate as FiOS nears the end of its planned build-out, the brokerage said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Competition from AT Inc (T.N) remains fairly muted, it added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The brokerage also maintained its positive bias on the cable sector given attractive growth rates vis-a-vis telecom competitors and expectations that cable can garner a larger share of household entertainment spend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cablevision shares closed at $24.64 Tuesday on New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jennifer Robin Raj in Bangalore; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((aruna.jennifer@thomsonreuters.com; within U.S. +1 646 223 8780; outside U.S. +91 80 4135 5800; Reuters Messaging:aruna.jennifer.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: CABLEVISION RESEARCH/JPM  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2010.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

JPMorgan Reshuffles Top Brass

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced Tuesday it is shuffling the positions
of three top executives, in addition to creating the new President of
International position. This is part of the company`s strategy to increase its
presence in the international market. 

JPMorgan named Ms. Heidi Miller, head of Treasury &amp; Securities Services (TSS),
as the President of International. While Mr. Michael Cavanagh, Chief Financial
Officer (CFO). will succeed Ms. Miller as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of TSS.
Mr. Doug Braunstein, head of Investment Banking, Americas, will replace Mr.
Cavanagh as CFO. 

All these appointments are effective immediately and JPMorgan will soon announce
the replacement of Mr. Braunstein as head of Investment Banking, Americas. 

The role of the President of International will be to enhance JPMorgan`s lines
of businesses globally, helping them to speed up, focus and prioritize their
investments in faster growing economies, such as China, India, Brazil and
Russia. 

Ms. Miller`s role will comprise resourcing and governing lines of business,
expanding local branches, seeking growth opportunities in other emerging
economies and reducing inefficiency. She will be facing the pressure from
recognized international peers such as HSBC Holdings plc. (NYSE: HBC) and
Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) in wholesale banking and cash management. Ms. Miller
will also be heading the newly-created International Operating Committee,
consisting of JPMorgan`s senior global leaders. 

Mr. Cavanagh who has served as JPMorgan`s CFO since 2004 will look after TSS,
one of the major business units of the company, for further expansion leading to
increased revenue and profit. 

Mr. Braunstein, who has now been appointed as CFO, will also be a member of
JPMorgan`s International Operating Committee. He has occupied several senior
Investment Banking positions in the company and has aided the company in the
advisory business. As a member of the Operation Committee, he will continue to
focus on strengthening JPMorgan`s capital strength and liquidity, risk
management, loan loss reserve and clear and transparent accounting. 

JPMorgan has considerably increased its reach in the U.S. market during the
financial turmoil, with the acquisitions of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.
However, high capital requirements and tight regulations slowed the company`s
expansion plans, thus, raising the priority of the overseas market. 

While expanding its geographic presence to enter emerging markets globally in
the recent weeks, JPMorgan has announced its foray into the Chinese market
through a joint venture with First Capital and proposed to acquire a Brazilian
hedge fund, G&#225;vea Investimentos. The company has also received the approval from
the European Union (EU) to acquire Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc's (NYSE:
RBS) non-U.S. commodities joint venture RBS Sempra Commodities LLP for $1.7
billion. 

These executive changes are a strategic move and are expected to help JPMorgan
acquire more businesses in Asia and Europe, which are the main areas of further
growth, as with its world class international business, the company believes
that future growth prospects are outside U.S. 

JPMorgan is currently a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold), implying that the stock is
expected to perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next
one to three months. While we anticipate continued synergies from the company`s
diversification and strong capital position, a pressured credit quality and
reduced levels of client activity will drag down future earnings. However, we
are impressed to see some improvement in credit quality during the last couple
of quarters. Therefore, we maintain our Neutral recommendation on the stock. 

Raser Tech Provides Project Update

Energy technology company Raser Technologies Inc. (NYSE: RZ) continues to
progress with its Lightning Dock geothermal power plant project in New Mexico.
The company started drilling on this 15 megawatt project in late May 2010. 

The Renewables Energy Group of Raser Technologies has contracted Barbour Well
Inc. of Henderson, Nevada for drilling wells in its geothermal project near
Lordsburg in southern New Mexico. Barbour is a Nevada-based firm licensed to
drill geothermal and domestic water wells in New Mexico. 

The drilling and initial operations at the well lasted for about ten days,
followed by the test phase of the project, where a series of tests to determine
water flow and temperature are performed. Raser`s management believes the
company is on track with the Lightning Dock project and looks forward to
positive test results. 

Following the success of the tests, the company is set to proceed with efforts
to arrange funds for additional drilling to develop the well field for the
project. Furthermore, the company expects to qualify for a 30% U.S. Treasury
grant under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Earlier this
year, the company received a grant of $33 million from the U.S. Treasury for its
Thermo No. 1, Utah project. 

Provo, Utah-based Raser Technologies operates as a geothermal power development
and technology licensing company in the United States. The company operates in
two segments - Power Systems, and Transportation and Industrial Technology.
Going forward, the company expects to add 40MW annually to its geothermal
capacity over the three-year period 2010-2012 to take its total annual
geothermal power generation capacity to 130MW.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Coal Industry Review &amp; Outlook - June 2010

Our near-term (6-18 months) outlook for the coal industry has improved somewhat
from our previous neutral sentiment to a more positive undertone. Various recent
economic indicators suggest that the U.S. economy appears to be stabilizing. 

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), coal production
in 2009 fell by nearly 8.5% in response to lower U.S. coal consumption, fewer
exports and higher coal inventories. Going forward, the EIA estimates a 3%
decline in U.S. coal production in 2010, despite increases in domestic
consumption and exports due to increased producer and end-user inventories.
However, coal production in 2011 is estimated to improve 5.4% on the back of
continued growth in consumption and exports, as existing inventories are
reduced. We expect the coal markets to continue to strengthen throughout 2010. 

Despite some recent pressures, the overall trend in coal prices has been
favorable, driven by improvements in demand from the domestic and international
markets and reduced stockpiles. The U.S. generator stockpile levels have reduced
largely from peak levels in November 2009. 

Furthermore, we anticipate smaller build-in stockpiles throughout 2010, with
demand being absorbed partially from existing producer stockpiles. These
inventory draws and expected mild builds should continue to ease pricing
pressure going forward. 

Additionally, prices for seaborne metallurgical and thermal coals are moving
higher as China and India are rapidly increasing imports and traditional
Asian-based customers are returning to pre-recession growth levels. The expected
moderation in China`s growth may not have a significant impact on its demand for
coal. 

Metallurgical coal (coking coal), a key ingredient in the production of steel,
is in great demand due to the recovery of the Asian steel industry. The growth
in Chinese steel demand is acting as a major driver of global demand and pricing
for coking coal, followed by India. 

Steel plant capacity utilization rates in the U.S. and around the world continue
to improve compared to last year. Domestic steel mills are using approximately
73% of their capacity, while Asian steel mills are currently running at full
capacity. This calls for increased demand for metallurgical coal around the
world. 

Coal is the backbone of electricity generation in the U.S. The U.S. relies on
coal for about half of its power generation, compared with about 20% of gas. The
reason is simple: coal is by far the least expensive and most abundant fossil
fuel in the country. The extraordinary decline in electric generation brought
about by the recent economic slowdown had pushed coal inventories to
historically high levels in 2009. But, we believe fundamentals are aligning such
that substantial inventory declines are likely to be seen in 2010. 

We remain bullish on the international thermal coal market than the domestic
U.S. thermal coal. Excess supply in the Atlantic market caused by softer demand
in Europe and the U.S. is currently being absorbed to some extent by the Pacific
markets. 

OPPORTUNITIES

The larger coal players with strong balance sheets will be able to capitalize on
the current market environment in the form of acquisitions. In particular, we
like companies with exposure to the international coal markets. We also like
companies with leverage to metallurgical coal markets. Companies like Peabody
Energy Corporation (NYSE: BTU), CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE: CNX), Walter Energy
Inc. (NYSE: WLT) and Arch Coal Inc. (NYSE: ACI) look attractive in the current
scenario. 

Peabody is the largest pure-play coal producer. Its Australian operations
provide direct exposure to Asian markets such as China and India, where
substantial increases in coal demand are expected in the years ahead. Peabody`s
growth story continues to ride on the strong China-India-Australia connection. 

We believe the growth prospects for coal in the regions where Peabody operates
are very attractive. Going forward, we expect the company will benefit from its
large production and reserve position in the Powder River Basin (PRB) and
Illinois Basin, which are safe, low-cost regions that will continue to penetrate
the Eastern U.S. markets. 

Arch Coal has a significant amount of reserves and is a top-three producer in
the Powder River Basin. In our opinion, its Powder River Basin assets reflect
visible long-term value, and the Jacobs Ranch acquisition will only enhance it.
Furthermore, Arch Coal is well positioned to capitalize on the resurgence in
coal demand once the global economy stabilizes, given its decades of reserves, a
strong balance sheet and efficient, low-cost operations. 

CONSOL Energy`s deep and diversified portfolio, primarily comprising coal and
natural gas, is well positioned to benefit from the growing energy demand around
the world and provides the company with significant long-term growth potential.
It is one of the largest low-cost coal producers in the northern Appalachia
basin. The low-volatile metallurgical coal and high-Btu steam coal will command
premium prices even in a subdued commodity environment. Furthermore, the
company`s gas operations show solid growth potentials. 

WEAKNESSES

Coal has been viewed as an industry that is faced with the risk of being
abandoned due to the alarming issues of climate change, carbon emission concerns
and energy sustainability. This has been prompting increased usage of
alternative sources of energy generation like wind, solar and nuclear power. 

The reality, though, is that most alternatives are nowhere near ready for
primetime use. And political constraints appear to be delaying, if not
altogether eliminating, the threat of major environmental regulatory overhaul, a
net positive for the coal industry. Solar and wind power are expensive, and
nuclear power has issues regarding its acceptance as a major power source. While
the production of coal plants has slowed to curb emissions, the coal industry
should see the profits continuing to roll in. 

Another major alternative for the use of coal in energy generation is natural
gas. Cheaper natural gas and big inventories have greatly hurt the U.S. and
European thermal coal demand in the past year. Looking ahead, we expect the
thermal coal demand to remain under pressure well, driven by lower gas prices.
With the discovery of abundant shale natural gas in the U.S., the long-term
competitive dynamic may have moved notably against coal. It is, however, far
from certain or clear at this stage. 

On the regulatory front, there is heated debate regarding the effectiveness of
"cap-and-trade" legislation. Basically designed to impose a per-ton expense on
carbon dioxide emissions, the coal and utility industries have been opposed to
this system, claiming that it will drive up the cost of coal and put an
effective tax onto people living in the Midwest U.S. 

The cap-and-trade system may pose long-term problems for the coal industry as it
would increase the cost of coal, thereby decreasing its competitiveness as an
energy source (and consequently reducing demand for it) and would force
businesses to use less reliable and more expensive forms of energy. Related to
the regulatory concerns are issues about mine safety, particularly in the
backdrop of recent high-profile accidents. More stringent regulations and
oversight in this area may come at the expense of operating efficiencies and
higher expenses. 

In terms of the macro picture, if the global economy -- particularly regarding
its demand for steel -- is slow to recover, this could mean prolonged price
suppression for CAPP and NAPP coal, which could lead to reduced production,
idled mines and higher unit costs. Investors also have to be wary of the growth
outlook for China, given its central role in driving the demand for coal as well
as all other commodities. A significant and sustained pullback in Chinese growth
will be major negative for the coal group. 

Specific names to avoid in the space include the coal master limited
partnerships (MLPs) such as Natural Resource Partners (NYSE: NRP) and Penn
Virginia Resources (NYSE: PVR). The outlook for these partnerships remains weak,
as evident from recent guidance. We are not confident of their ability to
sustain distributions at current levels. As such, we would be staying away from
the coal MLPs.

&lt;p&gt;Neon Enterprise Software on Thursday said it plans to file a mainframe-related complaint against IBM with the European Commission, compounding the IT giant's mounting regulatory issues in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neon, which makes software for mainframe computers, said the complaint is connected with IBM's "on-going anticompetitive and abusive conduct" in the mainframe business. The company did not comment on when it would file the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has already been slapped with three mainframe antitrust complaints in Europe from TurboHercules, PSI and T3 Technologies. In March, TurboHercules, a mainframe software company in France, filed a complaint with the Commission in which it said that IBM ties its OS with mainframe hardware, which freezes out smaller competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has not yet received any complaint, wrote Steve Eisenstadt, an IBM spokesman, in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM strongly believes Neon's product offers no innovation," Eisenstadt wrote, adding that Neon's motivation is to profit from the "billions of dollars" IBM has invested in mainframes in the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "copycat" companies are attempting to mimic the functionality of IBM's mainframe servers, and in doing so, are violating IBM's intellectual property, Eisenstadt wrote. IBM will vigorously protect investments in its mainframe technologies, Eisenstadt wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, the U.S. Department of Justice initiated a preliminary investigation related to allegations of IBM's dominant behavior in the mainframe computer market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neon makes the zPrime software, which the company says can reduce operating costs by shifting mainframe computing tasks to IBM's zAAP and zIIP specialty mainframe processors. IBM introduced specialty processors (SPs) in mainframes to divert certain workloads from the central processor, and customers don't pay software licensing fees to use those SPs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies have already exchanged legal barbs over zPrime and its functionality. Neon has accused IBM of unlawfully trying to maintain dominance in processing of workloads on IBM's mainframe computers, while IBM accusing Neon of hijacking its intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December Neon filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, accusing IBM of unlawfully interfering in the customers' purchase of zPrime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Neon, IBM told its mainframe customers in a letter that "the use of zPrime will cause Neon's customers to become obligated -- contrary to IBM's original promises to customers that purchased SPs - to pay software license fees for workloads shifted to SPs." IBM's claim is false, Neon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM filed a counter-claim to Neon's suit in January, accusing Neon of building zPrime in a way to misappropriate IBM's intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) has filed a lawsuit to prevent former senior executive Joanne Olsen from taking a job with rival Oracle Corp ORCL.O, which wooed her away from IBM after 31 years with the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Procter  Gamble launches new products to gain share&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Set to launch Fusion ProGlide Gillette in Europe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Ariel Gel gains 10 pct of UK detergents market
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - Procter  Gamble Co (PG.N), the
world's biggest consumer goods group, is gaining market share in
Europe helped by new products and by making versions of its
brands at lower prices to cope with tough economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Cincinnati-based Gillette razor and Tide detergent maker
has launched new automatic dishwasher and stain removal products
over the last two years, while a new Gillette Fusion ProGlide
razor blade is due in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have been growing market share each month over the last
seven months," Procter  Gamble Western European President
Gianni Ciserani told Reuters on the sideline of the global
summit of the consumer goods forum in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He says the group has launched Ariel stain remover, Fairy
automatic dishwasher products and Pampers Dry Max diapers in
Western Europe to help boost sales in a region which makes
around 25 percent of the group's overall worldwide sales.
 The new diaper has 20 percent less pulp and sells for a
lower price, and so has gained a 10 percent market share in the
struggling economy of Greece while it has around a 4-5 percent
share in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ciserani says its Fairy automatic dishwasher product has
been launched in Italy, Spain, Britain, Belgium and the
Netherlands, while the new Gillette razor blades recently
launched in the United States are due shortly in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He says the group's new product pipeline is 20-25 percent
bigger than last year, and this programme came up with Ariel Gel
in Britain which works in cold water and has taken 10 percent
share of the detergent market in which the group has an overall
half share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. giant competes against Reckitt Benckiser's (RB.L)
Finish and Vanish in autodishwash and stain removal, against
Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) and Henkel (HNKG_p.DE) in detergents
and Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) for diapers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Europe is very volatile. The worst is behind us but the
recovery will be much slower than people expect," Ciserani
added.

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta--(Business Wire)--
The investment opinions offered below and in this press release are provided by
Nick Hunter, RIA, of Picksthatmove.com. 

PicksThatMove is pleased to bring investors special situation stocks which have
a high potential for price appreciation. These companies have interesting
business models and they have to execute on the business development level to
bring value to shareholders. Some of our past picks had soared over 200%. To
view some of our profiled stocks, please visit our website at
www.picksthatmove.com. 

At PicksThatMove, our team scours the technical and financials of hundreds of
companies to identify those stocks showing the greatest potential for growth. 

Since April, Microsoft (MSFT) is down nearly 19.25% for no other reason than the
market`s usual grass grazing herd mentality. The same mentality I make my money
exploiting. This time around, cows like Apples, and they`ve bid up the Steve
Jobs Project to price levels unjustified by reality. I smell an opportunity:
Apple shares are overvalued and Microsoft is a bargain. 

As of yesterday Microsoft was trading at $25.31 and has a market cap of 224.34
billion. In 2009 the company had a net income of $14.57 billion, with each share
generating $1.63 (earnings per share). Meaning, when you buy Microsoft stock,
you`re paying $25.35 for ownership of a share that`s generating approximately
$1.63 of the company`s annual income. Last year, Apple posted $8.23 billion in
profit and had earnings per share of $11.78. 

So, on top of the fact Apple`s market cap is 23.87 billion dollars higher than
that of Microsoft`s when the former was 6.34 billion dollars more profitable in
2009, the earnings per share of each company are even more telling. 

Apple is trading at a whopping $271.14, meaning every $1 you spend on Apple
generates $0.043 of its earnings. Microsoft is trading at $24.35, meaning $1 of
Microsoft shares generates $0.064. That means every dollar you spend on
Microsoft is generating 50% for cash than Apple. 

Yet even though Microsoft looks much better on paper, investors are eager to pay
double for Apple based on its future value. But Apple`s price has already been
pumped up. Can you really foresee it upping everything it`s done in the past six
years? Because the company is valued as if it will, as if it has to? 

Microsoft on the other hand is low right now. Yes, the company is in a period of
transition; it is a successful behemoth built in a different market that`s now
coping with competitors and a new landscape in computing. But Microsoft is
focusing on long-term research aimed at pioneering the next generation of
breakthrough technologies. The most touted is cloud computing, revolutionizing
the way we access information. The next few years will also see dramatic changes
in the way people interact with technology, as touch, gestures, handwriting, and
speech recognition become a normal part of how we control devices. This will
make technology more accessible and simpler to use and will create opportunities
to reach new markets and deliver new kinds of computing experiences. 

As computing power increases, Microsoft has the ability to build software that
understands users intentions based on what they have done in the past and then
anticipate their future needs rapidly improving. This will enable Microsoft to
deliver a new generation of software that has the knowledge and intelligence to
respond to simple natural language input and quickly carry out complex tasks in
a way that accurately reflects users needs and preferences. 

Microsoft is in a great position to lead the way. With a superb pipeline of
products and ongoing long-term investments in key technology areas such as cloud
computing, natural user interfaces, scientific computing, and much more, they
will continue to deliver innovations that help people lead richer, more
productive, more creative, and more connected lives. 

With $31.5 billion in cash lying around, Microsoft has more than enough money to
cope with change.

&lt;p&gt;A French business school plans to trade Google Apps, used by around half its staff and students, for Microsoft's rival Live@edu service.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Skema Business School's 6,250 students, 500 administrative staff and 128 teaching staff will have access to Microsoft's Live@edu hosted e-mail service, which includes calendar and contact management, instant messaging, video conferencing and 10GB of storage space, the school announced Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff and students will also be offered Microsoft Office 2010 under a site-wide licensing program, and access to Sharepoint Online, giving them each 25GB of storage space for documents, whether shared or their own. The applications will run in Microsoft's European data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school is making the move as part of a three-year collaboration agreement with Microsoft, which will also see the company offer internships to Skema graduates and supply staff to teach elements of a course on social networking, the school said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skema describes itself as a pioneer in the use of online collaboration tools for its work. It was created last November from the merger of two French business schools, CERAM and ESC Lille. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESC Lille, with around 3,000 students, adopted Google Apps Education Edition in April 2008, one of the first schools in France to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching to Live@edu will allow Skema to harmonize the IT systems used by staff and students of the two schools, and will also enable it to integrate them with the software used to run the school, also developed using Microsoft's software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff are migrating to Microsoft Office 2010 now; students will move to the new software in the third quarter, the school said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The win will be particularly sweet for Microsoft International President Jean-Philippe Courtois, who graduated from CERAM in 1983, before it became part of Skema. He is also a member of the school's Council of Strategic Direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to its French campuses in Paris, Lille, and Sophia-Antipolis, Skema has one in Suzhou, China, and recently opened another in Raleigh, North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Sayer covers open source software, European intellectual property legislation and general technology breaking news for IDG News Service.

&lt;p&gt;Wingstop First Restaurant in Dallas to Test Coca-Cola Freestyle&#174;, New Touch
Screen Fountain Dispenser 


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Freestyle&#174;, The Coca-Cola Company`s exciting new interactive fountain
dispenser, is available for the first time in the Dallas area. 

Long-time Coca-Cola customer Wingstop, the fast-growing chicken wing restaurant
concept that has sold more than 1.9 billion wings, will be the first to offer
the fountain in the Dallas area. Wingstop plans to feature Coca-Cola Freestyle
in three of its locations this summer. Units will be installed in 25 additional
Dallas-area restaurants later this year, including select Boston Market, CiCi`s
Pizza, DoubleDave`s Pizzaworks, Pei Wei Asian Diner, Schlotszky`s, Souper!
Salad!, Taco Bueno, and Which Wich? locations. 

The sleek, stylish new fountains are touch screen operated, enabling consumers
to select from more than 100 regular and low-calorie beverage brands - including
many varieties of waters, fruit-flavored beverages and sparkling beverages that
have never before been available in the U.S. other than on Coca-Cola Freestyle.
The self-serve fountains - which represent a complete departure from anything
The Coca-Cola Company has offered previously - have been in development for more
than four years. 

"We have created a concept that is quickly becoming recognized as the soda
fountain of the future - the way people will experience Coca-Cola beverages
years from now," said Gene Farrell, vice president, Coca-Cola Freestyle,
Coca-Cola North America. 

Early testing of the fountains began a year ago and expanded to include more
than 50 restaurants across Georgia and Southern California. Results from the
test indicate an increase in total restaurant sales - including fountain
servings - as well as a measurable lift in traffic. The company plans future
testing in other cities as early as the fall. 

The Coca-Cola Freestyle&#174; dispenser uses unique, proprietary PurePour Technology
TM and has the capacity to dispense up to 106 branded beverages in the same
footprint as a standard eight-valve machine. Consumers can experience Coca-Cola
Freestyle&#174; virtually at www.Facebook.com/cocacolaFreestyle.

&lt;p&gt;  CHICAGO, IL, Jun 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
RISC Networks, the leader in business technology analytics, today
announced Version 3.0 of its Unified Correlation Engine Logic (UCEL), the
proprietary analytics software at the foundation of the company's network
and IT infrastructure consulting services. The announcement coincides
with Cisco Live 2010, taking place in Las Vegas from June 27th to July
1st.

    RISC Networks, an analytics provider for Cisco Systems, IBM and others,
does not sell network monitoring software or hardware. Instead, the
company provides technology analytics services. Its consulting engineers
use UCEL 3.0 to correlate and analyze information gathered from clients'
entire IT environments, including data, voice and video traffic,
networks, servers, desktops, applications, printers and other technology.

    The new version enables RISC Networks' engineers to more accurately
pinpoint specific problems at the device and traffic path level and
illustrate the results to the client in an easy-to-read "punch list" of
prioritized network management issues. In addition, UCEL 3.0 adds
important new features that deepen the analytics capabilities for
Microsoft servers and desktops.

    Important new features of UCEL 3.0 include:


--  Data Center Virtualization Analysis for Microsoft Windows Servers
--  Windows Server Event Log Analytics
--  Windows OS and Office License Compliance Analysis
--  HD Video Call Path Simulations present a clear visual picture that
    cross correlates poor calls with root cause errors
--  Quality of Service (QoS) Flow Analysis checks high priority traffic
    actual performance and IP configurations
--  Enhanced Performance/Component Correlation pinpoints problems at the
    device level

    

"We have conducted thousands of analytics engagements, which has
given us tremendous insight into what IT managers need to more
effectively manage their IT infrastructures," said Jeremy Littlejohn,
chief analyst at RISC Networks, Inc. "We listened to our clients and
developed new methodologies and correlation models in our version 3.0
engine that are even more detailed, but still easily translate into clear
actionable items that our clients can solve."

    In its consulting engagements, RISC Networks uses its proprietary tools
and methodology to fulfill a much needed role in the industry, providing
objective analytics and independent reporting to help guide clients in
making strategic decisions to improve and optimize their IT
Infrastructure.

analytics, a system of analysis and data reporting services developed to
provide comprehensive and actionable data for IT networks. Utilizing its

consulting services that help clients optimize the reliability,
scalability and performance of their entire IT infrastructure, including
data, voice and video traffic, networks, servers, desktops, applications,
printers and other technology.

    A business technology analytics engagement from RISC Networks delivers
fast, independent and objective results, including a specific "punch
list" at the device and traffic path level that explains exactly what
issues are impacting the system and how to fix, avoid or prevent them.
RISC Networks consulting engineers perform the analytics themselves and
explain the data reports in detail, so there is little or no impact on
client resources and no training required.

companies like Cisco, IBM, BestBuy, CDW and Presidio as well as some of
the world's leading blue-chip companies.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fired another salvo as its battle against Google for search turf heated up this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, Microsoft unveiled new features aimed at making Bing more than just a search site. Bing was enhanced with an entertainment page that will let users watch TV shows, play games and listen to music -- all without leaving the Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has become a full-on war . I'm not too sure it can get any hotter," said Rob Enderle, an analyst at Enderle Group. "Microsoft is trying to make Bing ever more capable. The goal is to get you to live within their search engine and not go to any other sites, certainly not Google. The more you can do with Bing, the less likely you are to wander someplace else like Google. It's textbook customer containment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is looking to significantly beef up Bing's handling of entertainment-related queries, an area that draws a lot of interest from users. The company also will be looking to increase its footprint with other "verticals," such as health, travel and shopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Bing could use a boost in its competition with long-dominant Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Microsoft's hefty investment of time, RD and advertising dollars, Bing hasn't made much of a dent in Google's search market share in the year that Bing has been on the market. Google has been hanging tough, grabbing more than 71% of all U.S. searches in April. That was a 2% increase over its numbers in March, according to a report from Hitwise, an online traffic monitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing, which is in third place behind Microsoft and Yahoo , saw its own numbers slip 2% in April, reaching a 9.43% share for the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This week's move is a good one for Bing," said Dan Olds, an analyst at Gabriel Consulting Group. "I think these new features are good choices for their initial rollout, particularly the video search. With a single search, users can see pages of thumbnail videos that relate to their search terms. Plus, they can see the videos play without leaving the Bing page, which helps users sift through the results and find exactly what they want."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft continues to innovate and execute well, it just might start chipping away at some of Google's substantial market lead, Olds said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysts were in agreement that Bing's innovation will push Google to do the same. And that, they say, can only mean good things for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bing's design choices have already had a big impact on Google," said Hadley Reynolds, an analyst at market research firm IDC. "The most obvious is Google's belated introduction of a left rail similar to Bing's this past May, and their increasing integration of rich media and best bets into the interface. Now Bing is moving the goal post further with these June enhancements. I expect to see an ongoing series of changes to the core searcher experience from both Google and Microsoft continue through the next couple of years and spawn a counterpart competition in the mobile search experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Gaudin covers the Internet and Web 2.0, emerging technologies, and desktop and laptop chips for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;June 24 (Reuters) - Besieged energy giant BP Plc (BP.L)
(BP.N) is set to partner with U.S. rival Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to
bid for a South China Sea exploration block, the Wall Street
Journal said, citing a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The move signals rival firms are still willing to partner
with BP in deep water projects in spite of the company's failure
to stop a Gulf of Mexico oil well leak that is threatening to
pollute the U.S. Gulf coast, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron will have a 60 percent stake in the block and act as
operator, with BP holding the remaining interest, the person
told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cnooc Ltd (0883.HK), a unit of China National Offshore Oil
Corp, has the right to take a 51 percent stake in the block if
the companies make a commercial oil or natural gas discovery,
according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, it was not known whether Cnooc would exercise
pre-emption rights on the asset, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) has selected
BP and Chevron as preferred buyers for block 42/05, located
about 250 kilometers south of Hong Kong, according to the
Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies involved in the deal declined to comment to
the Journal. They could not immediately be reached for comment
by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours.

&lt;p&gt;June 24 (Reuters) - Movie studio The Weinstein Co has agreed
to a major debt restructuring that gives Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) and Assured Guaranty Ltd (AGO.N) possession of as many as
250 films in its library, the Wall Street Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The restructuring, finalised by the companies on Wednesday,
is designed to allow Weinstein Co to continue as a going concern
and resolve the financial struggles that beset the studio
shortly after it opened in 2005, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the restructuring deal, Goldman has agreed to
subtract $115 million from Weinstein Co's total outstanding debt
of $450 million, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any interest payments owed by Weinstein Co on the debt were
eliminated in the agreement, the Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and Assured Guaranty, which insured some of the
company's debt, will also own a small portion of Weinstein Co's
future projects, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Weinstein Co can pay off the $335 million through film
library revenue, it will emerge debt free and be able to reclaim
ownership of those 250 movies, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weinstein Co and Goldman could not be immediately reached
for comment by Reuters outside normal U.S. business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harvey and Bob Weinstein founded the company after they sold
Miramax Films, the powerhouse studio behind such 1990s movies as
"Pulp Fiction" and "Shakespeare in Love," to Walt Disney Co
(DIS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the years, Goldman has helped raised hundreds of
millions of dollars to finance Weinstein Co's projects.

&lt;p&gt; * AIG ex-CEO Sullivan, Risk Officer Lewis to testify&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman's Viniar also among witnesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * FCIC hearings in Washington on Wednesday, Thursday
 (Rewrites throughout with details of hearings, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder and Paritosh Bansal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - Joseph Cassano, a former AIG
executive who played a big role in bringing the giant insurer
to its knees, will face-off next week with a U.S. panel
investigating the causes of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cassano will rub shoulders with a star cast, which includes
Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) President Gary Cohn and Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar who will testify at hearings
before the  Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission next Wednesday
and Thursday on the role of derivatives in the financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cassano, who ran AIG Financial Products, the division
behind the insurer's meltdown in September 2008, has evaded
public appearances since leaving the insurer some two years
ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The son of a Brooklyn policeman, Cassano has been the
subject of criminal and civil investigations in the United
States and abroad, but recently had the specter of prosecution
lifted when the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and
Exchange Commission ended their investigations against him and
other AIG executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Former AIG Chief Executive Martin Sullivan and AIG Chief
Risk Officer Robert Lewis are also expected to headline the
latest of the panel's hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hearing comes as Congress prepares to hold final votes
on financial reform legislation to address the financial
crisis. The roles of Goldman and AIG in the crisis have been
scrutinized since U.S. taxpayers committed hundreds of billions
of dollars to bail out the banking industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; INVESTIGATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taxpayers pledged up to $182 billion to address problems at
AIG's financial products division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG Financial Products wrote a form of insurance, known as
credit-default swaps, on bonds created out of the home mortgage
loan market during the U.S. housing boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the loans began to sour and the bonds lost value,
firms that had taken out the insurance demanded collateral from
AIG, leading to the insurance industry's equivalent of a run on
a bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2007, Cassano boasted that the company did not expect to
realize even $1 in losses on the portfolio. He left AIG in
March 2008 under pressure over the company's financial
situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which has been criticized for benefiting from the
government's bailout of AIG, will send four executives to
Washington next week, including Cohn, who is second-in-command
to Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein. Blankfein testified before
the commission in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month the FCIC served Goldman with a subpoena,
saying the firm had not been cooperative after it "dumped" 2.5
billion digitized documents on the committee in response to a
request for information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, the SEC charged Goldman with civil fraud stemming
from its packaging and marketing of the Abacus collateralized
debt obligation, an investment product linked to the
performance of a group of mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCIC has been holding both public hearings and private
meetings with financial industry players, including investor
Warren Buffett, to piece together the causes and impact of the
financial meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The congressionally appointed commission is supposed to
issue a report by Dec. 15, detailing the crisis that peaked in
late 2008 after the collapse of former investment banking giant
Lehman Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report will serve as a public record of the historic
event and will not likely include thorough recommendations for
reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The witness list for next week is posted at:

HP Acquires Melodeo

Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ) recently acquired Melodeo, which operates as
nuTsie, the online music service, in a deal valued between $30.0 million to
$35.0 million. 

With this acquisition, HP is expected to move into the Ivy League of the music
business and will be able to challenge veteran Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL). The
software produced by Melodeo enables a person to scan their iTunes library and
play their favorite numbers. 

Hewlett-Packard, the world`s leading server and personal computer manufacturer,
has already entered the digital music business in partnership with mobile music
startup company Omnifone Ltd. The companies have launched a subscription music
service business in Europe. 

As per a new report published by the representative body of the worldwide
recording industry, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry
(IFPI), global digital music trade revenues reached US$4.2 billion in 2009, up
12.0% on a year-over-year basis. The IFPI also stated that more than a quarter
of all revenues for the recorded music industry worldwide are now coming from
digital channels. 

Although online music piracy is a threat, governments all over are gradually
implementing strict regulations for Internet service providers. France, South
Korea and Taiwan adopted new laws to address the crisis in 2009, while other
governments including the UK and New Zealand have proposed new laws for adoption
in 2010. This is good news for music companies, as it will definitely reduce
revenue loss and add to their bottom line. 

The company is diversifying its business in every possible direction and
expanding from servers, personal computers, business computing, printing and now
music. Though slow, the company is surely moving towards becoming an end-to-end
IT provider with the adoption of all upcoming technologies. 

HP has always grown through strategic acquisitions. During fiscal 2008, the
company acquired nine companies, the largest of which was Electronic Data
Systems (EDS) for approximately $13.9 billion. The company`s Technology
Solutions Group (TSG) segment shifted its outsourcing services operations and a
part of its consulting and integration activities to EDS. We believe the EDS
acquisition will give the services portion of the TSG business a stronger
foothold to compete against its largest rival, IBM (NYSE: IBM). 

Hewlett-Packard`s second quarter EPS exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and
revenues enjoyed an upward trend, showing substantial improvement. The company
expects revenue to remain in line in the third quarter, and during the fiscal
year 2010. The company is through with the acquisition of networking major 3Com,
and will now be able to challenge networking leader Cisco Systems Inc. (Nasdaq:
CSCO). 

Although we remain positive about the company`s performance going forward based
on improvement in demand and the leadership position it enjoys in the PC
segment, we are not very confident about the company`s Printing business as
cheaper substitutes are present in the market. We maintain our Neutral rating on
the stock. 

Eni Ramps up in Indonesia

Italy`s oil and gas integrated Eni SpA (NYSE: E) has successfully appraised the
Jangkrik gas discovery in offshore Indonesia. Located about 70 kilometers from
the coast, the well encountered more than 80 meters of net gas pay in excellent
quality reservoir. The well produced gas at a tubing constrained rate of 17.5
million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) during the production test. 

Eni (the operator) and GDF Suez jointly control the block with a 55% and 45%
interest, respectively. They will proceed to assess technical and commercial
viability for further development of the field. 

The company conducts its major exploration and production (E) activities for
hydrocarbons in Italy, Croatia, North Africa, West Africa, the North Sea, the
Gulf of Mexico, the Middle East, the Caspian Sea, Australia, Latin America and
the Far East. 

Eni holds working interests in twelve permits in Indonesia, out of which it
currently operates six. A key part of Eni`s long-term business strategy relates
to its focus on playing a leading role in the natural gas market. 

Eni plans to invest approximately $72 billion in the 2010 to 2013 time frame, an
increase of 8% from the 2009 to 2012 plan. This increase was driven by new
projects in Iraq and Venezuela as well as Indonesia in the E space. 

With new fields continuously coming online across Eni's footprint and production
ramp-up in the existing fields, its near-term upstream production prospect is
gaining traction with a strong strategic rationale. We are currently Neutral on
Eni.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Goldman Charged with Securities Fraud

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) is in the news again for all the wrong
reasons. The company and some of its top officers and directors have been
charged with securities fraud, and a class action lawsuit has already been filed
by the Pomerantz Haudek Grossman &amp; Gross LLP in the United States District
Court, Southern District of New York. 

The securities fraud lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of the purchasers and
receivers of Goldman notes and/or bonds, alleges that the company violated
sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5
promulgated under it during the period from December 14, 2006 to June 9, 2010. 

Goldman has been charged with providing false and misleading facts regarding its
business model and the reasons for its accomplishments during the class period.
The company also allegedly failed to disclose the receipt of a Wells Notice from
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 2009. A Wells Notice is a
letter that the SEC sends to people or firms when it is planning to bring an
enforcement action against them. 

The securities fraud lawsuit alleges that as a result of such misstating of
facts, the company`s securities had been trading during the relevant period at
prices that were artificially puffed up. Following its exposure, the price of
Goldman securities dropped substantially. 

A few days ago, the SEC postponed Goldman`s trial date for civil-fraud
litigation to July 19, 2010 from June 21, 2010. Goldman had been charged by the
SEC for misstating facts and selling poor quality subprime investments to its
customers in 2006, without disclosing the risk factors, including the vital role
of Paulson &amp; Co., a prime hedge fund, in the portfolio selection process. 

Additionally, the SEC accused the investment bank of creating a collateral debt
obligation (CDO) called Abacus 2007-AC1, which comprised mortgage-backed
securities. 

Following up on its civil fraud litigation against Goldman, the SEC is also
planning to probe into the investment practices of other industry giants such as
Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) and JPMorgan Chase &amp;
Co. (NYSE: JPM). 

While we believe that Goldman is well positioned to reap the benefits of its
strategic cost-balancing initiatives and attractive business mix, we think that
such allegations and charges against the company somewhat dampen investors`
confidence in the stock. 

Also, if such charges are affirmed, the company needs to initiate damage control
and incur huge charges. Therefore, such issues are not only a blow to the
company`s reputation, but also a dent in its financials. 

Nike Q4 Earnings Meets View

Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE) recorded robust fiscal 2010 fourth-quarter earnings that
rose 53% to $521.9 million or $1.06 per share from $341.4 million or 70 cents
per share in the year-ago quarter. Quarterly earnings matched the Zacks
Consensus Estimate, which moved up a penny in just the past week as 5 of 18
covering analysts raised expectations. 

Quarterly Details

Despite macroeconomic headwinds, Nike`s total revenues grew 8% to $5.1 billion
from $4.7 billion in the prior year quarter. The company continued to benefit
from its strategy of consistently focusing on innovative products that provide a
competitive edge over rivals. 

During the quarter, Nike witnessed revenue growth across all geographic regions,
except Japan. Revenue growth was primarily led by Emerging Markets, which rose
47% year-over-year, followed by growth in China, Central and Eastern Europe,
North America and Western Europe of 12%, 9%, 4% and 2%, respectively. 

Nike`s quarterly gross profit grew 18% year-over-year to $2.4 billion, while
gross margin expanded 400 basis points (bps) to 47.4%. The solid growth was due
primarily to higher in-line product margins, favorable product mix and reduction
in discounted close-out sales. Global inventories fell 13% year-over-year to
$2.0 billion, mainly due to prudent inventory management policies and efforts to
align merchandise mix in-line with sales trends. 

Nike ended the quarter with cash and equivalents of $3.1 billion, and a healthy
long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio of 4.4%, compared to a cash balance of
$2.3 billion and long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio of 5.1% in the year-ago
period. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.9 million shares for about
$216 million as part of its four-year $5 billion program approved in September
2008. 

Future Orders

Nike reported an increase in future orders scheduled for delivery from June
through November 2010, which increased 7% year-over-year to $8.8 billion. Future
orders measure customer orders scheduled for delivery in the coming season and
are a widely used metric to gauge the performance of retailers. 

Guidance

Moving forward, Nike is expected to benefit from its significant brand presence
through the ongoing soccer World Cup and the upcoming World Basketball Festival
in New York. The company expects revenue to increase by a high single-digit rate
in fiscal 2011 and by a low double-digit rate in the first quarter of the same
fiscal, both excluding currency impacts. 

However, Nike also stated that both top and bottom-line performance in fiscal
2011 is likely to come under pressure from unfavorable currency translations,
and rising costs of raw materials, labor and freight.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

5 Bank Stocks That are Headed Higher

While large financial institutions like JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM) or Citigroup
(NYSE: C) are in the headlines every day, those stocks are probably going to
underperform their smaller counterparts during the current cycle. Smaller,
lesser-known bank stocks are in a better position to benefit from the improving
economic backdrop for the banking business than larger banks. That`s because the
smaller banks are able to focus on conservative banking practices without being
distracted by trading operations, exotic financial products or international
capital flows. 

The banking industry has been experiencing strong growth over the last year or
so. This growth has come from improving credit conditions, a low interest rate
environment and weaker banks exiting the business. 

Improving credit conditions have resulted in a reduction of non-performing loans
and fewer charge-offs. Low interest rates have allowed banks to increase their
net interest margins. Banks that survive this difficult period are experiencing
solid growth in core deposits. These factors all contribute to banks generating
a higher level of earnings that are more stable than in the previous cycle. 

According to the FDIC's Quarterly Banking Profile, the banking industry had
earnings of $18 billion in the first quarter of 2010. That was the industry's
best quarter in two years. Also, over half of the banks reported year-over-year
net income growth. That`s the highest percentage since the third quarter of
2006. 

To be sure, there are several risks that are negatively-affecting bank stock
prices. These include macro issues such as the sovereign debt issues, high
unemployment, a double dip in housing and the sustainability of an economic
recovery. Those risks, for the most part, are already reflected in bank stocks. 

That said, the biggest risk banks are facing comes from regulatory reform, which
is currently being debated in Congress. Specifically, the Collins Amendment,
which was part of the Senate's bill, could result in significant dilution for
those banks that haven't repaid TARP or have a large part of their Tier 1
capital in the form of trust preferreds. 

While the risks facing banks are not overblown, it appears those risks are also
baked into current bank stock prices. That means if those risks don't pan out as
expected, there is substantial upside potential in smaller bank shares. 

Below are five bank stocks that should continue to benefit from improving credit
quality and generate strong earnings growth, while managing to side-step the
biggest risks facing the financial sector. 

Beneficial Mutual Bancorp (Nasdaq: BNCL) 

Beneficial is the fourth-largest mutual holding company in the U.S. with 68
branch offices and total assets of $4.7 billion. As of February 3, 2010, it
operated 68 banking offices in greater Philadelphia and New Jersey. 

BNCL earned $0.10 per share in the first quarter, easily beating the Zacks
Consensus Estimate by 4 cents, or 66.7%. In the last three quarters, Beneficial
has beaten expectations by an average of 83.9%. 

In the last two months, the 2010 Zacks Consensus Estimate is up 6 cents, or
23.1%, to $0.32 per share, while the Zacks Consensus for 2011 is higher by 3
cents, or 8.1%, to $0.40. 

Beneficial Mutual is a Zacks #2 Rank ('buy') stock that is trading at 33x 2010
consensus EPS estimates and 26x 2011 consensus estimates. 

Dime Community Bancshares (Nasdaq: DCOM) 

Dime Community Bancshares operates as the holding company for The Dime Savings
Bank of Williamsburgh, which provides financial services and loans primarily for
rent-stabilized apartment buildings. Dime has $4.1 billion in assets. As of
January 26, the company operated 23 branches located in Brooklyn, Queens and the
Bronx, New York. 

DCOM reported first-quarter EPS of $0.28, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate
by a penny. In the last two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2010 is
higher by 8 cents, or 7.1%, to $1.20 per share. The outlook for 2011 is up 6
cents, or 4.8%, to $1.30. 

Dime is a Zacks #2 Rank ('buy') stock that trades at 11x 2010 consensus EPS
estimates and 10x 2011 consensus estimates. 

First Niagara Financial Group (Nasdaq: FNFG) 

First Niagara Financial Group operates as the holding company for First Niagara
Bank, which provides banking and financial services to individuals, families and
businesses. First Niagara has about $20 billion in assets. As of December 31,
2009, FNFG operated 171 bank branches, including 114 branches in Upstate New
York and 57 branches in western Pennsylvania. 

FNFG has matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two quarters. In the
last 60 days, the 2010 Zacks Consensus Estimate is up 3 cents to $0.87, and the
guidance for 2011 is up a penny to $1.12. 

First Niagara is a Zacks #2 Rank ('buy') stock that trades at 15x 2010 consensus
EPS estimates and 12x 2011 consensus estimates. 

Old National Bank (NYSE: ONB) 

Old National Bancorp operates as the holding company for Old National Bank,
which provides financial services primarily in Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky.
ONB has $7.9 billion in assets. As of December 31, 2009, it operated a total of
172 banking centers, loan production or other financial services offices. 

Old National earned $0.12 per share in the first quarter, beating the Zacks
Consensus Estimate by 7 cents, or 140%. This prompted analysts to boost their
EPS estimates for 2010 and 2011. The consensus for 2010 increased 17 cents, or
60.7%, and the consensus for 2011 climbed 10 cents, or 18.2%. 

Old National Bank is a Zacks #1 Rank ('strong buy') stock that trades at 25x
2010 consensus EPS estimates and 18x 2011 consensus estimates.

&lt;p&gt;New Organization Created to Focus on Global Unconventional Resource Development

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) announced today it has completed its
agreement with XTO Energy Inc., creating a new organization to focus on global
development and production of unconventional resources. 

Under the agreement, approved by XTO stockholders at a special meeting Friday,
the new organization will continue to be known as XTO Energy Inc. and maintain
its head office location in Fort Worth, Texas. 

Jack Williams, a former vice president of ExxonMobil Development Company, has
been elected president of XTO Energy Inc. Keith Hutton, formerly XTO`s chief
executive officer, is executive vice president of the new organization. 

"With this agreement, we are combining XTO`s skills, capabilities and asset base
with ExxonMobil`s advanced research and development and operational
capabilities, global scale and financial capacity," said Williams. "The new
organization will create the opportunity for more jobs and investment in the
development and production of clean-burning natural gas both here in the United
States and around the world." 

Nearly all of XTO`s 3,300 employees are transitioning to the new organization,
which Hutton said is the result of what has been a key focus of transition
planning since the agreement was announced in December 2009. 

"ExxonMobil worked closely with XTO`s management to ensure employees understand
how important they are to the future success of the new organization," said
Hutton. "XTO`s employees bring the ability to enhance ExxonMobil`s global
operations through the vast experience they have gained in innovative and
efficient resource development in the United States." 

Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, said this
conclusion of the agreement is good news for the United States as it will help
produce more of America`s own clean-burning natural gas, which brings with it
innovation, technology, investment and jobs. 

"ExxonMobil`s Energy Outlook indicates that gas will grow more rapidly than any
other major energy source given its availability and relatively low carbon
profile," said Tillerson. "We believe gas is the fuel of choice for power
generation, producing fewer greenhouse gas emissions than other
electrical-generation fuels, such as coal." 

The agreement received regulatory clearance from the competition authorities in
March. 

Under the agreement, each outstanding common share of XTO has been converted
into the right to receive 0.7098 shares of ExxonMobil common stock, with cash to
be paid in lieu of any fractional shares. More information on the exchange of
XTO shares for ExxonMobil shares will be mailed to XTO stockholders in the near
future. 

XTO`s resource base is the equivalent of 45 trillion cubic feet of gas and
includes shale gas, tight gas, coal bed methane, shale oil and conventional oil
and gas production. These will complement ExxonMobil`s holdings in the United
States, Canada, Germany, Poland, Argentina and Indonesia.

ExxonMobil will conduct an analyst conference call on Thursday, July 8, 2010 at

&lt;p&gt;Landmark NYC Verdict Hailed as Socially Significant for Corporate Environmental
Accountability
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Greenberg Glusker today announced that Firm Partner Robert S. Chapman is a
finalist for the 2010 Public Justice Trial Lawyer of the Year Award for his
successful representation of New York City in a trial against Exxon Mobil
Corporation. The City charged Exxon Mobil with poisoning its groundwater and
drinking water supply with the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether
(MTBE). After an 11-week federal court jury trial, which was the first of nearly
200 MTBE cases nationwide to go to trial, Chapman and his team obtained a $104.7
million compensatory damage award holding the oil company responsible for the
groundwater contamination. 

"In this highly complex, high-stakes and high-profile trial, Bob showed us how
the art of the trial should be practiced," said Norman H. Levine, Managing
Partner of Greenberg Glusker. "This national recognition of Bob`s trial
excellence and courtroom strength is richly deserved, and even more noteworthy
because of the public interest issues." 

The October 2009 trial victory culminated a protracted battle with Exxon, which
mounted a deep-pocketed defense including complex scientific and technical
evidence designed to refute claims relating to the health effects of MTBE. The
jury found Exxon liable for product liability for failure to warn the public
about the dangerous nature of its product as well as trespass, public nuisance,
and negligence. 

Chapman served as co-counsel with attorney Victor Sher of Sher Leff, LLP, a San
Francisco law firm, with overall case oversight by Susan Amron of the New York
City Law Department, all of whom share in the nomination as finalists. 

"The current oil outpouring in the Gulf adds greater resonance to the message
our jury sent Exxon when they said a petroleum giant can`t get away with
polluting the city`s water," said Chapman. "I am grateful to Public Justice for
its recognition and salute their action and commitment to public law and access
to justice." 

Public Justice created and supports a nationwide network of trial lawyers to
pursue precedent-setting and socially significant litigation in the public
interest. Other nominees for the 2010 award handled cases involving the
constitutionality of California prisoners` health care and claims against Royal
Dutch Shell Petroleum for environmental and human rights abuses in Nigeria.
Public Justice will announce the winner of the Trial Lawyer of the Year Award on
July 13, 2010 at its annual gala in Vancouver, British Columbia. 

Chapman is a preeminent trial lawyer with an extensive track record of
prevailing in high-profile matters. He has litigated entertainment cases in both
trial and appellate courts for more than 30 years. He has obtained a number of
multi-million dollar trial court awards, including an $80 million jury verdict,
which is the largest ever obtained against a motion picture studio. His
litigation skills transferred readily to the New York venue and contributed to
this significant courtroom victory for cities and water utilities.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs reclaimed the top spot for mergers and acquisitions advice in the first half of 2010, underlining the Wall Street giant's resilience even as it battles U.S. civil fraud charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With global dealmaking still subdued, Goldman's (GS.N) advisory role on nearly $190 billion of transactions allowed it to retake the MA crown from Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which last year bested its arch-rival for the first time since 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary data from Thomson Reuters, released on Friday, showed global announced MA hit $976 billion in the year to June 22, in line with last year's subdued levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman worked on five of the year's 10 largest deals, more than any rival except Morgan Stanley, advising American International Group Inc's (AIG.N) American Life Insurance Co Inc (ALICO), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), and Allegheny Energy Inc AYE.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MA rankings are typically based on relationships built up over years, and deals that can take many months to craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the recovery is welcome news for Goldman as it battles the worst blow to its reputation in decades: an April charge from the Securities and Exchange Commission of civil fraud over a subprime mortgage-linked security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman denies any wrongdoing, but the episode has led lawmakers and others to query its commitment to a long-cherished principle of putting clients' interests first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of people are surprised by Goldman's resilience, particularly those of us in the boutique world whose marketing is based on the fact we give independent, unbiased advice," said Philip Keevil, a senior partner at Compass Advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But what it comes down to is the strength of the brand -- no board of directors, no CFO ever gets condemned for hiring Goldman Sachs," said Keevil, a former head of international MA at Salomon Brothers and head of European MA at Citigroup (C.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has mounted an aggressive effort to retain clients who might be spooked by the SEC allegation that Goldman failed to inform a client about a short-seller's role in packaging a subprime mortgage-linked security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman would still like you to believe the firm is run by Gus Levy or John Whitehead, who was famous for saying, 'Put the client first and the firm second.' But now it seems like everybody is a (trading) counterparty," Keevil said. "However, if you're prepared to accept that, they do an incredible job."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, whose MA business has been led by London-based U.S. banker Gordon Dyal since 2004, declined to comment on its league-table standing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A London-based head of MA, who declined to be identified while discussing a rival, said Goldman's legal difficulties simply reflected wider pressure on the industry and would not meaningfully hurt its advisory business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are great professionals, they are a tough competitor and I don't expect them to go anywhere," this banker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MURDOCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the other big Wall Street banks, advice to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp (NWSA.O) on its $12 billion move to take full control of British satellite broadcaster BSkyB (BSY.L) helped JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) claim top spot for European announced MA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan ranked third worldwide, as it did last year, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch stood sixth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany's Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), whose MA business is run from London by U.S. banker Brett Olsher and Norwegian Henrik Aslaksen, advanced to fourth place from eighth. It leaped to 4th from 18th place in U.S. MA, helped by advice to telephone company CenturyTel (CTL.N) on its $22 billion takeover of peer Qwest (Q.N) and advice to MetLife Inc (MET.N) on the $15.5 billion takeover of ALICO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keefe, Bruyette and Woods analyst Matthew Clark said Deutsche Bank emerged from the financial crisis as a "relative winner" in reputational terms, and has made a sustained effort to boost market share in corporate finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although bankers cautioned against drawing strong conclusions from a thin market in which a few key deals can lead to big swings in rankings, considerable movement was evident elsewhere in the league tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a role in the year's biggest deal -- Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's consolidation of his telecoms empire via America Movil (AMXL.MX) -- Citigroup fell to seventh place globally from fourth a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lazard (LAZ.N), which enjoyed a big role on Kraft-Cadbury last year, also dropped, to 10th from sixth, while UBS (UBSN.VX) and Barclays Capital (BARC.L) claimed top-10 spots after ranking 12th and 11th, respectively, for the first half of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Quentin Webb; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of International Business Machines
Corporation (IBM) and IBM International Group Capital LLC (IIGC), an indirect,
wholly owned subsidiary whose debt is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
IBM, as follows: 

IBM 

--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; 

--Senior unsecured credit facility at 'A+'; 

--Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; 

--Short-term IDR at 'F1'; 

--Commercial paper (CP) rating at 'F1'. 

IIGC 

--Long-term IDR at 'A+'; 

--Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; 

--Short-term IDR at 'F1'; 

--CP paper rating at 'F1'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's action affects approximately $41 billion
of debt, including the company's $10 billion credit facility, which is
essentially undrawn. 

The ratings and Outlook reflect IBM's: 

--Solid credit protection measures for the 'A+' rating category, especially core
(non-financing) metrics; 

--Significant liquidity supported by a solid cash position and strong and
consistent free cash flow; 

--Considerable recurring revenue from information technology (IT) services,
software and financing, which in aggregate account for approximately 50% of
total revenue and mitigate revenue and profit volatility; 

--Highly diverse customer base from both an industry and geographic perspective;


--Breadth and quality of product and service offerings, resulting in leading
market share in IT services, middleware software, servers and number two share
of the total disk storage market. 

Ratings concerns include: 

--Risk of core debt (non-financing) increases to achieve financial and/or
business objectives, such as sizable debt-financed share repurchases and/or
acquisitions, resulting in a material reduction of credit protection measures; 

--Consistent, material increases in cash dividends long-term, which could
pressure free cash flow and financial flexibility in the absence of commensurate
growth in profitability, thereby necessitating further increases in core debt to
fund acquisitions and/or share repurchases. 

IBM's total credit protection measures improved in the latest 12 months (LTM)
ended March 31, 2010 due primarily to a 46% decline in core debt to $4.1
billion, continued margin expansion leading to EBITDA growth of 4.8% despite a
3.9% decline in revenue and a lower interest rate environment. Total leverage
declined to 1.1 times (x) at March 31, 2010 from 1.4x in the prior year. Total
interest coverage improved to nearly 24x from 16x. In the past year, core
leverage (core debt/core EBITDA) declined to 0.2x from 0.4x and core interest
coverage improved to 65x for the LTM ended March 31, 2010 from nearly 34x in the
same period last year. 

IBM has superior financial flexibility and liquidity as of March 31, 2010
supported by nearly $14 billion of cash and equivalents, and a $10 billion
revolving credit facility that is essentially undrawn, which expires on June 28,
2012. Liquidity is further supported by strong and consistent free cash flow
(post-dividends), which increased to $14.1 billion for the LTM ended March 31,
2010 from $11.9 billion in the corresponding year ago period, despite a 7.3%
increase in cash dividends to $2.9 billion. Fitch expects IBM's free cash flow
to be nearly $15 billion in 2010 due primarily to continued profit margin
expansion, reflecting a more favorable revenue mix and continued cost
discipline, and improving top-line growth led by Smarter Planet solutions,
business analytics, growth markets and emerging opportunities in cloud
computing. 

Fitch expects IBM to continue to use free cash flow to pursue acquisitions to
further strengthen its position in the software and services industries,
aggressively repurchase shares and pay cash dividends to shareholders. The
underfunded status of IBM's worldwide defined benefit (DB) pension plans
improved to negative $8.1 billion (91% funded) at year-end 2009 from negative
$12.8 billion (85% funded) in 2008 due to a rebound in the return on pension
assets to 12% compared with a 17% decline in 2008, partially offset by an
increase in the present value of IBM's future pension liability as a result of
discount rate declines in several countries (U.S. discount rate declined 15
basis points to 5.6%). Excluding unfunded nonqualified DB pension plans, IBM's
worldwide underfunded status improved to negative $900 million (99% funded) at
year-end 2009 compared with negative $6 billion in 2008 (93% funded), thereby
reducing IBM's legally mandated minimum contribution to $800 million in 2010
from the $1.3 billion actually contributed in 2009. Fitch believes the company
has more than ample liquidity to satisfy the legally mandated pension funding
requirements, estimated at approximately $3.6 billion through 2014. Depending on
financial market conditions in 2010, the amount of legally mandated minimum
contributions could increase due to more frequent remeasurement of funded status
in certain non-U.S. countries. 

Total debt was $26.3 billion as of March 31, 2010, consisting of approximately
$5 billion of short-term debt, including $2 billion of CP, and $21.3 billion of
long-term debt. Fitch estimates $22.2 billion, or 84%, of total debt is
attributable to IBM's global financing business with the remaining debt
attributable to core (non-financing) operations. IBM has minimal debt maturing
in the remainder of 2010 (approximately $500 million) followed by $4 billion of
maturities in 2011. Fitch believes IBM will refinance the vast majority of the
upcoming debt maturities in order to maintain a targeted debt/equity ratio of
approximately 7x for the financing business and maintain a permanent amount of
core debt in the capital structure. 

For the purpose of financial evaluation, Fitch analyzes IBM's core business and
financing activities separately since they are capitalized differently and have
dissimilar cash flow characteristics. Although IBM Global Finance (IGF)
contributed approximately 9% to IBM's pre-tax earnings in 2009, it constituted
the largest component of IBM's balance sheet, representing approximately 32% of
total assets and 36% of total liabilities at year-end 2009. 

The main purpose of IGF is to facilitate clients' acquisition of IBM systems,

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs reclaimed the top spot for mergers and acquisitions advice in the first half of 2010, underlining the Wall Street giant's resilience even as it battles U.S. civil fraud charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With global dealmaking still subdued, Goldman's (GS.N) advisory role on nearly $190 billion of transactions allowed it to retake the MA crown from Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which last year bested its arch-rival for the first time since 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary data from Thomson Reuters, released on Friday, showed global announced MA hit $976 billion in the year to June 22, in line with last year's subdued levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman worked on five of the year's 10 largest deals, more than any rival except Morgan Stanley, advising American International Group Inc's (AIG.N) American Life Insurance Co Inc (ALICO), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), and Allegheny Energy Inc AYE.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MA rankings are typically based on relationships built up over years, and deals that can take many months to craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the recovery is welcome news for Goldman as it battles the worst blow to its reputation in decades: an April charge from the Securities and Exchange Commission of civil fraud over a subprime mortgage-linked security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman denies any wrongdoing, but the episode has led lawmakers and others to query its commitment to a long-cherished principle of putting clients' interests first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of people are surprised by Goldman's resilience, particularly those of us in the boutique world whose marketing is based on the fact we give independent, unbiased advice," said Philip Keevil, a senior partner at Compass Advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But what it comes down to is the strength of the brand -- no board of directors, no CFO ever gets condemned for hiring Goldman Sachs," said Keevil, a former head of international MA at Salomon Brothers and head of European MA at Citigroup (C.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has mounted an aggressive effort to retain clients who might be spooked by the SEC allegation that Goldman failed to inform a client about a short-seller's role in packaging a subprime mortgage-linked security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman would still like you to believe the firm is run by Gus Levy or John Whitehead, who was famous for saying, 'Put the client first and the firm second.'

&lt;p&gt;CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - China's Taikang Life Insurance Co said on Saturday a deal by an investing arm of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to buy AXA's $1.05 billion stake in Taikang was in the final stages of negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal could give Goldman a substantial stake in China's No.4 life insurer and allow France's AXA (AXAF.PA) to shed a non-core asset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The negotiations are in the final stages and we expect to make an announcement some time soon," Chen Dongshen, chief executive officer of Taikang Life told Reuters on the sidelines of the Fortune Global Forum conference in Cape Town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheng declined to confirm the price of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese authorities will give the acquisition a thorough final check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the deal could give Goldman a key foothold in the fast-growing economy's burgeoning insurance market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China Life Insurance Co Ltd 601628.SS. is the market leader in the world's most populous country, where the Communist government is increasingly encouraging people to buy insurance as Beijing reforms its healthcare system for the sake of social stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen said Taikang Life would list in the next three years as it seeks to expand its market share and position to be the third largest insurer in the country within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sooner the better, but probably not tomorrow. Probably in about three years," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheng said Taikang Life has about 24 million customers, 60 percent of whom are in the country's cities and 40 percent from the rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheng said this year his company, which he founded 14 years ago, would grow its market share to 10 percent from 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further growth would be unlikely because of the stiff competition in the insurance sector, which has exploded as incomes have improved in the country of some 1.5 billion people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen said he saw new growth of his business driven by demand from the rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He who occupies the rural market will be the big winner over the next ten years," Chen told delegates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the next ten years, our society will change, the rural areas will become even more integrated to the urban areas and differences between the two will diminish gradually."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheng said rural dwellers ranked insurance policies as a key must-get item next to cars and houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheng's company had life insurance policy outlets in most villages, standing side by side with veterinary and stations for giving advice to farmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He estimated China's large agrarian rural population at 700 million, and said many of these would be urbanized and drawn into the country's fast-expanding cities over the next ten years, accelerating their incomes and purchasing power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On investing in China, Cheng said the recipe to success in the vast country was partnering or buying shares in an established market player, rather than going it alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When a foreign company comes in the best way to success is to partner with a big Chinese company, we have seen some examples of companies that have failed going it alone," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ron Askew)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney is going retro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting Monday, its kid-targeted Radio Disney network will air a scripted serial called "My Dream," a contemporary story on a format reminiscent of the 1940s, before TV was pervasive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Depression-era radio serials that typically featured episodes lasting 30 minutes, episodes of "My Dream" will last just 90 seconds each. "Bite-size chunks," as Radio Disney GM Michael Riley put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An original episode will debut each day, five days a week, for a month. Each episode will air four times on Radio Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My Dream" stars 13-year-old Daphne Blunt as Kayla, a teenager trying to make a name for herself in the music industry while dealing with the usual struggles, responsibilities and emotional ups and downs of an everyday teen. Blunt's credits include stints on "The Young and the Restless" and "Big Time Rush."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney said it hasn't lined up a sponsor for the show. "We really wanted to capitalize on what makes radio ," Riley said. "It's a back-to-the-future concept."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is known for incubating successful cross-platform franchises; it's not inconceivable that "My Dream" could be a TV show someday. Right out of the gate, in fact, it will be an online property; the episodes will be available on-demand at Disney.com, which will feature video snippets of Kayla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Blunt's singing is part of the show, there are no plans to include her in Radio Disney's regular lineup of tunes alongside the likes of Miley Cyrus and Jonas Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft took another shot at rival Google today as it touted the support it provides for Office 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blog post Monday, Barbara Gordon, who heads Microsoft's customer service and support, argued that her company's offerings beat Google's hands down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The launch of Office 2010 earlier this month reminded me just how much this makes us different," Gordon said. "When was the last time you called Google for help recovering a lost Google Doc? Were you even able to find a number? My guess is, no. Google simply does not provide that level of service."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gordon went on to boast of Microsoft's various support avenues, including user-to-user support via online forums, support by phone and e-mail, and deployment technologies for enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google offers a range of support for its paying Google Apps customers that includes e-mail, emergency phone support, online forums and setup guides. According to the Google Apps site , the company responds to e-mail support on most issues within one business day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers and businesses using the for-free Google Docs can browse online help documents or leave a message on the online applications' Web forums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google declined to respond to Microsoft's allegations with a countering statement, but a company spokesman noted that there are resellers who provide higher levels of support, including end-user support, for Google Apps. With the price of that suite running $50 per user per year, businesses can purchase outside support from a reseller and still end up paying less than Microsoft charges for each Office license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Google spokesman also returned Gordon's shot about lost Google files, saying that Google backs up all documents, even those saved using the free Google Docs, at multiple data centers . The argument that files can become lost, he added, was "amusing" because it's only an issue on client-side software such as Office, where documents are saved locally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two giants have been butting heads for months. In May, Matthew Glotzbach, Google's enterprise product management director, kicked off the public battle by urging companies to forget about upgrading to Office 2010, and instead add Google Docs to their mix. "Google Docs makes Office 2003 and 2007 better," Glotzbach said then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft countered a day later , saying that Google Docs' integration with Office was inferior to the online Office Web Apps that rolled out earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Microsoft have also tussled over reports that the former is ditching Windows on its workers' PCs over security concerns, a claim that several experts characterized as disengenuous at best, bogus at worst .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Discover Surpasses Estimates

On June 24, Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) reported a fiscal second
quarter profit of $258 million or 33 cents per share. The earnings were well
ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate at 11 cents. The surge in profits was due
to a significant rise in the use of credit cards with reduced defaults, as well
as gains from the payments business driven by strong volumes. 

The company reported a loss of $132 million or 31 cents per share in the
year-ago quarter. However, results in the year-ago quarter excluded an after-tax
gain of approximately $295 million related to the settlement of an antitrust
litigation with Visa, Inc. (NYSE: V) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA). 

Also, Discover made the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) repayment of $1.2
billion of preferred stock. This resulted in lower earnings by 13 cents per
share in the reported quarter. 

H Block Surpasses Estimates

H Block`s (NYSE: HRB) fiscal fourth-quarter earnings from continuing
operations came in at $2.11 per share, up 7 cents from the Zacks Consensus
Estimate of $2.04. This also compares favorably with earnings of $2.08 per share
in the year-ago period. Net income from continuing operations for the quarter
was $692.4 million versus $707.8 million reported in fourth-quarter 2009. 

The better-than-expected results were aided by lower operating expense and share
buybacks. However, revenue suffered a decline from fewer tax filings. 

Including net loss from discontinued operations of $1.6 million or 1 cent per
share, H Block`s net income for the reported quarter came in at $690.8 million
or $2.10 per share, compared with $706.9 million or $2.08 per share in the
year-ago quarter. 

Revenues for the reported quarter were $2.3 billion, down 5.2% from $2.5 billion
recorded in the year-ago quarter. 

Another Pipeline Setback for Pfizer

Recently, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) halted studies being conducted with pipeline
candidate tanezumab, which is being developed for the treatment of patients
suffering from osteoarthritis. The global suspension comes in the wake of the
FDA's request to the pharma major to stop the osteoarthritis clinical program. 

The request was based on reports of the disease becoming more severe in a few
patients who were treated with tanezumab. The increased severity led to joint
replacement. 

We note that Pfizer is also evaluating the candidate for treating cancer pain,
interstitial cystitis, lower back pain and diabetic nerve pain. However, the
adverse event witnessed in the osteoarthritis program is yet to be observed in
the programs being conducted with non-osteoarthritis patients. The agency has
directed the company to present its assessment of the potential implications of
the adverse events witnessed in the osteoarthritis program in the studies being
carried out with non-osteoarthritis patients.

&lt;p&gt;   * Goldman sees 5 pct hit on regional banks' profit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Asset managers may also feel the pinch: Goldman
 (Recasts; adds details from Goldman Sachs note)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 28 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs analysts said the U.S.
financial reform bill could dent the earnings of big banks by
as much as 13 percent, while their regional counterparts may
have to brace for a 5 percent hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BofA Merrill Lynch said a new levy on large banks and hedge
funds to raise $19 billion to cover the costs of the
legislation will hit banks' annual normalized earnings per
share by 2 percent to 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said the new levy will hurt a select group of
financial firms with assets over $50 billion, including banks
and insurance companies and also hedge funds managing more than
$10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage expects asset manager Och-Ziff Capital
Management Group (OZM.N) to be the most impacted by the
regulation among public managers, followed by BlackRock Inc
(BLK.N) to a smaller degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the reform is largely positive for the exchanges
and for the inter-dealer brokers and electronic trading
companies, the brokerage said. "We see exchanges such as CME
Group (CME.O), Nasdaq OMX Group Inc (NDAQ.O), and
Intercontinental Exchange INC (ICE.N) as beneficiaries of the
reform, and believe more activity will shift onto their
platforms over time," the brokerage said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BofA Merrill Lynch said rating agencies may review many
large banks with the passage of the U.S. financial reform bill,
but most banks will see no downgrade or at the most a cut of
one long-term debt rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit rating agencies Moody's Investors Service and
Standard  Poor's had warned that U.S. regulatory reform could
spark bank downgrades as it removes government support for the
debt, which currently provides a boost of several notches to
the ratings over their stand-alone credit profile.
[ID:nN03254966]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The largest threat to bank ratings in the financial reform
bill is a provision that gives the federal government an option
to liquidate large banks rather than bail them out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, U.S. lawmakers hammered out the last pieces of
sweeping financial reform, agreeing to rules that require banks
to hold more capital and put new curbs on derivatives dealing
and proprietary trading. [ID:nN2593529].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Ultimately, we believe that some of the increased
regulatory and legal burdens will be passed on to customers
either in the form of annual fees or higher spreads on
lending," Goldman said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa may be everywhere you want to be, but not if you stick an "e" in front of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court on Monday ruled a man cannot use the "eVisa" name for an Internet business because it diluted the trademark of Visa Inc, the world's largest credit card network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the nine-year-old lawsuit, Visa had objected to the use of the name by Joseph Orr, who started running eVisa out of his apartment in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orr said the name derived from "Eikaiwa Visa," an English-language tutoring service he had operated in Japan. Eikaiwa is Japanese for English conversation, and eVisa was intended to suggest an ability to travel in the English-speaking world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his opinion for a three-judge panel of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski said Visa enjoys a "strong trademark" not weakened by the common use of the word "visa" in ordinary conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kozinski said that by using "eVisa" to describe a "multilingual education and information business," and posting an eVisa mark on his website next to a booklet resembling a passport, Orr improperly blurred the meaning of "visa."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are, for instance, many camels, but just one Camel; many tides, but just one Tide," Kozinski wrote, referring respectively to the cigarette and laundry detergent brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Camel cupcakes and Tide calculators would dilute the value of those marks," he went on. "Likewise, despite widespread use of the word visa for its common English meaning, the introduction of the eVisa mark to the marketplace means that there are now two products, and not just one, competing for association with that word. This is the quintessential harm addressed by anti-dilution law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bradley Booke, a lawyer representing Orr, did not immediately return a call seeking comment. A spokesman for San Francisco-based Visa had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa filed its original lawsuit in federal court in Las Vegas, where Orr's company JSL Corp was incorporated. The Ninth Circuit hears appeals from that court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Visa International Service Association v.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - One of the sleeper provisions in the 2,000-page financial regulatory reform bill may be one that is no more than six paragraphs long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brief section of the massive bill is aimed at stamping out some of the conflicts of interest that arise from Wall Street's packaging and marketing of asset-backed securities -- investment products backed by a pool of mortgages, loans or bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measure could give U.S. securities regulators the authority to ban a narrow class of so-called securitized products that enable Wall Street banks to take the opposite side of trade from a client, lawyers and other structured finance experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may eliminate a certain class of deals," said Jerry Marlatt, an attorney in New York with Morrison  Foerster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some on Capitol Hill have dubbed the provision the Goldman Sachs amendment because its legislative proponents introduced the measure after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) over its sale of subprime mortgage-linked security called Abacus 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The provision's language was drafted by Sen. Carl Levin, who raked Goldman top executives over the coals for the bank's role in putting together the Abacus deal and other similar collateralized debt obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levin used an April hearing by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to pillory Goldman for packaging and selling so-called synthetic CDOs that were designed as a bet against the housing market and the underlying basket of mortgage-backed securities included in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, after the measure survived the legislative sausage-making process, Levin said in a statement it would "prevent the obscene conflicts of interest revealed in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing with Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman was not immediately available. But during the Congressional hearing, Goldman executives defended their activities by saying it was consistent with acting as market maker and taking prudent steps to reduce its risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measure introduced by Levin includes a provision that permits banks to engage in "bona fide market-making in the asset backed security."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama has said he would like to sign a final bill by the July 4 holiday. But the timing of a congressional vote may be delayed by the death of Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIMBERWOLF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it will ultimately be up to the SEC to determine just how big an impact the conflicts of interest measure will have on Wall Street's securitization machine. As with much of the financial regulatory reform bill, it will be up to regulators to design the rule to carry out the broad mandates drafted by U.S. lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But look for Levin and his legislative team to keep pressing the issue in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometime after Labor Day, Levin's panel is expected to release a lengthy report that will detail all its findings about Goldman's CDO business. People familiar with the committee's work said the report will go beyond the testimony at the hearings and the hundreds of pages of Goldman emails previously released to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committee investigators are continuing to gather information about several controversial Goldman CDOs including deals called Timberwolf and Hudson Mezzanine, said these sources. The committee also has asked a number of former and current Goldman executives who appeared at the April hearing to clarify their testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People close to the committee and Levin said they could opt for another hearing to focus specifically on the Timberwolf, Hudson and other deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second hearing and the committee's report could provide guidance for the SEC in how to institute rules to prevent conflicts in the marketing of asset-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A legislative report is not binding on regulators, said Donald Langevoort, a securities law expert and professor at Georgetown University Law School. But he said it would be naive to conclude regulators do not take into account reports prepared by influential members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the prospect of an investigative report likely means another round of negative headlines for Goldman and any other bank that took part in similar kinds of CDO deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reported by Matthew Goldstein, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

notice in just a few days for shallow-water drilling there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. government effectively halted oil and gas drilling in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico because of the continuing leak from
the BP Plc (BP.L) well, but tighter regulations led Apache Corp
(APA.N) to declare force majeure last week on a Rowan (RDC.N)
shallow-water rig, or jackup. [ID:nSGE65O0F4]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Force majeure relieves a company from liability when it cannot
fulfill contractual obligations because of natural and unavoidable
catastrophes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New rules on restrictions from the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, formerly known as the Minerals Management Service, are
prompting energy producers to pull back from the shallow waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hercules said it was in talks with Chevron to resolve the
issue, and it would consider legal action if those talks did not
yield a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The force majeure on the Hercules 120, declared on June 23,
came one day after Apache declared its own force majeure on the
rig owned by Rowan Cos Inc (RDC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hercules 120 is earning a dayrate of $27,000-$29,000, a
range that was set to increase by $4,000 from July until the
contract ran out at the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; San Ramon, California-based Chevron also operates two other
rigs owned by Hercules, but those were not subject to the notice
of force majeure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Hercules fell 16 cents to $2.64 on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;Service Release 5 Enhances RES Software`s Automation and User Workspace
Management Solution
PHILADELPHIA--(Business Wire)--
RES Software, the proven leader in user workspace management, expanded its run
book automation offering today with the launch of RES Wisdom Service Release 5.
RES Wisdom Service Release 5 offers users support for migrating to the recently
released Microsoft Exchange Server 2010. With this new service release, RES
Wisdom continues to enable IT professionals to deliver any set of changes to
user workspaces, automate provisioning of IT resources and support Citrix
Workflow Studio, all from a single console. 

RES Wisdom enables IT administrators to use run books (prebuilt workflows) to
automate operations management processes, using logic to apply changes dependent
on specific parameters. Any combination of maintenance and provisioning jobs can
be chained into a single run book to automate complex sequences of changes
across a combination of workstations and servers. This ensures that end users
have the right resources available at any time or place, increasing their
productivity. RES Wisdom is easy to install on an administrator`s workstation
and can be deployed quickly across the network to all the workstations and
servers in the organization, regardless of location. 

Support for Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 is offered as the critical next step
in the evolution of RES Wisdom. As enterprises of all sizes begin to migrate
their end-users to the latest version of Exchange Server, they are now able to
control the management of the process from one central console. This essential
feature also enables advanced scheduling, which allows IT professionals to more
cost effectively automate, manage and maintain the migration process. The
migration of small batches of users can be scheduled at specific, convenient
times that will not disrupt workflow. 

"RES Software has been a committed Microsoft technology partner for five years,"
said Bob Janssen, Chief Technology Officer, RES Software. "With RES Wisdom
Service Release 5, our joint customers will now have support during the
migration and management of Microsoft Exchange Server 2010. This additional
feature further supports the ability of RES Wisdom to seamlessly manage the user
workspace environment and is critical in maintaining organizational productivity
and ensuring minimal end-user impact." 

In addition to the support of Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, RES Wisdom Service
Release 5 provides the following key benefits:

* Accountability - Reporting and audit trails show what happened, when, why and
how 
* Better business alignment - Run books designed, developed, implemented and run
in line with IT service levels, and in support of IT-to-business alignment
initiatives 
* Predictable results - Manageable task automation in support of IT operations
process that can cross organizational silo boundaries 
* Personnel optimization - Reducing the need for manually running mundane,
repeatable tasks 
* Reduced risk - Removing manual, error-prone human intervention 
* Security - Executing processes in line with policy and compliance regulations 
* Supporting best practices - Increasing IT operations efficiency by supporting
IT-to-business alignment initiatives 
* Support of Citrix Workflow Studio - The combination of Citrix workflows and
RES Software run books allows administrators to leverage the power of Citrix
Workflow Studio with increased scalability and ease of use

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs started coverage of the U.S. solar sector with a "neutral" view, saying higher-than-expected demand and decline in equipment prices will accelerate the shift in profit share from high-cost European manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBT Further Distinguishes Itself by Earning a Microsoft Competency in
ISV/Software Solutions and Microsoft Business Solutions
CEDAR PARK, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Integrated Bank Technology (IBT), a company that specializes in providing core
processing, imaging software applications and a comprehensive suite of products
for financial institutions, today announced it has attained Gold Certified
Partner status in the Microsoft Partner Program with a competency in
ISV/Software Solutions and Business Solutions Competency, recognizing IBT`s
expertise and impact in the technology marketplace. As a Gold Certified Partner,
IBT has demonstrated expertise with Microsoft technologies and a proven ability
to meet customers` needs. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners receive a rich set
of benefits, including access, training and support, giving them a competitive
advantage in the channel. 

"We are extremely pleased to have attained Gold Certified Partner status in the
Microsoft Partner Program. This allows us to clearly promote our expertise and
relationship with Microsoft to our customers," said Mike Golebiowski, IBT
President. "The benefits provided through our Gold Certified Partner status will

"Customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the gap between
their business demands and technology capabilities," said Allison Watson,

IBT as a new Gold Certified Partner for demonstrating its expertise in providing
customer satisfaction using Microsoft products and technology." 

As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner status, IBThad
to declare a Microsoft Competency. Microsoft Competencies are designed to help
differentiate a partner`s capabilities with specific Microsoft technologies to
customers looking for a particular type of solution. Each Competency has a
unique set of requirements and benefits, formulated to accurately represent the
specific skills and services that partners bring to the technology industry.
Within select Competencies, there are Specializations that focus on specific
solution areas that recognize deeper expertise within that Competency. Serving
as a specialized path to earning those Competencies, Specializations give direct
access to the tools and resources that support that specific area of focus. 

The Unified Communications Solutions Competency is intended for partners that
have an aptitude for Microsoft Unified Communications technologies and have the
ability to streamline communications between people and organizations,
regardless of medium, platform, device, or location. Partners that have attained
this competency have demonstrated expertise in planning, deploying, and managing

unified messaging, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) call management, and
audio-video-Web conferencing; all using Microsoft Unified Communications
technologies, including Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Office
Communications Server. 

"Microsoft unified communications solutions harness the power of software to
help streamline communications between people, whether down the hall or across
continents. These technologies allow organizations to adapt to changing business
needs with a secure, extensible platform that spans the communication modes of
e-mail, voicemail, calendaring, telephony, instant messaging, and conferencing,"
said Eric Swift, Senior Director of product management for the Unified
Communications Group at Microsoft Corp. "Leading companies need partners, such
as IBT, they can trust to deliver unified communications on the Microsoft

&lt;p&gt;New Leading-Edge Certification Builds Institutional Relevance, Strengthens
Academic Curriculum and Prepares Students for the Workforce as Microsoft Office
2010 Experts 
DENVER--(Business Wire)--
Certiport (www.certiport.com), the official test delivery solution provider for
the global workforce and academic markets, today announced the availability of
the Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) 2010 certification, an industry
recognized, standards-based credential for validating Microsoft Office 2010
skills. 

The Microsoft Office Specialist certification is the premier credential chosen
by individuals seeking to validate their skills and advance their careers. It
enables individuals to tap the full features and functionality of the Microsoft
Office 2010 system resulting in heightened confidence, credibility and
differentiation. MOS helps students to validate their skills, advance in the
classroom and prepare for a 21st century workforce. 

Encouraging teachers and students to quickly migrate to the recently released
Microsoft 2010 certification will also help strengthen institution curriculum
and programs with industry-standard applications as the basic platform for
learning and testing. 

Details about the certification: www.certiport.com/MOS2010

Video News Release: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAvgOaba9Ws

Certiport provides Microsoft users easy access to the relevant certification

classroom," said Ray Kelly, chief executive officer, Certiport. "Over 1 million
Office certification exams are delivered every year. As they embrace new
technology, both individuals and academic institutions show they are at the top
of their field and are ready to put these skills to work." 

MOS 2010 will impact the academic community by:

* Allowing students to experience greater success in the classroom and enter the
workforce with an important advantage over other job candidates. 
* Giving teachers a powerful tool for measuring and developing digital literacy
among their students, while earning their own certification for professional
development. 
* Strengthening academic institutions with relevant, state-of-the-art learning
and cost-effective solutions so students can develop skills they will need in
the workplace.

"A significant gap exists between the supply and demand of office professionals
with proficient technical abilities," said Lutz Ziob, general manager, Microsoft
Learning. "The new Microsoft 2010 certification program connects schools with
the professional world by enabling students to validate skills on Office
products with industry-recognized credentials needed in today's workplace."

Updates Interference Proceedings Between AVRS, Inc. (Senior Party) and Allvoice Development Ltd (Junior Party) and the Litigation Between Allvoice Development Ltd and Microsoft Corp.</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(Business Wire)--
Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. (AVRS) (OTCBB:AVOI) www.avrsys.com
announced today developments to the interference proceedings resulting from the
March 9, 2010 Declaration of Interference between AVRS`s Holt App. S.N.
09/351,542 ("the Holt application") as the Senior Party and Allvoice Development
Ltd (Allvoice)`s Mitchell Pat. No. 5,799,273 ("the Mitchell patent") as the
Junior Party. Charles Gholz and his team at Oblon Spivak, in conjunction with
the inventors and AVRS`s expert witness Todd Porter, have prepared and filed
five motions authorized by Administrative Patent Judge Sally Medley of the Board
of Patent Appeals and Interferences requesting judgments that all of Allvoice`s
claims in interference are unpatentable over a prior AVRS patent ("the Holt
patent"), AVRS`s Digital Dictate product, for lack of enablement, for
indefiniteness, and for lack of support for their means-plus-function claims. 

The Mitchell patent is the subject of a lawsuit that Allvoice filed against
Microsoft in August 2009 in which Allvoice alleged infringement of Allvoice`s
Mitchell patent. On March 25, 2010, Microsoft filed a motion to stay its
litigation with Allvoice in the Eastern District of Texas (6:09-cv-366), pending
the completion of the interference proceedings between the Mitchell patent and
the Holt application. That motion was denied on June 4, 2010. The management of
AVRS believes that the denial of that motion will make the result of the
interference more important to Microsoft. 

The inventors and AVRS were subpoenaed by both Allvoice and Microsoft for
depositions in the litigation. Mr. McCabe (also of Oblon Spivak) filed a motion
for a protective order in the Texas court limiting the scope of the discovery of
AVRS requested by Allvoice and Microsoft. Even though it bears the burden of
proof, Microsoft agreed to limit the scope of the discovery that it requested.
However, Allvoice continues to seek discovery on issues that have nothing to do
with Digital Dictate or the Holt patent. 

In its opposition to AVRS`s motion for a protective order, Allvoice relied on
the fact that it had filed a motion for reconsideration in the interference
again asserting that the declaration of the interference was unlawful. However,
a three-judge panel of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interference (including
Judge Medley) denied Allvoice`s request for reconsideration on June 18, 2010. 

President and CEO Walter Geldenhuys said, "The development of our speech
recognition technology dates back to 1994. We are as committed to that field
today as the day we started. We achieved remarkable goals with limited capital
resources, including the issuance of a second patent in 2009 and the declaration
of interference in March 2010. We understand the need for timely news and expect
to post periodic updates as events unfold. The AVRS team, in conjunction with
Oblon Spivak, has worked extremely hard sorting through volumes of documents. I
am very pleased with the progress made in the interference and our participation
in the Allvoice v Microsoft case and expect the process to move forward in a
timely manner. We are actively evaluating companies that we believe are
profiting from our patented technology. This is a crucial step in the process.

 (Adds Dimon comments on strength of recovery, regulatory

the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, on Tuesday began a
program to cut the rates it charges small businesses for loans
-- if the businesses hire new employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For each new employee a small business hires -- up to a
maximum of three -- the bank will cut the rate on its Chase
loan by 0.5 percentage point, it said in a statement.
Businesses will also get a discount for opening a checking
account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A small-business owner could save about $4,000 over three
years on an outstanding balance of $65,000 with the discounts,
according to JPMorgan estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We know how important it is to help small businesses
because they are core to the U.S. economy," JPMorgan Chief
Executive Dimon said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's average rate on a small-business loan is about 6
percent, a spokesman said. The average rate on a small-business
loan across U.S. banks is about 5.5 percent, estimated Bob
Coleman, author of the Coleman Report on loans backed by the
Small Business Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawmakers have criticized banks for slowing the recovery by
halting lending in a bid to stem losses on loans. Bank
executives, including Dimon, have said in response that they
are still lending but loan demand has slowed because of the
recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) in November launched a program
with Warren Buffett, providing $500 million for education
efforts and capital to small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said last year it planned to increase lending to
small businesses by $4 billion to a total of $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-based bank said it loaned $2.1 billion to
small businesses in the first quarter, up 31 percent from the
year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking at an event to mark the launch of the loan program
at the bank's Park Avenue headquarters, Dimon told small
business owners that he is optimistic about the strength of the
U.S. economic recovery and he believes fears of a double dip in
the recession are overblown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When one small business owner asked Dimon why U.S.
President Barack Obama's administration isn't doing more to
help small businesses, Dimon said that he is "beyond the point"
of asking the administration for support, in an apparent
reference to the financial reform bill currently before
Congress. The bill will force JPMorgan to cut some of its most
lucrative businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think in some ways it's time to let business do its own
thing," he added, noting that economic and regulatory certainty
may be all U.S. businesses need to start growing.

&lt;p&gt; June 29 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) alumni
have for decades gone on to top leadership positions throughout
the business world and in government.

 On Tuesday, Bank of Canada said chief Mark Carney, a
Goldman alumnus, hired his former colleague Timothy Hodgson to
advise him on financial market reforms. [ID:nN29130637]

 Hodgson is currently chief executive of Goldman Sachs
Canada. He and Carney worked together at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc in New York from 1998-2000.

 Below are some notable former executives from the
investment bank, which is currently battling a major legal and
public relations crisis:
TIMOTHY HODGSON - Hodgson, who joined Goldman in 1990, was
named CEO of Goldman Sachs Canada in 2005. He begins his new
role on Sept. 1, for an 18-month term, and will work on
developing and implementing reforms to the repo and
over-the-counter derivatives markets and on increasing capital
levels at banks.
MARK CARNEY - After a 13-year career with Goldman in its
London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto offices, Carney was
appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003. In
November 2004, he left the Bank for a position as senior
associate deputy minister of finance. He returned to the Bank
of Canada in February 2008, when he was named its governor and
chairman of its board of directors for a seven-year term.
JOHN THAIN - The former co-president of Goldman Sachs left a
24-year career at the world's biggest investment bank in 2004
for stints running the New York Stock Exchange and Merrill
Lynch  Co Inc MERDL.PK. In late 2008, he sold Merrill to
Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), which fired him a few weeks
later. But in February, Thain got another chance to run a
company, when the commercial lender CIT Group Inc (CIT.N) hired
him as its post-bankruptcy CEO.
DUNCAN NIEDERAUER - The former equities trading executive
joined the NYSE as president and co-chief operating officer in
2007 after 22 years at Goldman Sachs. When Thain left for
Merrill in late 2007, Niederauer succeeded his former Goldman
colleague as the NYSE's chairman and CEO.
ROBERT RUBIN - Rubin was co-head of Goldman in the early 1990s
before joining President Bill Clinton's cabinet in 1992 and
eventually serving as Treasury Secretary. Rubin left Washington
for Citigroup Inc (C.N) in 2001, where he became chairman of
the executive committee. In late 2007, Rubin took on the role
of nonexecutive chairman after CEO Chuck Prince resigned under
pressure. He left Citigroup in January 2009, but has continued
to face criticisms for pushing the bank to risk more of its own
money in trades, which ended up triggering billions of dollars
of writedowns.
HENRY "HANK" PAULSON - The former U.S. Treasury Secretary
presided over the worst of the financial crisis and several
controversial government rescue programs. Paulson joined
Goldman Sachs in 1974 and became its chief executive in 1999,
remaining in the role until President George W. Bush appointed
him to his cabinet in 2006.
JON CORZINE - Corzine, who lost his reelection bid as the
Democratic governor of New Jersey last year, was named CEO of
MF Global Holdings Ltd MF.N in March. Corzine joined Goldman
Sachs as a bond trader in 1975 and worked his way up to co-CEO
with Paulson. He played a key role in pushing the white-shoe
partnership to become a publicly traded bank in 1999, although
he was ousted by Paulson.
DANIEL OCH - The former star Goldman trader left to co-found
and head up Och-Ziff Capital Management, which in 2007 became
the first U.S. hedge-fund-only company to go public.
ROBERT STEEL - Steel, who became president and CEO of Wachovia
Corp in July 2008, sold the company to Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N)
later that year. He left the company but remains on Wells'
board of directors. Steel was U.S. Treasury undersecretary for
domestic finance, under Paulson, and was a Goldman vice
chairman when Paulson was CEO.
ROBERT KAPLAN - The former vice chairman and head of Goldman's
investment banking and investment management businesses is a
professor at Harvard Business School and a senior advisor to
Berkshire Partners LLC.
JOHN THORNTON - Along with Thain, he was formerly president and
co-chief executive of Goldman Sachs. After "the two Johns"
quit, believing they would not ascend to the top spot at
Goldman, Thornton went on to be chairman of the Brookings
Institution.
EDWARD LAMPERT - A protege of Rubin in Goldman's risk arbitrage
department, he left to form one of the world's top performing
hedge funds, ESL Investments. He was nicknamed "the next Warren
Buffett" after he acquired Kmart for less than $1 billion,
using the retailer as a cash cow to make other investments and
reaping the value of its real estate assets. He later
orchestrated the $11 billion merger of Kmart and Sears Roebuck
 Co and is currently the chairman of Sears Holdings Corp
(SHLD.O).
CHRISTOPHER FLOWERS - Founder of the U.S. private equity firm
J.C. Flowers  Co. Flowers, who founded Goldman's financial
institutions merger advisory practice, left the firm in 1998.
Two years later he participated in the takeover of Japan's Long
Term Credit bank, which went public in 2004 as Shinsei Bank.
JOHN WHITEHEAD - A 38-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, he retired
in 1984 as co-chair and senior partner. He is the founding
chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp and was at one
time chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He was a
deputy secretary of state in 1985, a second-in-command to
Secretary George Shultz under President Ronald Reagan.
JOSHUA BOLTEN - A White House chief of staff under Bush, Bolten
was Goldman's executive director for legal and government
affairs from 1994 to 1999.

&lt;p&gt; * Panel looking at whether Goldman-AIG ties spurred crisis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * CEO Blankfein among a "raft" of executives interviewed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder and Kim Dixon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, June 29 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and
bailed out insurer American International Group (AIG.N) face a
rough two days of questioning about their destructive
relationship that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) will zero in
on the ties between Goldman Sachs and AIG, and how the two
financial giants sold derivatives that deepened the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The congressionally appointed panel begins two days of
hearings on Wednesday, headlined by former AIG Financial
Products head Joseph Cassano and Goldman President Gary Cohn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A key focus will be "how the interaction of these two
financial giants may or may not have contributed to the causes
of the financial crisis," Phil Angelides, chairman of the
commission, said in a call with reporters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has long been criticized for benefiting from the
U.S. taxpayers' bailout of AIG. Taxpayers pledged up to $182
billion to address problems at AIG's financial products
division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. and European banks that had purchased credit
protection from AIG were quickly made whole after the U.S.
government bailed out AIG. Goldman, as a major trading partner
of the insurer, was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the
government rescue of AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG said in March, 2009, that $93 billion had been paid to
banks, including $12.9 billion to Goldman Sachs, which was the
most received by any bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cassano, who has evaded public appearances since leaving
the bailed-out insurer more than two years ago, participated in
more than five hours of preliminary interviews with the
commission's staff, Angelides and vice chairman Bill Thomas
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He was at the center of this. He obviously knows a lot
about not just what they did, but the interrelationship with
Goldman Sachs," Angelides said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE ROLE OF DERIVATIVES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG Financial Products wrote a form of insurance, known as
credit-default swaps, on bonds created out of the home mortgage
loan market during the U.S. housing boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the loans began to sour and the bonds lost value,
firms that had taken out the insurance demanded collateral from
AIG, leading to the insurance industry's equivalent of a run on
a bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the financial regulatory reform legislation nearing a
vote in Congress, banks would be allowed to continue dealing
credit-default swaps, as long as they go through a
clearinghouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has found itself under fire stemming from its
marketing and packaging of derivative products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On April 16, the SEC charged Goldman with civil fraud
relating to the Abacus collateralized debt obligation, an
investment product linked to the performance of a group of
mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein later in April
faced tough questioning from U.S. Sen. Carl Levin during a
Senate subcommittee hearing in April about Goldman's other
mortgage-linked products that turned toxic during the financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, Goldman was criticized by the FCIC for
failing to be responsive to its requests for information. The
FCIC said Goldman dumped some 2.5 billion pages of digital
documents on the commission in response to a request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The commission said on Tuesday that Goldman has been better
about responding to requests, but that there were still
information outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EXECUTIVES TAKE STAND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The commission said that a "raft" of Goldman executives,
including Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, also participated in
preliminary interviews for this week's derivatives-focused
hearing. Blankfein, who testified before the commission in
January, is not scheduled to participate in this week's
hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among those due to appear are Goldman Chief Financial
Officer David Viniar, former AIG Chief Executive Martin
Sullivan, and AIG Chief Risk Officer Robert Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCIC has been holding both public hearings and private
meetings with financial industry players, including investor
Warren Buffett, to piece together the causes and impact of the
financial meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The commission is supposed to issue a report by Dec. 15,
detailing the crisis that peaked in late 2008 after the
collapse of former investment banking giant Lehman Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report will serve as a public record of the historic
event and will not likely include thorough recommendations for
reform.

Blankfein, who testified before the commission in January, is not scheduled to participate in this week's hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those due to appear are Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, former AIG Chief Executive Martin Sullivan, and AIG Chief Risk Officer Robert Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCIC has been holding both public hearings and private meetings with financial industry players, including investor Warren Buffett, to piece together the causes and impact of the financial meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commission is supposed to issue a report by December 15, detailing the crisis that peaked in late 2008 after the collapse of former investment banking giant Lehman Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report will serve as a public record of the historic event and will not likely include thorough recommendations for reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder, Karey Wutkowski, and Kim Dixon in Washington; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman Sachs Canada CEO to be senior adviser&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Central bank chief Carney also hails from Goldman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Adviser Hodgson to liaise with banks on market reforms
 (Adds no comment from Goldman Sachs spokesperson)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Louise Egan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OTTAWA, June 29 (Reuters) - Canadian central bank chief
Mark Carney has hired a high-level executive at investment bank
Goldman Sachs Group Inc (G.N), his former employer, to advise
him on financial market reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of Canada said on Tuesday that Timothy Hodgson, chief
executive of Goldman Sachs Canada, will serve as special
adviser to Carney for an 18-month term beginning Sept. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carney and Hodgson are of the same generation and worked
together at Goldman Sachs in New York from 1998 to 2000. On
Tuesday Carney called his former colleague "one of Canada's top
investment bankers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He is widely recognized for his exceptional transaction
skills and understanding of how markets work," Carney said.
"The bank is privileged that someone of his experience has
chosen public service at this critical time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carney himself had a 13-year career with Goldman in its
London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto offices before going to
work for the Canadian government and later the Bank of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs alumni have for decades gone on to top
leadership positions throughout the business world, including
former U.S. Treasury secretaries Henry Paulson and Robert
Rubin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hodgson is leaving Wall Street's most powerful investment
bank after it suffered a major legal and public relations
crisis this year when U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
charged it with fraud in a civil lawsuit over its marketing of
a subprime mortgage product. Goldman has called the lawsuit
"completely unfounded".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANK CAPITAL REFORMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hodgson joined Goldman Sachs in 1990 and before his
appointment as CEO of the Canadian operations in 2005, he held
senior positions in New York, California and London, the Bank
of Canada said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his new role, Winnipeg-born Hodgson will work on
developing and implementing reforms to the repo and
over-the-counter derivatives markets and on increasing capital
levels at banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based in Toronto, he will head a team that liaises with the
country's major commercial banks, which are mostly based there,
to advance planned reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tougher bank capital standards and other financial market
reforms were high on the agenda of Group of 20 leaders who met
on the weekend in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They renewed a promise to overhaul financial regulations to
prevent future financial crises of the magnitude of the one
just experienced. [ID:nN27241260]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Canada's banks emerged largely unscathed from the crisis
due to conservative rules, but will still need to implement new
standards once the G20 signs off on them later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many countries are also taking a tougher look at
over-the-counter derivatives trading, which is being targeted
in the landmark U.S. financial-reform bill. [ID:nN28125377]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark Chandler, head of Canadian fixed income and currency
strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said Hodgson's expertise will
be useful as the central bank deals with financial reform
issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's a fair amount of discretion on how it's applied
country by country. So there's not going to be a boilerplate
solution," Chandler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You need people in place that know the particulars of each
country's financial system and what will and what won't work.
With that in mind, obviously it seems Mr. Hodgson has a good
view of that," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the decision drew fire from a one opposition lawmaker.
Thomas Mulcair, responsible for financial policy for the
left-leaning New Democratic Party, said Carney should reverse
the move and that 18-month contract left open the possibility
Hodgson could return to the financial sector after helping
shape the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If he wanted to come into the public service and be a
public servant with all of its attendant rules, which are quite
strong with regard to what you can do and not do after, that
would be fine," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's an 18-month contract, the guy is going to have
privileged access to all of the government's thinking on these
key issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman Sachs spokesperson declined to comment about
Hodgson's plans and Hodgson could not immediately be reached
for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Bank of Canada spokesman said he could not immediately
provide comment in response to Mulcair's remarks.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights UAL Corp. (Nasdaq: UAUA) as the Bull of the Day
and ABM Industries (NYSE: ABM) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity
Research provides analysis on Helmerich &amp; Payne (NYSE: HP), Chevron Corp. (NYSE:
CVX) and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Inc. (Nasdaq: BBBY). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We are upgrading our recommendation to Outperform on UAL Corp. (Nasdaq: UAUA)
based on the improved outlook for the airline industry. The company's first
quarter loss narrowed from the year-ago level and surpassed the Zacks Consensus
Estimate, based on good capacity and revenue management as well as improving
demand for business travel and premium service. 

The company expects to generate higher unit revenue growth for the second
quarter, driven by recovering business and international traffic and rising
fares. United Airlines has made significant progress by generating industry
leading unit revenue growth and operating performance. 

We expect the company to benefit from industry consolidation. The company
continues to strengthen its network, fleet and competitive position with the
reduced cost. Moreover, United Airlines will become the world's largest airline
following its merger with Continental Airlines. 

Bear of the Day: 

ABM Industries (NYSE: ABM) reported fiscal second-quarter EPS of $0.28, above
the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.26 but 12% lower than the prior-year EPS.
Growth at the Engineering and Parking divisions were offset by declines at the
other two divisions, Janitorial and Security. 

The company's top line growth remains restricted by the decline in commercial
office building occupancy and rental rates in the U.S. ABM depends highly on
acquisitions for growth, but has not indulged in any major acquisitions in the
past two years. 

Therefore, we downgrade our rating on ABM from Neutral to Underperform with a
target price of $20.00. Currently, we have a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell) on ABM
shares.

Venezuela Seizes Helmerich`s Rigs

The Venezuelan authority, led by socialist President Hugo Chavez, disclosed
plans to nationalize Helmerich &amp; Payne`s (NYSE: HP) 11 idle rigs in the country
last week. This follows a year-long dispute over pending payments by state oil
company PDVSA. However, the Venezuelan oil minister Rafael Ramirez said that the
government will pay Helmerich &amp; Payne for the fleet of oil rigs that was seized.


Helmerich &amp; Payne had engaged 11 rigs to be operational for PDVSA and completed
the contract obligations during calendar year 2009. Since then, these
conventional land rigs have been idle in Venezuela and have formed a part of the
company`s facilities. 

As of June 14, 2010, Helmerich &amp; Payne`s total amount due from PDVSA is valued
at $43 million (U.S. currency equivalent), including approximately $36 million
in invoices issued since the company changed its revenue recognition to cash
basis for its Venezuelan operation. 

Helmerich &amp; Payne`s management expressed surprise over the government`s
announcement as the company was willing to negotiate and sell the rigs. However,
the company maintained the stand that the dues should be cleared off. Over the
last twelve years, since 1998, Helmerich &amp; Payne had reduced the number of rigs
operating in Venezuela by almost 50%. 

However, according to the Venezuelan government, Helmerich &amp; Payne was the only
company out of 33 other oil services companies that declined to renegotiate
rates in 2009, when PDVSA failed to pay the bills due to a plunge in oil prices.
Hugo Chavez has been busy nationalizing a significant part of Venezuela`s oil
industry, beginning in 2007. The nationalization plan started with the major
heavy-crude projects worth billions of dollars, followed by dozens of smaller
service companies in 2009. Next in the pipeline for probable nationalization are
the five drills of the Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) venture. 

Helmerich &amp; Payne is currently rated as Zacks #3 Rank (Hold), implying that the
stock will likely perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the
next one-to-three months. This is supported by our long-term Neutral
recommendation. Helmerich &amp; Payne is a major land and offshore drilling
contractor in the western hemisphere, having an efficient drilling fleet with
major work contracts from well capitalized and large independent oil companies. 

Earnings Scorecard: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond

On June 23, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Inc. (Nasdaq: BBBY) reported first-quarter 2010
earnings of 52 cents a share, and handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate
of 48 cents. This marked the 5th consecutive quarter of improving trends on the
heels of double-digit topline growth coupled with higher margins. 

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond now expects to deliver second-quarter 2010 earnings between 59
cents and 63 cents a share. For fiscal 2010, earnings per share are expected to
rise by 15% over 2009. 

Estimate revision trends depict a positive sentiment among analysts for the
upcoming fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Over the last 7 days, 11 of the 24 analysts
covering the stock have revised their estimates upward, while only two have
moved in the opposite direction for fiscal 2010. A similar trend has been
noticed for fiscal 2011, where 9 of the 24 analysts covering the stock have
lifted their estimates while, only 3 have lowered their estimates in the last 7
days. 

However, for the second and third quarters, analysts` expectation remains
somewhat mixed. For the second quarter, 4 out of 20 analysts providing estimates
for the quarter have raised their estimates, with 8 analysts expecting earnings
per share to go down. For the third quarter, only 3 out of 21 analysts providing
quarterly numbers have lowered their estimates, while 10 moved in the opposite
direction.

&lt;p&gt; * Cassano participated in more than 5 hours of interviews&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Panel looking at whether Goldman-AIG ties spurred crisis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * CEO Blankfein among a "raft" of executives interviewed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder and Kim Dixon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, June 29 (Reuters) - A U.S. commission is
planning to focus on the ties between Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) and American International Group Inc (AIG.N), and how
derivatives transactions between the two financial giants may
have contributed to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a congressionally
appointed panel, will begin two days of hearings on Wednesday
headlined by former AIG Financial Products head Joseph Cassano
and Goldman President Gary Cohn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A key focus on the hearing will be "how the interaction of
these two financial giants may or may not have contributed to
the causes of the financial crisis," Phil Angelides, chairman
of the commission, said in a call with reporters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has long been criticized for benefiting from the
U.S. taxpayers' bailout of AIG. Taxpayers pledged up to $182
billion to address problems at AIG's financial products
division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. and European banks that had purchased credit
protection from AIG were quickly made whole after the U.S.
government bailed out AIG. Goldman, as a major trading partner
of the insurer, was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the
government rescue of AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cassano, who has evaded public appearances since leaving
the bailed-out insurer more than two years ago, participated in
more than five hours of preliminary interviews with the
commission's staff, Angelides and vice chairman Bill Thomas
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He was at the center of this. He obviously knows a lot
about not just what they did, but the interrelationship with
Goldman Sachs," Angelides said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The commission said that a "raft" of Goldman executives,
including Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, also participated in
preliminary interviews for the derivatives-focused hearing.
Blankfein, who testified before the commission in January, is
not scheduled to participate in this week's hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among those expected to appear are Goldman Chief Financial
Officer David Viniar, former AIG Chief Executive Martin
Sullivan, and AIG Chief Risk Officer Robert Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCIC has been holding both public hearings and private
meetings with financial industry players, including investor
Warren Buffett, to piece together the causes and impact of the
financial meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The commission is supposed to issue a report by Dec. 15,
detailing the crisis that peaked in late 2008 after the
collapse of former investment banking giant Lehman Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report will serve as a public record of the historic
event and will not likely include thorough recommendations for
reform.

&lt;p&gt;True Read of Capacity Reduces Costs &amp; Maximizes Investments in IBM Specialty
Processors
BETHLEHEM, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Today, PERFMAN announced the release of PERFMAN version 7.3.11, which includes
several product enhancements designed to improve the capacity and enhance the
performance of IBM zSeries Specialty Processors. With this release, PERFMAN
users can more accurately measure capacity consumed across all IBM zSeries
processors, which in turn affect the allocation of computing resources
associated with efficiently running business-critical applications. In addition,
PERFMAN users will be able to anticipate CPU limitations associated with IBM`s
sub-capacity software pricing model. These CPU limitations can inhibit
performance and negatively affect response times, which directly impact the
business. 

"We continue to invest in our IBM capacity planning, performance management, and
IT team collaboration solutions because of the significant performance
improvements that our clients experience," stated Pete Weilnau, CTO. "Our
clients are high-powered users who often ask for value-add improvements&#8230;and we
are delighted to develop as many of these as possible and deliver solutions that
improve response times, lower costs, and alert IT professionals to critical
factors that help smooth business operations." 

Many IBM zSeries CPUs have specialty processors, which are lower in cost than
general purpose processors, but whose effective capacity can vary significantly.
With this PERFMAN release, users have the ability to change the capacity ratings
of specialty processors on zSeries CPUs. As a result, businesses can more
accurately measure the capacity consumed across various types of processors. In
addition, using PERFMAN Analyst, the user has a consolidated view to keep track
of specialty processor metrics from multiple systems and better manage
performance. The business can also quickly assess the value of adding specific
types of specialty processors, as well as general purpose processors, to their
zSeries CPUs. 

Other PERFMAN enhancements in this release are advantageous for businesses that
have elected to use sub-capacity pricing, but want to make sure they are not
negatively affecting performance. Prior to sub-capacity pricing, IBM users paid
for software based on the total capacity of the machine. If they upgraded
capacity, software license fees would automatically increase. Sub-capacity
pricing saves software costs by putting a "cap," called the defined capacity, on
one or more of the machine`s LPARS. In certain circumstances, if an LPAR needs
more capacity than its defined capacity, business response time may suffer. New
PERFMAN charts prevent business disruptions by alerting the user when that
phenomenon is about to happen. 

PERFMAN v.7.3.11 is currently in beta and is included in the next release for
all PERFMAN clients.

team collaboration solutions for the most demanding IT infrastructures on the

proven cross-platform solutions boost IT service levels, lower costs and provide

&lt;p&gt;LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Hitched.co.uk, the UK`s leading wedding planning website, has teamed up with
Microsoft to use their new Silverlight PivotViewer software to enhance their
wedding venue search facilities. 

Dean Yardley, managing director of hitched.co.uk, said: "Since launching in
1997, our core purpose has always been to make wedding planning easier by
utilising the latest web technology. The launch of the Silverlight PivotViewer
from Microsoft enables us to provide an enhanced search facility for couples
looking for wedding venues. By using PivotViewer on our site, wedding planners
can easily manipulate our extensive venues database and custom search according
to their requirements. This process of filtering the wedding venue requirements
becomes visual, easier and frankly much more enjoyable." 

Silverlight PivotViewer ensures that hitched.co.uk`s extensive and ever
increasing amount of data can be handled in the most engaging way. Choosing a
wedding venue is a complex process which requires short listing potential
locations by only selecting the options that offer facilities which match the
requirements of those planning the event. Making the best choice of venue is
important financially for couples (the venue cost can often be as much as 50% of
the overall budget) and many guests will also invest emotionally in the
location. For so many reasons, a venue can make or break a wedding. 

Hitched.co.uk now allows the bride and groom to conduct this crucial short
listing in an interactive, dynamic environment, whilst being able to see the
photos representing the venues. Couples can find their perfect location by
searching over 2500 venues such as alcohol licensed places, overnight
accommodation availability, in house catering, and many other options. 

Brett Brewer, General Manager at Microsoft Corporation, said: "I was truly
impressed to see how rapidly hitched.co.uk was able to deploy our Silverlight
PivotViewer on their site. Not only is it an amazing showcase of the potential
for this type of visualization technology, but it is equally as impressive for
anyone searching for a wedding venue. Hitched.co.uk seems passionate about
bringing state of the art experiences to their audience, and we`re extremely
pleased that they found such a valuable use for PivotViewer so rapidly."

new technology allows users to find their perfect wedding venue.

&lt;p&gt;Redefines Children`s Retail Industry with Innovative Design Including All New
Disney&#8729;Pixar Cars-branded Ridemakerz Experience

PASADENA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Today,Disney Store celebrates the launch of its newly-designed store with a
grand opening event at The Shops at Montebello complex in Montebello, Calif.,
just outside of Los Angeles. A crowning achievement of The Walt Disney Company,
the high-tech makeover of Disney Store solidifies the retailer`s global
leadership in children`s retail and activates the future transformation of its
more than 300 locations worldwide. Among the many new attractions of the newly
designed store is the first-ever Disney&#8729;Pixar CARS-branded RIDEMAKERZ experience
which sets the stage for kids of all ages to build 1:18 scale toy custom cars
inside of Disney Store. Disney Store executives, stars from the upcoming Disney
Channel Original Movie "Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam" and characters from
Disney&#8729;Pixar`s blockbuster film franchise Toy Story joined the festivities and
greeted hundreds of Disney fans who waited excitedly for the opportunity to
experience the innovative new store. 

The Montebello store is the first of 20 newly designed Disney Store locations
that will open across major markets in the United States and Europe in 2010. The
4,800-plus square foot store`s floor-to-ceiling remodel now features multimedia
technology, interactive storytelling and Disney Store exclusive merchandise that
bring Disney`s most beloved characters to life for families in the local
community. 

"As part of Disney, we`re committed to the value of entertainment and exclusive
experiences," said Jim Fielding, president of Disney Stores Worldwide. "Disney
is setting a new standard for the specialty retail category by integrating
robust technology and creative store planning to make each visit customizable
and that much more memorable. This is truly an immersive, one-of-a-kind retail
experience for children and families that only Disney could deliver." 

Technology is integrated throughout the new store to create magical moments for
guests: 

The newly designed Disney Store is merchandised by franchise neighborhoods so
guests can easily shop by character or theme and is anchored by several "hero
fixtures" including:

* The Disney&#8729;Pixar CARS-branded RIDEMAKERZ attraction is a one-of-a-kind
immersive car building and customizing experience. Launching with three favorite
CARS characters -- Lightning McQueen, Mater and Sally -- fans use tools to
assemble their car, and their imagination to customize it with a wide selection
of rims, side pipes, hoods scoops, blown engines, spoilers and many more
accessories. Disney&#8729;Pixar CARS-branded RIDEMAKERZ toy vehicles will only be
available within the new Disney Store design and, later this year, at RIDEMAKERZ
retail locations. 
* The Disney Princess Castle with Magic Mirror - A child-sized princess castle
anchors the Disney Princess neighborhood and inspires kids to make believe. As
they walk under the iconic castle they encounter a magic mirror and with the
wave of a wand, they watch in delight as their favorite Disney Princess
character appears.

A customizable shopping experience:

The new store concept also includes the launch of an all new in-store
application where guests can customize their shopping experience. Accessed via
an interactive kiosk with touch screen, this animated experience gives users the
ability to navigate a 3-D view of all Disney Store and DisneyStore.com products
and discover the latest Disney Store news via video clips, articles, and social
media feeds. This application allows the Disney Store to share its news to
customers, who can then share information and in-store events via email, Twitter
and Facebook. 

The Disney Store Theatre: The newly designed storeswill also feature a theater
as part of its marquee attractions. Guests can pick from a selection of
pre-loaded content that will be updated regularly and can view classic and new
Disney entertainment, sneak-peek previews, music videos and more. The theater
will also serve for special in-store events such as reading time, scavenger
hunts and more. 

The "Pixie Dust Trail" and "Magical Trees": With its glistening blue glitter,
the Pixie Dust Trail leads guests through the store and to major interactive
elements as they enjoy a Disney-themed skyline and surrounding magical trees
which are programmable with changing colors, images, and music set to an array
of Disney themes. 

The newly-designed Disney Store is scheduled to open in the United States this
year at the following locations:

* The Shops at Mission Viejo in Mission Viejo, CA, is anchored by luxury
retailers and offers an extensive merchandise mix in a sophisticated atmosphere.
Disney Store will be located on the second level in a 5100-plus square foot
space. 
* Disney Store on North State Street in Chicago, IL, (Block 37 Complex) will
anchor the southeast corner of the center in 4,464 square feet on level one of
the mall. The complex features an eclectic mix of shopping, dining and
entertainment within a five-story atrium, located in the heart of Chicago`s Loop
between Washington and Randolph on State Street. 
* Freehold Raceway Mall in Freehold, NJ, offers a complete mix of department
stores, specialty stores, restaurants and entertainment making the property an
ideal location for the new Disney Store. 
* NorthPark Center in Dallas,TX, offers shoppers the best in every retail
category, and the newly-designed Disney Store opening this fall will represent
its premier children`s retail store.

Other locations to feature the new Disney Store design opening this year
include: Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, NY; Santa Monica Place in Santa
Monica, CA; International Plaza in Tampa, FL; Fashion Valley in San Diego, CA;
Disney Store in Union Square in San Francisco, CA; and a two-story Disney Store
in Times Square in November. 

With each new store opening in 2010, Disney Store will designate a day for 10
percent of the sales to be donated to the Make-A-Wish Foundation in the United
States.

SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--

&lt;p&gt;  METHUEN, MA, Jun 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
RAID Incorporated, an end-to-end high-performance solutions provider
specializing in leading-edge technologies, today announced that it signed
an OEM agreement with IBM to integrate the IBM General Parallel File
System(TM) (GPFS(TM)) with RAID's end-to-end high-performance computing
and technology solutions. Through this agreement, RAID clients will gain
access to the most advanced parallel file system in the industry.

    GPFS is a high-performance, extremely scalable clustered file system
developed by IBM that provides reliable, concurrent high-speed file
access to applications running on multiple nodes of clusters. In
addition, GPFS greatly simplifies cluster file system administration and
includes tools capable of managing petabytes of data and billions of
files.
 "GPFS was invented by IBM Research more than a decade ago and,
thanks to continuous investment, now forms the basis for some of IBM's
most innovative high performance and storage solutions," said Dave
Jursik, vice president of Deep Computing for IBM. "Through this agreement
with RAID and others like it, GPFS is becoming widely available and
adopted across the industry."

    GPFS currently powers many of the world's largest scientific
supercomputers, including many of the supercomputers that populate the
Top 500 List of the most powerful supercomputers on the planet, and
commercial applications requiring high-speed access to large volumes of
data such as digital media, engineering design, business intelligence,
financial analytics, seismic data processing, geographic information
systems, and scalable file serving.

    GPFS can be used with AIX, Linux and Microsoft Windows Server-based
clusters or a heterogeneous cluster of AIX, Linux and/or Windows Server
nodes. It is the most mature parallel file system for Windows platforms. 

RAID Inc. is shipping GPFS version 3.3 today, along with their Xanadu(TM)
line of enterprise-class HPC storage solutions and patent-pending
StorageWatch(R) remote management and monitoring service.

    "The ability to integrate GPFS with our customized HPC solutions provides
RAID with much more flexibility and provides us with a very complete
portfolio of parallel file system options," stated Dr. Ercan Kamber,
Director of HPC Engineering at RAID. "IBM's commitment to GPFS and
support for multiple storage platforms provides RAID customers access to
a robust, well supported parallel file system."

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Jun 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Riverbed Technology (NASDAQ: RVBD), the IT performance company, today
announced an extension of its relationship with Microsoft through the
delivery of a comprehensive best-of-breed secure Web gateway and WAN
optimization solution for organizations with remote offices. The joint
solution combines Riverbed(R) award-winning WAN optimization technology
with Microsoft's Forefront Threat Management Gateway (TMG) 2010 solution
into a single appliance. This offering enables customers to virtualize
their branch office infrastructure and deliver LAN-like application
performance for branch users while protecting corporate networks from Web
security threats such as malware and spam.

    With this offering, Riverbed and Microsoft customers have the ability to
further virtualize IT resources at the branch in a cost-effective manner
while delivering end-to-end security. The solution takes advantage of the
capabilities of the Riverbed Services Platform (RSP), a virtualized
platform capable of running branch services, integrated with the
Steelhead(R) appliance hardware. RSP allows customers to deploy up to
five best-of-breed branch services on a single device, enabling
organizations to consolidate the hardware infrastructure at the branch
office, resulting in easier IT management and lower operational overhead
and power costs. In addition to the TMG security platform, Riverbed
customers have the ability to virtualize and run other Microsoft services
on the RSP, including Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008,
Windows Server 2003, Active Directory and DNS/DHCP. 

    "Microsoft has a long history of working with Riverbed to help our mutual
customers achieve strategic initiatives, such as virtualization," said
Zakie Mashiah, Principal Group Manager in the Server and Tools Business
at Microsoft. "This joint solution enables organizations to realize what
we call Business Ready Security through Riverbed best-of-breed WAN
optimization solutions fully integrated with our comprehensive Web
security solution in a way that is simple to manage and deploy."

    Customers deploying Microsoft's TMG security platform on RSP are able to
protect their businesses from malware and other threats, and enable
employees to safely and productively use the Internet. TMG provides
multiple layers of continuously updated protections that are integrated
into a unified, easy to manage gateway, reducing the cost of Web security
at the branch office. Forefront TMG 2010 running on RSP provides multiple
inspection technologies, including application and network-level
firewalls, intrusion prevention and malware filtering, to keep users safe
from Web-based attacks and prevent malware outbreaks on the enterprise
caused by inadvertent employee visits to malicious sites or by downloads
of infected files. Additionally, RSP integration with the Forefront TMG
Web Protection Service enables customers to enforce a consistent Web
security policy for application protection, malware inspection and URL
filtering within the branch. When taking advantage of TMG on the RSP,
enterprises are able to obtain all of these security benefits and WAN
optimization, while simplifying the management and lowering the costs of
its edge services. 

    "Customers are increasingly looking to virtualize IT resources at the
branch office in order to reduce costs and simplify management," said
Venugopal Pai, vice president, global alliances at Riverbed. "RSP offers
customers the flexibility to virtualize their key edge services such as
Microsoft's TMG secure Web gateway while realizing the benefits of
Riverbed best-of-class WAN optimization solutions. By partnering with
companies like Microsoft, Riverbed is the only vendor to offer a single
appliance that combines WAN optimization with a complete end-to-end
security offering."

    The joint solution is available today. For more information, please view

&lt;p&gt; * Historic disconnect between intrinsic value, share price&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Geico, MidAmerican, Burlington Northern to fuel growth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Slowing economy, big storms, Buffett retirement may hurt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Berkshire invested $5 billion in Goldman in Sept. 2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc
(BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) shares may rise 25 percent in the next year
as a recovering economy lifts profit and investors recognize
that Warren Buffett's company is undervalued, Goldman Sachs
analysts said, starting coverage with a "buy" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Christopher Neczypor set price targets of $152,000
for Berkshire's Class A shares and $101 for its Class B shares,
saying a "disconnect" between the market value and intrinsic
value of Berkshire is "close to a multi-decade high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) received a $5 billion
preferred stock investment from Berkshire in September 2008.
Buffett has praised the leadership of Goldman Chief Executive
Lloyd Blankfein and defended Goldman's marketing of securities
that led to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil
fraud lawsuit. Wall Street banks have procedural safeguards to
keep equity research units independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neczypor said earnings at Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire
will benefit from growth in auto insurance sales through
direct-to-consumer entities such as its Geico unit, as demand
for energy from its MidAmerican Energy unit increases, and as
more customers depend on shipping through its Burlington
Northern Santa Fe railroad unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also said recent acquisitions have reduced Berkshire's
dependence on equity investments, and "provides greater clarity
into the source of future value for the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the risks to this forecast include an economic
slowdown, losses at Berkshire's insurance and reinsurance units
from catastrophes such as hurricanes, and the ability of the
79-year-old Buffett to find appropriate successors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neczypor projected operating profit of $6,161 and $6,972

&lt;p&gt;  MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, Jun 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Violin Memory, Inc., provider of the world's fastest and most scalable
memory arrays, has achieved a leading Blade Server TPC-E benchmark in
partnership with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 and HP's latest ProLiant blade
server offering. The TPC-E benchmark simulates the workload of a
brokerage firm's central database. This benchmark demands both low
latencies and fast response times. It is utilized by vendors to
demonstrate system solutions for realistic and representative workloads
commonly addressed by large OLTP systems. 

    The full benchmark results are available at
http://www.tpc.org/tpce/results/tpce_result_detail.asp?id=110062101.

    "The combination of Violin Memory Arrays and the trusted and scalable SQL
Server 2008 data platform software demonstrated a new level of response
times and excellent price per transaction (Price/TpsE) numbers," said
Claude Lorenson, Director, Business Platform Division at Microsoft Corp.

    "As demonstrated by the TPC-E benchmark process, Violin Memory Arrays
facilitate dramatic application acceleration of critical business
applications," said Don Basile, CEO Violin Memory. "SQL Server 2008 is a
recognized database leader in demanding low-latency business solutions.
These results demonstrate the performance and efficiency benefits now
available from solid-state Memory Arrays, as opposed to using thousands
of spinning disks aggregated together."

    "Violin is in a unique position to benefit from the dollars allocated to
solid-state memory systems versus disk drive arrays," said Jim Bagley,
Senior Analyst at Storage Strategies Now. "The TPC-E benchmark
demonstrated sustained response times 10 times faster than other storage
systems, which underscores the unique flash management technology Violin
has developed for the 3200 series product line."

    About Violin Memory, Inc.

    Violin Memory is pioneering the future of enterprise solid state systems,
with memory arrays that accelerate business critical applications and
enable companies to virtualize and optimize their IT infrastructure.
Specifically designed for sustained performance with high reliability and
serviceability, Violin's flash-based appliances scale to tens of

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Les &#171; Changemakers d`Ashoka &#187;, ExxonMobil et le Centre International pour la
Recherche sur les Femmes (CIRF) ont annonc&#233; aujourd`hui les trois gagnants du &#171;
programme Femmes | Outils | Technologie :: Promouvoir le d&#233;veloppement des
femmes dans l`&#233;conomie &#187; (Women | Tools | Technology:Building Opportunities &amp;
Economic Power Challenge). Les gagnants ont &#233;t&#233; s&#233;lectionn&#233;s parmi 268 projets
en provenance de 67 pays d`Afrique, d`Asie, d`Am&#233;rique latine et du
Moyen-Orient. 

Les projets gagnants sont Bicycling Empowerment Network Namibia (Namibie), Lua
Nova Association (Br&#233;sil) et Solar Electric Light Fund USA (travaillant au
B&#233;nin). 

&#171; Le fait de voir une gamme aussi large de solutions innovantes catalyser le
d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique des femmes &#224; travers la technologie dans le monde
entier est pour nous une source d`inspiration &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Diana Wells,
pr&#233;sidente des &#171; Changemakers Ashoka &#187;. &#171; Nous sommes ravis d`avoir re&#231;u tant
d`id&#233;es aussi int&#233;ressantes gr&#226;ce &#224; ce programme, et nous sommes honor&#233;s d`&#234;tre
en mesure de soutenir le travail d`avant-garde r&#233;alis&#233; par les laur&#233;ats &#187; 

Les trois gagnants aident &#224; faire &#233;voluer la vie des femmes de diff&#233;rentes
fa&#231;ons. Solar Electric Light Fund USA (qui travaille au B&#233;nin) a con&#231;u des
syst&#232;mes solaires d`irrigation au goutte-&#224;-goutte permettant aux agricultrices
b&#233;ninoises de cultiver des champs pendant la saison s&#232;che qui dure six mois par
an en Afrique, am&#233;liorant ainsi les revenus et l`alimentation de leur famille.
Bicycling Empowerment Network Namibia offre une formation et du mat&#233;riel
permettant aux femmes d`organiser des ateliers de bicyclette communautaires en
Namibie pour apprendre &#224; r&#233;parer des bicyclettes - un domaine traditionnellement
r&#233;serv&#233; aux hommes. La Lua Nova Association d&#233;veloppe chez des femmes d&#233;munies
et maltrait&#233;es des comp&#233;tences pour subvenir &#224; leurs besoins et &#224; ceux de leurs
familles en concevant et en construisant leurs propres maisons. 

Le public a &#233;t&#233; invit&#233; &#224; voter en ligne pour les trois meilleurs projets,
provenant d`un groupe de 10 finalistes pr&#233;alablement s&#233;lectionn&#233;s par un panel
de juges experts en innovation, impact social et durabilit&#233;. 

&#171; Les concepts innovants de ce programme vont am&#233;liorer de mani&#232;re significative
la vie des femmes dans les pays en voie de d&#233;veloppement, en leur permettant de
devenir des actrices &#233;conomiques dans leurs communaut&#233;s et de mieux subvenir aux
besoins de leurs familles &#187;, a comment&#233; Suzanne McCarron, pr&#233;sidente de la
Fondation ExxonMobil. &#171; Nous nous r&#233;jouissons &#224; l`avance d`aider ces innovateurs
&#224; imposer leurs id&#233;es de fa&#231;on &#224; ce que les solutions propos&#233;es dans le cadre de
ce programme b&#233;n&#233;ficient &#224; un plus grand nombre de femmes &#187;. 

On pourra voir chaque gagnant sur le site Changemakers.com comme l`innovateur
ayant propos&#233; l`une des id&#233;es les plus brillantes pour favoriser, &#224; travers la
technologie, le d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique des femmes. Les gagnants seront
&#233;galement invit&#233;s &#224; participer &#224; des ateliers de travail organis&#233;s vers la fin
de l`ann&#233;e par les &#171; Changemers d`Ashoka &#187; et ExxonMobil. Ces ateliers
permettront des &#233;changes sur la fa&#231;on d`&#233;largir la port&#233;e des concepts retenus,
de mettre les innovateurs en relation avec des partenaires potentiels et des
opportunit&#233;s de financement, et enfin, permettront d`organiser des visites sur
site des projets prometteurs. 

L`orientation et les objectifs du programme d&#233;coulent &#224; l`origine d`une &#233;tude de
recherche intitul&#233;e &#171; Bridging the Gender Divide in Technology &#187; (Combler
l`&#233;cart entre les hommes et les femmes dans le domaine de la technologie),
r&#233;alis&#233;e par le CIRF et financ&#233;e par la Fondation ExxonMobil. Le rapport mettait
en relief ce qui doit &#234;tre fait pour am&#233;liorer la fa&#231;on dont les technologies
sont d&#233;velopp&#233;es et d&#233;ploy&#233;es pour permettre aux femmes de mieux r&#233;ussir dans
leur &#233;conomie locale, de devenir des dirigeantes influentes et de mieux subvenir
aux besoins de leur famille. 

&#171; Ces innovations vont &#224; la rencontre des femmes l&#224; o&#249; elles vivent. Elles sont
pratiques, et elles vont susciter des r&#233;actions qui aideront &#224; r&#233;pondre aux
probl&#232;mes auxquels font face les femmes dans leur vie priv&#233;e, leur travail et
leur communaut&#233; &#187;, indique Anju Malhotra, vice-pr&#233;sidente pour la recherche,
l`impact et l`innovation au Centre International pour la Recherche sur les
Femmes. &#171; Nous nous r&#233;jouissons &#224; l`id&#233;e de voir comment ces id&#233;es cr&#233;atives
vont g&#233;n&#233;rer des changements durables pour les femmes et les &#233;conomies. C`est un
moment d&#233;cisif pour le monde. &#187;

de la estaci&#243;n seca del a&#241;o en la naci&#243;n africana, aumentando su ingreso
familiar y la nutrici&#243;n. Bicycling Empowerment Network Namibia est&#225; brindando
capacitaci&#243;n y equipos para que las mujeres dirijan talleres comunitarios acerca
de la bicicleta en Namibia, lo que permite que se conviertan en expertas en
mec&#225;nica de bicicletas -un campo tradicionalmente dominado por los hombres. Lua
Nova Association est&#225; proporcionando a las mujeres desfavorecidas y maltratadas
las habilidades que necesitan para ayudar a sostenerse y sostener a sus familias
a trav&#233;s del dise&#241;o y construcci&#243;n de sus propios hogares.

"Los conceptos innovadores del desaf&#237;o har&#225;n mejoras significativas en las vidas
de las mujeres en los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo, lo que permite que se conviertan en
actores econ&#243;micos clave en sus comunidades y brinden un mejor sustento a sus
familias", afirm&#243; Suzanne McCarron, presidenta de la Fundaci&#243;n ExxonMobil.
"Esperamos poder ayudar a estos innovadores a ganar terreno por sus ideas de tal
manera que al final puedan llegar a m&#225;s personas con sus soluciones del
Desaf&#237;o".

patrocinados m&#225;s tarde en el a&#241;o por Ashoka`s Changemakers y ExxonMobil. Los
talleres incluir&#225;n debates acerca de c&#243;mo ampliar el alcance de los conceptos
probados, c&#243;mo conectar a los innovadores con socios potenciales y sobre
oportunidades de financiaci&#243;n, e incluyen visitas a sitios de proyectos
prometedores. 

La direcci&#243;n y el enfoque para el Desaf&#237;o fue proporcionada por un estudio de
investigaci&#243;n titulado "Bridging the Gender Divide in Technology" (Reduciendo la
divisi&#243;n de g&#233;neros en la tecnolog&#237;a), realizado por el ICRW y financiado por la
ExxonMobil Foundation. El documento pone de relieve lo que hay que hacer para
mejorar la forma en que las tecnolog&#237;as se desarrollan e implementan para
beneficiar a las mujeres, permiti&#233;ndoles tener m&#225;s &#233;xito en la econom&#237;a local,
convertirse en l&#237;deres m&#225;s fuertes y hacer mayores contribuciones a sus
familias. 

"Estas innovaciones les llegan a las mujeres donde ellas viven. Son pr&#225;cticas y
ser&#225;n catalizadores para hacer frente a las exigencias que las mujeres tienen en
su vida en el hogar, en su vida laboral y en su vida comunitaria", dijo Anju
Malhotra, vicepresidenta de investigaci&#243;n, impacto e innovaci&#243;n en el
International Center for Research on Women. "Estamos muy contentos de ver c&#243;mo
estas ideas creativas desencadenar&#225;n generaciones de cambio para las mujeres y

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Ashoka`s Changemakers, ExxonMobil and the International Center for Research on
Women (ICRW) announced today the three winners of the Women | Tools |
Technology:Building Opportunities &amp; Economic Power Challenge. The winners were
selected from 268 project entries from 67 different countries in Africa, Asia,
Latin America and the Middle East. 

The winning entries came from Bicycling Empowerment Network Namibia, Namibia,
Lua Nova Association, Brazil and Solar Electric Light Fund, USA (working in
Benin). 

"It is inspiring to see such a wide range of innovative solutions catalyzing
women`s economic advancement through technology around the world," said Diana
Wells, Ashoka`s Changemakers` president. "We are thrilled to have received so
many worthwhile ideas through this Challenge, and we are honored to be able to
support the groundbreaking work being done by the winning innovators." 

The three winners are changing women`s lives in a variety of ways. The Solar
Electric Light Fund USA (working in Benin) has designed solar-powered drip
irrigation systems that enable women farmers in Benin to grow crops during the
African nation`s annual six-month dry season, boosting their family income and
nutrition. Bicycling Empowerment Network Namibia is providing training and
equipment for women to run community-based bicycle workshops in Namibia,
allowing them to become adept at bicycle mechanics - traditionally a
male-dominated field. The Lua Nova Association is providing underprivileged and
abused women with the skills they need to help sustain themselves and their
families by designing and building their own homes. 

The public was invited to vote online for the three best solutions from a group
of 10 finalists previously selected by an expert panel of judges for excelling
in the areas of innovation, social impact and sustainability. 

"The innovative concepts from the Challenge will make significant improvements
in the lives of women in developing countries, allowing them to become key
economic players in their communities and better provide for their families,"
said Suzanne McCarron, president of the ExxonMobil Foundation. "We look forward
to helping these innovators gain traction for their ideas so they can ultimately
reach more people with their Challenge solutions." 

Each winner will be featured on Changemakers.com as one of the strongest ideas
for catalyzing women`s advancement through technology. The winners will also be
invited to participate in collaboration workshops hosted later this year by
Ashoka`s Changemakers and ExxonMobil. The workshops will include discussions on
how to broaden the reach of proven concepts, connect innovators with potential
partners and funding opportunities and include site visits to promising
projects. 

Direction and focus for the Challenge was provided by a research study entitled,
"Bridging the Gender Divide in Technology," which was conducted by ICRW and
funded by the ExxonMobil Foundation. The paper highlights what needs to be done
to improve the way technologies are developed and deployed so they benefit
women, enabling them to be more successful in their local economy, stronger
leaders and greater contributors to their families. 

"These innovations meet women where they live. They are practical, and they will
be catalytic in addressing the demands women have in their home life, in their
work life and in their community life," said Anju Malhotra, vice president of
research, impact and innovation at the International Center for Research on
Women. "We`re excited to see how these creative ideas will trigger generations
of change for women and economies. This is a teachable moment for the world."

&lt;p&gt;  MONTREAL, Jun 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Atrion International today announced that JACAM Industries has selected
its Compliance Guardian for Microsoft Dynamics AX to ensure adherence to
global regulations. Atrion's Compliance Guardian for Microsoft Dynamics
AX is an out-of-the-box solution that provides product and raw material
compliance assessment, document authoring and management, automated
labeling, substance volume tracking and extensive reporting capabilities.

    "As we expand into new global markets, JACAM continues its commitment to
the highest environmental, health and safety standards in the industry.
To support these objectives we sought a powerful compliance system that
was tightly integrated with our chosen ERP system," said Jason West,
President of JACAM. "With our rapidly growing customer base and the ever
changing global regulations, product compliance is a strategic component
of our evolving infrastructure."

    Compliance Guardian is Powered by ACE(TM) which allows Microsoft Dynamics
AX users to weave Atrion's Product Compliance Solution and Managed
Regulatory Content into their business processes so that they can comply
with emerging global regulatory requirements at all stages of the product
life cycle. The suite of products helps process and discrete

disruption of operations associated with the lack of accurate contextual
product compliance information.

a robust compliance solution to meet the needs of their growing global
customer base," said Joe Cella, Vice President, Marketing and Partner

work closely together to provide chemical and other process manufacturing
companies a comprehensive solution to help reduce costs and optimize
operational performance while adhering to global compliance regulations.

    Catalyst legislations such as REACH, GHS and RoHS, as well as customer
demand are making environmental responsibility an increasingly important
factor in everything from materials procurement to distribution.
Noncompliance creates substantial financial and safety risks that impact
the entire supply chain, including the inability to import and export,
sell globally and meet customer demand. Product compliance is essential
to profitable growth.

&lt;p&gt;Nearly a month after a Google engineer released details of a new Windows XP flaw, criminals have dramatically ramped up online attacks that leverage the bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reported Wednesday that it has now logged more than 10,000 attacks. "At first, we only saw legitimate researchers testing innocuous proof-of-concepts. Then, early on June 15th, the first real public exploits emerged," Microsoft said in a blog posting. "Those initial exploits were targeted and fairly limited. In the past week, however, attacks have picked up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacks, which are being launched from malicious Web pages, are concentrated in the U.S., Russia, Portugal, Germany and Brazil, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCs based in Russia and Portugal, in particular, are seeing a very high concentration of these attacks, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to security vendor Symantec, these attacks peaked late last week. "Symantec has seen increased activity around this vulnerability. The increased activity started around June 21 and peaked around June 26 and 27," a company spokesman said via instant message Wednesday. Attacks have leveled out since then, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criminals are using the attack code to download different malicious programs, including viruses, Trojans and software called Obitel, which simply downloads more malware, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flaw that's exploited in all of these attacks lies in the Windows Help and Support Center software that comes with Windows XP. It was disclosed on June 10 by Google researcher Tavis Ormandy. This Help Center software also ships with Windows Server 2003, but that operating system is apparently not vulnerable to the attack, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ormandy was criticized by some in the security community for not giving Microsoft more time to patch the flaw, which he disclosed to the software vendor on June 5. He released details of the bug five days later, apparently after failing to convince Microsoft to fix the issue within 60 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a security advisory released June 10, Microsoft outlines several ways to turn off the Windows Help Center Protocol (HCP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's next set of security updates are due July 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert McMillan covers computer security and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

 SAN FRANCISCO, June 30 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp  (MSFT.O)
has pulled the plug on a new generation of smartphones less
than three months after unveiling the devices that were part of
its efforts to catch-up with Apple Inc  (AAPL.O) and Google Inc
 (GOOG.O) in the fast-growing mobile market.

 Microsoft said on Wednesday it had canceled plans to sell
its "Kin" phones in Europe this Fall. The company added the
internal team working on the Kin phones would be combined with
the group working on Microsoft's forthcoming Windows Phone 7
software.

 "We will continue to work with Verizon in the U.S. to sell
current Kin phones," Microsoft said in an emailed statement.

 The move underscores the challenges facing Microsoft, whose
software is used on the vast majority of the world's PCs, as it
strives to adapt to consumers' growing taste for handheld
Internet-connected gadgets like smartphones.

 In April, Microsoft said it was shelving an internal
project to develop a tablet PC similar to Apple's iPad.

 Last month, Microsoft reorganized its mobile phone and
video game division, announcing that longtime Microsoft
executive Robbie Bach would retire and that the senior vice
presidents in charge of phones and games would report directly
to Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.

 Ballmer is "looking at the (mobile) business, seeing what's
making money, what makes sense to do going forward," said Matt
Rosoff, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft.

 The Kin phones represented software giant Microsoft's first
foray into designing its own phones. The two Kin models
featured built-in Internet social networking functionality as
well as Microsoft's Zune digital music player and were aimed at
savvy young phone users.

 Microsoft began selling the Kin phones with Verizon
Wireless in May. Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. wireless
operator, is a joint venture of Verizon Communications (VZ.N)
and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L).

 But Rosoff said the phones lacked certain key smartphone
functions, such as the ability to install software
applications, yet had wireless data service plans that were
priced comparably to more full-featured devices like Apple's
iPhone.

 The Kin was also based on a special Microsoft software
called Windows Phone OS, even as Microsoft prepared to release
the new Windows Phone 7 mobile operating system. Smartphones
running Windows Phone 7 are expected to be available this
holiday season.

 "Windows Phone 7 is the real mobile strategy," said Rosoff.
"The fact that it (the Kin) was ever released in the first
place was a mistake. When they went with Phone 7, they should
have quietly killed this project."

 Verizon Wireless spokeswoman Brenda Raney said that the Kin
remains an important part of the company's "portfolio."

 The smartphone market is exploding. According to research
group Gartner, global sales rose nearly 50 percent in the first
quarter.

 Microsoft had a 6.8 percent share of the global market for
smartphone operating systems in the first quarter of 2010,
according to Gartner. Google's Android had 9.6 percent, Apple's
iPhone had 15.4 percent, while Blackberry-maker Research in
Motion had a 15.4 percent share and Nokia's Symbian software
had a 44.3 percent share.

 RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Breza said that the
battle to win the smartphone market is still in its early
stages.

 "With their vast amount of resources, I would never want to
count out Microsoft," he said. "They can acquire their way into
it. They can approach it in a different strategy."

 Shares of Microsoft were up 61 cents, or 2.7 percent, at
$23.62 in extended trading on Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt;Red Hat has come up with an interesting sales pitch that seems to benefit rival Microsoft as much as Red Hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last week's Red Hat Summit in Boston, Red Hat company executives repeatedly said that only two IT vendors have all the software necessary to build an entire cloud, and allow workloads to move from one cloud to another. And those two companies are Microsoft and Red Hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red Hat exec: Oracle's not an open source company&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We and Microsoft are the only ones that can lift up that entire stack, and bring it with all our assets to the public cloud," said Red Hat CTO Brian Stevens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build a cloud network, the software you need includes server virtualization, an operating system, orchestration and management tools, middleware, and application development frameworks, Red Hat executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might point out that Oracle, now that it owns Sun Microsystems, meets all or most of Red Hat's criteria for building a cloud. Open source rival Novell also offers all of the above, though Novell's middleware comes from JBoss, which is owned by Red Hat. But Red Hat may prefer to compare itself to Microsoft rather than Oracle and Novell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst sees VMware as the company's primary competitor, but at the same time Red Hat executives claim Microsoft is its only rival that actually produces all the software necessary to build a cloud. Red Hat, of course, believes its dedication to open source should give it a leg up over Microsoft, because Red Hat customers will be able to build clouds using any combination of software vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most companies have legacy environments they want to adapt," says Scott Crenshaw, vice president of Red Hat's platform business unit. "That's where the open architecture becomes really important. If they've already made an investment in OpenView, or Tivoli, and Windows or .NET, or whatever, you need to be able to accommodate that. You absolutely need an open architecture, which Microsoft doesn't have, and VMware certainly doesn't have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, besides its mammoth market share, has at least one clear advantage over Red Hat. In addition to Windows, Hyper-V virtualization, .NET and other software tools, Microsoft has its own public cloud computing service in Windows Azure.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red Hat just released its own "Cloud Foundations" package, which is little more than a repackaging of all its previous products. However, Red Hat is offering consulting services and a free reference architecture, 193 pages long, that details how to build a private infrastructure-as-a-service cloud. Red Hat has also built integrations with third-party cloud services like Amazon EC2, making it possible for customers to move workloads from a private cloud to a public infrastructure-as-a-service cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Red Hat cloud can be built entirely with Red Hat software, or with a combination of software from Red Hat and other vendors, Crenshaw says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If somebody wants to deploy VMware virtualization on a Red Hat operating system running IBM WebSphere, perfect, they can do it," he says. "What they can't do is deploy VMware virtualization on a VMware operating system with VMware middleware."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red Hat, VMware and Microsoft are all making plays in the emerging platform-as-a-service portion (PaaS) of the cloud market. Unlike infrastructure-as-a-service offerings like Amazon EC2, which sell raw computing capacity in the form of virtual machine instances, PaaS gives developers all the tools they need to build and deploy Web applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Platform-as-a-service is really kind of the next wave, and right now it's only been adopted by people doing relatively lightweight applications," Crenshaw says. "It's much more in the experimentation phase."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware's PaaS strategy has been boosted by its acquisition of Java vendor SpringSource, and a partnership with Salesforce.com to build a cloud computing service that will host Java applications.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crenshaw dismisses VMware's SpringSource as "wonderful &#8230; for a very small class of applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Red Hat itself is struggling to get into the PaaS market, currently dominated by Windows Azure, Google App Engine and Force.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our ability to deliver standardized platform-as-a-service offerings makes us appealing to cloud service providers," Crenshaw says, but acknowledges that as of today no vendor is offering a PaaS cloud based on Red Hat software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My prediction is we'll have 500 cloud providers in the next 12 to 18 months," Crenshaw says. "Not all of them will succeed, but everyone's going to try. And there's going to be a huge diversity in what they offer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jbrodkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about data center in Network World's Data Center section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;With leaked slides igniting rumblings about Windows 8 this week, it dawned on me how much the Windows operating system family is expanding. Microsoft's goal is clear: cover an increasingly diverse hardware landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 Amazing Things You'll Do With Windows 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alleged Windows 8 slides indicate that, with its next client operating system, Microsoft will push for near-instant startup times, integrated facial recognition technologies, support for USB 3.0 and Bluetooth 3.0, compatibility across different devices through the cloud, and simpler streaming of movies and TV shows to any screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trouble is, the growing Windows family is starting to get a little confusing and dysfunctional, if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has never streamlined its product lines very well. Yes, it has a vast portfolio, but it always seems to create customer confusion with too many versions, complex pricing schemes and long and winding product names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 7 Series (the "Series" was later dropped), Windows Embedded Compact 7, Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS) and System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) jump to mind as Microsoft products with names that will never win any awards for brevity. Hell, even the acronyms are confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suppose we've gotten used to Microsoft's byzantine branding and version confusion, but now even the Windows operating system, which is usually fairly easy to understand, is proliferating in perplexing ways. Suddenly, we've been hit with a new crop of Windows operating systems for different devices - not versions of operating systems mind you, but different operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slideshow: Windows 7 Hardware in Pictures: The Latest and Greatest Laptops Slideshow: Seven Features in Windows 7 You Probably Don't Know About Slideshow: Seven Tools to Ease Your Windows 7 Rollout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no question that today's hardware landscape is complex with its desktops, laptops, netbooks, "slates" (aka tablet PCs), smartphones, e-readers and ruggedized mobile devices. Fear not, Microsoft is here to make sure its Windows operating systems are just as complex. OK, more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a rundown on the burgeoning Windows family. I hope this leaves you less dazed and confused about the various members and where they live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 8: It's early to be making judgements about the follow up to Windows 7, but leaked slides charting Microsoft's strategy with its next client OS reveal an emphasis on instant startup times, facial recognition technologies and seamless compatibility across laptops, tablets, TVs and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7: The successor to the embattled Windows Vista, Windows 7 rolled out last October with a fresh interface and networking and security features that have largely won over the trust of consumers and businesses. Windows 7 currently runs on desktops, laptops, netbooks and tablet PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Mobile 6.5.x: This is the last in the line of the traditional Windows Mobile OS family before Windows Phone 7 takes over in phones this fall. WM 6.5 was a minor upgrade to Windows Mobile 6.1 in Oct. 2009 that included a revamped GUI. Anyone with a Windows Mobile phone is running some version of Windows Mobile 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 7: A major rebranding of the Microsoft phone operating system. Quite simply, the weight of Microsoft's mobile world is on Windows Phone 7, as Microsoft has fallen dangerously behind in the mobile race compared to Apple and RIM, with Android phones now also gaining steam. Windows Mobile 6.x phones will not be upgradeable to Windows Phone 7 because of hardware requirements. The OS is scheduled to ship for the 2010 holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Embedded Handheld: This is the newest member of Microsoft's mobile OS family and is built on Windows Mobile 6.5 technology (which was built on the Windows CE kernel, now known as Windows Embedded Compact. Confused yet?). This OS will be used on what Microsoft is calling "enterprise handheld mobile devices": durable smartphones and PDAs used by service technicians, field workers and healthcare reps who need custom line-of-business apps such as bar-code scanning and RFID reading. Windows Embedded Handheld will ship by the end of the year and then, in the second half of 2011, a new version based on the Windows Phone 7 kernel, aka Windows Embedded Compact 7, will be released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Embedded Standard 7: This is Microsoft's operating system for OEMs that want to include Windows 7 features like Aero, Windows Touch, Silverlight 2 and BitLocker in kiosks, point-of-sale terminals, televisions and set top boxes. It is shipping now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Embedded Compact 7: This is the next generation of Microsoft's Windows Embedded CE, the platform on which Microsoft builds its phone and mobile operating systems. The upcoming Windows Phone 7 is based on Windows Embedded Compact 7 core. On its own, Windows Embedded Compact 7 will be pitched to device makers whose products don't need or are not powerful enough for the full version of Windows 7, such as slates, portable media players and e-readers. OEMs can select from a menu of Windows Embedded Compact 7 features to get just what they need for their devices. The OS runs on either x86 or ARM-based chips and is scheduled to ship in the fourth quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

&lt;p&gt;Developed by the company's Live Labs research group, PivotViewer can visualize large collections of data in such a way to make them easier to order and analyze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software can offer a high-level summarization of the data and allow viewers to swoop down to inspect individual data elements in finer detail. The data visualization can also be easily reorganized depending on conditions set by the user, hence the word "pivot" in the name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more about using the content as the [user interface] rather than using controls or menus," said PivotViewer engineer Brett Brewer in a video posted by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft debuted the technology at its Professional Developers Conference last November and demonstrated it during the TechEd conference earlier this month, during the keynote of Bob Muglia, who is president of Microsoft's Server and Tools Business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demos usually show PivotViewer operating in a browser, with the left-hand side of the screen devoted to a set of check boxes that can be used to filter the data set, and the rest of the page devoted to organizing small icons, each of which represents a particular piece of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data visualization technology could be used for business intelligence, Web site navigation, and as a conduit for content management companies to easily present their libraries to users, Microsoft asserts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology has at least one early adopter. The U.K. wedding planning site Hitched uses PivotViewer as part of its wedding venues visual search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PivotViewer includes application programming interfaces (APIs) to allow designers to customize the control of the viewer. Data collections must be described in XML and include icons for each element, according to the software's technical documentation. The data then can be placed on a Web server, where it can be accessed by any browser running Silverlight and the viewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joab Jackson covers enterpise software and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com Analyst Blog features: Union Pacific Corp. (NYSE: UNP), International
Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM), Hewlett Packard Co. (NYSE: HPQ), Vornado
Realty Trust (NYSE: VNO) and KKR Financial Holdings LLC (NYSE: KFN).

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Union Pacific Downgraded

We are downgrading our recommendation on Union Pacific Corp. (NYSE: UNP) from
Outperform to Neutral, implying that the stock will perform mostly in line with
the broader market. This move is based on the relatively unfavorable economic
environment and the regulatory risks. 

The current state of the U.S. and world economy is expected to keep Union
Pacific`s top-line growth under pressure in the near future. It will not be
feasible for the majority of sectors to escape this downturn unscathed. Volumes,
as measured by total carloads, were down 16% for full year 2009, compared with a
decline of 5% in 2008 and 1% in 2007. 

Moreover, certain operating expenses are likely to increase in the coming years.
While Union Pacific has caught up on its backlog of hiring, the company still
expects significant labor cost inflation, though improved productivity and lower
headcount could offset this somewhat. 

Interest expense should also prove to be a headwind to earnings growth. The
company has added $1.4 billion of long-term debt to fund share repurchases, in
part. This will cost the company an additional $60 to $75 million per year in
interest charges. 

In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, total operating revenues soared 16% year
over year to $4 billion. The results for the reported quarter primarily
benefited from increased operating revenues, given the growth in business
volumes. Stable Customer Satisfaction Index, core pricing gains and strong cash
from operations were also among the positives. However, higher operating
expenses, primarily as a result of increased fuel costs and depreciation,
constitute the primary risk. 

Freight revenues also showed an improvement over the prior-year quarter in all
six business groups. During the reported quarter, freight revenues spiked up 16%
year over year to $3.8 billion. 

Despite Union Pacific`s efforts to curtail costs, operating expenses increased
8% year over year in the quarter, primarily due to a 51% rise in fuel costs to
$583 million, largely related to higher oil prices as well as an 8% increase in
depreciation. 

IBM`s Mainframe Wins New Customer

International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) announced that Comepay, a
leading provider of self-service payment kiosks in Russia and the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS), has chosen its System z10 mainframe to use it in
its core business operations. Comepay is expected to deploy the new System z
mainframe by the end of the second quarter of 2010. Financial details on the
deal were not provided. 

With operations in 11 regions of Russia, the new System z10 mainframe deployed
from IBM will enable Comepay to expand its business operations across the
country. This will aid the company to run a predicted three-fold increase in
transactions from 10,000 to 30,000 per second. Moreover, the new systems will
help augment growth for Comepay by providing cost effective services and
adequate support to its customers. 

The performance and virtualization capabilities of System z mainframe, running
on z/os will enable Comepay to process the growing amount of transactions and
meet business-critical data processing requirements at a lower total cost of
ownership. IBM`s DB2 and WebSphere MQ software will facilitate Comepay to
enhance its information management capabilities while improving the security and
reliability of its transaction processing center, the company said. 

IBM`s System z mainframe can help organizations in emerging markets to manage
their businesses. IBM pointed out that Comepay will add to its expanding
customer base in growing markets, already comprising major customers in China,
Korea and Namibia, namely China Internet Network Information Center, Korea's BC
Card and Dongbu Insurance and The First National Bank of Namibia. 

Based on the strength of its global on-demand model (responding to customer
demand with flexibility and speed), IBM plans to grow revenues in all
geographical regions, with robust growth in emerging markets such as Brazil,
Russia, India and China (BRIC). 

IBM`s Systems and Technology segment is also witnessing growth. Systems and
Technology revenues spiked up 9% (2%, adjusting for currency) year-over-year to
$3.4 billion in the most recent quarter. Systems revenues rose 4%, attributable
to an increase in System x revenues, which grew 36%. This was offset by a
decrease of 17% in revenues from POWER Systems. Revenues from System z mainframe
server products decreased 17%, while the hardware revenues that include servers
and high-end mainframe computers soared 5% in the quarter. 

IBM is expected to get a boost from new mainframe contracts. As virtualization
drives richer server configurations, IBM is targeting $9.3 billion in gross
profit, for 2010, for the Systems and Technology segment. We expect the next
generation mainframe product to deliver a higher benefit to the company, thereby
extending the company`s leadership in energy efficiency, security and
resiliency. 

Although global sever revenues fell, IBM has again topped the server market in
2009 with a 32.9% factory revenues share compared with Hewlett-Packard`s 29.9%,
according to IDC. This growth was driven by a solid performance from its System
x, System p and System z servers. 

To focus on its investments on differentiating technologies with a high-growth
potential, IBM has launched new products and solutions including its new
WebSphere Portal software, version 6.1, POWER6, BladeCenter-S, BladeCenter QS22,
System z10, Power, System x servers, high-performance computing, virtualization,
energy efficiency, and IBM System Storage SAN Volume Controller (SVC) Entry
Edition. 

The next generation mainframe product will likely benefit the company, moving
forward. This product will have a 50.0% additional capacity than the current
system. This should give IBM a competitive edge over Hewlett Packard Co. (NYSE:
HPQ), whose next-generation chip is not expected to catch POWER6 Processor's
speed. 

Vornado`s 2Q Earning Likely to Dip

Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE: VNO), a leading real estate investment trust (REIT),
has recently announced that it will record a net loss of $21 million or 10 cents
per share in fiscal 2010 second quarter, given the loss generated by Toys `R` Us
for its first quarter ended May 1, 2010. 

Toys `R` Us, a leading global retailer of dedicated toys and baby products,
reported net loss of $55 million in the fiscal first quarter compared with $35
million in the year-earlier period. The lackluster performance was primarily due
to weak demand for entertainment products like video game hardware and software
in its International segment. In addition, its business is highly seasonal with
fiscal fourth quarter accounting for over 80% of total annual sales. 

Toys `R` Us was acquired in 2005 by KKR Financial Holdings LLC (NYSE: KFN), Bain
Capital, and Vornado Realty for $6.6 billion. Vornado Realty currently owns
about 32.7% of Toys `R` Us. Consequently, it would record a proportionate share
of the total net loss incurred by the toy company, and its second quarter FFO
(fund from operations) would decrease by $9.5 million or 5 cents per share. Fund
from operations, a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, is
obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses
to net income.

&lt;p&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100630006274/en

4GB and 8GB PC3L-10600 RDIMMs Validated on Intel Xeon 5600 Series Processors
PRINCETON, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Dataram Corporation (NASDAQ: DRAM), a worldwide leader in the manufacture of
high-quality computer memory, storage products, software and services, today
announced the immediate availability of low-voltage, energy efficient memory
upgrades for IBM`s System X servers. These 1.35v DDR3L RDIMMs are fully
compatible and have been validated with the new Intel Xeon 5600 Series
processors. 

Dataram customers will immediately appreciate the benefits of using the new
energy efficient memory - most notably reduced power consumption and cooling
requirements - without having to sacrifice performance, budget or reliability.
The new memory upgrades are available in DDR3L-1066 and DDR3L-1333 speeds, can
be purchased at up to 40% off IBM prices, and are manufactured and tested in
Dataram`s state-of-the-art USA manufacturing facility which operates under
stringent ISO 9001 standards. 

"As part of Dataram`s green initiative, these energy efficient memory products
are a result of our effort to develop and promote products that minimize their
impact on our environment", stated John Freeman, President &amp; CEO. "In
conjunction with our stringent quality requirements and extensive compatibility
testing, customers can be completely confident in adding Dataram memory to their
IBM System X servers". 

Referred to in the industry as "DDR3L" and "PC3L", the memory operates at 1.35
volts, compared to the 1.5 volts of standard DDR3 memory. As a result, customers
can expect up to a 20% power savings with the use of this new memory. Dataram`s
new low-voltage DDR3L DIMMS are compatible with older DDR3-based systems and
will operate at the higher voltage when mixed with standard 1.5 volt memory
within the same system. 

IBM System X servers supporting Dataram`s energy efficient memory products
include the IBM System X iDataPlex dx360 M3 (6385, 6386, 6394), x3400 M3 (7378,
7379), x3500 M3 (7380), x3550 M3 (7944), x3620 M3 (7376), and x3650 M3 (7945).

&lt;p&gt; * Sale could raise up to 1 billion euros-sources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Expressions of interest due July 30-source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shell shares down 1 pct &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds details, shares, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Greg Roumeliotis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMSTERDAM, June 30 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L)
and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) have launched the sale of their German
gas storage business, which could fetch up to 1 billion euros
($1.22 billion), several people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS AG (UBSN.VX), which is advising on the sale of the gas
storage assets of BEB Erdgas und Erdoel GmbH, a joint venture
between Exxon and Shell, has started sending out "teaser"
documents to potential buyers, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil majors are selling some assets in a drive to invest in
production. In April, Exxon agreed to sell a 9.4 percent stake
in a Norwegian gas transport system to infrastructure funds of
UBS and French state-owned bank Caisse des Depots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The enterprise value of the BEB storage sites for sale,
which do not include its largest facility in Dotlingen in Lower
Saxony, is estimated between 500 to 700 million euros, two of
the sources said, depending how long-term the contractual
agreements BEB has with its clients are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This valuation does not include any cushion gas used to keep
facilities operational, the sources said. One source said that
BEB could fetch an additional few hundred million euros for the
gas, bringing the total value of any deal up to 1 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Expressions of interest are due on July 30, one of the
sources said. The sale is expected to attract interest from gas
transmission operators, utilities and financial investors such
as infrastructure funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for BEB was not immediately available for
comment. A Shell spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UNREGULATED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tariffs applied by gas storage operators in Germany are
not regulated, although there is risk of legislation coming into
effect in the future, said one source close to the sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The assets will appeal to gas transport companies and
utilities looking to balance their portfolio but also to traders
and financial investors," the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The German wholesale gas market is dominated by big
operators such as E.ON Ruhrgas, RWE (RWEG.DE), Wingas BASF.DE
and VNG. They import and produce gas and control the high
pressure pipeline networks, although foreigners such as Gasunie
have made inroads into the German transport sector. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2007, Shell and Exxon agreed to sell the 3,600 km gas
transport network of BEB to Gasunie. Asked about whether Gasunie
would now bid for BEB's gas storage business, a spokesman for
the Dutch gas infrastructure company declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale comes at a time when Germany is looking to boost
its natural gas reserves. It imported some 80 percent of its
consumption needs last year, paying roughly 20 billion euros for
the shipments from abroad, mainly from Russia and Norway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shell shares were down 1.1 percent to 1,691 pence at 1232
GMT, underperforming London's FTSE 100 index .FTSE which was
slightly up 0.15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a FACTBOX on the German wholesale gas market, please

&lt;p&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100630005175/en

Bank launches first-ever incentive to encourage businesses to hire, grow
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Continuing its commitment to small businesses, Chase announced today an
innovative incentive that rewards businesses for each new employee they hire
this year. 

Starting today, Chase will lower its interest rate on a new Chase Business Line
of Credit by 0.5 percentage point for each new hire, up to three, for the life
of the loan. Counting the discount for a new business checking account, a small
business owner could save about $4,000 over three years on an outstanding
balance of about $65,000, Chase estimated. 

"We encourage businesses to take advantage of the lowest interest rates in years
and to create more jobs for the economy," said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase. "We know how important it is to help small
businesses because they are core to the U.S. economy." 

Late last year, Chase announced that it planned to increase its lending to small
businesses by $4 billion in 2010 to a total of $10 billion through access to
working capital, term loans for expansion, commercial mortgages, lines of credit
and business credit cards. It also pledged to hire 325 additional business
bankers. 

The offer is available to business owners who are approved for a new Chase
Business Line of Credit up to $250,000 or existing business customers who
increase their line of credit by $10,000 or more. Chase business checking
customers will receive an additional half percent discount on their loan rate. 

To learn more about this program, or to apply, business owners can visit their
nearest Chase branch and talk with a business banker, or go to
Chase.com/LoanForHire. 

Chase`s continued support for small businesses

* In the first quarter of 2010, Chase loaned $2.1 billion to small businesses -
a 31 percent increase from a year earlier. 
* Chase added 235 more small business bankers and plans to add about 100 more by
year end. 
* The bank recently instituted a second review process to give business owners
every chance they deserve, making $110 million in additional loans to small
businesses.

As part of its outreach to small businesses, Chase is holding seminars in 11
cities across the country to help local business owners increase sales and fund
their businesses. Mark LeBlanc, author of "Growing Your Business," will be
joined by a panel of local bankers, business owners and representatives from the
Small Business Administration and Chamber of Commerce.

&lt;p&gt;First Book in Baseball Series to Be Published in Winter 2011

Baltimore Sun sportswriter Kevin Cowherd to be co-author
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Disney Book Group will publish a middle-grade baseball series written by
National Baseball Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr. and co-authored by Baltimore Sun
sportswriter Kevin Cowherd. The series will feature characters from a Babe Ruth
League team named the "Orioles". The agreement for world rights was negotiated
by Stephanie Owens Lurie, Editorial Director, Disney-Hyperion, an imprint of
Disney Book Group, and Ian Kleinert, of Objective Entertainment. 

The first book in the series-Hothead-will be published in Winter 2011 under the
Disney-Hyperion imprint. It centers on all-star third baseman Connor Sullivan,
who has a big problem: his temper. The story was inspired by Cal`s own struggle
with frustration as a young player. Additional books will follow every year. 

"Working with Kevin and the team from Disney has been a pleasure," said Ripken.
"Connor is a character that I was able to help develop with Kevin based on my
experiences as a kid who struggled with his emotions. I hope that the kids
reading it find it to be fun and take away a few lessons from it." 

"Cal Ripken Jr. is a living legend, of course, and in his work with kids he has
demonstrated a commitment to being a positive influence," says Lurie. "We are
thrilled to have this opportunity to share Cal`s love of baseball and his can-do
outlook with young readers." 

Cal Ripken, Jr. was a shortstop and third baseman for the Baltimore Orioles for
his entire career (1981-2001), a rare occurrence in Major League Baseball today.
Nicknamed "The Iron Man" for his relentless work ethic and reliability on the
field, Ripken is most remembered for playing in 2,632 straight games over 17
seasons, shattering New York Yankee Lou Gehrig`s previous record of 2,130 games.
He was also a 19-time all-star and is considered to be one of the best
shortstops that professional baseball has ever seen. In 2007, when he was
inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, he received the most votes in
the history of the Hall of Fame. Since his retirement Ripken has worked as
President and CEO of Ripken Baseball, Inc. to nurture the love of baseball in
young children on a grassroots level. In August of 2007 Ripken was named
American Public Diplomacy Envoy and has since been traveling the world to bring
baseball to people everywhere. He currently lives in Maryland with his wife and
two children. 

Kevin Cowherd has been a writer for the Baltimore Sun since 1987, is nationally
syndicated by the Los Angeles Times-Washington Post news service, and is the
author of Last Call at the 7-Eleven, a book of selected writings published by
Bancroft Press. In 1990 he was honored by the American Association of Sunday and
Feature Editors for excellence in feature writing. He currently writes a sports
column and blog for the Baltimore Sun. As a sportswriter he is curious about
athletes` private thoughts and emotions. He is also a humorist, and an
experienced Little League coach. He lives with his wife and three children near
Baltimore.
