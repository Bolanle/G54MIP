&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
has begun a review of its London operations that could result
in entire departments going overseas to avoid paying increasing
British taxes, the Daily Telegraph reported in its Monday
edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The newspaper, which quoted unnamed sources, said the bank
was understood to be considering its options after Britain
announced plans for a new tax on bankers' bonuses, a new income
tax rate and the increased banking regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Telegraph said the investment bank had asked an
internal team to examine various strategies, including whole
divisions being moved abroad. It said the review was in the
very early stages and could also recommend no changes at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's proprietary trading arm, foreign exchange trading
teams and the bank's back office operations were all mentioned
as areas that could be examined in the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain has unveiled a 50 percent tax for banks on bonuses
over 25,000 pounds in a bid to rein in multimillion-pound
payouts by an industry bailed out by taxpayer cash. It has also
announced plans for a 50 percent top rate of income tax on high
earners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one at Goldman Sachs was immediately available to
comment.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Homeland Security Department rather than the State Department should handle U.S. visas overseas to meet security threats, the chairman of the Senate homeland security committee said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecticut independent Joe Lieberman raised the idea during a discussion on ABCs "This Week" of the attempted bombing of a Detroit-bound plane on Dec 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe, incidentally, that we ought to take a look at taking the visa application and admission responsibility from the State Department. It doesn't really fit with foreign policy anymore," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And in an age of terrorism, I think the Department of Homeland Security ought to be handling visas abroad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 23-year-old Nigerian accused of the attempted bombing, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, held a multiple-entry U.S. visa issued in London, according to a statement by his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaders of the Senate committee say they will convene a hearing this month to examine airline security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee's top Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, said on "This Week" the State Department should have revoked Abdulmutallab's visa after his family told U.S. officials they were worried about his activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Homeland Security Department was to take control this month of a visa program for flight school students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign citizens from all but 35 countries, mostly in Europe but also including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea, must obtain a U.S. visa to visit the United States but a visa does not guarantee entry. Some 5.8 million non-immigrant visas were issued in 2006, the most recent year listed on a State Department site on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Charles Abbott, editing by Alan Elsner)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 3 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) could see
its shares rise more than 20 percent in the next year because
of the heavier emphasis it has put on oil exploration projects
compared with rivals, Barron's reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The financial weekly said in its Jan. 4 edition that
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, would benefit
from oil prices that are widely expected to continue rising in
2010 after jumping 75 percent in 2009, compared with a 6
percent increase in natural gas prices last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crude oil accounted for two-thirds of its oil-equivalent
reserves at the end of 2008, a higher percentage than at rivals
ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Barron's
wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barron's also cited Chevron's ability to cut costs ahead of
schedule and a lower price-earnings valuation than Exxon's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The newspaper nonetheless cautioned that Chevron is
vulnerable to falling oil prices and low oil refining margins,
but said most such concerns were likely already reflected in
Chevron's share price.

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. reached the 85,000 H-1B visa cap late last month thanks to a fourth quarter spike in demand .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, according to data recently released by the AFL-CIO labor union, most of the visa-holders are less than 35-years-old and most likely from India. About half work in computer-related occupations. The AFL-CIO compiled its numbers from a number of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service reports showing the make-up of visa users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the reaching of the H-1B cap, the USCIS now won't accept new visa applications until April 1 for fiscal 2011, which begins on Oct. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government data studied by the AFL-CIO covers a number of years through the 2008 fiscal year and shows a largely consistent pattern of visa usage. For instance, 54% of 2008 visa recipients were from India, close to the percentage from the past several years, according to the USCIS reports. Two thirds of H-1B petitions approved in 2008 were for workers between the ages of 25 and 34, compared to 48% in 2007 and 66% in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relative youthfulness of H-1B petitioners is likely to reinforce the concerns of visa critics who contend that the pool of young of workers is helping to foster age discrimination in the IT workplace . Estimates by various industry groups puts the number of IT workers in the U.S. between 4 to 6 million people. The total depends on what occupational groups are counted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian nationals are the dominant recipients of the visa. Of the total number of H-1B visas issued for initial employment in 2008, for example, 61,739 were to workers from India, followed by 9,157, or 8.8%, from China. Canadians accounted for 3,968 visas or 3.9% of the total, and the Philippines, 3,957, or 3.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AFL-CIO released the USCIS reports as part of a report on the visa program, called Gaming the System: Guest Worker Visa Programs and Professional and Technical Workers in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Windows 7, Microsoft (MSFT) aims to please both consumers and businesses large and small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute -- small?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, a lesser-known aspect of the Windows 7 strategy is to appeal to SMBs (small and midsized businesses). Microsoft defines a small business as anywhere from five to 100 employees, and anything between 100 and 1,000 employees is considered to be midsize. Most of these companies need more than what Windows 7 Home Premium offers, but cannot afford the Software Assurance licences required for Windows 7 Enterprise edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In between these two worlds is Windows 7 Professional, a version of the new OS that is pricier than Home Premium (Professional costs $199 for an upgrade version and $299 for a new, full retail version. Home Premium goes for $119 and $199), but offers more networking and security features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some examples of Win7 Pro features: location-aware printing to connect to printers anywhere; remote desktop connectivity; encrypted file system; the Windows XP Mode virtualization feature that allows users to run XP applications that won't work natively on a Windows 7 machine; and domain join, which allows easier connection from a personal laptop to a business network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business with 10 or fewer employees may not need the features of Windows 7 Professional, but for anything beyond 10 employees Windows 7 Home Premium may not be enough, says Sandrine Skinner, a director in the Windows Commercial Product Management group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing a marketing and revenue opportunity, Microsoft has started packaging Windows 7 Professional on PCs from hardware partners like Dell, Lenovo and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and marketing them to SMBs. Microsoft is also working on guidelines to help SMBs pick the right version of Windows 7 for their needs, and plans to release these guidelines before mid-2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent interview, Skinner admits that SMBs are a group that was not given enough attention with Windows Vista. Therefore, Microsoft baked new features into Windows 7 Professional with SMBs in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is an edited version of CIO.com's interview with Skinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When will Windows 7 Professional machines designed for SMBs be available, and which OEMs will be manufacturing them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already have some great options available today, including the Dell Vostro V13, Lenovo's ThinkPad SL series and HP's ProBook 5310m. We will keep working with OEMs and retailers to make sure small businesses have a broad selection of PCs to choose from and that they all address their business needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are Windows 7 Professional features that SMBs are clamoring for? Can you provide some examples?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few examples that address three key specific business needs are productivity, data backup and application compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of productivity, we hear from customers that new user interface features such as the Taskbar, Jumplists and the Snap features as well as mobility features like location-aware printing, are very helpful. In many cases, these practical benefits result in significant time savings, which in the end impact a small businesses' bottom line and can increase time spent with customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ For complete coverage on Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system -- including hands-on reviews, video tutorials and advice on enterprise rollouts -- see CIO.com's Windows 7 Bible. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is Advanced Backup, which lets customers back up their files and their entire PC image on a network through automated scheduling so they don't have to worry about their documents in case of a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slideshow: Seven Features in Windows 7 You Probably Don't Know About&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slideshow: Windows 7 in Pictures: The Coolest New Hardware&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slideshow: Seven Tools to Ease Your Windows 7 Rollout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, SMBs can still leverage their line of business applications, which may have been custom built for their business to run on Windows XP, by using Windows XP Mode. XP Mode can extend the life of many older productivity apps by making it possible to run them on Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've just scratched the surface here in terms of features and benefits and would encourage small businesses to check out our customized Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you say to midmarket companies that find themselves needing Windows 7 enterprise features like DirectAccess or BitLocker to Go, but are not in a position to do a Software Assurance agreement?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recognize every business has a unique set of needs and in this scenario, we also offer various Volume Licensing [VL] options to midmarket customers that provide flexible options. We currently provide a VL promotion to midmarket customers on Open Licensing and encourage customers to get a hold of a licensing specialist to learn more about how to upgrade to Windows 7 Enterprise if they want to use the features you mention, namely DirectAccess and BitLocker, amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will you be marketing the Windows 7 SMB machines to entrepreneurs and small business owners: TV, Web ads, word of mouth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we do not share specific details on our advertising campaigns, we can tell you that we have been working directly with SMB customers and partners through our Small Business Ignite early-adopter program. The program proved to be a great way to get their great feedback on what they care about and what they want to get out of their PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, we used this input to give small businesses what they asked for. We've seen a lot of early excitement, which seems to be spreading virally and through word of mouth -- both for customers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Microsoft be encouraging retail stores or resellers to create package deals for Windows 7 SMB PCs to entice buyers, or does MS stay out of pricing? What other ways can Microsoft make Windows 7 SMB PCs financially attractive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our partner approach, we're definitely focused on delivering small businesses the choice they're looking for at the right prices. Based on local market needs, we're working with our partners to bring the best value to our small-business customers across the world. For example, in France we just launched the Small Business Assurance program for organizations that have between one and 50 PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has already prepared Windows 7 with code to let users download the new operating system's first service pack, a prominent blogger reported last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rafael Rivera, who writes the Within Windows blog, sniffed out several keys in Windows 7 's registry that add an eligibility check for Service Pack 1 (SP1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A first service pack -- which includes already-issued security patches as well as new bug fixes, and in some cases, new features -- is important because many corporations won't widely deploy a new edition of Windows until that milestone has been reached. Service packs are also relatively rare: Windows XP, which debuted in October 2001, has had only three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivera took the appearance of the eligibility check to mean that SP1 testing is imminent. "The takeaway here is that external [emphasis in original] Windows 7 SP1 testing should commence soon, if it hasn't already," said Rivera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if Rivera's hunch is correct, it could be months before Microsoft launches a public preview of SP1. For example, although Microsoft seeded an invite-only group of testers with Vista SP1 in September 2007, it didn't make the beta available to the general public until December 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has embedded similar keys in Vista, as well as Windows XP, to determine who is eligible, and when, to receive a service pack beta via Windows Update. In the cases of both Vista and Windows XP, Microsoft offered small downloads when it was ready to expand the preview to the public; those downloads modified the registry so users' PCs would "see" the service pack on Windows Update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft adheres to the timeline it used for Vista, Windows 7's SP1 should be available to a small group of testers in June, and to the public in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time that Rivera has rooted out details of Microsoft's software. Last November, Rivera accused Microsoft of using open-source code in a Windows 7 installation tool without acknowledging where it got the code. Microsoft quickly pulled the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool , then later re-released it as open-source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not immediately respond to questions about its Windows 7 SP1 plans, or comment on Rivera's blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), General Electric (NYSE: GE), Dynamics Corporation
(NYSE: GD), Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC).

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Lockheed F-16s Fly Egypt

Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) will sell 24 F-16 fighter aircraft to
Egypt for more than $3.2 billion. The U.S. and Egyptian governments have signed
the agreement, which would upgrade Egypt's existing F-16 fleet. 

Lockheed Martin`s F-16s are powered by the General Electric Company`s (NYSE: GE)
F110-GE-129 engine. The F-16 jet fighter aircraft was originally developed by
General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE: GD) in 1976. However, in 1993, General
Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to Lockheed Martin. 

Lockheed Martin`s F-16s have witnessed lower sales volumes in recent times,
affecting the performance of its Aeronautics segment. In recent times, Lockheed
Martin`s F-22 Raptor program was also cancelled. However, higher volumes from
the F-35 program salvaged the performance of the segment. 

Lockheed Martin remains a key player in the defense industry catering to the
U.S. Government, foreign governments and other commercial buyers. Lockheed`s
traditional defense focus appears strong, with increasing interest from domestic
and international customers. In addition, management intends to explore strong
business opportunities beyond the traditional defense market, specifically in
the areas of civil, governmental and commercial space businesses. The company
mainly competes with Boeing Company (NYSE: BA), and Northrop Grumman Corporation
(NYSE: NOC). 

Shares of Lockheed Martin rose 15 cents to $68.70 on Wednesday. Going forward,
we are bullish on the company due to significant upside potential based on
strong defense outlays, above-industry average return-on-invested-capital and
expanding product lines. This would be partially offset by risks related to key
projects execution, fate of high cost platform programs and order cancellations.
Thus we reiterate our market Neutral recommendation on the shares.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Pipeline Setback for J

Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) has received yet another setback related to its
pipeline candidate ceftobiprole, a broad-spectrum antibiotic &#8722; aiming the
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) &#8722; for the treatment of
complicated skin infections and nosocomial pneumonia. Johnson and Johnson had
licensed the drug from Swiss drug company Basilea Pharmaceuticals in 2005. 

Johnson and Johnson received a complete response letter (CRL) from the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), delaying the approval process further. According
to the FDA, there were many flaws in the trials due to which the company has
been asked to conduct new studies to evaluate the drug's safety and
effectiveness. Johnson and Johnson intends to discuss its future course of
action related to ceftobiprole with the FDA shortly. 

The new drug application (NDA) for ceftobiprole has been pending since May 2007.
The approval has been getting delayed due to the presence of protocol related
issues from initial stages. In November 2008, the FDA issued a CRL recommending
additional site audits to be conducted. Following this, the company completed
the audits through a third party, the results of which were submitted in June
this year. 

Ceftobiprole`s path to approval has not been smooth in the EU either. The review
process has been halted until a Good Clinical Practice inspection is done. An
opinion by the EU Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use is anticipated
in the first quarter of 2010. Given the repetitive delays in the approval
process in both the US and EU, Basilea filed an arbitration claim against
Johnson and Johnson in Feb 2009 seeking damages. The latest delay would increase
the claims in the arbitration process. 

On approval, ceftobiprole will have to compete with several established drugs,
which include ViroPharma`s (Nasdaq: VPHM) Vancocin, Theravance`s (Nasdaq: THRX)
Vibativ, Cubist Pharmaceutical`s (Nasdaq: CBST) Cubicin, Pfizer`s (NYSE: PFE)
Zyvox and Tygacil.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 4 (Reuters) - Raymond James cut Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) to "market perform" from "outperform," saying it does
not expect shares of the oil major to outperform in an
environment of steadily rising oil prices.
 Analysts, led by Pavel Molchanov, said they still see much
potential in Exxon with industry leading returns on equity,
solid balance sheet and steady execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "But sometimes, being the ultimate energy 'blue chip' could
be a disadavantage. We envision 2010 being one of those times,"
they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, the analysts upgraded Hess Corp (HES.N) to
"strong buy" from "outperform," saying that "while catalysts in
recent quarters were meager, there is a plateful for 2010."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Exxon were up 1 percent at $69.16, while that of
Hess were up 4 percent at $63.18 Monday afternoon on the New
York Stock Exchange.

Revatio is Only PAH Treatment in Its Class with Approved I.V. Formulation,
Allowing Patients to Continue Treatment While Unable to Use Oral Therapy
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. announced today that the European Commission has approved Revatio&#174;
(sildenafil) solution for injection for patients who are currently prescribed
oral Revatio and who are temporarily unable to take oral medicine, but are
otherwise clinically and haemodynamically stable. 

Revatio is the only phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor with both oral and I.V.
formulations approved in the European Union for the treatment of PAH. 

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare, progressive disease that affects an
estimated 100,000 men and women worldwide. This incurable disease is
characterized by continuous high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries,
leading to heart failure and premature death. Pulmonary arterial hypertension
can occur with no known underlying cause, or it can be found in association with
other disorders such as connective tissue disease. 

"Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a life-threatening disease, and medical
treatment can help delay damage caused by the disease," said Jean-Luc Vachiery,
M.D., professor of Cardiology and director of the Pulmonary Vascular Diseases
Unit at Clinique Universitaire De Bruxelles Hopital Erasme (Erasme Hospital) in
Belgium and former chairman of the Working Group on Pulmonary Circulation and
Right Ventricular Function of the European Society of Cardiology. "Now with the
approval of Revatio solution for injection, we have an option to bridge
interruptions in treatment of adult patients who may be temporarily unable to
take this important therapy in tablet form." 

For some patients, continued oral medication may not be an option for a period
of time. While oral treatment can often be re-introduced at a later stage, the
ability to maintain treatment during periods when the patient is unable to take
or tolerate an oral formulation is important to preserving health in patients
with PAH. Revatio solution for injection is for adult patients with PAH who are
stable on Revatio tablets but who are temporarily unable to take oral medication
and for whom the physician considers continuity of treatment to be in the
patients` best interest. 

"The approval of Revatio solution for injection is a clear demonstration of
Pfizer`s commitment to developing treatments addressing the unmet needs of
patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension," said Cara Cassino, M.D., vice
president of Pulmonary Vascular Disease, Clinical Development and Medical
Affairs, Pfizer. "This important milestone highlights the Specialty Care
Business Units dedication to advance treatments for serious and life-threatening
conditions such as pulmonary vascular disease." 

About Revatio

Revatio was first approved by the European Commission in October 2005. Oral
Revatio tablets are available as a 20mg tablet taken three times a day. The
recommended dose of Revatio Injection is 10 mg (corresponding to 12.5 mL) three
times a day administered as an intravenous bolus injection.

&lt;p&gt;New Interactive Features at Expedition206.com Help Fans Connect With Global
Travelers Every Step of the Way


MADRID--(Business Wire)--
One down, 205 to go.Coca-Cola`s team of three young "happiness ambassadors"
kicked off their year-long global adventure known as Expedition 206 by ringing
in the New Year with thousands of partygoers in Madrid, Spain. Madrid was the
first stop on the team`s 275,000-mile voyage to 206 countries and territories
where Coca-Cola is sold to seek out what makes people happy. 

The three members of Expedition 206 - Tony Martin, 30, a Washington, D.C. native
who teaches kindergarten in Munich; Kelly Ferris, 23, a university student from
Brussels; and Antonio Santiago, 24, a university student from Mexico City - will
document the entire trip on www.Expedition206.com and a variety of social
networking sites, including Facebook (http://facebook.com/cocacola), YouTube
(http://youtube.com/expedition206), Twitter (http://twitter.com/x206), Flickr
(http://www.flickr.com/photos/e206) and a TypePad blog at
http://expedition206.typepad.com. 

"Celebrating New Year`s Day was a perfect start to this journey as we are
anticipating an amazing 2010 and look forward to sharing the experience with the
world," said Tony. 

As the team travels the globe seeking stories of happiness, fans can follow the
real-time updates with a new Expedition 206 widget that takes all of the team`s
content and pulls it onto fans` own Web sites, blogs and social network profile
pages. In addition, the built-in chat function on www.Expedition206.com ensures
people can quickly and easily become a part of the Expedition 206 adventure -
interacting with the team members and other fans. Using all of these sites and
tools, fans will serve as "virtual travel agents" for the team, helping decide
where they will go, what they will do and whom they will visit in each
destination. 

As part of their preparation for Expedition 206, the team met with Margarita
Alvarez, president of the Coca-Cola Happiness Institute in Madrid, to learn
about the organization`s research into what makes people happy. The Coca-Cola
Happiness Institute was established by the Company in 2008 in Spain, in
collaboration with several leading experts, to conduct and publish research
about the nature of happiness and how different people perceive happiness. 

"The research we`ve done to study happy people and the causes of happiness will
provide a good foundation for the ambassadors as they travel the world seeking
out and documenting stories of joy and optimism," Alvarez said. "These are three
of the most energetic, uplifting people I`ve ever met, so it`ll be fun to watch
them interact with so many different people from all corners of the earth." 

Madrid Mayor Alberto Ruiz-Gallard&#243;n Jim&#233;nez welcomed Tony, Antonio and Kelly
during an event at Madrid`s town hall, after which the team took a tour of the
city. The team also ran in the San Silvestre Vallecana, a race that has taken
place every Dec. 31 in Madrid since 1964. At the stroke of midnight, they each
ate 12 grapes - las doce uvas de la suerte, or "the twelve grapes of luck" - at
Puerta del Sol, a 100-year-old tradition that is supposed to bring good luck to
all who eat one grape with each ring of the bell at midnight. 

The team also completed the first in its series of 206 exchanges of specially
decorated Coca-Cola bottles. They presented the first commemorative bottle,
which they received from Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company.
In return, they received Spain`s special bottle, which they will present to
their hosts on the next stop on their world tour, Portugal. At the end of the
expedition, all 206 of these one-of-a-kind bottles will be displayed in a
special collection at the World of Coca-Cola in Atlanta. 

Tony, Kelly and Antonio also met with a delegation of representatives from the
Shanghai World Expo 2010, who presented them with a miniature version of
"Haibao," the mascot of the Shanghai Expo. Haibao will accompany the team as
they travel the world, bringing a taste of the World Expo to each stop along the
route. The team is scheduled to visit the Shanghai World Expo in May, along with
other marquee events that Coca-Cola sponsors throughout the year, such as the
Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Canada and the FIFA World Cup 2010 in
South Africa. 

"Kelly, Tony and I are looking forward to documenting this trip and learning
from all of the great people we`ll meet along the way," Antonio said. "We`re
just getting started, and we`ve already met so many wonderful people in Madrid.
I can`t imagine what the next 205 countries will bring."

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Jan 5 (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N)
on Tuesday unveiled a technology called KeyChest to enable
consumers to buy films or television shows from various
distributors, store them on remote servers, and play them on
multiple platforms ranging from TVs to computers and phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney said it plans to roll-out KeyChest for both the U.S.

to the upcoming technology conference in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney said negotiations with content distributors, cable
companies and telecommunications services have been ongoing for
several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney hopes the technology will be deployed before the end
of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also said a third-party company will operate
KeyChest, and that it expects other studios to make their
content available through the authenticating technology Disney
has developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Company officials said the goal of KeyChest is to make it
easy for for viewers to see a movie accessed from various
outlets and to address the issue of compatibility in
maneuvering content from device to device as well as limited
storage space on consumers' hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She also said this was not intended as a Disney only

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today disclosed retail prices for Office 2010, and said it has no plans to offer "upgrade" editions -- the discounted versions for users who already have an earlier edition on their PCs. The move will effectively raise the price for many users who want to migrate from older editions of the popular suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also spelled out prices for its new "key cards," single-license codes that will be sold at up to 30% off boxed copy prices, for upgrading the Office Starter 2010 mini-suite that many computer makers are expected to preinstall on new PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's trimmed the number of retail editions of Office 2010 for the general public to three, down from Office 2007's five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boxed version of Office 2010 Home and Student, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote, comes with a price tag of $149, and lets a family install the suite on as many of three household PCs. A single-license key card will cost $119, 20% less than the boxed copy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2010 Home and Business, which adds the Outlook e-mail client to the four applications available in Home and Student, runs $249 and can be installed on up to two of the buyer's PCs. A one-license key card will be priced at $199, a 20% savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding Publisher and Access, the latter Microsoft's desktop database software, Office 2010 Professional will be priced at $499 and can be installed on a pair of PCs. The single-license key card, however, will run $349, a discount of 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SKU Microsoft added to the retail line today is Professional Academic, an edition available to K-12 and college students, staff and faculty. The edition contains the same application mix as Office 2010 Professional, can be installed on up to two PCs and will cost $99. No key card option will be available for the academic edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is making changes to more than the suite's editions, however. A company spokeswoman confirmed today that Microsoft does not plan to offer separate upgrade editions for Office 2010. That's a major departure from the past; Microsoft has traditionally sold upgrades at prices significantly less than the so-called "full" editions, which are designed for installing the suite on a PC sans Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Office 2007 line, the Standard edition -- which contains the same applications as Office 2010 Home and Business -- costs $399.95 for the full version but only $239.95 for the upgrade, a savings of 40%. Office 2010 Home and Business, meanwhile, will cost $249 in the boxed version, effectively raising the price of the suite by $10 for people wanting to upgrade. The key card price of $199 for Office 2010 Home and Business is $40 less than the upgrade price of Office 2007 Standard, but it's a one-license deal; the boxed copy lets customers install the suite on two PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2010 Professional will cost even more than the corresponding Office 2007 edition with the elimination of upgrade pricing. Microsoft sells the Office 2007 Professional upgrade for $329.95, but the boxed copy of the same edition of Office 2010 costs $499, a 51% increase. And Office 2010 Professional's single-license key card price of $349 is $20 higher than Office 2007 Professional's upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New with Office 2010, Microsoft's product key card -- a small credit card-sized piece of plastic that includes a single license activation key -- is aimed at customers who have purchased a new PC with Office Starter 2010 preinstalled. Starter, which replaces the decades-old Microsoft Works suite, includes reduced functionality versions of Word and Excel , but lacks the PowerPoint and OneNote applications available on Home and Student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the code for Home and Student, Home and Business, and Professional are installed on new PCs that offer Officer Starter; the key simply "unlocks" the appropriate version, eliminating the need to download additional software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office Starter will include on-screen advertisements in the lower-right-hand corner of the Word and Excel windows; those ads, of course, vanish when a key card and its product activation key are used to upgrade to one of the paying editions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also offer two other SKUs to its volume license corporate customers : Office 2010 Standard, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote and Publisher; and Office Professional Plus, which adds Access, InfoPath, Communicator and SharePoint Workspace to the Standard mix. Those two editions will not be sold at retail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All versions of Office 2010 also come with Office Web Apps , the bare-bones online Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote applications that consumers can use for free via Windows Live and enterprise workers can access if their companies have an Office Software Assurance Plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2010 is scheduled to debut in June. The Microsoft spokeswoman said that the company would offer a promotion at some point before its release that will give buyers of Office 2007 a free or heavily-discounted copy of the new Office 2010 when it launches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;An Italian consumers association is set to mount a class-action lawsuit to obtain compensation for customers who buy PCs with preinstalled Microsoft software but who prefer not to use the Windows OS, the association's president announced Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeking the return of the cost of the unwanted Microsoft software from the manufacturers of computer hardware will be registered with a court in Florence later this week, said Vincenzo Donvito, president of ADUC (Association for the Rights of Users and Consumers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 2,000 people, most of them Linux users, have already expressed interest in participating in the lawsuit, Donvito said in a telephone interview. The initiative takes advantage of a new law permitting class-action lawsuits, which went into effect on Jan. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been waging this battle for some years and have already won a pilot case in Florence," Donvito said. "That victory modified the situation and many producers now allow a refund, but with a difficult and complicated system. Customers have to send their computers to the manufacturers' headquarters to get the software removed and then they only receive compensation of 30 to 40 euros  for a product that costs between 150 and 250 euros."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system ended up costing consumers money and people would only do it on a point of principle, Donvito said. Private individuals who bought computers containing Microsoft software, rejected the license and left the software unused can participate in the ADUC lawsuit, which is being filed in Florence because the association has its headquarters there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Participation in the lawsuit is free, though people are welcome to make a voluntary contribution to the legal costs," Donvito said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judges in Florence will have to decide whether to accept the lawsuit, and the process could take several months, as the administrative machinery for processing the new lawsuit requests is not yet in place, Donvito said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will not be possible to get back more money than the actual cost of the Microsoft software, the ADUC president said. "Italian law provides for the recovery of money that has been illicitly subtracted but there is no provision for punitive damages," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never wanting to miss the opportunity to bewilder customers, Microsoft today announced pricing for the forthcoming Office 2010. Key difference: Now you can save money by purchasing a card with a product key code, instead of the full boxed product. But, there's a catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is significant: The boxed version of Office 2010 Professional licenses two copies, while the card-only option licenses just one. Adding more confusion: The boxed version of Home and Student edition is a family pack that licenses  (Here is our visual tour of Office 2010).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upgrade pricing--which is what most businesses and users care about--was not announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pricing announcement was made by Rachel Bondi, Office 2010 general manager, in a blog post. Here is a Microsoft document that compares the four versions and their pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the versions and pricing:&lt;/p&gt;

Office Home and Student: $149 (boxed) $119 (product key card)
Office Home and Business: $279 (boxed) $199 (product key card)
Office Professional: $499 (boxed) $349 (product key card) 
Office Professional Academic $99 (boxed only)&lt;p&gt;Office Home and Student includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Home and Business adds Outlook. Professional provides Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, Publisher and Access. The Academic edition will only be available through college bookstores and selected resellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My take: Why does Microsoft go out of its way to offer people bad deals like the Product Key Card? I am guessing it will be marketed as a way for customers to turn the trial version of Office provided on a new PC into a permanent purchase. If all you ever need is one copy, that's fine. But, if you have both a desktop and laptop machine, then the boxed version is a much better buy, especially in the case of Home and Student edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2010 is available for download as a public beta and is expected to be formally released later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Coursey has been writing about technology products and companies for more than 25 years.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Tuesday said it had revoked the visa it had given a Nigerian man after his alleged attempt to blow up an airliner on Christmas Day with explosives hidden in his underwear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama on Tuesday said U.S. intelligence agencies had enough information about Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to have discovered and possibly disrupted the plan to destroy the Detroit-bound airline but "failed to connect those dots."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama said the intelligence community knew Abdulmutallab had traveled to Yemen and established contact with extremists. The CIA has said it first learned of Abdulmutallab on November 19, when his father visited the U.S. embassy in Abuja and sought help finding him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics have questioned why the U.S. government did not put the pieces together and revoke his visa before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Abdulmutallab was stripped of his visa after the attempted attack, as were an unspecified number of others suspected of links to terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more than one," Crowley told reporters at his daily briefing. "I don't think it's fruitful to get into a scoreboard about ... how many people have we found today that we think have links to terrorism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Sandra Maler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
The Crosstex Energy companies, Crosstex Energy, L.P. (NASDAQ: XTEX) (the
Partnership) and Crosstex Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: XTXI) (the Corporation),
announced today that the Partnership has acquired the Intracoastal Pipeline, an
approximately 60-mile natural gas liquids (NGL) pipeline, from Chevron Midstream
Pipelines, a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) for approximately $10
million. The Intracoastal Pipeline, which extends from Patterson to Henry in
southern Louisiana, connects to Crosstex`s Pelican processing plant and accesses
other third-party processing plants in the region. NGL`s produced at Crosstex`s
Pelican plant flow through the Intracoastal Pipeline to Crosstex`s Cajun-Sibon
NGL pipeline for delivery to the Partnership`s Riverside fractionator.
Crosstex`s Eunice processing plant also is connected to the Cajun-Sibon NGL
pipeline. 

"The Intracoastal Pipeline will serve as a strategic link between our Pelican
and Eunice processing facilities and our Eunice and Riverside fractionators. We
believe the pipeline will enhance our operational efficiencies and competitive
advantages in the region, allowing us to maximize benefits from the processing
and NGL value chain," said Barry E. Davis, Crosstex President and Chief
Executive Officer. "The acquisition is consistent with our strategy to develop
our NGL business in southern Louisiana." 

About the Crosstex Energy Companies

Crosstex Energy, L.P., a midstream natural gas company headquartered in Dallas,
operates approximately 3,300 miles of pipeline, 10 processing plants and three
fractionators. The Partnership currently provides services for 3.2 billion cubic

Natural Gas Stocks Dip Again

Continued strong domestic production (from a number of unconventional natural
gas fields) and recessionary consumption (due to the economic downturn),
particularly in the industrial sector, are at the core of the commodity's
current woes. Stockpiles have gone on to create new highs this year as the
economic downturn eats into demand and natural-gas producers continue to unlock
new supplies from onshore natural-gas fields known as shales. Months of mild
weather further weakened demand for the fuel to heat homes and businesses. 

Given the depressed state of the commodity, the lower-than-anticipated drop in
reserves sent natural gas prices lower during the last few days of 2009.
However, the commodity has fared extremely well during the month of December,
giving returns of over 35% on the back of sustained inventory drawdown. Natural
gas prices ended the year at about $5.50 per million Btu (MMBtu), up more than
100% from their September 2009 lows. This was also helped by the news that oil
major ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) has decided to pick up unconventional natural gas
producer XTO Energy (NYSE: XTO) in a $41 billion all-stock deal. 

Nevertheless, we are not fully convinced about the sustainability of natural
gas` current gains, as the specter of a continued glut in domestic gas supplies
(storage levels remain 13.6% above their five-year average) still weighs and the
inventories remain higher compared to averages for this time of year. This
translates into limited upside for natural gas-weighted companies and related
support plays. 

The gap between supply and demand is expected to reverse in the coming months as
producers bet on forecasts for colder weather and the lagging effect of the
sharp drop in domestic drilling activity takes hold. 

Until then, we remain cautious on natural gas-focused E players such as
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK), EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG) and Devon Energy Corp.
(NYSE: DVN).

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (NYSE: WFC), Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE: GS), Morgan Stanley
(NYSE: MS), Shutterfly Inc. (Nasdaq: SFLY) and Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT). 

Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the free Profit from

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

WFC Pays $25M in Stock Bonuses

Carrying out its aforesaid bonus payment plans, on Dec. 31, 2009, Wells Fargo &amp;
Co. (NYSE: WFC) announced that it has paid stock bonuses worth $25 million to
its top four executives. The company also declared its denial for any cash bonus
payments for the fiscal year 2009. Moreover, disablement of selling this bonus
stock for at least the next five years, subject to company performance, came in
as another rider of bonus payments. 

Wells Fargo has taken a method similar to the one that Goldman Sachs Group
(NYSE: GS) had applied last week for bonus payments. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS)
is also considering one such proposal. 

According to the announcement, Wells Fargo will pay bonuses in the form of
stock, namely the "retention" shares of its common stock. By issuing these
shares for a three-year vesting period subject to achieving a defined
performance target, the company retains the authority to seize the stock bonus
of the executives in case they join a rival company. However, any cash bonus
payment for 2009 has been completely nixed to avoid any distress and undue
misunderstanding in the market. 

As intended, the announcement of stock bonuses came in just after Wells Fargo
exited the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) on Dec. 23, 2009. Wells Fargo`s
decision was crucial for the retention of its top four executives, who are
significantly responsible for the company`s performance. Despite the global
economic turmoil, Wells Fargo is believed to have attained the current level of
stability and a vital Wachovia acquisition primarily owing to its meticulous and
diligent managerial force. In Aug. 2009, the company had also raised the
salaries to reward these executives. 

Shutterfly Upped to Outperform

We are upgrading our recommendation on the shares of Shutterfly Inc. (Nasdaq:
SFLY) to Outperform. Increased usage of digital cameras combined with
accessibility of high-speed internet provides significant expansion potential
for the company. Product innovation, strategic partnerships with retailers and
opportunistic acquisition also augur well. We believe Shutterfly`s focus on
developing a successful commercial printing business aided by strategic
partnerships will significantly contribute to its earnings. 

Shutterfly`s third-quarter loss of 25 cents per share was 4 cents better than
the Zacks Consensus Estimate, primarily driven by a better-than-expected growth
in revenue. 

Shutterfly is innovating in the Personalized Products and Services category to
drive print customers toward higher revenue and higher margin products. The
company has already begun to realize leverage in its business model in gross
margins, operating margins and capital expenditures. The capital expenditures
are arriving from its strategic storage and manufacturing initiatives. These
structural improvements should benefit the company, going forward. 

Shutterfly has teamed up with Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT), a leading discount
retailer in the United States, to increase brand awareness and make its services
available in Target stores and on the Target.com website. During 2008, the
company entered into a strategic relationship with Group O, a leading provider
of marketing services, to provide commercial print services. Additionally, the
company acquired Nexo in 2008 and TinyPictures in September 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is aggressively pushing its small and medium business clients to make the move to Windows 7 and Office 2007. It announced an expansion of an existing promotion allowing business customers to upgrade to Windows 7 and the Office 2007 productivity suite at half off the suggested retail pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be eligible, customers must be part of Microsoft's Open Value Subscription (OVS) program and currently running one of the listed prior versions of those products. The original program--which expires June 30, 2010--included customers migrating from Windows Vista and Office 2003. Microsoft has now expanded the scope of the promotion to include customers upgrading from Windows XP and Office XP as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to operating systems and productivity suites for businesses, Microsoft's biggest competitor is itself. Alternative operating systems and office productivity applications exist, but pose little threat to Microsoft's dominance. However, tight budgets and a comfort level with the existing platform and applications can lead customers to complacency and apathy. Bottom line: if it ain't broke, why fix it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Windows side of that equation, the answer is that it is, in fact, broken. Companies that have already made the switch to Windows Vista have less compelling incentives to upgrade, but the vast majority of customers still rely on Windows XP. The advantages offered by Windows 7 just in the areas of security, remote support and connectivity, and simplicity of networking justify the upgrade by themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Office 2007, there are a couple of reasons business customers should consider taking advantage of Microsoft's generous offer. First, in addition to saving half off the suggested retail price of Office 2007, customers will also receive the associated Software Assurance benefits which include the ability to upgrade to Office 2010 for free when it is released later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, customers that take advantage of this offer quickly--like this week--can still get Word 2007 with the XML-associated features Microsoft recently lost its court battle with i4i over. As of January 11, 2010, Microsoft can no longer sell Microsoft Word with the patented technology, so a modified version lacking the functionality will be sold. However, customers that jump on this deal and make the purchase prior to January 11, 2010 can still get the "complete" Word 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual savings may vary, and in many cases won't truly be 50 percent. The reason is that business customers already have volume licensing agreements with volume discount pricing. The promotional offer is for 50 percent off suggested retail, but a company that is already used to getting 20 percent off as a volume discount will only get an additional 30 percent off--not 50 percent off of the discounted price they normally pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many businesses that held off from upgrading to Windows Vista and have clung to Windows XP are already exploring the switch to Windows 7. There could be issues with existing computer systems forcing customers to refresh hardware as well in some cases, but the deep discount on the operating system itself should provide some additional incentive for those customers to act before the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Bradley tweets as @PCSecurityNews, and can be contacted at his Facebook page .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/185812&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Jan 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Titus Labs today announced that its family of user-based classification
offerings is fully interoperable with Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2
File Classification Infrastructure (FCI). Titus Labs Message
Classification (TMC) and Titus Labs Document Classification (TDC) enable
organizations to build on the server-based classification offered as part
of FCI. An information management strategy that delivers both user and
server based classification enables organizations to drive the highest
levels of user awareness and reduce the risk of accidental data leakage.

    While the server-based classification in FCI enables organizations to
classify data either by content or folder, information may be
misclassified. Organizations can address this issue by implementing TMC
and TDC which includes users, who are most familiar with the data, in the
classification process. Furthermore, Titus Labs enables users to quickly
and easily correct any incorrect classifications. The end result is a
higher level of end user awareness, properly marked data and reduced risk
of accidental data leakage. 

    "Being able to manage data based on its business value enables
organizations to handle sensitive information with more care," said Eric
Jewett, Director Windows Server Marketing, Microsoft Corporation. "The
combined Titus Labs and Microsoft solution delivers rich capabilities for
automatic classification and policy enforcement at both the server and
end user level."

    Information classification is the critical first step in managing data
based on its business value. TMC enables organizations to force user
classification of Microsoft Outlook emails, while TDC drives
classification of Microsoft Office Documents. The addition of TMC and/or
TDC to existing FCI capabilities enables organizations to create an
end-to-end classification strategy, which is critical to ensuring
compliance, reducing risk and protecting valuable data. Both TMC and TDC
were fully tested with the RTM Microsoft Window Server 2008 R2 FCI. 

    "In conjunction with Microsoft, Titus Labs classification software
delivers the power to better manage information and ensure protection and
policy enforcement within the enterprise," explained Charlie Pulfer Vice
President of Product Management, Titus Labs "Information management is a
critical area for enterprises as they strive to protect their most
valuable asset, their information from issues such as accidental data
leakage. The combination of user and server based classification delivers
an unprecedented level of protection with industry-leading automatic
classification capabilities." 

    About Titus Labs

    Titus Labs is the leading provider of
http://www.titus-labs.com/software/Classification_default.html"&gt;email,
document and SharePoint classification software solutions to help
organizations share information securely while meeting policy and
compliance requirements. Our solutions enable military, government, and

&lt;p&gt;State-of-the-Art Store Design Inspired by Walt Disney`s Legacy of Innovation
PASADENA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney Store will transform an expansive retail space in the heart of New York`s
Times Square into a magical state-of-the-art, interactive retail destination set
to open in fall 2010. The lease signed with Vornado Realty Trust, negotiated by
RCS Real Estate Advisors, and brokered by SRS Real Estate Partnerssecured the
location at 1540 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Street. Inspired by Walt
Disney`s legacy of creativity and innovation, the new Disney Store will
celebrate Disney`s long-standing history with the city that never sleeps. 

Since the debut of Walt Disney`s audio-animatronic figures at the New York
World's Fair in 1964, Disney designers, architects, and engineers have utilized
technology to bring new immersive experiences to the city. Continuing the
legacy, Disney Store will incorporate technologically advanced displays
including an interactive Disney Princess castle to serve as one of many magical
centerpieces at the new Times Square location. An all-new children`s theater
will feature the latest Disney entertainment, classic animation, and continue
Disney`s rich tradition of storytelling. 

"Bringing Disney Store to the center of Times Square is a monumental
achievement, and we have created a retail experience that complements the energy
and innovation that Times Square inspires," said Jim Fielding, president of
Disney Stores Worldwide. "We`re focused on reinvigorating retail and providing a
unique shopping destination to millions of families from all over the world who
travel to New York for a magical experience." 

"Disney`s bold move to restore 42nd Street`s greatest landmark theater in the
1990s was the turning point in Times Square`s recent history. We are thrilled
that Disney is bringing its creative energies yet again to Times Square with
this new Disney Store. An iconic brand is coming again to America`s most iconic
place," said Tim Tompkins, president of Times Square Alliance. 

Renovations will begin soon at the Times Square location, designed to showcase a
wide assortment of products inspired by iconic Disney characters and key
entertainment properties. The newly-designed Disney Store will facilitate
interactive play and imagination, host children`s activities, special events,
and celebrity appearances. Over the next five years Disney Store plans to
strategically balance its retail portfolio, enter new markets, and transform
more than 300 locations across the US and Europe to feature the new design.

end-users. In addition, F5`s DevCentral portal, the only ADN online IT user
community, provides a custom iRule specifically designed for Windows Server 2008

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp plans to get its Natal body-gesturing gaming system into stores in time for this year's holiday shopping season, hoping to boost sales of its Xbox console and associated games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natal, which lets gamers control on-screen movements with hand gestures and voice commands, without a handheld device, is the software giant's counter to Nintendo Co Ltd's hugely successful Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wii was an important innovation, it was a part step. Natal is a giant step," said Robbie Bach, head of Microsoft's Entertainment and Devices unit, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to change the (gaming) experience in a pretty fundamental way," Bach told Reuters in an interview. "It's an accelerant in the business, because it will create new experiences for everyone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wii, which went on sale in 2006, also employs motion-sensing technology. But players wield a controller -- a device that doubles as everything from a tennis racket to a steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Xbox 360 game console is a distant runner-up to Nintendo's wildly popular gaming platform. Bach is hoping the controller-less Natal system will draw in new audiences, including older generations which are not a big market for gaming products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 70 percent of game developers are working on Natal versions of games, Bach said, meaning there should be a range of games available by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natal will require new hardware, essentially a motion-sensing camera, but will work with existing Xbox 360 consoles. Bach did not give pricing for the new system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft demonstrated Natal several times last year, but had never pinned down a date for rolling it out for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This coming year will be Xbox's biggest 12 months since the beginning of the business" in 2001, said Bach, with Natal and a new version of its popular "Halo" combat game -- Halo Reach -- slated for fall of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is also pushing growth of Xbox Live, which lets remote users play against each other and access Facebook, Twitter, Netflix and other Web services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Xbox 360 sold 820,000 units in November in the United States to the Wii's 1.26 million. But the world's largest software company hopes to bring the console into the center of the living room, transforming it into more than just a gaming box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bach laughed at the suggestion his unit will develop a "Zune phone" based on its well-reviewed but still unpopular digital music player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're doing tons of work in the phone space," Bach said. "But I've said consistently, we don't have plans to do a Zune phone, and we don't have plans to do Microsoft phones."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edwin Chan, Matthew Lewis and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which has been criticized for its lack of support of the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) specification in its Internet Explorer (IE) browser, this week joined the industry working group that oversees SVG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the company, in response to an inquiry, stopped short of saying it would actually begin to support SVG in IE. SVG provides for interactive Web-based graphics and is supported in other major browsers including Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Google Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Last year, InfoWorld examined what impacts the HTML 5 standard might have on Microsoft's Silverlight and Adobe's Flash technologies. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In joining the SVG Working Group of the World Wide Web Consortium, Microsoft is demonstrating "commitment to interoperability and standards support," said Patrick Dengler, senior program manager for the Microsoft Internet Explorer Team, in a blog entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're excited to take part in ensuring future versions of the SVG spec will meet the needs of developers and end users," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We recognize that vector graphics are an important component of the next generation Web platform," Dengler added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if Microsoft would support SVG, a company representative released this statement, which sidesteps the question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're investing in what the Web will look like in the future and we are committed to providing a browser that accurately supports Web standards.&#160; Making the Web easier for developers continues to be important and we will continue to contribute to development of HTML 5 along with other popular Web standards"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last fall, at the SVG Open 2009 conference at Google offices in Mountain View, Calif., dignitaries stressed that Microsoft's lack of SVG support in IE was a hindrance. Microsoft did have two representatives at the session but the company did not announce any support for SVG. &#160;Microsoft has supported vector graphics via the Microsoft-driven Vector Markup Language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Microsoft blog on the planned IE9 browser, some persons commenting on the technology were eager for SVG support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If IE9 doesn't support SVG, which has been a solidified W3C recommendation/standard since 2003, I won't support IE9," said one commenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's failure to support SVG in IE thus far has had somewhat of a chilling effect on adoption of the technology, with some people not wanting to use it because it is not supported across all browsers, said Doug Schepers, &#160;team contact for the W3C SVG and WebApps working groups. But the company's lack of support may be attributable to priorities rather than clinging to its own VML technology, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I've talked to them about it it's always been a matter of priority. There's a lot of stuff they need to do, and they haven't gotten around to SVG," Schepers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been talking with the IE team about SVG for a while and recent discussions have been very productive," said Schepers. All browsers, it seems, have been slow to support SVG, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other companies represented on the SVG working group include vendors such as Apple, Opera, Mozilla, and Boeing. Google is not part of the working group, but that could change now that Microsoft is participating, Schepers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SVG has been in existence for about a decade. Version 1.2 has just been finished and work is beginning on SVG 2.0, which is to feature a clarified document object model, simplified scripting and elements for common tasks such as making flow charts and diagrams, Schepers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft joins SVG working group," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Hewlett-Packard Co will unveil a new tablet computer on Wednesday, sources said, beating Apple Inc's hotly anticipated move into the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But analysts were skeptical that Microsoft and HP could generate as much consumer excitement as Apple's new device, widely expected to be unveiled on January 27, though the company has not said anything about it publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone's fired up about this type of device," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at fund manager Fort Pitt Capital Group. Microsoft has "a lot of the pieces in place" to make such a device work, but it's not clear that it can claim significant market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How do you make them usable and at a price point people will pay, which I suggest is sub-$500?" asked Caughey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, and HP, the top personal computer maker, are the latest companies to eye tablets that bridge the gap between laptops and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endpoint Technologies analyst Roger Kay said both companies have experience in designing a touch-screen, tablet-style device but that consumer interest in the category has never lived up to the hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could all change, Kay said, if Apple joins the fray. Microsoft and HP faced a difficult challenge in topping whatever device Apple launches, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The elephant in the room of course is Apple.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Chip Sales on the Rise

According to the latest updates from the Semiconductor Industry Association
(SIA), worldwide sales of semiconductors rose to $22.6 billion in November, up
3.7% from October and up 8.5% year over year. 

SIA President George Scalise added that sales of many IT and consumer products
fared much better than earlier projections in 2009. Sales of personal computers
continue to be strong, signaling the beginning of a recovery of demand from the
business sector. The release of Microsoft's (Nasdaq: MSFT) Windows 7 operating
system in October has boosted sales. In the consumer market, unit sales of LCD
TVs were up 25% - 30%. Sales increased sequentially in all geographic markets. 

Most chipmakers have recently raised their outlook for the December quarter in
anticipation of strong sales from all geographies. 

Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) upgraded its guidance for the fourth quarter
of 2009. Management expects revenues from all vertical markets to be up
sequentially in the fourth quarter, reflecting a strong new product cycle as
well as improving end-market trends and customer desire for appropriate
inventory to support sales levels. 

Rival company Xilinx Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) upgraded its guidance for the third
quarter of fiscal 2010. Management increased sales guidance primarily due to
broad-based strength across all end market categories and geographies. 

Earlier, top player Texas Instruments Inc. (NYSE: TXN) also raised its outlook
for the fourth quarter, driven by improved demand in chips used in cell phones
and other electronic gadgets such as hard disk drives and video game consoles.
Management stated that October and November were both strong months for the
company. 

Microchip Technology Incorporated (Nasdaq: MCHP) upgraded its guidance for the
third quarter as the company continues to see excellent design-win traction in
strategic product lines. This clearly signals a strong recovery in semiconductor
markets, which were hit hard by the global economic downturn a year ago.

&lt;p&gt;The headline of the story, "Italian consumer group plans class action against Microsoft," posted Tuesday, was incorrect. The lawsuit planned by the ADUC (Association for the Rights of Users and Consumers) seeks the return of the cost of unwanted Microsoft software from the manufacturers who preinstalled Windows on computer hardware. The headline has been clarified, and the deck headlined changed. The new headline reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Jan 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
China Education Resources Inc. ("China Education", "CER", "the Company")
(TSX VENTURE: CHN) (PINK SHEETS: CHNUF) today announced that it has
launched a joint promotional campaign in China with Coca-Cola Company
("Coke") promoting Qoo, a non-carbonated beverage developed by Coke
targeted at the youth market. 

    Coke has distributed 100,000 promotional packages in the Beijing area
each consisting of a large bottle of Qoo and a CD from CER which contains
10 short English courses developed by CER and a link to CER's education
services portal ("ESP"), through which the user will have access to a
number of online tutoring courses and a memory game to help students
learn English, both of which will be free initially but will require the
user to pay after a certain period. The CD also contains an invitation to
visit the CER offices in Beijing to take an English language assessment
examination. 

    C.F. Zhou, Chairman and CEO, said, "We are very proud of our new
association with Coke, one of the most recognized companies in the world.
This gives us tremendous credibility and to the best of my knowledge, CER
is the only online education company in China to be involved in any
promotional efforts with Coke. Over the last several years, CER has
developed a strong national reputation as a company which provides
leading edge, high quality products in the K to 12 area. This is a
win/win situation for both companies. Coke believes that an association
with a well known education company will help promote the sales of Qoo.
We believe that Coke's market penetration and distribution capabilities
will open new doors for us, as evidenced by the fact that the Qoo
promotional packages have now appeared in Wal-Mart stores around Beijing.
While it is too early to gauge the commercial success of this new
venture, I feel that an association with Coke will greatly increase our
exposure in the marketplace and do nothing but benefit our shareholders.
We will keep shareholders updated."

    ABOUT CHINA EDUCATION RESOURCES INC. 

    In collaboration with China's various education authorities and experts,
China Education Resources Inc. ("CER") is helping to transform the
curriculum of the world's largest educational system. Recognizing the

Chinese Central government's 2000 education reform policy changes, CER

heights.

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft, HP slate may go on sale mid-2010 - sources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Comes ahead of expected Apple unveiling Jan. 27&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS Jan 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and
Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) will announce late Wednesday a
tablet computer, sources said, becoming the biggest names to
venture into a nascent but potentially competitive market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company and top PC maker join
Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and others that are expected to show off new
tablets this year, aiming to bridge the gap between laptops and
smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's and HP's device will come with multimedia
capabilities and multi-touch functions, sources familiar with
the product told Reuters without elaborating, confirming a New
York Times report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The device will go on sale possibly by mid-2010, the
newspaper reported on its website. Microsoft and HP declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although next-generation tablet PCs are scarcely evident on
the market, the technology world is abuzz about their
potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At this week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas,
Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) are expected to
unveil so-called smartbooks based on their chips. Freescale
Semiconductor [FSLSM.UL] already has announced its own
version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But most attention is focused on Apple, which is widely
expected to lift the lid on its own tablet on Jan. 27, though
the company has not publicly said anything about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new generation of devices will seek to break Intel
Corp's (INTC.O) stranglehold on PCs -- the chipmaker makes
eight out of 10 microprocessors in the global market. Intel's
Atom processor now dominates the fast-growing netbook market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's shares fell 1 percent to $30.66 on Nasdaq at
mid-afternoon. HP's stock was off 0.44 percent at $52.44 on the
New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Bill Rigby and Gabriel Madway; Editing by

&lt;p&gt;Renewable Energy, PlantBottle, Recycling Programs Also Among Environmental
Initiatives Launched In San Francisco 


SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company officially "flipped the switch" today on its newly
refurbished, historic Coca-Cola sign located in downtown San Francisco at 701
Bryant St. The relighting also coincides with several environmental initiatives
that Coca-Cola is currently introducing in the Bay Area. 

About the New Coca-Cola Sign

Viewed by thousands of people who cross the Bay Bridge every day, the new sign`s
high efficiency lighting provides the same level of brightness as the previous
sign, but with enhanced reliability and greater energy efficiency. With this new
sign, 

Coca-Cola has furthered its corporate commitment to environmental sustainability
by converting obsolete lighting technology to a state-of-the-art LED display
that is 80 percent more energy efficient than the previous sign and has offset
100 percent of the electricity used to power the sign through the purchase of
Green-e certified 100 percent wind Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). 

In this endeavor, Coca-Cola collaborated with Sterling Planet, the nation's
leading retail provider of renewable energy, carbon offsets and energy
efficiency "White Tags". The purchase of Green-e certified wind energy displaces
the generation of conventional electricity therefore reducing carbon emissions
that would otherwise enter the atmosphere. 

The new display was engineered, manufactured and installed by Young Electric
Sign Company, a leading manufacturer and supplier of electronic displays in the
U.S. During the replacement process, 90 percent of the metal materials and
wiring from the previous sign faces were recycled. Sign elements that could not
be recycled such as the neon fixtures were disposed of in accordance with EPA
guidelines. 

"We have heard from many Bay Area residents about their love for this iconic
sign and we are honored that it has become such a beloved San Francisco
landmark," said Bea Perez, Senior Vice President, Integrated Marketing,
Coca-Cola North America. "The new sign reaffirms our commitment to maintain a
positive presence in the community by championing energy management and
sustainability initiatives." 

A Coca-Cola sign has been on display alongside the southbound lanes of the 

Bay Bridge for more than 70 years. The new 70-foot-by-30-foot sign is roughly
the same size and appearance as the previous sign. The new sign also features
the familiar Spencerian script of the Coca-Cola logo on both the north and south
faces of the display. 

About Coca-Cola`s Local Environmental Initiatives

Along with new sign, Coca-Cola is also introducing PlantBottle, a 100 percent
recyclable PET bottle made partially from plants, which reduces Coca-Cola`s
dependency on petroleum. For select markets in the Western United States,
including San Francisco, Seattle and Los Angeles, PlantBottle packaging will be
used for certain sparkling beverage brands and DASANI&#174; water in several sizes
starting in January. 

In addition, Coca-Cola Enterprises, the bottling partner serving the San
Francisco area, launched a recycling program at the San Leandro bottling
facility in January 2009. As of November 2009, this facility is recovering and
recycling the equivalent of 95 percent of packaging material used at the plant
(up from 61 percent in November 2008) with the goal of achieving 100 percent.
The program was launched as part of a goal to recover 500 million pounds of
recyclables by 2010.

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
The ExxonMobil Foundation announced today it will contribute $500,000 to Teach
For America to recruit and train math and science teachers for public schools in
low-income communities in Dallas, Houston, southern Louisiana and Washington,
D.C. 

The ExxonMobil grant will be used to recruit more than 1,500 top college
graduates from across the United States to teach middle-school math and science.
The funds will also support Teach For America`s rigorous program of pre-service
training, ongoing professional development and mentoring for these teachers. 

"Improving the quality of math and science education in America`s classrooms is
a primary focus for ExxonMobil because we believe that education is the key to
progress, development and economic growth," said Gerald McElvy, president of the
ExxonMobil Foundation. 

"Recruiting and training math and science teachers with strong content knowledge
is a critical step to addressing underperformance in these subjects. Teach For
America has a proven model that attracts our best and brightest college
graduates, and ExxonMobil actively supports their mission to address the math
and science achievement gap." 

In 2004, Teach For America launched an initiative to expand its corps of math
and science teachers to 4,000 by 2015 in order to serve more than 240,000
students annually. Teach For America recruits on more than 350 college campuses
nationwide. 

"ExxonMobil`s longstanding partnership with Teach For America helps improve
educational outcomes in our nation`s highest-need schools," said Wendy Kopp,
chief executive officer and founder of Teach For America. "We are grateful for
this support which enables us to bring thousands of talented and committed math
and science teachers to schools where they have a profound impact of inspiring
the next generation of math, science, and engineering professionals." 

ExxonMobil has supported Teach For America for 16 years. 

ExxonMobil is a long-standing supporter of math and science education, which
includes a $125 million commitment to launch the National Math and Science
Initiative (NMSI) in the United States. NMSI`s UTeach program has been praised
as a model for increasing the supply of qualified math and science teachers
through rigorous undergraduate education programs at colleges and universities
across the country. 

In 2009, ExxonMobil invested more than $90 million in education initiatives
worldwide. Other initiatives include the ExxonMobil Reasoning Mind Teacher
Qualification Program, partnerships with former astronauts Bernard Harris and
Sally Ride to encourage students to study math and science, and the Mickelson
ExxonMobil Teachers Academy, a partnership with PGA golfer Phil Mickelson and
his wife, Amy, which has equipped more than 2,000 teachers with innovative tools
to inspire students in math and science. Education is the largest program area
for ExxonMobil`s contributions.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Weitz &amp; Luxenberg (www.weitzlux.com) is helping to keep the residents of Vigo
County, Indiana, updated on the Jordan Creek environmental cleanup. The project
was initiated after a massive flood in June, 2008 caused the breach of a soil
levee on property owned by Pfizer Inc. An estimated 300 million gallons of
floodwater from a 900-acre watershed surged into a small containment pond that
was part of Pfizer`s wastewater treatment plant. The floodwaters overwhelmed the
small 3-acre pond, sending chemically-laden soil downstream into Jordan Creek
and across residential property lines in Indiana`s Vigo County. 

"Many residents are worried and are reaching out for legal information, as well
as health information," said Robin Greenwald, head of the Weitz &amp; Luxenberg
Environmental and Toxic Torts unit. "We want to share our knowledge with all
Vigo County home owners affected by the toxic PCB spill." 

Property owners there face more than water-damaged furniture. They are also
contending with soil contamination from high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) that seeped into the ground. The accident prompted the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management
to order a massive cleanup project. 

The bottom line

Fearing Pfizer`s cleanup efforts would fail to restore ground soil or real
estate values to pre-flood conditions, many local residents have asked that the
state order Pfizer to buy out their property. According to the company, the
cleanup project required the removal and replacement of some 70,000 cubic yards
of soil along 3.2 miles of Jordan Creek. 

PCB exposure symptoms

Despite Pfizer`s efforts, Jordan Creek residents are now reporting illnesses
associated with PCB exposure, including skin conditions such as chloracne and
rashes. Health authorities say symptoms can also include: changes in blood and
urine (which may indicate liver damage), dermal and ocular lesions, irregular
menstrual cycles, a lowered immune response, and poor cognitive development in
children. 

Seek justice and obtain compensation

If you are a Vigo County, Ind., resident and you or a family member is
experiencing health problems related to the exposure to PCBs, or you seek legal
advice about real estate property devaluations stemming from the accident, the
law firm of Weitz &amp; Luxenberg will provide a free legal consultation. Visit our
website at www.weitzlux.com, where you can obtain a free case review.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Wednesday it has struck a collaboration deal with India's Strides Arcolab Ltd that will significantly expand the generics business of the world's largest drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal, in which the terms were not disclosed, is expected to deliver 40 off-patent products -- primarily injectable cancer medicines -- to healthcare providers and patients in the United States, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first products to be commercialized under the collaboration are expected to be launched this year, pending U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will sell the off-patent sterile injectable and oral medicines covered by the deal in the United States through its Established Products unit -- its name for its generics business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has said it intends to become a major player in the injectables market with a goal to be among the world's top five in five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And we don't plan on stopping with the top five," David Simmons, president of Pfizer's Established Products unit, said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Strides is a powerhouse in the sterile injectables area," Simmons said, adding that Pfizer looked at more than 100 companies before settling on the deal with Strides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the U.S. market for off-patent injectable medicines is $10.9 billion, but declined to speculate on just how much of that market Pfizer could eventually grab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This deal marks the latest move by Pfizer to expand its generics business through tie-ups with Indian companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last May Pfizer signed licensing deals with India-based Aurobindo Pharma Ltd and Claris Lifesciences Ltd that increased its generics portfolio by 60 products and boosted its business in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This agreement (with Strides) brings the total number of products in-licensed by our Established Products business unit to more than 200," Simmons said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including Pfizer's own vast portfolio of medicines, the Established Products unit will have about 600 off-patent products, Simmons said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new deal, finished dosage from products will be licensed and supplied by Strides and Onco Laboratories Ltd and Onco Therapies Ltd -- joint ventures between Strides and Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd, Pfizer and Strides said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bangalore-based Strides has 14 manufacturing plants in six countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the current deal involves Pfizer sales only in the United States, it could eventually be expanded to include sales in others countries and additional products, Simmons said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We view this as a beginning of a partnership," Simmons said. "We look at Strides as a strong anchor point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

patients in the United States, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first products to be commercialized under the
collaboration are expected to be launched this year, pending
U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, the companies
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer will sell the off-patent sterile injectable and oral
medicines covered by the deal in the United States through its
Established Products unit -- its name for its generics
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has said it intends to become a major player in the
injectables market with a goal to be among the world's top five
in five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And we don't plan on stopping with the top five," David
Simmons, president of Pfizer's Established Products unit, said
in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Strides is a powerhouse in the sterile injectables area,"
Simmons said, adding that Pfizer looked at more than 100
companies before settling on the deal with Strides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the U.S. market for off-patent injectable medicines
is $10.9 billion, but declined to speculate on just how much of
that market Pfizer could eventually grab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This deal marks the latest move by Pfizer to expand its
generics business through tie-ups with Indian companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last May Pfizer signed licensing deals with India-based
Aurobindo Pharma Ltd (ARBN.BO) and Claris Lifesciences Ltd that
increased its generics portfolio by 60 products and boosted its
business in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This agreement (with Strides) brings the total number of
products in-licensed by our Established Products business unit
to more than 200," Simmons said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Including Pfizer's own vast portfolio of medicines, the
Established Products unit will have about 600 off-patent
products, Simmons said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the new deal, finished dosage from products will be
licensed and supplied by Strides and Onco Laboratories Ltd and
Onco Therapies Ltd -- joint ventures between Strides and Aspen
Pharmacare Holdings Ltd (APNJ.J), Pfizer and Strides said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bangalore-based Strides has 14 manufacturing plants in six
countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the current deal involves Pfizer sales only in the
United States, it could eventually be expanded to include sales
in others countries and additional products, Simmons said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We view this as a beginning of a partnership," Simmons
said. "We look at Strides as a strong anchor point."

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Strides Arcolab (BSE: 532531, NSE: STAR) today announced
a new collaboration, wherein Pfizer will commercialize off-patent sterile
injectable and oral products in the United States through its Established
Products Business Unit. These finished dosage form products will be licensed and
supplied by Strides and Onco Laboratories Limited and Onco Therapies Limited,
two joint ventures between Strides and Aspen, South Africa, in which each has a
50% ownership interest. The financial terms of the supply agreement were not
disclosed. 

The companies believe this is a highly complementary collaboration, which is
expected to deliver 40 off-patent products, many of which are oncology
therapeutics, to healthcare providers and patients in the U.S., by joining
Pfizer`s solid commercial infrastructure with Strides`s high-quality
manufacturing capabilities. The first of the products commercialized under this
collaboration is expected to be launched in 2010. 

"This Strides collaboration is new and exciting, and we are encouraged about the
potential of this relationship," said David Simmons, president and general
manager of Pfizer`s Established Products Business Unit. "In addition, this
agreement brings the total number of products in-licensed by our Established
Products Business Unit to more than 200 -- resulting in a total business unit
portfolio of approximately 600 high-quality, reliable, and cost effective
products for patients." 

"Partnering with Pfizer enhances our ability to reach a larger base of customers
and patients in need of quality treatment options," said Arun Kumar, Strides
Founder and Managing Director. "We have established a reputation for efficient
formulation development and technologies, manufacturing, and operational
flexibility and are looking forward to bringing these strengths to bear in our
collaboration with Pfizer." 

Pfizer`s Established Products Business Unit launched its U.S. Injectables team
less than 10 months ago and is already marketing products in the U.S. Through
this new collaboration with Strides, Pfizer continues to demonstrate its
commitment to become one of the top players in the injectables market.

&lt;p&gt;Expansion of the Popular MegaVideo&#174; JPEG Line Now Available in Smaller Form
Factor 1.3 to 5 MP Color and Day/Night Versions
GLENDALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Arecont Vision, the industry leader in IP-based megapixel camera technology,
today announces the launch of their new compact JPEG series of cameras in 1.3,
2, 3 or 5 megapixel formats. These CMOS sensor cameras were designed to address
cost sensitivities in the JPEG market as well as the size constraints of
environmental housings. Although the compact cameras are approximately half the
size and one-third lighter than their MegaVideo&#174; full size counterparts, the new
line offers identical picture quality, frame rates, image processing and many
core functionalities of the full size units. These cameras have been completely
redesigned to allow for significantly lower price points while maintaining
performance. 

Equipped with on camera motion detection and 64 zone capability, the cameras
provide custom programmable resolution, brightness, saturation, gamma, sharpness
and tint. Ideal for installations in environmental housings where a lighter,
more space-saving design is required, the Arecont Vision Compact JPEG cameras
function via PoE, eliminating the need for auxiliary power. In addition to color
and day/night models, all Arecont Vision Compact JPEG cameras feature Moonlight&#8482;
mode: an extended exposure and proprietary noise cancelling feature. 

"Our goal was to design and implement a compact camera that offered equal
performance and nearly identical feature sets to our existing JPEG MegaVideo&#174;
line at price points set to match or beat VGA prices to assure no-cost-penalty
megapixel selection for cost sensitive projects. Our new compact series provides
the same exceptional image quality, low light sensitivity and fast frame rates
that customers enjoy with all our products," said Dr. Michael Kaplinsky, CEO,
Arecont Vision. "This new offering further expands what is already the broadest
megapixel product line in the industry." 

Arecont Vision`s Compact JPEG 1.3 megapixel models (AV1310 and AV1310DN) and 2
megapixel models (AV2110 and AV2110DN) hit a new low price point for branded,
full featured megapixel cameras, and are now available for purchase.
Additionally, the 3 megapixel (AV3110 and AV3110DN) and 5 megapixel (AV5110 and
AV5110DN) models reach new competitive price points for Arecont Vision, and will
be available in February of 2010.

&lt;p&gt;Company Veteran and Proven Leader Will Oversee Consolidated Client Services and
Operations Department
WAYNE, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
The Keane Organization, a leading provider of compliance and risk management
solutions to Fortune 1000 corporations, today announced the promotion of Mary
Greener Steigerwalt to Chief Operating Officer, effective January 1, 2010.
Steigerwalt was previously the President of Keane`s Retirement Services Division
(KRS), where she was responsible for sales, sales management, and revenue
development for the business unit. In her new role as COO, she will take over
the consolidated functions of Client Services and Operations for the entire
organization. 

Mark Sweatman, formerly Senior Vice President with Keane`s Investor
Communication and Retention Solutions (ICRS) division, was recently announced as
Steigerwalt`s successor as the new President of KRS. 

Before joining Keane in 2005, Steigerwalt worked in the trade-publishing
industry for fifteen years, where she served as Vice President of Operations.
Steigerwalt has experience in all operational aspects of business, including
acquiring, selling, and launching new products and businesses.

like to congratulate her as she steps in to this new position," says Dorothy
Flynn, CEO of The Keane Organization. "Mary`s exemplary leadership of the KRS
division leaves me with no doubt that she will continue to play an integral role
in the firm`s progress. Her strong background in operations management and her
acute understanding of The Keane Organization`s products and services combine to
make her the ideal candidate for the position." 

"My experience as President of Keane`s Retirement Services division was
invaluable in helping me to understand the business from a sales perspective,
particularly when it comes to meeting the risk management and compliance needs
of our clients," says Steigerwalt. "Combined with my many years of operations
experience, I feel that my background has prepared me well to serve as COO, and
I look forward to tackling the many additional challenges of this new role." 

As COO, Steigerwalt will be responsible for managing the convergence of Client
Services and Operations management, as well as the development and
implementation of The Keane Organization`s many product and service offerings.
Steigerwalt will be joined by Joe Pollock and Tara Altman, who have both been
promoted to new positions in support of the consolidation of Client Services and
Operations. As Associate Vice President, Pollock will focus on building out all
of the operational systems associated with the new department, and will play an
integral role in analyzing and improving efficiencies of Operations. Altman will
join Pollock as Associate Vice President, Operations, where she will lead a team
of specialists focused on product support. 

Steigerwalt began her career at The Keane Organization in 2005 as the Executive
Vice President of the Business Solutions Group. She played an integral role in
the launch of the KRS division, and was promoted to President of the business
unit in April of 2008. Steigerwalt holds a management degree from La Salle

&lt;p&gt;
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., Jan. 6, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immunomedics, Inc.
(Nasdaq:IMMU), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing monoclonal
antibodies to treat cancer and other serious diseases, today announced that
Cynthia L. Sullivan, President and Chief Executive Officer, will present a
corporate overview, including comments on the Company's product portfolio, at

About Immunomedics

Immunomedics is a New Jersey-based biopharmaceutical company primarily focused
on the development of monoclonal, antibody-based products for the targeted
treatment of cancer, autoimmune and other serious diseases. We have developed a
number of advanced proprietary technologies that allow us to create humanized
antibodies that can be used either alone in unlabeled or "naked" form, or
conjugated with radioactive isotopes, chemotherapeutics or toxins, in each case
to create highly targeted agents. Using these technologies, we have built a
pipeline of therapeutic product candidates that utilize several different
mechanisms of action. We also have a majority ownership in IBC Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., which is developing a novel Dock-and-Lock (DNL) methodology with us for
making fusion proteins and multifunctional antibodies, and a new method of
delivering imaging and therapeutic agents selectively to disease, especially
different solid cancers (colorectal, lung, pancreas, etc.), by proprietary,
antibody-based, pretargeting methods. We believe that our portfolio of
intellectual property, which includes approximately 141 patents issued in the
United States and more than 300 other patents issued worldwide, protects our
product candidates and technologies. For additional information on us, please
visit our website at www.immunomedics.com. The information on our website does
not, however, form a part of this press release.

This release, in addition to historical information, may contain forward-looking
statements made pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Such statements, including statements regarding clinical trials,
out-licensing arrangements (including the timing and amount of contingent
payments), forecasts of future operating results, and capital raising
activities, involve significant risks and uncertainties and actual results could
differ materially from those expressed or implied herein. Factors that could
cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks associated with
new product development (including clinical trials outcome and regulatory
requirements/actions), our dependence on our licensing partners for the further
development of epratuzumab for autoimmune indications and veltuzumab for
non-cancer indications, competitive risks to marketed products and availability
of required financing and other sources of funds on acceptable terms, if at all,
as well as the risks discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The Company is not under any obligation, and the Company
expressly disclaims any obligation, to update or alter any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Management`s prepared remarks and answers to questions during the presentation
referenced in this release, including those concerning the company`s financial
results, operational initiatives, future performance expectations, and effects
of economic conditions are forward-looking statements and actual results may
differ materially from those projected or implied by the forward-looking
statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Future performance
expectations are predicated upon achievement of various sales and performance
targets that may be difficult to meet. Economic conditions are unstable and may
cause hospitals and other healthcare providers to curtail HIT system spending.
Eclipsys` cost reduction and other initiatives in response to the challenging
economic environment, including initiatives designed to improve operational
efficiencies, may not be effective, and it is difficult to predict what the
company may be able to achieve. Eclipsys sales may fall below expectations due
to market conditions, competition, and other factors, including client demands
for pricing and financing concessions. Costs may be greater than anticipated due
to the potential need to increase spending to ensure performance in accordance
with commitments to clients, regulatory requirements and other factors. Software
development may take longer and cost more than expected, and incorporation of
anticipated features and functionality (including as required to comply with
ARRA and related regulations, as well as other certification standards) may be
delayed, due to various factors including programming and integration challenges
and resource constraints. The market is highly competitive. Implementation and
customization of Eclipsys software is complex and time-consuming. Results depend
upon a variety of factors and can vary by client. Each client`s circumstances
are unique and may include unforeseen issues that make it more difficult than
anticipated to implement or derive benefit from software, implementation or
consulting services. The success and timeliness of the company`s services will
depend at least in part upon client involvement, which can be difficult to
control. Eclipsys is required to meet specified performance standards and
regulatory requirements, and clients can terminate contracts, assess penalties
or reduce contract scope under certain circumstances. More information about
company risks is available in recent Form 10-K and other filings made by
Eclipsys from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Special
attention is directed to the portions of those documents entitled "Risk Factors"
and "Management`s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations." Eclipsys Corporation and The Outcomes Company are registered
trademarks of Eclipsys Corporation.

&lt;p&gt;Monthly Four-part Series Provides Insight into Data-Driven Initiatives
CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Mariner and Microsoftinviteschool district and Department of Education leaders
to a series of Web sessions, beginning January 19, 2010 and continuing through
April 20, 2010. The series, entitled "Managing for Performance: From the School
to the State House," highlights education analytics that improve student
achievement and are the backbone of data-driven initiatives in K-12
organizations across the country. 

The speakers, including innovative K-12 leaders from several school districts
and a state DOE, will share the experiences and knowledge that they have gained
in their data-driven and performance management initiatives with Mariner
Education Division`s guidance. Scheduled for the third Tuesday of each month
from 11:00-11:30a.m. (EST), the sessions will provide participants with an
opportunity to interact with school district and Department of Education leaders
to learn about strategies to improve student achievement, transparency and
accountability. Registration for one or more of the Web Series sessions is
available at: www.mariner-usa.com/webseries.htm. 

"The effective use of data is essential to the success of managing for
performance," said David "Fitz" Fitzgerald, Mariner`s Education Practice Manager
and one of the Web Series` featured speakers. "We`ve learned from our
experiences with districts and DOEs that teachers and principals need easy
access to data views and education analytics to drive improvements in
instruction and student outcomes." 

"It has never been more important for schools to acquire rich data transparency
and education analytics solutions to help drive student achievement, test scores
and curriculum needs that will help educators map to state standards and
students` career aspirations," said Anthony Salcito, vice president of worldwide
education at Microsoft Corp. "Having that repository and toolset is going to be
the key priority for schools as they strive for innovation and transformation in
the classroom." 

This is the second Web Series in which Mariner Education and Microsoft have
showcased K-12 organizational leaders to their peers who have interest in
similar initiatives. The first series focused on the District Data Dashboard
implemented by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools and was held in the spring of 2009.
It generated tremendous interest from school district administrators and
educational leaders in the United States and around the world. 

District and Department of Education leaders of all levels are encouraged to
participate in the series to gain insight into the most effective applications
of performance management for classrooms, schools, districts and DOEs.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Martina Fuchs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DUBAI, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) signed a deal
with state-run Qatar Petroleum to develop a multi-billion dollar

said in a statement on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Qatar is the world's largest producer of liquefied natural

Arab state. Exxon has stakes in several of Qatar's LNG projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The petrochemical plant in the industrial city of Ras Laffan
was expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2015, the
statement said. That was a three-year delay on the previous

Qatar's North Field and produce a range of premium products to

&lt;p&gt;Proposed project includes world's largest steam cracker and specialty
polyethylene plants
DOHA, QATAR &amp; HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Qatar Petroleum (QP) and ExxonMobil Chemical Qatar Limited, a subsidiary of
Exxon Mobil Corporation, announced they have signed an agreement to progress the
joint development of a world-scale petrochemical complex in Ras Laffan
Industrial City, Qatar. The proposed complex would include the world's largest
steam cracker and polyethylene plants, and one of the world's largest ethylene
glycol plants. The announcement was made by His Excellency, Abdullah bin Hamad
Al-Attiyah, Qatar Deputy Premier, Minister of Energy and Industry and QP
Chairman, and by Steve Pryor, President, ExxonMobil Chemical Company, at a
signing ceremony held in Doha. 

"The State of Qatar has embarked on ambitious programs to utilize and develop
its hydrocarbon resources. This agreement represents another important step to
achieve the vision of His Highness the Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani,
for the optimal utilization of the country`s natural resources," His Excellency
Al-Attiyah said. 

"Teams from Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil have worked together to develop a
leading-edge project that will meet the growing global demand for petrochemical
products," added Pryor. "ExxonMobil Chemical is looking forward to working with
Qatar Petroleum to develop this world-class petrochemical complex featuring
ExxonMobil`s industry-leading, proprietary technology."

650 KTA gas phase polyethylene plants, and a 700 KTA ethylene glycol plant. The
project will employ ExxonMobil's proprietary steam cracking and polyethylene
process, and product technologies. It will utilize feedstock from gas
development projects in Qatar's North Field and produce a range of premium
products to serve global petrochemical demand, with a particular focus on the
growing Asia markets. 

Start-up of the proposed facility is estimated in late 2015.

&lt;p&gt;Second Major Alliance Validates Ensemble Leadership in New Therapeutic Space
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Ensemble Discovery today announced the initiation of a strategic alliance with
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) to discover and develop drug candidates of a novel class
against a number of high-value pharmaceutical targets. 

The collaboration will deploy Ensemble`s proprietary drug discovery platforms
and EnsemblinTM compound libraries to discover and advance drug candidates.
Pfizer will provide upfront and research payments to Ensemble and will have the
right to develop and commercialize any products arising from the collaboration.
In addition, Ensemble will receive development milestones plus royalties based
on worldwide sales of any drugs emerging from the alliance and commercialized by
Pfizer. 

The goal of the alliance is to develop Ensemblins against important therapeutic
targets, particularly those involving protein-protein interactions. Ensemblins
are a new class of oral drugs developed by Ensemble to address disease targets
that cannot be modulated effectively by traditional small molecule
pharmaceuticals. 

"We are excited to launch our new alliance with Pfizer," said Dr. Michael D.
Taylor, CEO of Ensemble Discovery. "This is our second major alliance in less
than a year and it attributes a significantly increased value to our platform
and its resultant products. This deal supports Ensemble`s position as the
leading company exploring new therapeutic opportunities between small molecules
and biologics." 

Tony Wood, Ph.D., Global Head of Chemistry at Pfizer said, "Pfizer is very
pleased to join this collaboration. The Ensemble technology platform will give
us access to an area of chemical space not currently well-represented in our
file that holds the potential to be of utility in addressing novel target
types." 

Historically, the biopharmaceutical industry has focused its drug discovery on
oral small molecules, which obey the "rule-of-five", and large protein
biologics, which cannot address targets inside cells or be administered orally.
A large region of molecular diversity exists between these classes, containing
very few approved drugs. Ensemble aims to be the leading company in this space;
Ensemblins are synthetic macrocycles designed to access this space and to have
oral availability and other advantages of small molecules combined with the
biochemical power of biologics. 

"Our Ensemblin platform advanced massively during 2009 and our capabilities will
increase further in 2010," said Nick Terrett, CSO of Ensemble Discovery. "There
is a growing recognition in the large pharma companies of the need for novel
chemistry capability to attack the many targets with strong biological
validation that do not lend themselves to conventional small molecule or
biologic drugs. Our progress has demonstrated the power of the Ensemblins to
address those targets, as our leading projects have advanced to demonstrate oral
efficacy in preclinical disease models." 

About Ensemblins

EnsemblinsTM are a new class of synthetic macrocycles developed by Ensemble
using its proprietary chemistry platforms, including DNA-Programmed ChemistryTM.
Macrocyclic rings are found in many natural product-based drugs and bestow
favorable pharmaceutical properties and powerful protein surface binding
properties upon such drugs. Thus, macrocycles are uniquely suited to address
many protein targets that cannot be modulated effectively by traditional small
molecule pharmaceutical compounds. Macrocycles have been challenging to
synthesize in large numbers and this has constrained their wider use in the
industry. Ensemble has produced larger libraries of macrocyclic drug candidates
than any previously synthesized in the pharmaceutical industry. 

About Ensemble Discovery Corporation

Based in Cambridge, MA, Ensemble Discovery Corporation is deploying its
proprietary chemistry platforms to develop a novel class of therapeutics known
as "Ensemblins". Ensemble is the exclusive worldwide licensee from Harvard
University of its patents covering DNA-Programmed Chemistry. 

Ensemble is pursuing a proprietary drug pipeline and also collaborations with
pharmaceutical partners. Ensemble established its first drug discovery alliance
with Bristol-Myers Squibb in April 2009. Ensemble`s lead proprietary programs
are in the inflammatory disease field, including programs to target the TNF
receptor superfamily.

This news release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the federal securities laws. Statements regarding future events, developments,
the Company's future performance, as well as management's expectations, beliefs,
intentions, plans, estimates or projections relating to the future (including,
without limitation, statements concerning revenue and net income), are
forward-looking statements within the meaning of these laws and involve a number
of risks and uncertainties. Moreover, these forward-looking statements are
subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outlined
below. As a result, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated by
the forward-looking statements. Among the important factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking
statements are: the volume and timing of systems sales and installations; length
of sales cycles and the installation process; the possibility that products will
not achieve or sustain market acceptance; seasonal patterns of sales and
customer buying behavior; the timing, cost and success or failure of new product
and service introductions, development and product upgrade releases; undetected
errors or bugs in software; changing economic, political or regulatory
influences in the health-care industry; changes in product-pricing policies;
availability of third-party products and components; competitive pressures
including product offerings, pricing and promotional activities; the Company's
ability or inability to attract and retain qualified personnel; possible
regulation of the Company's software by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration;
uncertainties concerning threatened, pending and new litigation against the
Company including related professional services fees; uncertainties concerning
the amount and timing of professional fees incurred by the Company generally;
changes of accounting estimates and assumptions used to prepare the prior
periods' financial statements; general economic conditions; and the risk factors
detailed from time to time in Quality Systems' periodic reports and registration
statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A significant
portion of the Company's quarterly sales of software product licenses and
computer hardware is concluded in the last month of the fiscal quarter,
generally with a concentration of such revenues earned in the final ten business
days of that month. Due to these and other factors, the Company's revenues and
operating results are very difficult to forecast. A major portion of the
Company's costs and expenses, such as personnel and facilities, are of a fixed
nature and, accordingly, a shortfall or decline in quarterly and/or annual
revenues typically results in lower profitability or losses. As a result,
comparison of the Company's period-to-period financial performance is not
necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future
performance. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer bragged up Windows 7 success last night in his keynote speech at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he wasn't lying, said Stephen Baker, an analyst with the NPD Group, which provided Microsoft with some of the numbers that Ballmer used to trumpet Windows 7 's first two months on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh, yeah, the numbers were right," said Baker from Las Vegas today. "From all angles, from unit sales, from dollars, it was a great holiday season for Windows 7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer cited NPD data several times during his CES keynote . "U.S. retail data shows that Windows PC sales jumped almost 50% the week it launched," said Ballmer just minutes into his presentation. "On Black Friday, [NPD] reported that retailers sold 33% more Windows PCs than the year before. And for the 2009 holiday season a 50% increase in Windows PC sales from last year. Last year was a tough year, but these are still phenomenal numbers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night, Ballmer also announced that Windows 7 was "by far the fastest selling operating system in history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He must have gotten that from someone else," Baker said, noting that NPD had no data to confirm or deny Ballmer's claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Windows 7 did have a great opening two months, Baker agreed. "PC sales were pretty dramatic," he said, "and it's definitely a Windows 7 thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What took Baker by surprise was the big bump in sales of desktop PCs, a category once thought at death's door. "To some extent, desktop sales have been through the roof in the holiday season," he said. "For a while there, desktop sales were slow, we were seeing negative growth, and they were doing bad, really bad. But during the holidays we've seen nothing but positive numbers. It's not been huge -- desktops aren't going to outsell notebooks any time soon -- but even so, it was a big surprise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker was hard pressed to explain the uptick in sales of Windows 7 desktops, although he had a theory. "While a lot of people may be upgrading their Vista laptops [with a retail upgrade copy of Windows 7], generally consumers' desktops are a lot older than their notebooks," Baker said. "Those older desktops are probably running Windows XP."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, consumers may be deciding to buy a new PC with Windows 7 already installed rather than go through the hassle of trying to upgrade the older hardware to the new operating system. Or they may believe it's simply time to retire the XP workhorse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The desktop is usually the central controlling computer in the house," Baker argued. "And Windows 7 gives consumers a better experience for that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Baker said a similar upgrade scenario had played out on the Mac when Apple's desktop sales climbed 71% in October and November over the same months of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 7 is a hit," said Baker, comparing its opening months to Vista's much smaller impact on PC sales three years ago. "As a product, it's great. But Microsoft is also doing a great job on the marketing end as well," Baker added. For an example, he pointed to a special that Best Buy ran yet again in its circular last Sunday that offered three Hewlett-Packard computers -- a netbook, a notebook and a desktop -- for $1,199. All three PCs are equipped with Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They keep running that special," Baker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Baker's eyes, Microsoft biggest mistake with Windows 7 was to yank the popular Family Pack, a multi-license bundle that customers could use to upgrade up to three PCs from Windows XP or Vista, to Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft pulled the Family Pack in early December, about a month after it first offered the $119.99 package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was a mistake," said Baker. "What [Microsoft] doesn't seem to get is that the nature of what people own is a lot different now. There are multiple PCs in the house, and all of them could use the upgrade."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes Microsoft's move all the harder to accept, said Baker, is that the company's most popular edition of Office is Home and Student, which lets users install the suite on as many as three PCs in the same household.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft needs to be more aggressive on price to drive adoption of Windows 7," Baker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today said it will deliver a single security update on Tuesday to patch just one vulnerability in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the company acknowledged that it does not yet have a fix for a crippling bug in Windows 7 that went public nearly two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expected update will patch a vulnerability rated "critical" -- Microsoft 's most serious rating in its four-step scoring system -- in Windows 2000. The bug also affects Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7, as well as Windows Server 2003, Server 2008 and Server 2008 R2, but is tagged as "low" for those editions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first thing that came to mind was a denial-of-service vulnerability for the newer [operating systems], and a remote code execution on Windows 2000," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft downplayed the threat even to Windows 2000 users. "The Exploitability Index rating for this issue will not be high, which lowers the overall risk," said Jerry Bryant, a Microsoft security spokesman, in a post to the company's security response center blog today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms welcomed next week's light patch load, which follows several months of multiple updates: Microsoft set a security record in October when it patched 34 vulnerabilities in 13 separate updates, for example. "It's nice to have a light month, especially with the uptick in Adobe vulnerabilities," said Storms, referring to a bug in Adobe's popular PDF software that is also slated to be patched Jan. 12 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe, which last summer committed to releasing security updates for Reader and Acrobat each quarter, will also patch bugs next Tuesday. Adobe published its own pre-patch notification today, but as is its practice, declined to say how many vulnerabilities, other than the one now being used by hackers , will be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Microsoft is skipping one patch next week, Bryant confirmed today: The company will not fix an outstanding denial-of-service vulnerability in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. "We are still working on an update for the issue at this time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-November, Microsoft confirmed that the bug in SMB (Server Message Block), a Microsoft-made network file and print-sharing protocol, could be used by attackers to cripple Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 machines. Microsoft has maintained that the vulnerability cannot be used to hijack PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Windows 7 flaw was first reported by Canadian researcher Laurent Gaffie Nov. 11, 2009, just a day after Microsoft shipped that month's patches, when he published proof-of-concept attack code to a security mailing list. According to Gaffie, exploiting the flaw crashes Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 systems so thoroughly that the only recourse is to manually power off the computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a public [relations] perspective, I would have expected Microsoft to patch the SMB bug this month," said Storms. "On the other hand, I'm not surprised they won't, since it's only a denial-of-service bug."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will release the security update at approximately 1 p.m. ET on Jan 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Prolonged exposure to cocaine can cause permanent changes in the way genes are switched on and off in the brain, a finding that may lead to more effective treatments for many kinds of addiction, U.S. researchers said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study in mice by Ian Maze of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and colleagues found that chronic cocaine addiction kept a specific enzyme from doing its job of shutting off other genes in the pleasure circuits of the brain, making the mice crave the drug even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study helps explain how cocaine use changes the brain, said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the study published in the journal Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding is opening up our understanding about how repeated drug use modifies in long-lasting ways the function of neurons," Volkow said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the team gave one group of young mice repeated doses of cocaine and another group repeated doses of saline, then a single dose of cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that one way cocaine alters the reward circuits in the brain is by repressing gene 9A, which makes an enzyme that plays a critical role in switching genes on and off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies have found that animals exposed to cocaine for a long period of time undergo dramatic changes in the way certain genes are turned on and off, and they develop a strong preference for cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study helps explain how that occurs, Volkow said, and may even lead to new ways of overcoming addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, Maze and colleagues showed these effects could be reversed by increasing the activity of gene 9A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When they do that, they completely reverse the effects of chronic cocaine use," Volkow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said this mechanism is likely not confined to cocaine addiction, and could lead to a new area of addiction research for other drugs, alcohol and even nicotine addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the questions we've had all along is, after discontinuing a drug, why do you continue to be addicted?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is one of the mechanisms that probably is responsible for these long-lasting modifications to the way people who are addicted to drugs perceive the world and react to it," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Todd Eastham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Wednesday posted an update for Word 2007 that ditches the custom XML tagging technology a federal court banned the company from including in its software after Jan. 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Microsoft had produced a patch for computer makers who factory-install Microsoft Office 2007 on new PCs before they're shipped to distributors, retailers or customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update, which weighs in at 12.3MB and was added to Microsoft's download site Wednesday, is mandatory only for customers who purchase or license Word 2007 for use in the U.S. after this Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an accompanying support document , Microsoft also said it will distribute a similar patch for Word 2003, although that update has not yet appeared on the company's site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users who bought or licensed Word before Jan. 10 do not have to apply the patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patch turns an existing copy of Word 2007 into the twin of what Microsoft is required to market after Sunday. With the patch's availability, copies of Office 2007 and Word 2007 already on store shelves may be salable, assuming Microsoft gets the word out to those customers that they need to apply the fix. "You must install this update if you are instructed by Microsoft in a separate communication," Microsoft said in the support document, hinting that it will do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft assured customers that applying the patch would not affect Office Word content controls, the Office Open XML (OOXML) formats that Word 2007 supports or the Custom XML markup data stored within older Word formats from the Word 97-Word 2003 eras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move was forced on Microsoft by a federal appeals court two weeks ago when it rejected the company's appeal of an injunction applied by a lower court several months ago. The case, which began in 2007, pitted Canadian software developer i4i against Microsoft when the former accused the latter of illegally using its XML editing technology in Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2009, a Texas jury said Microsoft violated i4i's patent, and ordered it to pay i4i nearly $300 million in damages. The federal judge overseeing the lawsuit issued his injunction on Aug. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case has attracted interest primarily because of that injunction, which originally was set to take effect Oct. 10, 2009. The injunction was suspended after Microsoft threatened that sales chaos would result, and several major computer makers, including Hewlett-Packard and Dell, stepped forward to back Microsoft's claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is looking to sign a contract for a Transocean Ltd (RIG.N) rig capable of drilling in Arctic waters that will cost up to $1 billion to build, according to a person familiar with the rig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new rig could be deployed to places such as Greenland, Iceland or offshore Alaska, and command a rate in the range of the record $650,000 per day that Transocean, the largest offshore rig contractor, secured in mid-2008 for a five-year deepwater contract that starts next month, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives and analysts say Arctic offshore drilling will become more attractive for big oil companies as pricier crude supports more expensive extraction and with so many onshore reserves in the hands of state firms or in volatile regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many extractive resource groups and shipping companies have their eyes on the Artic's potential as an increase in melting ice leaves more open water each summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transocean Chief Executive Bob Long said in September, without giving details, that his company could announce a new arctic-class rig with a contract by the end of 2009. A few analysts, after meeting Transocean management late last year, put the cost of the rig at somewhere approaching $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final decision on the new Transocean drillship had been expected last month, but Exxon was busy working out its $30 billion deal to buy XTO Energy Inc XTO.N, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon spokeswoman and a Transocean spokesman both declined to comment on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on its website, Exxon says: "ExxonMobil has a portfolio of significant Arctic opportunities, with ongoing studies spanning the range of exploration, project feasibility assessment and planning, and technology development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds Exxon outlook from its website, background, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
is looking to sign a contract for a Transocean Ltd (RIG.N) rig
capable of drilling in Arctic waters that will cost up to $1
billion to build, according to a person familiar with the rig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new rig could be deployed to places such as Greenland,

become more attractive for big oil companies as pricier crude
supports more expensive extraction and with so many onshore
reserves in the hands of state firms or in volatile regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many extractive resource groups and shipping companies have
their eyes on the Artic's potential as an increase in melting
ice leaves more open water each summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Transocean Chief Executive Bob Long said in September,
without giving details, that his company could announce a new
arctic-class rig with a contract by the end of 2009. A few
analysts, after meeting Transocean management late last year,
put the cost of the rig at somewhere approaching $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A final decision on the new Transocean drillship had been
expected last month, but Exxon was busy working out its $30
billion deal to buy XTO Energy Inc XTO.N, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon spokeswoman and a Transocean spokesman both
declined to comment on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But on its website, Exxon says: "ExxonMobil has a portfolio
of significant Arctic opportunities, with ongoing studies
spanning the range of exploration, project feasibility
assessment and planning, and technology development."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc was sued on Thursday by an Illinois pension fund seeking to recover billions of dollars of bonuses and other compensation being awarded for 2009, saying the payouts harm shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a lawsuit filed in New York state supreme court in Manhattan on behalf of shareholders, the Central Laborers' Pension Fund said Goldman had by September 25 set aside nearly $17 billion for compensation and might pay out more than $22 billion for the year. It said this "highlights the complete breakdown" of corporate oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit contends that Goldman's revenue for the year was artificially inflated by government bailouts of the banking industry and the insurer American International Group Inc, as well as a change in Goldman's fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such sums, and Goldman's practice of continuing to pay out nearly 50 percent of net revenue as compensation, show "scant regard" for the interests of shareholders, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally called the lawsuit "completely without merit." Other defendants are Chairman and Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn, Vice Chairman J. Michael Evans, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, and 10 directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An individual shareholder, Ken Brown, filed a similar lawsuit in the same court on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has in recent months been faulted by banking critics who say it is one of the biggest beneficiaries of government efforts to shore up a financial system that seized up in September 2008, and who consider its pay awards outsized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank repaid its $10 billion of bailout money last year, and thus is no longer subject to related curbs on pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concern about financial industry pay generally is expected to rise over the next few months as companies release their proxy statements and hold annual meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other unions have also criticized Goldman conduct.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) shares rose more than 6 percent on Thursday after J.P. Morgan raised its price target on the stock to $22 from $20, saying investors underappreciate potential earnings recovery at the GE Capital finance unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Comes ahead of expected Apple unveiling Jan. 27&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft, HP slate to go on sale this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Demo runs Amazon Kindle software
 (Recasts with Ballmer demonstration)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby and Gabriel Madway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LAS VEGAS, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer unveiled a new Hewlett-Packard Co
(HPQ.N) tablet computer on Wednesday, beating Apple Inc's
(AAPL.O) hotly anticipated move into the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But analysts were skeptical that Microsoft and HP could
generate as much consumer excitement as Apple's new device,
widely expected to be unveiled on Jan. 27, though the company
has not said anything about it publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer showed off the new device at the end of his keynote
speech at the CES technology show in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This great little PC -- which will be available later this
year -- I think many customers are going to be very excited
about," said Ballmer, using finger touches to flip through a
book on the screen using Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) Kindle
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Everyone's fired up about this type of device," said Kim
Caughey, senior analyst at fund manager Fort Pitt Capital
Group. Microsoft has "a lot of the pieces in place" to make
such a device work, she said, but it's not clear that it can
claim significant market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "How do you make them usable and at a price point people
will pay, which I suggest is sub-$500?" asked Caughey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer did not detail pricing or when the device will hit
stores. An earlier New York Times report said it could go on
sale by mid-2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's presentation, which kicked off the world's
biggest consumer technology show, started late after a power
outage and suffered a few tech hiccups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After Ballmer, Microsoft's entertainment and game chief
Robbie Bach announced that a new instalment of the hugely
successful Halo game will be out this year, and its
controller-less game system Project Natal will be in stores by
the holiday season. [ID:N06170410]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BIG HYPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, and HP, the
top personal computer maker, are the latest companies to eye
tablets that bridge the gap between laptops and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Endpoint Technologies analyst Roger Kay said both companies
have experience in designing a touch-screen, tablet-style
device but that consumer interest in the category has never
lived up to the hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That could all change, Kay said, if Apple joins the fray.
Microsoft and HP faced a difficult challenge in topping
whatever device Apple launches, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The elephant in the room of course is Apple. Other
manufacturers are scrambling to get things together before it
defines the market," Kay said. "HP may be looking to put a
stake in the ground before Apple makes its move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talk of Apple's tablet -- potentially the company's biggest
product launch since the iPhone -- has swirled in trading
rooms, tech websites and industry forums for months. The
speculation helped propel Apple's stock to record highs in
January, though some say the device may be overhyped.
[ID:nN0588388]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABUZZ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HP has been heavily promoting touch technology across its
line of PCs, and just announced new products such as an updated
version of its TouchSmart swivel-screen convertible laptop, and
a touch-enabled netbook. [ID:nN04220829]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although next-generation tablet PCs are scarcely evident on
the market, the technology world is abuzz about their
potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At this week's CES show, Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Nvidia
Corp (NVDA.O) are also expected to unveil so-called smartbooks
based on their chips. Freescale Semiconductor [FSLSM.UL]
already has announced its own version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unni Narayanan from Primary Global Research said he does
not expect the new tablet to showcase any game-changing
innovation, and instead may be more advanced versions of
existing HP devices already on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our expectation is that it will be a testing-the-waters
sort of thing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From Microsoft's perspective, Kay said the company wants to
"highlight and showcase everything that Windows 7 can do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new generation of devices will seek to break Intel
Corp's (INTC.O) stranglehold on PCs -- the chipmaker makes
eight out of 10 microprocessors in the global market. Intel's
Atom processor now dominates the fast-growing netbook market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's shares fell 0.6 percent to close at $30.77 on
Nasdaq. HP was off 0.9 percent at $52.18 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

violations of federal securities laws against Koss Corp. ("Koss" or the
"Company") (NASDAQ: KOSS), relating to the Company`s now-disclosed internal
investigation of "unauthorized financial transactions." Koss has expanded its
internal investigation to include fiscal years 2006 through the present. 

On December 24, 2009, Koss issued a press release announcing that: (1) following
the discovery of unauthorized financial transactions, Sujata Sachdeva, the
Company`s Vice President of Finance and Secretary, was terminated; and (2) two
members of the Company's accounting staff who served under Sachdeva were placed
on unpaid administrative leave. According to the Company: "Preliminary estimates
indicate that the amount of unauthorized transactions since fiscal year 2006
through the present may exceed $20 million, but at this point the Company and
its advisors cannot assess the potential impact on its financial statements or
identify the extent that specific fiscal periods may be affected. Nor can the
Company and its advisors yet assess the extent of the possible offsets through
insurance, asset recoveries and other mechanisms related to the unauthorized
transactions. As a result, the Company has concluded that its previously issued
financial statements at least since the end of its 2006 fiscal year should no
longer be relied upon. The Company plans to restate its financial statements for
such periods as further investigation indicates." 

If you purchased shares of Koss Corp. since January 2006, if you have
information or would like to learn more about these claims, or if you wish to
discuss these matters or have any questions concerning this announcement or your
rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Investor

&lt;p&gt;  REDWOOD CITY, CA, Jan 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Host Analytics, the leading provider of cloud-based corporate performance
management (CPM) solutions, today announced it has attained Gold
Certified Partner status in the Microsoft Partner Program with a
competency in ISV/Software Solutions, recognizing Host Analytics'
expertise and impact in the technology marketplace. As a Gold Certified
Partner, Host Analytics has demonstrated expertise with Microsoft
technologies and a proven ability to meet customers' needs. Microsoft
Gold Certified Partners receive a rich set of benefits, including access,
training and support, giving them a competitive advantage in the channel.

    As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner status,
Host Analytics had to declare a Microsoft Competency. Microsoft
Competencies are designed to help differentiate a partner's capabilities
with specific Microsoft technologies to customers looking for a particular
type of solution. Each Competency has a unique set of requirements and
benefits, formulated to accurately represent the specific skills and
services that partners bring to the technology industry. The ISV/Software
Solutions Competency recognizes the skill and focus partners bring to a
particular solution set. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners that have
obtained this competency have a successful record of developing and
marketing packaged software based on Microsoft technologies.

    "This news is important because it means we can offer customers the latest
product and platform enhancements sooner rather than later," said Ric
Ratkowski, vice president of product strategy at Host Analytics. "As a
Gold Certified Partner we'll have access to Microsoft technology
innovations, such as advanced Web 2.0 user interface controls, before they
are publicly available. This way we can update the Host Analytics CPM
platform so users get the most important new capabilities as soon as
possible."

    "Solutions competencies are an important way for Microsoft to better
enable ISVs to meet customer needs," said Walid Abu-Hadba, corporate vice
president of the Developer and Platform Evangelism Group at Microsoft
Corp. "They allow ISVs to keep and win customers through their deep
knowledge of solutions-based Microsoft platform technologies. Microsoft
has a long history of working closely with ISV partners to help them
deliver compelling solutions and applications to our mutual customers,
and the Microsoft Competencies are an important step in continuing to
enhance vital relationships with ISVs worldwide."

    The Microsoft Partner Program was launched in October 2003 and represents
Microsoft's ongoing commitment to the success of partners worldwide. The
program offers a single, integrated partnering framework that recognizes
partner expertise, rewards the total impact that partners have in the
technology marketplace, and delivers more value to help partners'
businesses be successful.

&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA--(Business Wire)--
Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, Inc., a leader in the development of products with
the potential for earlier and more effective detection, diagnosis, and
monitoring of brain disorders, today announced that Daniel M. Skovronsky, M.D.,
Ph.D., Founder and CEO, will present at the J.P. Morgan 28th Annual Healthcare
Conference. 

Dr. Skovronsky`s presentation is scheduled for Wednesday, Jan. 13 at 7:30 a.m.
PST in Elizabethan C/D. Dr. Skovronsky will provide attendees with an update on
Phase III clinical trials and commercialization efforts for the company`s
amyloid imaging compound 18F-AV-45 (AV-45). This tracer is the most advanced
compound of its type in development for imaging amyloid plaque in the brain
associated with Alzheimer`s disease. In 2009, AV-45 entered a pivotal
registration study using a unique trial design that was based upon
recommendations by the FDA peripheral and CNS advisory committee. 

Avid`s second program, 18F-AV-133 (AV-133) PET imaging of the vesicular
monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in patients with suspected dopaminergic
degeneration, is currently in Phase II clinical trials. AV-133 has also been
shown to be a marker for beta cells of the pancreas in preclinical studies. The
compound is now in Phase I studies to test the ability of this molecular imaging
agent to distinguish type 1 and type 2 diabetes subjects from healthy, normal
individuals based on a PET scan of the pancreas. 

The J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference will be held Jan. 11-14, 2010 at the
Westin St. Francis in San Francisco. The event brings together established
industry leaders, emerging fast-growth companies, innovative technology
creators, and globally minded service providers.

&lt;p&gt;DEERFIELD, Ill.--(Business Wire)--
Walgreens (NYSE: WAG)(NASDAQ: WAG) pharmacy patients now have the ability to
securely download their prescription history from Walgreens.com to a personal
Microsoft HealthVault record. The new service allows patients the convenience of
linking their Walgreens prescription information to other health and medical
records for easy management and the ability to share a complete profile with
other health care providers. To sign up for the service or for more details, go
to www.walgreens.com/healthvault. 

Walgreens agreement to join Microsoft HealthVault, a personal health application
platform that allows users to store and share their health information, was
announced this past summer. 

Millions of registered Walgreens.com users are already accessing their
prescription history for convenient refills, tax purposes or personal use.
Patients who enroll in this new feature will also have daily updates to their
prescription data accessible via a personal HealthVault record. 

"We're pleased to be part of the Microsoft HealthVault network," said Don
Huonker, Walgreens senior vice president of health care innovation. "This
partnership supports our efforts to promote stronger collaboration among
patients and their pharmacists, physicians and other health care providers. Any
tool that can help enhance a patient`s interactions with multiple providers
stands an excellent chance for improving medical outcomes while lowering health
care costs." 

"HealthVault was designed to allow people to engage in and take more control
over their health, in partnership with their physicians," said David Cerino,
general manager for the Consumer Health Solutions Group at Microsoft Corp. "This
collaboration with Walgreens is especially valuable to people managing multiple
medications for themselves or a family member. By combining prescription details
with an individual`s broader health history, we are enabling users and their
healthcare providers to develop deeper insights that can be used to develop
effective ongoing health management plans." 

In order to link prescription data to an individual HealthVault record,
Walgreens pharmacy customers must have an authenticated pharmacy account on
Walgreens.com. Registered users can then easily enroll with HealthVault directly
from the Walgreens Web site.

&lt;p&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100107005961/en

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) and Debiopharm Group (Debiopharm) announced today that they
have entered into a co-development agreement to conduct a Phase 3 trial of
tremelimumab (CP675,206), a fully human anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody for the
treatment of patients with unresectable, Stage IV melanoma. A biomarker will be
used to select patients considered likely to respond to tremelimumab. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Debiopharm will assume responsibility for
conducting the phase 3 trial of tremelimumab and Pfizer will retain
responsibility for worldwide commercialization of the compound. 

Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, occurs in about 69,000 patients in
the United States each year, and results in about 9,000 deaths. The number of
melanoma cases worldwide is increasing faster than any other cancer. 

Pfizer`s investigational drug, tremelimumab (CP675,206), currently in phase 2,
is a fully human igG2 monoclonal antibody which has been in development for the
treatment of advanced melanoma. In April 2008, Pfizer announced that it had
discontinued a Phase 3 clinical trial for patients with advanced melanoma after
the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review of interim data showed that the
trial would not demonstrate superiority to standard chemotherapy. Analysis of
the data from this trial identified the biomarker which will be used in patient
selection for the upcoming trial. 

"The continuation of the clinical development of tremelimumab with our partner,
Debiopharm, is a demonstration of our commitment to personalized medicine for
cancer patients," said Garry Nicholson, president and general manager of
Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit. "Debiopharm is a successful company which has
achieved impressive results on a global scale. This co-development partnership
is an opportunity to leverage the combined expertise of both companies in this
innovative endeavour." 

Thierry Mauvernay, Executive Vice President, Debiopharm Group said, "Debiopharm
and Pfizer share the same vision of personalized medicine for the benefit of
patients and to enhance the effectiveness of medicine. We are proud to enter
into a unique co-development partnership with Pfizer to address the unmet
medical needs of Melanoma patients." 

Financial terms of the co-development agreement between Debiopharm and Pfizer
have not been disclosed.

BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Experiment 626 is rearing his adorable blue alien head once more in a new video
game. Disney Interactive Studios today announced the upcoming release of Disney
Stitch Jam, a rhythm-based music and adventure game being developed exclusively
for Nintendo DS. Scheduled for release March 2010 in North America, the DS game
will introduce players to the latest adventures set in the popular world of
Stitch, a classic character from the Walt Disney Pictures` 2002 film "Lilo &amp;
Stitch." 

Players will remember Stitch as the character that was born out of a genetic
experiment and exiled to Hawaii in the film. The DS game takes place in exciting
locations, from tropical beaches to outer space, and introduces a new storyline
involving Stitch`s kidnapped girlfriend, Angel, by his evil nemesis Dr.
Hamsterviel. Stitch must embark on music-based missions and defeat Dr.
Hamsterviel in an epic galactic showdown.

Disney character who has been a fan favorite for years," said Craig Relyea,

with catchy music, dynamic characters and fun environments, this new DS game
will offer great content for kids with a high replay value." 

Disney Stitch Jam features intuitive side-scrolling gameplay that is appropriate
for young gamers who want to immerse themselves in the lovable character`s world
as he sets off on his many adventures. Kids have the option of stylus or button
controls as they catch, shoot and collect musical notes to release melodies and
clear 10 missions to save Angel. Disney Stitch Jam is equipped with two-player
co-operative play via download, where players can share the game with friends -
a second game cartridge is not needed. 

The game also includes a customization feature that allows fans to personalize
Stitch with special costumes and accessories that can be unlocked in the game.
Filled with a variety of original music created exclusively for the game,
players will watch Stitch dance and groove on tropical beaches, the frozen city,
the deep forest and other, numerous exotic locations. 

Developed by Cattle Call, Disney Stitch Jam is slated for release March 2010 and
rated E for Everyone with Comic Mischief by the Entertainment Software Rating
Board (ESRB). For more information, please visit www.disney.com/stitchjam.

&lt;p&gt;LAUSANNE, Switzerland &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) and Debiopharm Group (Debiopharm) announced today that they
have entered into a co-development agreement to conduct a Phase 3 trial of
tremelimumab (CP675,206), a fully human anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody for the
treatment of patients with unresectable, Stage IV melanoma. A biomarker will be
used to select patients considered likely to respond to tremelimumab. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Debiopharm will assume responsibility for
conducting the phase 3 trial of tremelimumab and Pfizer will retain
responsibility for worldwide commercialization of the compound. 

Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, occurs in about 69,000 patients in
the United States each year, and results in about 9,000 deaths. The number of
melanoma cases worldwide is increasing faster than any other cancer. 

Pfizer`s investigational drug, tremelimumab (CP675,206), currently in phase 2,
is a fully human igG2 monoclonal antibody which has been in development for the
treatment of advanced melanoma. In April 2008, Pfizer announced that it had
discontinued a Phase 3 clinical trial for patients with advanced melanoma after
the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review of interim data showed that the
trial would not demonstrate superiority to standard chemotherapy. Analysis of
the data from this trial identified the biomarker which will be used in patient
selection for the upcoming trial. 

"The continuation of the clinical development of tremelimumab with our partner,
Debiopharm, is a demonstration of our commitment to personalized medicine for
cancer patients," said Garry Nicholson, president and general manager of
Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit. "Debiopharm is a successful company which has
achieved impressive results on a global scale. This co-development partnership
is an opportunity to leverage the combined expertise of both companies in this
innovative endeavour." 

Thierry Mauvernay, Executive Vice President, Debiopharm Group said, "Debiopharm
and Pfizer share the same vision of personalized medicine for the benefit of
patients and to enhance the effectiveness of medicine. We are proud to enter
into a unique co-development partnership with Pfizer to address the unmet
medical needs of Melanoma patients." 

Financial terms of the co-development agreement between Debiopharm and Pfizer
have not been disclosed.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/ffa6de/the_cocacola_comp) has
announced the addition of the "The Coca-Cola Company - SWOT Framework Analysis"
report to their offering. 

SWOT Analysis, is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats involved in a project or in a business
venture. It involves specifying the objective of the business venture or project
and identifying the internal and external factors that are favorable and
unfavorable to achieving that objective. 

The aim of any SWOT analysis is to identify the key internal and external
factors that are important to achieving the objective. SWOT analysis groups key
pieces of information into two main categories: 

Internal factors - The strengths and weaknesses internal to the organization.
External factors - The opportunities and threats presented by the external
environment. 

The internal factors may be viewed as strengths or weaknesses depending upon
their impact on the organization's objectives. What may represent strengths with
respect to one objective may be weaknesses for another objective. The factors
may include all of the 4P's; as well as personnel, finance, manufacturing
capabilities, and so on. The external factors may include macroeconomic matters,
technological change, legislation, and socio-cultural changes, as well as
changes in the marketplace or competitive position. The results are often
presented in the form of a matrix. 

SWOT analysis is just one method of categorization and has its own weaknesses.
For example, it may tend to persuade companies to compile lists rather than
think about what is really important in achieving objectives. It also presents
the resulting lists uncritically and without clear prioritization so that, for
example, weak opportunities may appear to balance strong threats. 

Key Topics Covered:

* A. Executive Summary 
* B. A Brief Profile of the Company 
* C. SWOT Framework Analysis 
* C.1 Strengths to Build Upon 
* C.2 Weaknesses to Overcome 
* C.3 Opportunities to Exploit 
* C.4 Threats to Overcome 
* D. Glossary of Terms

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer unveiled a new Hewlett-Packard Co tablet computer on Wednesday, beating Apple Inc's hotly anticipated move into the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But analysts were skeptical that Microsoft and HP could generate as much consumer excitement as Apple's new device, widely expected to be unveiled on January 27, though the company has not said anything about it publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer showed off the new device at the end of his keynote speech at the CES technology show in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This great little PC -- which will be available later this year -- I think many customers are going to be very excited about," said Ballmer, using finger touches to flip through a book on the screen using Amazon.com's Kindle software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone's fired up about this type of device," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at fund manager Fort Pitt Capital Group. Microsoft has "a lot of the pieces in place" to make such a device work, she said, but it's not clear that it can claim significant market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How do you make them usable and at a price point people will pay, which I suggest is sub-$500?" asked Caughey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer did not detail pricing or when the device will hit stores. An earlier New York Times report said it could go on sale by mid-2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's presentation, which kicked off the world's biggest consumer technology show, started late after a power outage and suffered a few tech hiccups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Ballmer, Microsoft's entertainment and game chief Robbie Bach announced that a new installment of the hugely successful Halo game will be out this year, and its controller-less game system Project Natal will be in stores by the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG HYPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, and HP, the top personal computer maker, are the latest companies to eye tablets that bridge the gap between laptops and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endpoint Technologies analyst Roger Kay said both companies have experience in designing a touch-screen, tablet-style device but that consumer interest in the category has never lived up to the hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could all change, Kay said, if Apple joins the fray. Microsoft and HP faced a difficult challenge in topping whatever device Apple launches, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The elephant in the room of course is Apple. Other manufacturers are scrambling to get things together before it defines the market," Kay said.

&lt;p&gt;Agreement builds on series of recent agreements for natural gas delivery to
customers in Asia
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that its Australian subsidiaries
and Nippon Oil Corporation have signed a Heads of Agreement (HOA) for the
delivery of 0.3 million metric tons per year (MTPY) of liquefied natural gas
(LNG) for 15 years from the Chevron-operated Gorgon Project in Western
Australia. 

Jim Blackwell, president, Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production,
welcomed the agreement saying it would help underpin the importance of the
Gorgon Project to growing LNG markets. 

"We are pleased to have Nippon Oil as a customer of the Gorgon Project. The
agreement is another step towards commercializing our equity natural gas in
Australia." 

John Gass, president, Chevron Global Gas, said "We have a long history of
working with Nippon Oil and, with this agreement, are proud to add a new
dimension to that relationship." 

Gass added that, "Our agreements with Nippon Oil and other leading Japanese and
Korean energy companies demonstrate that Chevron is strongly positioned to meet
long-term demand growth in Asia-Pacific." 

Chevron is the operator of the Gorgon Project and holds an approximate 47
percent interest. 

The initial Gorgon Project development, in northwestern Australia, will include
a three-train, 15 million-metric-tons-per-year liquefied natural gas facility
and a domestic gas plant. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company's success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;   * Comes ahead of expected Apple unveiling Jan. 27&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft, HP slate to go on sale this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Demo runs Amazon Kindle software
 (Recasts with Ballmer demonstration)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby and Gabriel Madway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LAS VEGAS, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer unveiled a new Hewlett-Packard Co
(HPQ.N) tablet computer on Wednesday, beating Apple Inc's
(AAPL.O) hotly anticipated move into the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But analysts were skeptical that Microsoft and HP could
generate as much consumer excitement as Apple's new device,
widely expected to be unveiled on Jan. 27, though the company
has not said anything about it publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer showed off the new device at the end of his keynote
speech at the CES technology show in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This great little PC -- which will be available later this
year -- I think many customers are going to be very excited
about," said Ballmer, using finger touches to flip through a
book on the screen using Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) Kindle software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Everyone's fired up about this type of device," said Kim
Caughey, senior analyst at fund manager Fort Pitt Capital
Group. Microsoft has "a lot of the pieces in place" to make
such a device work, she said, but it's not clear that it can
claim significant market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "How do you make them usable and at a price point people
will pay, which I suggest is sub-$500?" asked Caughey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer did not detail pricing or when the device will hit
stores. An earlier New York Times report said it could go on
sale by mid-2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's presentation, which kicked off the world's
biggest consumer technology show, started late after a power
outage and suffered a few tech hiccups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After Ballmer, Microsoft's entertainment and game chief
Robbie Bach announced that a new instalment of the hugely
successful Halo game will be out this year, and its
controller-less game system Project Natal will be in stores by
the holiday season. [ID:N06170410]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BIG HYPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, and HP, the
top personal computer maker, are the latest companies to eye
tablets that bridge the gap between laptops and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Endpoint Technologies analyst Roger Kay said both companies
have experience in designing a touch-screen, tablet-style
device but that consumer interest in the category has never
lived up to the hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That could all change, Kay said, if Apple joins the fray.
Microsoft and HP faced a difficult challenge in topping
whatever device Apple launches, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The elephant in the room of course is Apple. Other
manufacturers are scrambling to get things together before it
defines the market," Kay said. "HP may be looking to put a
stake in the ground before Apple makes its move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talk of Apple's tablet -- potentially the company's biggest
product launch since the iPhone -- has swirled in trading
rooms, tech websites and industry forums for months. The
speculation helped propel Apple's stock to record highs in
January, though some say the device may be overhyped.
[ID:nN0588388]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABUZZ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HP has been heavily promoting touch technology across its

not expect the new tablet to showcase any game-changing
innovation, and instead may be more advanced versions of
existing HP devices already on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our expectation is that it will be a testing-the-waters
sort of thing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From Microsoft's perspective, Kay said the company wants to
"highlight and showcase everything that Windows 7 can do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new generation of devices will seek to break Intel

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Friday asked for a full panel of judges to review an appeals court decision upholding a $290 million jury verdict against it for infringing a patent held by a small Canadian company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company wants all 11 judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which handles many patent and trademark cases, to review the long-running case against Toronto-based i4i Ltd, in the hope of overturning the original judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft appealed the case last year, but in December a panel of three appeals court judges rejected its arguments, and upheld the federal jury decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That jury, in U.S. district court in Texas, ruled last August that Microsoft had infringed a patent belonging to i4i relating to text manipulation software in the 2003 and 2007 versions of Word, Microsoft's word processing application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury imposed more than $290 million in damages on Microsoft and the court granted i4i's motion for an injunction preventing Microsoft from selling versions of Word containing the disputed technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That injunction was stayed while Microsoft appealed the case with the Court of Appeals, but it is now due to take effect on January 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said last month that it was working to adjust current versions of Word to comply with the injunction, and said on Friday it would continue that work despite its new appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our position is unchanged. We expected them (Microsoft) to do this," said Loudon Owen, Chairman of i4i. "We are confident we will prevail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares closed up 0.7 percent at $30.66 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is: i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastructures for Information Inc v. Microsoft Corp, an appeal from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in case no. 07-CV-113.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft asks full panel of judges to review case&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Will still adjust Word to comply with injunction
 (Adds i4i chairman comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS Jan 8 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on
Friday asked for a full panel of judges to review an appeals
court decision upholding a $290 million jury verdict against it
for infringing a patent held by a small Canadian company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company wants all 11 judges of
the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,
which handles many patent and trademark cases, to review the
long-running case against Toronto-based i4i Ltd, in the hope of
overturning the original judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft appealed the case last year, but in December a
panel of three appeals court judges rejected its arguments, and
upheld the federal jury decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That jury, in U.S. district court in Texas, ruled last
August that Microsoft had infringed a patent belonging to i4i
relating to text manipulation software in the 2003 and 2007
versions of Word, Microsoft's word processing application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The jury imposed more than $290 million in damages on
Microsoft and the court granted i4i's motion for an injunction
preventing Microsoft from selling versions of Word containing
the disputed technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That injunction was stayed while Microsoft appealed the
case with the Court of Appeals, but it is now due to take
effect on Jan. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said last month that it was working to adjust
current versions of Word to comply with the injunction, and
said on Friday it would continue that work despite its new
appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our position is unchanged. We expected them (Microsoft) to
do this," said Loudon Owen, Chairman of i4i. "We are confident
we will prevail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares closed up 0.7 percent at $30.66 on
Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is: i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastructures
for Information Inc v. Microsoft Corp, an appeal from the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in case no.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Surprise Build in Crude Inventories

The larger-than-anticipated buildup in oil and gasoline supplies has again
raised concerns about the U.S. crude demand and the sluggish pace of a global
economic recovery. As a result, following the EIA release, oil prices pulled
back below $83 a barrel after settling near 15-month high a day earlier. 

The specter of a continued glut in global fuel supplies still weighs and all of
the inventories remain higher compared to averages for this time of year. As a
result, we are not fully convinced about the sustainability of crude oil`s
current gains, which have staged a remarkable rally in 2009, increasing more
than 75% (following a 54% dip in 2008). In particular, the drop in petroleum
stocks over the last few weeks have been triggered by weak refinery activity and
falling imports rather than a much awaited fundamental improvement in oil demand
that has remained largely unchanged. 

As such, we prefer to maintain our cautious stance on oil refiners like Sunoco
Inc. (NYSE: SUN), Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE: VLO) and Western Refining Inc.
(NYSE: WNR), given that the overall environment for refining margins is likely
to remain poor going into 2010. The sharply lower refinery utilization (at just
79.9% of capacity) provides enough evidence that refineries are cutting back on
production because the economy is still struggling on the demand side. 

Companies like Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) and Marathon Oil Corp. (NYSE: MRO) -
oil majors that have significant refining operations - are also expected to
remain under pressure until pricing and demand improve. The companies recently
announced reduction in their 2010 capital budget with a larger percentage of
funds allocated towards the Exploration &amp; Production (E) segment as against
the under-pressure refining business.

&lt;p&gt;   * Settlement major step in resolving data breach claims&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Visa to credit previously collected fines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares rise as much as 13 pct
 (Recasts, adds analysts comments, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Brenton Cordeiro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANGALORE, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Heartland Payment Systems Inc
(HPY.N) took a significant step in resolving data breach claims
with major card issuers by agreeing to pay $60 million as part
of a settlement agreement with Visa Inc (V.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the payment processor rose as much as 13 percent
on the announcement, prompting one Wall Street analyst to say
the settlement shows that the system-intrusion issue was
reaching "closer to the end."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Heartland settled reached a settlement with
American Express Co (AXP.N) by agreeing to pay the credit card
company $3.6 million, resolving all intrusion-related issues
between the two companies. [ID:nSGE5BG0IH]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is yet to reach settlements with Mastercard Inc
(MA.N) and Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) for losses
issuers may have incurred after cyber thieves breached its
payment systems in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Two down, two to go," analyst David Koning of Robert W.
Baird said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa being the largest issuer, theoretically implies the
settlement could be the biggest of the claims, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heartland declined to provide further details on the Visa
settlement, or on when a settlement with MasterCard Inc (MA.N)
could be expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the agreement, Visa would credit the full amount
of fines it previously collected from Heartland's sponsoring
bank acquirers and provide details of the settlement to
eligible issuers in the coming days, Heartland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In mid-day trade on the New York Stock Exchange, Heartland
shares were up 10 percent at $14.55. They had earlier touched a
high of $14.99.

As the home of names such as Microsoft, AOL and Google, the USA has led the
world in the development of Internet information and applications. Recent
studies consistently show that the Internet is playing an ever-increasing role
in daily life, both at work and in the home. The major uses of the Internet
include email, search, entertainment and online shopping. User-generated content
sites and social networking sites, such as MySpace, Facebook, Bebo and more
recently Twitter, were some of the fastest growing sites in the five years to
2009. Although the effects of the economic downturn are being felt in the areas
of e-commerce and online advertising, both sectors are expected to recover
strongly from 2010. Significantly, during its first year in office the Obama
administration has been resolute in driving growth in e-health and e-government
and in implementing network neutrality rules.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 8 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities started coverage
of Allos Therapeutics Inc ALTH.O with an "overweight" rating
and a price target of $10, citing upside potential from the
company's key drug Folotyn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said while there was lesser risk in getting
Folotyn approved as a treatment for a kind of cancer,
peripheral T-Cell lymphoma (PTCL), there were "several free
call options in the pipeline." Folotyn, which received an
accelerated approval to treat PTCL in September 2009, is being
tested in two other types of cancer -- cutaneous T cell
lymphoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The near-term driver for the stock would be data from the
mid-stage study of the drug in lung cancer against OSI
Pharmaceuticals' OSIP.O Tarceva, analyst Geoffrey Meacham
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Data from the lung cancer trial and the cutaneous T cell
lymphoma are expected to be available in the first half of
2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were up 7 percent at $7.20, Friday on
Nasdaq. They had touched a high of $7.25 earlier in the
session.

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Jan 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Microsoft has partnered with Show Media to create a major presence for
its new Bing Mobile App starting today at the 2010 Consumer Electronics
Show. Show Media, which creates branded media around transportation for
big events in cities throughout the country, Wednesday started giving
free shuttle rides for show-goers who downloaded  the Bing Mobile App.

    "CES is one of the biggest conventions in the world and Las Vegas is
notorious for not having enough taxis and other surface transportation to
accommodate such a vast crowd," says Laurence Hallier, Show Media's
Chairman. "We proposed to Microsoft that they provide a much needed hotel
shuttle service as a way to help promote its Bing Mobile App. The program
is designed to offer a better transportation solution for CES attendees
who generally must wait 30-60 minutes for taxicabs or shuttle
transportation to and from the convention center. CES patrons will be
shown the benefits and features of the new Bing Mobile App via a Bing
Ambassador onboard all vehicles."

    Show Media designed a multi faceted marketing and experiential initiative
which includes significant branding, transportation and interaction with
attendees to the CES show. JWT did the creative assets. The marketing
initiative includes two main components:

    BING SOLUTION STATION LOT: Show Media created a one-acre lot directly
across the street from the Las Vegas Convention Center featuring branded
signage for Bing Mobile App, custom traffic cones, mega-floor graphics,
custom flags and a BING SOLUTION STATION tent where Bing ambassadors
greet  show-goers and talk up the Bing Mobile App. This creates hours of
continuous coverage before, during and after each day's show.

    FREE BING SHUTTLES: Show Media branded 21 passenger shuttles and minivans
with Bing signage and is providing a Bing Ambassador on each vehicle who
can help riders explain the benefits of the Bing Mobile App and assist
with downloads. This creates massive awareness upon arrival into Las
Vegas and 24 hour coverage at all hotels and throughout the city during
CES.

    "The folks at Show Media are brilliant," says Eric Hadley, General Manager
of Worldwide Brand Microsoft. "They are providing a helpful mobile service
that makes everyone happy and is associating it with how helpful Bing's
Mobile App is. Lots of big companies spend big dollars to create awareness
at CES; none will be as successful as our partnership with Show Media."

    Show Media has legacy of innovation. At Austin's South by Southwest show,
Show Media created a similar presence for Ray-Ban with branded
transportation vans. This month in New York artworks by Shirin Neshat,
Alex Katz and Yoko Ono (three New Yorkers known for art that works both
conceptually and physically in a confined space) are displayed atop 500
New York City taxis instead of commercial messages as a way for Show
Media to give back to the city.

    Bing mobile is available for iPhone, iTouch and Blackberry and Windows
mobile phones and can found: @ discoverbing.com/mobile or @ m.bing on any
mobile device.

    Show Media (www.showmedia.com) is the fastest growing out-of-home media
company in the United States and was recently named by Inc. magazine as
one of the Inc. 500 fastest growing independent companies of 2009. Show
Media was co-founded in 2006 by entrepreneurs Laurence Hallier, and John
Amato with a goal to help brands connect with consumers in unique ways.
Show Media is known as an innovator in the industry and helps many of the
country's best known brands break through the clutter with their
advertising including Ray-Ban, Louis Vuitton and Microsoft's Bing.com.
Headquartered in New York, Show Media has operations in Las Vegas and New
York.

&lt;p&gt;PRINCETON, N.J. &amp; SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Heartland Payment Systems (NYSE: HPY), one of the nation's largest payments
processors, and Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced a settlement agreement under
which issuers of Visa-branded credit and debit cards will have an opportunity to
obtain a recovery from Heartland with respect to losses they may have incurred
from the 2008 criminal breach of Heartland's payment system environment.
Heartland will pay up to $60 million to fund the settlement program, which is
subject to certain conditions, including a specified level of participation by
U.S. Visa issuers. Visa will present details of the settlement to eligible
issuers in the coming days. 

"We believe issuers will benefit by participating in this settlement program
because it offers an immediate recovery with respect to losses they may have
incurred from the Heartland intrusion," said Ellen Richey, chief enterprise risk
officer, Visa Inc. "Helping financial institutions mitigate costs after a data
security breach has been a long-standing component of Visa`s security strategy,
along with promoting new security technologies, preventing fraud and leading
efforts to secure sensitive data across the entire payment system." 

Bob Carr, Heartland`s chairman and chief executive officer, stated, "We are
pleased to have reached a fair settlement agreement that helps issuers obtain a
recovery with respect to losses they may have incurred from the intrusion. At
Heartland, we are also committed to helping issuers - as well as all
stakeholders in the payment ecosystem - mitigate future risk. We have assumed a
leadership position in the development of enhanced data security and fostering
the sharing of information." 

The Visa/Heartland settlement agreement is contingent upon acceptance by
financial institutions representing 80 percent of the eligible issuers` U.S.
accounts that Visa considered to have been placed at risk of compromise during
the Heartland intrusion. The settlement also includes mutual releases between
Heartland and its sponsoring bank acquirers, on the one hand, and Visa on the
other. Heartland will fund up to $59.22 million of the amounts to be made
available to Visa and its issuers under the settlement program. Additionally,
Visa will credit the full amount of intrusion-related fines it previously
imposed and collected from Heartland's sponsoring bank acquirers towards the $60
million maximum funding of the program. The settlement amount represents a
significant recovery to Visa issuers for losses they may have suffered from the
Heartland data security breach. 

All U.S. card issuers who participate in the program will be eligible to receive
a portion of the specified recovery. The settlement also includes recovery for
international issuers of accounts Visa considered to have been placed at risk of
compromise. 

Participation in the settlement program supplants any other recoveries that may
be available to issuers through Visa and requires accepting issuers to release
Heartland, its sponsoring bank acquirers and Visa from any legal and financial
liability related to the Heartland intrusion. 

Visa will be notifying eligible issuers in the coming days with details about
the program and how to participate, and Visa will send eligible issuers their
formal offers to participate in the program on January 14, 2010. To facilitate
payment, eligible issuers will have until 5:00 pm PT on January 29, 2010 to
opt-in to the program before the offer expires.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * IBM establishes factoring business in China &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Targets hundreds of millions of dollars in assets &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Venture to initially supply financing to AMD &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Doug Young &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    HONG KONG, Jan 8 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) said on Friday it has formed a technology financing venture in China in connection with chipmaker AMD (AMD.N), aiming to build an operation with hundreds of millions of dollars in assets in its first year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The venture, to be based in the northeast city of Tianjin, will be IBM's first in China to engage in a service known as factoring, where companies hand over their receivables for goods already sold in exchange for cash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Factoring companies typically provide cash worth less than the full value of the receiveables, earning their cut when the money finally comes in from the customer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Initially, the new venture would provide factoring financing in China for AMD, an IBM supplier. It could eventually extend that service to AMD's distributors and other business partners in the country, said John Callies, general manager of IBM Global Financing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He called the venture a "several hundred million dollar" opportunity in its first year, but declined to be more specific. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This will be very successful," he told Reuters in a telephone interview. "We'll start off with AMD to make sure the processes are right. Once we get it right operationally, we'll look for other partners." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM Global Financing, IBM's financing unit, is a relatively small part of the global technology giant, but highly profitable, providing nearly 10 percent of its total pre-tax profit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In addition to factoring, the unit provides loans for IBM clients to buy computer equipment and services, and helps to take back leased equipment from IBM customers and resell it when the leases expire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM is already active in other financing activities in China, but the factoring venture is a new area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "On a worldwide basis, our working capital financing that factoring would be a part of represents about 25-30 percent of the global financing business," Callies said. "I can't say what the size of the business will be in Tianjin. But it's a measurable portion of the business we'll be doing in China." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM has a wide range of businesses in China, but does not break out its revenue for the country. Many of those involve IT consulting services, where the company competes with the likes of Hewlett Packard (HPQ.N) and Accenture (ACN.N). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In the third quarter of 2009, its most recent reporting quarter, it saw its China revenue grow 26 percent, with IBM Global Financing posting double-digit growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Callies' unit is also an investor in south China's Guangdong Development Bank, having made the investment with another of its major clients, Citigroup (C.N), as part of a Citi-led group that bought control of the bank for $3.1 billion in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    After the deal, IBM was awarded a major contract to supply IT services to the bank, according to local media reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Callies declined to comment on IBM's future plans for the stake.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "What we did there is we went and worked in conjunction with an important client that asked us to participate in a business opportunity that they had ... We were available because we had a banking license." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Doug Young; Editing by Chris Lewis) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((doug.young@thomsonreuters.com; +852 2843-1631; Reuters Messaging: doug.young.reuters.com@reuters.net)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((If you have a query or comment on this story, send an email to news.feedback.asia@thomsonreuters.com)) Keywords: IBM CHINA/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2010.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - The former head of American International Group Inc is urging a closer look at the actions of Goldman Sachs Group Inc, claiming the investment bank contributed to the insurer's near-collapse, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, former chief executive of AIG, told the Journal in an interview he believed not enough attention was being paid to the role Goldman Sachs played in the subprime meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well, it certainly wouldn't be difficult to come to that conclusion," Greenberg told the Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shot back at Greenberg, who based some of his accusations on articles in the New York Times, the Washington Post and other news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone, including Mr. Greenberg, who relies on news reports rather than facts to form an opinion, particularly of a complicated subject, has a very high probability of reaching the wrong conclusion," Lucas van Praag, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG had to be propped up with some $180 billion in taxpayer support after it nearly collapsed in September 2008. The U.S. government now owns nearly 80 percent of the company, once the world's largest insurer by market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government stepped in to rescue AIG after it ran short of funds to meet collateral demands from global banks that had bought credit protection from an AIG financial products unit. The government saw the AIG's possible collapse as a systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenberg, who left the company in 2005 amid fraud allegations, is calling for a fresh look at the role investment banks, and especially Goldman Sachs, played in developing new policies on credit default swaps and housing-backed derivatives that caused AIG's downfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He charged that Goldman Sachs, sensing a downturn in the housing market, created subprime housing-backed derivatives, and at the same time began shorting them, or betting they would fall in value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenberg called on investigative journalists, members of Congress and shareholder lawsuits to explore the policies that led the company he built up over four decades to implode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is too much smoke, too many smart people asking questions that deserve an answer. I would hope that investigative reporters do the job they love to do and bring the truth out. I would hope that Congress would then say we must do something about this in all fairness," Greenberg told the Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The American people should know about this and then bring about the changes necessary to avoid the total destruction of a great company that was the pride of America in the insurance industry," Greenberg was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the journal, Greenberg has devised a plan that would extend the terms of the government's $112 billion loan over 20 years, and cut its interest rate. And he wants the government to pare back its 79.9 percent stake in the company, saying taxpayers would be better served by a company that was not majority-owned by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenberg was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG spokeswoman Christina Pretto declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $180 billion federal bailout of AIG continues to rankle lawmakers, who on Friday pressed for Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to testify on the New York Federal Reserve Bank's dealings with AIG after its government bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The House oversight wants Geithner, who headed the reserve bank at the time of the AIG bailout, to answer questions about whether company executives were told to hold back information about how they were spending taxpayer money during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Steve Eder and Paritosh Bansal in New York, writing by Julie Steenhuysen, editing by Anthony Boadle)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds militant group, background) ABUJA, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Chevron (CVX.N) said on Saturday it had been forced to shut down 20,000 barrels per day of crude oil production in Nigeria, a day after security sources said gunmen had attacked a Chevron pipeline. Chevron Nigeria Limited ... confirms that there was a breach on its Makaraba-Utonana pipeline in Delta State, Nigeria on Friday, the major U.S. oil producer said, adding that the damage forced it to cut production by 20,000 bpd. Security sources told Reuters on Friday that unknown gunmen in the oil-rich Niger Delta attacked Chevron's Makaraba crude oil pipeline, which has been vulnerable to sabotage in the past. The pipeline was last attacked by the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), the West African country's most prominent militant group, in June 2009. A MEND spokesman said the group supported Friday's attack, but its fighters were not involved. The attack exposes the continued vulnerability of the oil industry infrastructure and the resolve of the people of the Niger Delta to fight for their land, he said.

industry," Greenberg was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the journal, Greenberg has devised a plan that
would extend the terms of the government's $112 billion loan
over 20 years, and cut its interest rate. And he wants the
government to pare back its 79.9 percent stake in the company,
saying taxpayers would be better served by a company that was
not majority-owned by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greenberg was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG spokeswoman Christina Pretto declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $180 billion federal bailout of AIG continues to rankle
lawmakers, who on Friday pressed for Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner to testify on the New York Federal Reserve Bank's
dealings with AIG after its government bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The House oversight wants Geithner, who headed the reserve
bank at the time of the AIG bailout, to answer questions about
whether company executives were told to hold back information
about how they were spending taxpayer money during the
financial crisis.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft asked an appeals court for a rehearing in the patent case that requires the software giant to pay US$290 million in damages and prevents it from selling the current version of Word starting on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suit charged Microsoft with using a patent owned by i4i in a feature in Word 2003 and 2007 that lets people create custom XML documents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld an earlier judgment that left Microsoft with the damages and the injunction requiring it to stop selling copies of Word that include the feature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Microsoft is asking the panel of judges primarily to reconsider the way that the damages figure was determined. "The petition details significant conflicts we believe the December 22 decision creates with established precedents governing trial procedure and the determination of damages, and we are concerned that the decision weakens judges' authority to apply appropriate safeguards in future patent trials," said Kevin Kutz, director of public affairs for Microsoft, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, i4i said it expected Microsoft to file such a petition and that it looks forward to building its business now that Microsoft is required to stop selling the offending products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it will be prepared by Monday to sell copies of Word 2007 with the feature in question removed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A response to Microsoft's rehearing request may not come for a while. Three judges will review it first, and they'll have seven days to either comply with or ignore it, signaling that they deny the request. If they deny it, the rest of the panel of judges will then have time to review the request. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rehearing could result in reduced damages and changes to the injunction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail about weather, quotes, issues at other
refineries)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Kristen Hays&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Jan 10 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil's (XOM.N) 562,500
barrel-per-day Baytown, Texas, refinery, the largest in the
U.S., was among several Gulf Coast refineries that faced unit
upsets and other issues related to an unusual three-day stretch
of freezing and sub-freezing temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Gulf Coast was under a hard freeze warning from the
National Weather Service through Monday morning after an Arctic
high pressure settled over the U.S. southern plains on Friday,
bringing freezing and sub-freezing temperatures to a region
that rarely experiences such cold for multiple days. The last
time southeast Texas experienced three days of such
temperatures was in December 1990, the weather service said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a filing with Texas pollution regulators, Exxon reported
a line leak in one unit and flaring because of a line
restriction to two others at the Baytown plant because of
temperatures at or below freezing in southeast Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality said inclement weather caused flaring because of the
line restriction at a booster station and a lubes unit. The
cold also caused line leak to a gofiner unit, which led to
flaring associated with equipment clearing to repair the line.
A gofiner unit removes sulfur from crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday Louisiana environmental regulators also confirmed
that frozen water seals caused flaring at Exxon's 305,000
barrel-per-day Baton Rouge, Louisiana refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All customer needs are being met despite the upset," Exxon
spokesman Kevin Allexon said on Sunday regarding Baytown. He
declined comment on the Baton Rouge flaring except to say that
flaring is a safety measure to burn off excess hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several other refineries reported various upsets as the
cold settled in. Motiva shut its gasoline-making fluid
catalytic cracking unit at its 290,000 barrel-per-day refinery
in Port Arthur, Texas, on Friday, and put it "into
circulation," meaning liquids are flowing through the unit, but
it is not making any products. Refiners usually put a unit on
circulation, rather than allowing it to go completely cold, for
issues that do not require extensive repairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) shut a hydrocracking unit
in the east plant of its 315,000 barrel-per-day refinery on
Friday for unplanned repairs to a compressor, and was
restarting it over the weekend. The company did not attribute
the unit shutdown to the cold, but in separate TCEQ filings,
Valero blamed the shutdown of an aromatics recovery unit and a
controller in a sour water stripper to inclement weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Valero spokesman Bill Day had no updates on the
hydrocracker restart on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other cold-related issues that companies reported to TCEQ
included a coker upset at Shell's (RDSa.L) 332,000
barrel-per-day refinery in Deer Park, Texas, on Friday when its
wet gas compressor tripped. Spokeswoman Chris Bozman said on
Sunday that frigid weather contributed to the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such upsets can be expected in cold weather, but a lack of
widespread problems is not a surprise, said Michael Economides,
a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the
University of Houston. Uninsulated pipes could crack or burst
if hydrates form from water with natural gas or hydrocarbons,
but it's more likely for refiners to experience issues like
those at Baytown or the others because those kinds of solids
crystallized in pipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cold weather, other than some accidental problems,
generally is not so bad for refining operations," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But extreme cold in February 2007 at Valero's 170,000
barrel-per-day McKee, Texas, refinery led to an explosion that
severely injured a worker. Federal investigators found that the
cold caused liquid in a pipeline to freeze overnight and
cracked the line. Warm weather the next day melted the frozen
section of pipe, and the liquid turned into a vapor cloud that
ignited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A TCEQ filing on Friday said a light ends compressor
tripped offline at the McKee refinery because of the cold.

&lt;p&gt;Consumers want more retail stores to be more interactive and personalized online, a new survey from IBM has found. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's a smarter consumer out there today, one who is really willing to engage with the retailer," said Shannon Miller, a business development lead for IBM's Global Business Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company surveyed 32,000 consumers online to find out how much interactivity they want from the retail outlets they frequent. For the survey, they interviewed participants from the U.S., the United Kingdom, Canada, China, India and Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM released the survey results in conjunction with the National Retail Federation conference, being held this week in New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey had found an overwhelming interest in more online customization services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These consumers are instrumented. They have a lot of devices and a lot of ways of accessing the retailers," Miller said. "As a result, they are creating more data for the retailer, but also getting more information for themselves. And that has made them smarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, 75 percent of those surveyed want their mobile phones to tell them where the nearest store of interest is located, and 68 percent want to see if the goods they are seeking are in stock at nearby locations. Also, 79 percent of the respondents want to be able to print coupons off of Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the survey found that consumers wanted different things from different media channels, Miller said. From the Web, consumers wanted to check prices and print coupons. From in-store kiosks, they wanted product information and the ability to order out-of-stock goods. And from their mobile phones, consumers wanted to know of nearby stores and a way to check if an item is in stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Retailers can tailor their strategy for each of these technologies to address what the consumers are asking them to do," Miller said. Such work might pay off too, according to the survey: If retailers could provide greater interactivity of this sort, then 61 percent of consumers would spend more money with the retailer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While such features may seem appealing, they will require an immense amount of work to set up, Miller admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are some foundational things a retailer has to do in order to share the data across the enterprise and get to what the consumers told us they wanted," Miller said. For one thing, the customer data and the product must be on the same platform, so that analytics can personalize the buying experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how the consumer interacts with the retailer, the retailer is able to consolidate the data and personalize dialogue with the consumer, Miller said, adding that few companies have gotten to this level of integration yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, IBM has launched a new virtual practice, called the Retail Center of Competency, to help retailers integrate analytics, merchandising systems and customer care into one infrastructure, Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM was not the only company unveiling a new retail-focused service at the NRF conference this week. Microsoft and Accenture also unveiled their new joint service to help high-end retail outlets consolidate their digital marketing and sales channels, a package called Style Star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing its quest for more ERP (enterprise resource planning) market share, Microsoft on Monday announced a new application aimed at mid-sized speciality retail chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamics AX for Retail consists of core AX ERP functionality, along with technology Microsoft acquired earlier this year. Redmond's key selling point is tight integration across components, from point of sale to the supply chain and financials. It also integrates with other Microsoft products, such as Office and SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application will support Microsoft's payment processing service as well as the upcoming Commerce Service, which ties ERP applications to multiple e-commerce systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The greatest challenge in retail is the changing nature of consumer behavior. People are becoming less brand-focused and more cost-conscious," said Crispin Read, general manager of Dynamics ERP. "Retailers will need to provide a completely connected experience to consumers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft partners have traditionally played a key role in its ERP strategy, providing customizations and additional features on top of the core ERP application. This won't change with AX for Retail, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will release the application mid-year, beginning with 16 countries. Pricing information wasn't available Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new offering will go up against a range of competitors in the retail ERP arena, from pureplays such as Celerant and Tomax, to offerings from broader ERP vendors like Epicor and Oracle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SaaS (software as a service) vendor NetSuite has also entered the fray, announcing a product called Multi-Channel Retail Management Suite earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Jan 11 (Reuters) - Chevron's (CVX.N) El Segundo,
California, refinery has restarted a hydrocracker after an
unexpected shutdown, a Chevron spokesman said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cracker at the 260,000 barrel-per-day Los Angeles area
refinery went down Friday after a compressor failure, a source

production, a Chevron spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The majority of the refinery continued to operate normally
during this brief outage," the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The incident happened as several other units, including a

&lt;p&gt;Ongoing problems with a Microsoft Corp. Web site handling software licenses have left some business customers unable to activate and use their Microsoft apps for more than a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft first took down its Volume Licensing Service Center for maintenance in early December, after attempts to merge multiple licensing sites into a single, more secure site backfired for some users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those affected include businesses purchasing Microsoft software, or resellers and integrators handling newly-purchased software for business customers. Problems they have reported via Twitter include users losing access to paid-for software licenses; an inabilityto login to the VLSC site and fix this for one month or more; and six-hour waits on Microsoft telephone support trying to fix their accounts;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One user said that Microsoft, unable to grant him access to his account and license activation keys, was forced to physically mail him replacement software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a blog published early Monday, Microsoft "sincerely apologized" for the "inconvenience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the vast majority of partners and customers are able to access the system, there remain some customers who may be experiencing difficulties and it has taken us longer than expected to correct those issues," said Microsoft. It invited users to send problems via e-mail or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some customers are finally getting their problems solved. Mark Lowe, co-owner of a Raleigh, N.C.-area systems integrator, tweeted Monday that he "was back on track" after working with Microsoft's Twitter-based support team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reached by phone, Lowe confirmed that he had, as per earlier tweets, been "going insane" after being unable to gain access to software that he had purchased more than a month ago -- and after spending hours with Microsoft's customer support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his license problem fixed, I " am a happy bunny today ," Lowe wrote Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Lai covers Windows and Linux, desktop applications, databases and business intelligence for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. has pulled almost every version of Office from its own online store to comply with a court order requiring it to remove custom XML technology from its popular Word software starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of mid-day today, the only edition available from the Microsoft Store was Office Ultimate 2007, a $670 "full-version" suite. All other Windows editions, as well as Office 2008 for Mac, were accompanied by the message: "This product is currently unavailable while we update versions on our site. We expect it to be available soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft confirmed that the disappearance of Office was related to the injunction that came out of a patent infringement case the company lost in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've taken steps to comply with the court's ruling and we're introducing the revised software into the U.S. market," said Michael Croan, a senior marketing manager, in an e-mail. He also downplayed the move. "This process will be imperceptible to the vast majority of customers, who will find both trial and purchase options readily available," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an e-mail earlier today, Croan said only that Office would be "temporarily" unavailable, and that the suite would return "soon after Jan. 11," when asked when Office sales would resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Microsoft also told potential customers that they can download the free beta of Office 2010 , the next-generation suite slated for a June release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, Microsoft had said it would be ready by the Jan. 11 deadline. "We expect to have copies of Microsoft Word 2007 and Office 2007, with this feature removed, available for U.S. sale and distribution by the injunction date," said Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz on Dec. 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2007 remained available at other retailers today, including online stores such as Amazon.com and Newegg.com, and brick-and-mortar stores like Best Buy, where the popular Office 2007 Home and Student is priced at $64.99, well under its list price of $149.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The injunction, which was first ordered by a Texas federal judge in August 2009 and then affirmed by an appeals court late last month, bans Microsoft from selling Word 2003 and Word 2007 as of today unless it dumps custom XML features from the software. In May 2009, a Texas court also ordered Microsoft to pay developer i4i Inc. nearly $300 million in damages, court costs and interest for allegedly violating the Canadian company's custom XML patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has posted updates for both Word 2003 and Word 2007 to its download site, and told customers in accompanying support documents that those updates are mandatory "only if you have been instructed to do so in a separate communication from Microsoft." The company has also committed to revamping Word 2008 for Mac and Word 2004 for Mac, even though those versions were not named in the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent infringement case between Microsoft and i4i has attracted interest because of the injunction blocking Word sales. The injunction was originally to take effect Oct. 10, 2009, but the appeals court suspended it while the court heard Microsoft's plea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it lost its appeal last month, Microsoft has not given up. Last Friday, it asked the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to either grant a rehearing with the same three-judge panel, or consider an en banc hearing before all the judges of the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt; * CEO says tired of employees being vilified&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * CEO among top bankers who will appear before gov't panel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Jan 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon defended the bank's pay
policies on Monday and said he was "tired" of his employees
being vilified over bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rising bonuses have drawn criticism from politicians and
others, who complain Wall Street's losses seem to be socialized
while its profits are privatized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon, along with the chief executives of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and other big banks,
will be appearing this week before a commission created by
Congress to look into causes of the financial meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan pays its employees for sustained performance over
multiple years, Dimon said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We do not have change-of-control agreements, special
executive retirement plans, golden parachutes, special
severance packages or merger bonuses," he told a JP Morgan
healthcare conference, adding that many of company's employees
are in client-facing jobs and work hard with small and mid-size
businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am a little tired of the constant vilification of these
people," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulators and lawmakers have pressed banks to tie
compensation to longer-term performance and to pay more in
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, the second largest U.S. bank by assets, is seen
as one of those that has best survived the credit crisis, but
as the recession lingers it is facing rising losses across its
large consumer loan portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In wide-ranging remarks, Dimon said the worst of the
problems in the U.S. residential real estate market appear to
be behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not over, but I am not sure it's going to get worse,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon said U.S. home prices have fallen significantly,
making home ownership more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regarding the commercial real estate market, Dimon said,
"commercial real estate is a train wreck but it's already
happened."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon also discussed regulatory matters. The CEO repeated
his opinion that regulators deserve the authority to manage
failures of large financial institutions, a view he laid out in
November in an opinion piece in the Washington Post newspaper.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) warned on Monday that fourth-quarter results would be "sharply lower" than the previous quarter due to a further deterioration in refining margins and its shares slipped about 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Refining indicator margins worldwide for the full fourth quarter declined to the lowest levels of the year," said the second-largest U.S. oil company, adding its exploration and production results would be in line with a quarter before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refiners' margins have been squeezed globally as rising prices for their input, oil, are not matched by improved demand for what they produce due to persistent economic sluggishness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter refining margins dropped by more than $4 on the U.S. West Coast to $11.83 per barrel, after holding up well for much of the year. Refining margins on the Gulf Coast fell by nearly $1 a barrel to $11.56, while margins in Singapore were hit even harder, down $2 at $2.46 per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Output from Chevron's refineries at home and abroad was down on the previous quarter, while its chemicals arm is expected to see earnings drop as well, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The downstream impact will cloud over a quarter that might have been a fresh start for the company under its new CEO, John Watson. Like rivals Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and BP Plc (BP.L), Chevron will report against comparable numbers that are no longer inflated by a mid-2008 oil surge above $140 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmark U.S. crude oil prices averaged $76 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2009, up from $68 in the third and $59 in the same quarter a year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRODUCTION KEEPS GROWING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's U.S. oil-equivalent output in October and November was up 2 percent to 759,000 barrels per day from 745,000 the previous quarter, while international output was 3 percent higher in the first two months, at 2.014 million bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total of 2.77 million bpd lent weight to Chevron's expectation in late October that it would exceed its overall 2009 output forecast of 2.66 million bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares fell 0.9 percent to $80.15 in after-hours trading, after closing 1.8 percent higher at $80.88 on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock got a lift on Monday after Citigroup increased its long-term oil price estimate and upgraded its view of Chevron and BP, among other big oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's stock, after rising just 4 percent in 2009, had already jumped 5 percent to start the current year, helped by a similar rise in the Chicago Board Options Exchange index of oil companies .OIX, boosted by stronger crude oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron reports fourth-quarter results on January 29. Prior to Monday's update, analysts had expected a profit of $3.2 billion, or $1.77 per share, on revenue of $43.5 billion, according to the averages on Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is up a bit from $1.72 per share in the previous quarter, but down from $4.3 billion in profit on $45 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall; editing by Gunna Dickson and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Attempt to force Goldman to defend pay policies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman cites "technicalities" to explain move, group says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ross Kerber&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) told an
activist group that it will seek permission to bar a proposed
proxy vote that urges detailed disclosure and defense of its pay
practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nathan Cummings Foundation in New York, which owns a stake
in the giant New York bank, was told by a Goldman executive on
Friday it would seek a "no action" letter from the Securities and
Exchange Commission that would allow it to omit the proposed pay
review from its upcoming proxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laura Shaffer, director of shareholder activities at the
philanthropic group, said on Monday that Dane Holmes, Goldman's
head of investor relations, told her the bank would seek the
letter for unspecified technical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At a time when Wall Street is under fire for its high
compensation and the quick return of lavish bonuses following
taxpayer bailouts, the move drew sharp words from the foundation
and could add fuel to criticism of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein is among the bank
executives scheduled to testify to Congress on Wednesday about the
origins of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They're trying to push us off the proxies, and I can't
believe it," said the foundation's president, Lance Lindblom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the move undercuts Goldman's past claims that it
has tried to be responsive to concerns about its compensation,
such as requiring executives to donate to charity and paying
top managers in stock rather than cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's the biggest head-fake in history," Lindblom said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The foundation had previously sponsored resolutions targeting
executive pay at Wells Fargo (WFC.N), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and
Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its proposal, the foundation asks shareholders to
request that Goldman's compensation committee produce a report
by October that includes an analysis comparing the pay of top
executives to median wages at the company and an evaluation of
whether the pay is excessive and should be modified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Named after the Baltimore immigrant who created what became
Sara Lee Corp SLE.N in the middle years of the 20th century, the
Nathan Cummings Foundation says on its website that it awards
grants to programs promoting diversity, cultural understanding and
concern for the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ross Kerber; Editing by Ros Krasny, Phil

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today reported in its interim update that
earnings for the fourth quarter 2009 are expected to be lower than in the third
quarter 2009. Upstream earnings are projected to be in line with third quarter
results as the benefit of higher commodity prices is offset by the absence of
gains recognized in the third quarter associated with formal approval of the
Gorgon project in Australia. Downstream results are expected to be sharply
lower, mainly due to significantly weaker refining margins. 

Basis for Comparison in Interim Update

The interim update contains certain industry and company operating data for the
fourth quarter 2009. The production volumes, realizations, margins and certain
other items in the report are based on a portion of the quarter and are not
necessarily indicative of Chevron's quarterly results to be reported on January
29, 2010. The reader should not place undue reliance on this data. 

Unless noted otherwise, all commentary is based on two months of the fourth
quarter 2009 versus full third quarter 2009 results. 

UPSTREAM - EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

The table that follows includes information on production and price indicators
for crude oil and natural gas for specific markets. Actual realizations may vary
from indicative pricing due to quality and location differentials and the effect
of pricing lags. International earnings are driven by actual liftings, which may
differ from production due to the timing of cargoes and other factors.

1 The Avg. Brent Spot Price is based on Platts daily assessments, using
Chevron`s internal formula to produce a quarterly average. 

Compared with the average for the third quarter 2009, U.S. net oil-equivalent
production during the first two months of the fourth quarter rose 14,000 barrels
per day primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. 

International net oil-equivalent production increased 57,000 barrels per day
compared with the third quarter. The liquids component of oil-equivalent
production increased 42,000 barrels per day reflecting normal operations in
Nigeria and the continued ramp-up of production from the expansion project at
the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan. Net natural gas production increased 106 million
cubic feet per day, mainly due to the completion of planned maintenance at North
Sea fields and higher sales in Thailand. 

For the first two months of the fourth quarter, U.S. crude oil realizations rose
$6.64 per barrel to $69.92. International liquids realizations also improved by
more than $6 to $68.14 per barrel. U.S. natural gas realizations increased $0.66
to $3.94 per thousand cubic feet compared with the third quarter, while average
international natural gas realizations improved slightly to $3.99 per thousand
cubic feet. 

International upstream earnings in the third quarter included gains and related
tax effects of about $400 million connected with formal project approval of the
Gorgon project. 

DOWNSTREAM - REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION

The table that follows includes industry benchmark indicators for refining and
marketing margins. Actual margins realized by the company will differ due to
crude and product mix effects, planned and unplanned shutdown activity and other
company-specific and operational factors.

Refining indicator margins worldwide for the full fourth quarter declined to the
lowest levels of the year. Marketing indicator margins in the United States were
also lower in the fourth quarter. Comparing October and November with the third
quarter, the Asia-Pacific / Middle East / Africa marketing margin saw a modest
improvement. 

During the first two months of the fourth quarter, daily U.S. refinery
crude-input volumes were down 50,000 barrels per day, or about six percent,
resulting from planned maintenance at the El Segundo refinery in California.
Outside the United States, refinery crude-input volumes were down 18,000 barrels
per day largely due to planned maintenance at the Burnaby refinery in Canada.

Both U.S. and international downstream results in the full fourth quarter are
expected to be substantially lower, in large part due to depressed margins.
Additionally, downstream earnings are projected to include unfavorable timing
effects due in part to the increase in crude oil and refined product prices
between the beginning and end of the quarter.

The company`s general guidance for the quarterly net after-tax charges related
to corporate and other activities is between $250 million and $350 million. Due
to foreign currency effects and the potential for irregularly occurring accruals
related to income taxes, pension settlements and other matters, actual results
may significantly differ from the guidance range.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF
"SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

This Interim Update contains forward-looking statements relating to Chevron`s
operations that are based on management`s current expectations, estimates and
projections about the petroleum, chemicals, and other energy-related industries.
Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "targets,"
"projects," "believes," "seeks," "schedules," "estimates," "budgets" and similar
expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.These
statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain
risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the company`s
control and are difficult to predict.Therefore, actual outcomes and results may
differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking
statements.The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date of this Interim Update.Unless
legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.

Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude-oil and
natural-gas prices; refining, marketing and chemicals margins; actions of
competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude-oil
liftings, the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product
substitutes; technological developments; the results of operations and financial
condition of equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company`s
joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development
activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from
existing and future crude-oil and natural-gas development projects; potential
delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the
potential disruption or interruption of the company`s net production or
manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation networks due to war,
accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather or crude-oil
production quotas that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC); the potential liability for remedial actions or

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights RadioShack Corp. (NYSE: RSH) as the Bull of the
Day and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE: JEC) the Bear of the Day. In
addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Best Buy (NYSE: BBY), Sears
(Nasdaq: SHLD) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We upgrade our recommendation for RadioShack Corp. (NYSE: RSH) to Outperform
based on our assessment that the company is likely to improve its earnings in
the future reporting quarters as a result of significant boom in the wireless
industry. 

The company is generating healthy revenue growth from stronger sales for its
Sprint Nextel postpaid wireless business, netbooks and prepaid wireless handsets
and airtime. The addition of T-Mobile as a postpaid wireless carrier also
contributed to revenue. 

RadioShack's decision to introduce iPhone 3G in all of its stores in 2010 will
also boost its top-line. In addition, RadioShack began selling mobile phones in
kiosks at about 100 Target stores. 

Bear of the Day: 

Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE: JEC) is one of the leading providers of
professional, technical and construction services to industrial, commercial and
governmental clients. The company's ongoing acquisition strategy will help it to
strengthen its position in future. 

However, the very cyclical nature of its business, as well as its heavy
dependence on third parties, is discouraging. The company also faces immense
risks as it operates in a highly-competitive environment. 

Thus, we maintain our Underperform rating on the stock. Our 6-month target price
is $38.00 per share.

Market Overreacts to BLS Numbers

Companies almost never revise their earnings after they are released (I did say
`almost`). But the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) almost always revises its
monthly payroll numbers. Many times, the final revision is completely different
from the initial release number. 

Even in this report, we saw that the initially released November job loss number
of 11,000 was revised to a positive gain of 4,000 jobs. Incidentally, the
revised November gain was the first positive job growth since December 2007.
Given this, today`s report is unlikely to be the final word December 2009
employment numbers. It is very likely that the final revision could be
completely different from this number, as we saw in the case of November. 

We don`t need to dig deep to see clear evidence of favorable trends in this
report as well as elsewhere in the economy. Of particular significance in
today`s report is the positive trend in the creation of temporary jobs, which is
a solid leading indicator for the labor market. A total of 47,000 temporary jobs
were created in December, which takes the number of such jobs created since July
to more than 160,000. A small number, no doubt, relative to the size of the
labor market, but clear evidence of movement in the right direction. 

Other recent reports on the health of the economy have been in the neutral to
positive category. While I would put the non-manufacturing ISM report in the
neutral category, the manufacturing ISM and retail sales numbers were clearly
positive. Many retailers, such as Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) and Sears (Nasdaq: SHLD),
have been reporting solid results and raising outlooks. 

Goldman Sued by Pension Fund

On Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) was sued by the Central
Laborers' Pension Fund in Illinois, who had bought some Goldman stock in Jan,
2009. As an active investor the pension fund charged Goldman of distributing $22
billion to its employees as bonus payments for fiscal year 2009. 

According to the pension fund, the excess bonus payments that amount to nearly
50% of the net revenue of the company are feared to be detrimental for Goldman
investors. Such high payouts, especially in the current sluggish economic
scenario, are being condemned by the plaintiffs. The charge also states that
Goldman had kept aside $17 billion by Sept 2009 for bonus payments, expecting to
further this to about $22 billion for 2009.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds cat cracker restarted, more detail)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Jan 11 (Reuters) - Chevron's (CVX.N) El Segundo,
California, refinery has restarted a catalytic cracker after an
unexpected shutdown, a source familiar with refinery operations
said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cracker at the 260,000 barrel-per-day Los Angeles area
refinery went down Friday after a compressor failure, the
source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The incident happened as several other units, including a
resid desulfurizer and a naphtha hydrotreater, were down for
planned maintenance, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron did not return calls, but a notice of planned
flaring filed with the South Coast Air Quality Management
District indicated plans to restart a unit.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will patch Word on the Mac to comply with a federal court's ruling requiring it to remove custom XML technology from its popular word processing software, the company confirmed last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Microsoft issued an update for Word 2003 for Windows to abide by the same ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late December, a federal appeals court affirmed a lower court's injunction that barred Microsoft from selling Word 2007 and Word 2003 starting Monday, Jan. 11 unless it dumped custom XML features from the software. In May 2009, a Texas court also ordered Microsoft to pay developer i4i nearly $300 million in damages, court costs and interest for allegedly violating the Canadian company's custom XML patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word 2007 for Windows was first updated in 2009 with a version for computer makers , then last week with a patch aimed at end users .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz, Word 2003, which was also named in the injunction, must be modified because customers purchasing or licensing Word 2007 have "downgrade" rights to the older edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft posted an update for Word 2003 for Windows on its download center Saturday. The patch, which weighed in at 5.6MB, was similar to the earlier Word 2007 update, in that it was mandatory only "if you have been instructed to do so in a separate communication from Microsoft," read the accompany support document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users who bought or licensed Word 2003 or Word 2007 before Jan. 10 do not have to apply the patches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Mac versions of Word were not specified in the injunction, Microsoft will also pull the offending technology from those editions, Kutz confirmed. "While Office for Mac products were not accused of infringement, we are changing the product to allay any potential concerns about compliance with the injunction," Kutz said in an e-mail last Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of late Sunday, however, Microsoft had not posted updates for Word 2004 for Mac or Word 2008 for Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent infringement case has attracted interest because of the injunction blocking Word sales. The injunction was originally to take effect Oct. 10, 2009, but the appeals court suspended it while it heard Microsoft's plea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not given up on the case. Last week, it asked the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to either grant a rehearing of its appeal with the same three-judge panel, or consider an en banc hearing before all the judges of the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;  WEST KINGSTON, RI, Jan 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
APC by Schneider Electric, a global leader in integrated critical power
and cooling services, today announced an expanded relationship with IBM
to offer an IBM Portable Modular Data Center container version based on
APC's award-winning InfraStruxure(R) architecture and IBM's global
services capabilities. IBM's PMDC provides a fully functional data center
in a shipping container with a complete physical infrastructure including
power and cooling systems and remote monitoring. By integrating APC
InfraStruxure products into the container it builds on the global
alliance between APC and IBM announced in 2006 when APC was selected as a
key data center physical infrastructure provider to IBM's Scalable
Modular Data Center (SMDC) and later when APC solutions were chosen as
the foundation for the IBM High Density Zone (HDZ) solution, which allows
customers to deploy a high density environment rapidly within an existing
data center.

    "APC's footprint in IBM's modular data center offerings demonstrates the
adaptability of our solutions to meet customer demands in a variety of
business applications," said Jim Simonelli, Chief Technology Officer, APC.
"APC's data center physical infrastructure design lends itself well to
IBM's PMDC, focusing on maximizing efficiency through a modular and
scalable approach. The pre-engineering and pre-testing we do for our
products ensure the PMDC solution is highly reliable and available."

    "IBM's partnerships with leading vendors such as APC provide customers
with an efficient, cost-effective solution to support IT growth in a more
flexible environment," said Steven Sams, vice president, Global Site and
Facilities Services. "The inclusion of APC technology is a result of our
long-standing relationship with APC. Our partnerships provide our clients
with best-of-breed technology and the world-class service capabilities of
IBM's global technology services organization."

    APC provides the physical infrastructure components in other IBM modular
data center offerings including IBM's SMDC. This solution, available
worldwide, incorporates APC's award-winning technologies for power,
cooling, racks and enterprise management software and helps clients
rapidly deploy a cost effective and energy-efficient, scalable 500 to
2,500 square foot data center to support their business. The partnership
enables clients to quickly design and build a data center in nearly any
working environment using IBM Global Services' capabilities and a

&lt;p&gt;Combination Will Let Users See Rich Set of Power and Thermal Data on AEM
Console, Aiding Energy Management in Data Centers
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Arch Rock Corporation has announced that Arch Rock's PhyNet IP-based wireless
sensor network technology will be supported in IBM's Systems Director Active
Energy Manager (AEM), to monitor and manage energy usage in corporate data
centers. 

The integrated products, now available, will allow a rich set of power and
thermal data gathered by strategically-placed Arch Rock wireless sensors to be
transmitted over wireless IP links and displayed on the AEM web interface,
presenting users with a comprehensive view of their data centers' energy
consumption and environmental health. 

The integration of PhyNet into AEM makes it easy for users to see all their
energy information on a single web interface (AEM), without having to move back
and forth among multiple vendors' consoles. Arch Rock's wireless sensors can
easily be placed anywhere the user needs to collect electrical, temperature or
humidity data, without the labor and cost of having to connect wires. Customers
can compare the Arch Rock-collected server inlet air temperature data with AEM
temperature readings from their CRACs [computer room air conditioners],
determining whether they can lower energy costs by raising CRAC supply air
temperatures while remaining within safety zones for server cooling. The sensor
data can also be used to monitor pre-set power and thermal thresholds,
triggering "event automation plans" through AEM to put servers in lower power
states or shut down systems that become overheated. PhyNet is expected to be of
particular benefit to the large set of IBM customers still using legacy
hardware, which are not equipped with built-in sensors. 

Arch Rock CEO Roland Acra said, "This integration effort will bring our IP-based
WSN technology to the attention of an extensive new group of Active Energy
Manager customers who are seeking a single, all-encompassing view of how their
data centers are using energy. We are very excited that IBM sought us out as a
collaboration partner in its energy management strategy." 

Arch Rock's IP-based PhyNet platform implements a tiered, scalable wireless
sensor network architecture that includes the first "WSN router,"
interconnecting IETF 6LoWPAN wireless mesh networks with IPv4 or IPv6 enterprise
networks. Sensor applications can reside across a corporate campus or in the
next room, communicating with any number of WSNs across local- or wide-area IP
networks. Because PhyNet extends standard IP technology from the enterprise
infrastructure to the sensor network mesh and out to individual sensor nodes,
those nodes can communicate directly with other IP devices on the enterprise
network regardless of their connection medium (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4 radio, 802.11
Wi-Fi, Ethernet). Arch Rock sensor nodes measure electric power (kilowatts,
voltage, current and power factor), temperature, humidity, air pressure and
chilled water flow and temperature. 

PhyNet also serves as the foundation for Arch Rock's Energy Optimizer, a
complete wireless energy monitoring system that provides real-time visibility
into the electrical usage and thermal status of facilities and data centers,
giving users the precise knowledge to take measures that conserve energy and
reduce costs.

&lt;p&gt;Multi-Modal Devices Can Achieve 80 Percent Reduction in Error Rates and 30
Percent Productivity Improvement; Provides Single Solution from Warehouse to
Shelf
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Aldata Solution, a leading provider of software solutions for the retail
industry, today announced the availability of Aldata Voice Directed Warehousing,
the second generation of Aldata`s Voice solution that is used by more than 6,000
picking operators daily for order preparation, order splitting and inventory
management. The solution was developed in partnership with IBM and Motorola and
is certified for use on the industry`s leading hardware. 

Aldata Voice Directed Warehousing combines voice technology with existing mixed
data collection methods (such as screen, pistol, keyboard, barcode reader and
others) on a single mobile computing device to deliver multiple capabilities at
substantially lower costs than traditional voice-only units. Multi-modal devices
can be used in all facets of the business, from the receiving dock and onboard
picking vehicles to the shipping docks and retail locations. Aldata Voice
Directed Warehousing is useable by any operator right out of the box with no
voice recognition training required. This drives down employee training costs
and enables operator interoperability. 

In addition to operator benefits, Voice Directed Warehousing simplifies
operations for organizations. Some companies have a dozen or more different
handheld devices, each with its own supplier. The new system from Aldata enables
companies to standardize on one type of system. As a result, they are able to
reduce maintenance costs and the number of supplier contracts they maintain. 

"Our customers are looking for efficiencies across their businesses and are
moving towards multi-modal devices that leverage existing investments but also
allow them to take advantage of new processes and retail best practices," said
Allan Davies, CMO, Aldata Solution. "In conjunction with Motorola and IBM, we`ve
developed a next generation technology that will drive savings for our customers
today while future-proofing their investments for tomorrow."

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Prolonged exposure to cocaine can cause permanent changes in the way genes are switched on and off in the brain, a finding that may lead to more effective treatments for many kinds of addiction, U.S. researchers said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study in mice by Ian Maze of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and colleagues found that chronic cocaine addiction kept a specific enzyme from doing its job of shutting off other genes in the pleasure circuits of the brain, making the mice crave the drug even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study helps explain how cocaine use changes the brain, said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the study published in the journal Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding is opening up our understanding about how repeated drug use modifies in long-lasting ways the function of neurons," Volkow said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the team gave one group of young mice repeated doses of cocaine and another group repeated doses of saline, then a single dose of cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that one way cocaine alters the reward circuits in the brain is by repressing gene 9A, which makes an enzyme that plays a critical role in switching genes on and off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies have found that animals exposed to cocaine for a long period of time undergo dramatic changes in the way certain genes are turned on and off, and they develop a strong preference for cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study helps explain how that occurs, Volkow said, and may even lead to new ways of overcoming addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, Maze and colleagues showed these effects could be reversed by increasing the activity of gene 9A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When they do that, they completely reverse the effects of chronic cocaine use," Volkow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said this mechanism is likely not confined to cocaine addiction, and could lead to a new area of addiction research for other drugs, alcohol and even nicotine addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the questions we've had all along is, after discontinuing a drug, why do you continue to be addicted?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is one of the mechanisms that probably is responsible for these long-lasting modifications to the way people who are addicted to drugs perceive the world and react to it," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Todd Eastham)&lt;/p&gt;

million and year-end 2010 cash position of $840-890 million -
ROCKVILLE, Md.--(Business Wire)--
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: HGSI) today will announce its priority
goals for 2010 and report on the Company`s increasing momentum toward
commercialization of late-stage products for systemic lupus and chronic
hepatitis C in a presentation by H. Thomas Watkins, President and Chief
Executive Officer, to financial analysts and investors at the 28th Annual
JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. 

"2010 will be another pivotal year for HGS," said Mr. Watkins. "In 2009, we and
our partners successfully completed Phase 3 development of BENLYSTA for systemic
lupus and ZALBIN for chronic hepatitis C. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we
submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) for ZALBIN in the United States,
and Novartis submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) under the
brand name JOULFERON in Europe. We and GSK plan to submit marketing applications
for BENLYSTA in the U.S. and Europe in the second quarter of 2010. We have the
potential for regulatory approval of two major products in the U.S. before the
end of this year, both directed to large and growing markets that represent
significant medical need. We greatly strengthened our cash position in 2009 with
two successful public offerings of common stock. Even with our expected ramp of
investment in commercial build-out and pre-launch manufacturing, we expect to
end 2010 with between $840 million and $890 million in cash and investments." 

During his presentation, Mr. Watkins will discuss the following goals and
updates on progress: 

LATE-STAGE PRODUCTS

BENLYSTA: First Drug for Lupus to Succeed in Phase 3 Trials; On Track for Second
Quarter 2010 Submission of U.S. and European Marketing Applications; Potential
U.S. Approval Fourth Quarter 2010

In July and November 2009, HGS and GSK announced that BENLYSTA (belimumab) met
the primary efficacy endpoints in BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 - thus becoming the
first drug for lupus to achieve positive results in Phase 3 trials. BENLYSTA is
being developed by HGS and GSK under a co-development and commercialization
agreement entered into in August 2006. 

"Based on the Phase 3 results, BENLYSTA could become the first new approved drug
in more than fifty years for people living with systemic lupus," said Mr.
Watkins. "We and GSK plan to submit marketing applications in the second quarter
of 2010, following discussions with regulatory authorities in the United States
and Europe." 

The data showed that BENLYSTA plus standard of care achieved a clinically and
statistically significant improvement in patient response rate, compared with
placebo plus standard of care. BLISS study results also showed that belimumab
was generally well tolerated, with rates of overall adverse events and
discontinuations due to adverse events comparable between belimumab and placebo
treatment groups. 

With nearly 1700 patients participating, the BLISS studies comprise the largest
clinical trial program ever conducted in lupus. In October 2009, HGS provided a
full presentation of BLISS-52 results at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the
American College of Rheumatology. The BLISS-76 study was analyzed after 52 weeks
in support of a potential Biologics License Application (BLA) in the United
States and Marketing Authorization Applications (MAA`s) in Europe and other
regions. Additional data from BLISS-76 will be available in the second quarter
of 2010 following completion of the full 76-week study period. 

Key goals for BENLYSTA in 2010:

* Pre-submission meetings with regulators (Q1). 
* Submission of BLA in the U.S. and MAA in Europe (Q2). 
* Top-line 76-week results from BLISS-76 (Q2). 
* Scientific disclosure of BLISS-76 52-week results (Q2). 
* Potential U.S. regulatory approval (Q4).

ZALBIN: Phase 3 Development Successfully Completed; Marketing Applications Filed
in United States and Europe; Potential Approval Second Half 2010

HGS submitted a BLA to FDA for ZALBIN (albinterferon alfa-2b) in the United
States in November 2009, and Novartis submitted an MAA under the brand name
JOULFERON to the EMEA in Europe in December 2009. Albinterferon alfa-2b is being
developed by HGS and Novartis under an exclusive worldwide co-development and
commercialization agreement entered into in June 2006. 

"Assuming licensure by regulatory agencies in the United States, Europe and
other regions, HGS believes ZALBIN could become an important treatment for
chronic hepatitis C," said Mr. Watkins. "We look forward to continuing to work
closely with Novartis to advance albinterferon alfa-2b to the market under the
brand name ZALBIN in the United States." 

The regulatory submissions include the results of two pivotal Phase 3 clinical
trials, known as ACHIEVE 1 and ACHIEVE 2/3, showing that 900-mcg ZALBIN dosed
every two weeks met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority to Pegasys
(peginterferon alfa-2a) dosed once each week. Patients also received oral
ribavirin. In both studies, ZALBIN, with half the injections, achieved sustained
virologic response comparable to that achieved by Pegasys. The rates of serious
and/or severe adverse events were also comparable in these studies. ACHIEVE 1
was conducted in patients infected with genotype 1 virus, and ACHIEVE 2/3 was
conducted in patients with genotypes 2 or 3 virus. The two studies treated a
total of 2255 patients. 

ZALBIN will be the brand name for albinterferon alfa-2b in the United States,
and JOULFERON will be the brand name in the rest of the world. These brand names
will be subject to confirmation by health authorities at the time of product
approval. 

Key goals for ZALBIN in 2010:

* Results of Phase 2b monthly dosing trial (H1) 
* Potential U.S. regulatory approval (H2)

Raxibacumab: $163 Million in Revenue Recognized from First 20,000 Doses
Delivered to Strategic National Stockpile; Approximately $151 Million Expected
from Second Order for 45,000 Doses to Be Delivered Over Three Years

In April 2009, HGS completed its first product sales with the delivery of 20,000
doses of raxibacumab to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile for emergency use
in treating inhalation anthrax. In July 2009, the U.S. Government exercised its
option to purchase an additional 45,000 doses for the Strategic National
Stockpile, to be delivered over a three-year period. HGS expects to receive
approximately $142 million from this award as deliveries are completed. The
first delivery under the second order, approximately 5600 doses, was completed
in November 2009. 

Raxibacumab is being developed under a contract entered into in 2006 with the
Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the Office of
the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS). HGS submitted a Biologics License Application
to the FDA for raxibacumab in May 2009. The BLA submission included safety and
efficacy data published in the July 9, 2009, edition of The New England Journal
of Medicine. The Company received a Complete Response Letter from FDA in
November 2009 and discussions with FDA are planned. HGS will receive $20 million
from the U.S. Government upon FDA licensure of raxibacumab. 

Key goals for raxibacumab in 2010:

* Deliveries to the Stockpile of approximately 15,000 doses in partial
fulfillment of the follow-on order for 45,000 doses over three years, with
payment received as deliveries are made and accepted. 
* Discussions with FDA regarding Complete Response Letter.

GSK Pipeline:Two Phase 3 Trials of Darapladib Now Underway for Treatment of
Cardiovascular Disease; Six Phase 3 Trials of Syncria Ongoing for Treatment of
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Darapladib for cardiovascular disease. In December 2009, GSK announced the
initiation of its second pivotal Phase 3 trial to evaluate whether darapladib
can reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as a heart attack or
stroke. This second Phase 3 trial will enroll and randomize approximately 11,500
men and women with acute coronary syndrome. GSK initiated its first pivotal
Phase 3 trial of darapladib in December 2008. The first trial completed
enrollment ahead of schedule of approximately 15,000 men and women with chronic
artery disease. Darapladib was discovered by GSK based on HGS technology. HGS
will receive 10% royalties on worldwide sales if darapladib is commercialized,
and has a 20% co-promotion option in North America and Europe. 

Syncria (albiglutide) for type 2 diabetes mellitus. In February 2009, GSK
announced the initiation of a Phase 3 program to evaluate the efficacy, safety
and tolerability of Syncria in the long-term treatment of type 2 diabetes
mellitus. Six Phase 3 trials of Syncria are currently ongoing with the objective
to demonstrate durable efficacy and cardiovascular safety of Syncria as mono-
and add-on therapy. Syncria is a biological product generated from the fusion of
human albumin and modified human GLP-1 peptide, and is designed to act
throughout the body to help maintain normal blood-sugar levels and to control
appetite. Syncria was created by HGS using its proprietary albumin-fusion
technology, and the product was licensed to GSK in 2004. HGS is entitled to fees
and milestone payments that could amount to as much as $183 million - including
$33 million received to date - in addition to single-digit royalties on
worldwide sales if Syncria is commercialized. 

ONCOLOGY PROGRAM:TRAIL PATHWAY OFFERS THERAPEUTIC OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS BROAD
RANGE OF CANCERS

Mapatumumab (HGS-ETR1), the Company`s human monoclonal antibody to TRAIL
receptor 1, is the most advanced of any product in development that targets the
TRAIL apoptosis pathway. Three randomized Phase 2 chemotherapy combination
trials are currently underway to evaluate mapatumumab`s potential in the
treatment of advanced multiple myeloma, non-small cell lung cancer, and
hepatocellular cancer. HGS is investing strategically to expand and advance its
oncology portfolio around its expertise in the apoptosis, or programmed cell
death, pathway. 

In November 2009, HGS and Aegera Therapeutics announced the initiation of a
Phase 1 trial of HGS` lead IAP inhibitor, HGS1029, as monotherapy in patients
with advanced lymphoid tumors. The study`s primary objectives include evaluation
of safety and tolerability, and dose selection for Phase 2 trials. HGS1029 as
monotherapy is also being studied in an ongoing Phase 1 study initiated in 2008
in patients with advanced solid tumors. The IAP inhibitors are a novel class of
compounds that block the activity of IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) proteins,
allowing apoptosis to proceed and causing the cancer cells to die. When IAP
proteins are over-expressed in cancer cells, they can help cancer cells resist
apoptosis and resume growth and proliferation. HGS plans to continue the study
of HGS1029 both alone and in combination with other anti-cancer agents,
including mapatumumab. 

Key goals for the oncology program in 2010:

* Results of randomized trial of mapatumumab with carboplatin and paclitaxel for
first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (Q1). 
* Time-to-progression data from randomized trial of mapatumumab with bortezomib
in advanced multiple myeloma (mid-2010). 
* Initiation of randomization stage in trial of mapatumumab with sorafenib in
hepatocellular cancer (in 2010). 
* Phase 1 trials of HGS1029 ongoing in advanced solid tumors and lymphoid
tumors. 
* Initiation of trials of HGS1029 in combination with mapatumumab and other
agents.

FINANCIAL GUIDANCE

During his presentation to the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, Mr. Watkins will
present the following guidance regarding the financial results expected by HGS
for the full years 2009 and 2010.

* HGS expects cash and investments at year-end 2009 to total approximately $1.19
billion, compared with approximately $373 million at the end of 2008.

* This includes approximately $813 million in net proceeds from two public
offerings of HGSI common stock completed in August and December 2009.

* In 2010, HGS expects:

* net cash burn to be between $300 million and $350 million; 
* cash and investments at year-end to total $840-890 million; 
* revenues of at least $150 million.

These figures do not include potential ZALBIN approval milestone payments. 

"From a financial perspective, 2009 was another strong year for HGS," said Mr.
Watkins. "Our financial performance substantially exceeded the guidance we
provided in January 2009, both for net cash burn and year-end cash. We expect
year-end 2009 cash and investments to total approximately $1.2 billion." 

Presentation to Be Webcast

Mr. Watkins` presentation to the 28th Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference will
be webcast and may be accessed at www.hgsi.com. The presentation is scheduled to
begin on January 11, 2010, at 10:00 AM Pacific or 1 PM Eastern time. Investors
interested in listening to the live webcast should log on before the
presentation begins to download any software required. The archive of the

About Human Genome Sciences

The mission of HGS is to apply great science and great medicine to bring
innovative drugs to patients with unmet medical needs. The HGS clinical
development pipeline includes novel drugs to treat lupus, hepatitis C,
inhalation anthrax and cancer. 

The Company`s primary focus is rapid progress toward the commercialization of
its two lead drugs, BENLYSTA (belimumab) for lupus and ZALBIN (albinterferon
alfa-2b) for hepatitis C. Phase 3 development has been completed successfully

Europe. 

In April 2009, HGS completed the delivery of 20,000 doses of raxibacumab to the
U.S. Strategic National Stockpile for use in the event of an emergency to treat
inhalational anthrax. In July 2009, HGS secured a new purchase order for 45,000
doses of raxibacumab to be delivered to the Stockpile over a three-year period
beginning near the end of 2009. In May 2009, HGS submitted a Biologics License
Application to the FDA for raxibacumab for the treatment of inhalation anthrax. 

The Company also has several drugs in earlier stages of clinical development for
the treatment of cancer, led by the TRAIL receptor antibody mapatumumab and a
small-molecule antagonist of inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins. In addition, HGS
has substantial financial rights to certain products in the GSK clinical

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Net cash burn is a non-GAAP financial measure that may be considered in addition
to results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Generally, a non-GAAP financial
measure is a numerical measure of a company`s performance, financial position or
cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally
included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and
presented in accordance with GAAP. We define "net cash burn" as net loss, plus
non-cash expenses, such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and other
non-cash charges, and minus deferred revenue and capital expenditures. This
non-GAAP measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP
results. The Company believes that net cash burn is relevant and useful
information for the Company and our investors as it provides a simple method of
determining net cash used by the Company. Net cash burn is also a measure used
by our management, including our chief executive officer, who is our chief
operating decision maker, in evaluating the performance of our business. Net
cash burn, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
reported by other companies since not all companies necessarily calculate net
cash burn in an identical manner and, therefore, they are not necessarily an
accurate measure of comparison between companies. Due to the forward-looking
nature of the net cash burn figures for 2010, a reconciliation of net cash burn
to net loss cannot be made without unreasonable efforts.

&lt;p&gt;Escalate`s Interactive Store Kiosk Application Will Leverage Microsoft
Multi-touch Technology to Deliver a Unique, Customer-centric Store Kiosk
SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
Escalate Retail today announced that it will premiere and demonstrate its
Interactive Store Kiosk application at the National Retail Federation`s (NRF)
99th Annual Convention and Expo in New York, January 10-13, 2010 (booth #619.)
The Interactive Store Kiosk application, deployed on industry-leading hardware
from HP, leverages Microsoft Multi-touch and Silverlight technologies to deliver
rich product catalog browsing, highly detailed product features, social shopping
features, and "endless aisle" shopping supported by rich multimedia
capabilities. 

While store kiosks of the past have been one-dimensional and lacking in
shopper-friendly features, Escalate`s Interactive Store Kiosk will allow
consumers to "shop how they think." Microsoft Multi-touch technology responds to
multiple points of touch contact simultaneously and allows shoppers to "grab"
digital information with their hands and interact with on-screen content by
touch and gesture, without a mouse or keyboard. Customers can access the entire
product catalog ("endless aisle"), browse video content that`s relevant to their
shopping choices, view the retailer`s latest social networking stream, read
customer reviews in-store, create, update, and shop wish lists and gift
registries, and more. 

With today`s retail market more competitive and consumers more discriminating
than ever, retailers must continue finding ways to stay relevant and connected
to their customers at all times. Shoppers typically cannot get substantial
product information from the brief details available in the aisle and on the
packaging. Without confidence that they are choosing the best option, many will
window shop in-store and decide to do more research online at home before
committing to a specific model. Then, they may very well choose to purchase
online from a competitor. 

By offering shoppers the entire product catalog combined with rich product
descriptions, photos, video, customer reviews and more - all at their fingertips
- they can comparison shop between brands and feel confident that they are
making an informed purchase decision without walking out of the store. 

"Our Interactive Store Kiosk brings a unique opportunity for retailers to
provide their customers with a comprehensive product research portal in the
store that`s innovative and engaging," said Mike Julson, CTO of Escalate Retail.
"By utilizing Microsoft Silverlight on the kiosk with the Multi-touch
capability, we were able to create an immersive user experience with deep-zoom
technology for browsing products interactively and accessing high-quality
product images without affecting store connectivity. Finally, our Interactive
Store Kiosk accesses exposed business logic through web services on our
multichannel e-Commerce platform leveraging the same product content, pricing,
customer reviews and more that are used in other channels." 

"We share Escalate`s commitment to help our retail customers deliver a
consistent shopping experience through seamless multi-channel integration and
via innovative technologies, including self-service, using solutions such as
Microsoft Multi-touch and Silverlight," said Brendan O`Meara, managing director,
worldwide retail industry, Microsoft. "Because of our breadth of consumer
relationships and insight, Microsoft is uniquely positioned to enable our retail
industry partners to create compelling virtual connected experiences, such as
Escalate`s Interactive Store Kiosk, for their customers aligned with their other
offerings - online, in-store or mobile."

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, Jan 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Editors Note: There is a photo associated with this press release.

    A new generation of digitally-aware 8-14 year olds has been identified in
the biggest ever pan-European study of tweens. These children, who have
never known a world without the internet, and who in turn have a
heightened awareness of their future and that of the planet, have been
labeled Generation XD - the Digital children of Generation X.

    Named 'Generation XD' and commissioned by Disney as part of ongoing
research for the new kids TV channel Disney XD, the study interviewed
over 3,000 8-14 year-olds in six countries (UK, France, Germany, Italy,
Poland and Spain). The results shatter many myths about children's
relationship with the internet and attitudes towards the family and
celebrity culture.

    Fundamentally different to previous generations due to its digital
upbringing, Generation XD - children born between 1995 and 2001 to
parents of Generation X - has witnessed more technological developments
than any other generation and never known life without digital
entertainment, mobile phones or social media channels. 

    Victoria Hardy, Executive Director, EMEA Research, Disney Channels,
commented: "As we enter a new decade, the XD report redefines the popular
image of today's tweens and shows them as a positive, community-minded
generation who uses the technology that surrounds them to make a positive
impact on their lives and the world around them."

    The study reveals the following trends as a consequence of this
unprecedented connectedness:

    - Digital Generation - while completely at ease with technology, XDs use
it to enhance rather than replace face to face social interaction

    -- Face to face contact is still the most preferable way to meet up with
friends (30%) over and above texting (15%), online chat (14%) and mobile
(8%)

    -- 95% feel that the internet and computers are important to them

    -- 53% feel the internet improves their life by helping them talk to
their friends outside school

    -- 44% say the internet makes it easier to stay in touch with friends

    -- Homework (59%) scores second only to gaming (74%) for most common uses
of the internet

    - Mini-Preneurs - despite the credit crunch, which is in part a result of
the credit-and-debt culture of Generation X before them, XDs are
establishing good financial habits early

    -- 70% are saving their pocket money rather than spending it immediately

    -- 64% of XDs would much rather work for themselves than for someone else
when they grow up 

    - Generation Aspiration - despite the celebrity dominated environment
that XDs have grown up in, they have strong family values and aspire to
traditional vocations rather than the pursuit of fame 

    -- The top five future professions are vet, teacher, footballer, doctor
and police officer

    -- Topping the poll in every single country as the person they admire
most in the world is mum at 43%, with dad coming second at 30%

    - Green Tweens - Generation XD say caring for the environment is important

    -- 97% of XDs believe it is important to look after the planet, with 74%
already recycling regularly

    Tom Dunmore, Consulting Editor, Stuff said: "As the kids of Generation X,
who embraced all mod cons in their twenties, you'd expect Generation XD
to be fully versed in how the internet can help them. What's interesting
though, is how they are embracing both cutting edge technology and
traditional family values in their approach to life. While David Beckham
does inevitably get a mention, fame and celebrity are secondary to family
and they aspire to be vets and teachers rather than singers and
celebrities, which is both surprising and encouraging. Indeed, Generation
XD is remolding the traditional definition of youth as we know it".

    Concluded Victoria Hardy: "Generation XD kids have a heightened
understanding of socio-economic issues, deep family values and are
already demonstrating behavioural patterns that will have a deep impact
on the future. As the world leader in family entertainment, Disney
invests heavily to ensure we continue to understand our audience, to help
us produce content that is aspirational for them and, critically, that is
available when and where they want it in their digital universe, both of
which are central to Disney XD."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today confirmed that the version of Flash bundled with Windows XP contains multiple bugs, and urged customers to upgrade to a newer edition of the multimedia player plug-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a security advisory issued alongside a one-patch update for the month, Microsoft acknowledged that Flash Player 6 contains numerous vulnerabilities. Flash Player 6 is the version of Adobe's software that Microsoft includes in Windows XP, even in the copies it continues to sell to computer makers, who offer the eight-year-old operating system on netbooks, notebooks and some desktop PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe discontinued security support for Flash Player 6 in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Adobe Flash Player 6 was provided with Windows XP and contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page," Microsoft said in its advisory. "Adobe has addressed these vulnerabilities in newer versions of Adobe Flash Player. Microsoft recommends that users of Windows XP with Adobe Flash Player 6 installed update to the most current version of Flash Player available from Adobe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Windows XP is affected by Microsoft's old Flash Player gaffe. Newer versions of Windows include newer editions of Flash Player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recommended that users either uninstall Flash Player 6 on Windows XP -- a move that could cripple browsing, since much of the content on the Web is Flash-based -- or update to a new version of Flash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current version of Flash Player is 10.0.42.34, which can be downloaded from Adobe's site .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows XP users who have regularly updated Flash Player on their PCs have little or nothing to worry about. Users can find out what version of Flash they're using by heading to this Adobe detection page .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today issued just one security update for Windows, the lowest number on a Patch Tuesday since January 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for once, researchers urged users to spend their patching time dealing with updates from Adobe, also expected today, rather than Microsoft 's fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's update patches just one vulnerability, which is rated "critical," Microsoft's highest threat ranking, for Windows 2000, but is rated "low" for all other versions of the operating system, up to and including the new Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patch addresses a bug in how Windows Embedded OpenType (EOT) font engine decompresses specially-crafted EOT fonts, said Microsoft in the accompanying MS10-001 bulletin. EOT fonts are a compact form of fonts designed for use on Web pages, but they can also be used in Word and PowerPoint documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the second EOT bug fix in the last three months. In November, Microsoft patched a flaw in how the Windows kernel parsed EOT fonts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the vulnerability could result in remote code execution -- security speak that means an attacker could use the bug to hijack a PC -- only Windows 2000 got the critical ranking. All others were tagged with the lowest threat rating in Microsoft's four-step scoring system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft explained why in several ways. "These [other] Windows operating systems contain the vulnerable code but do not use this code in a way that may expose the vulnerability," the company said in the security bulletin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Due to the nature of bounds-checking performed on 32-bit systems XP and later, the only buffer+index combinations which would pass the old checks will point into address 0x80000000 and above," Brian Cavenah from the Microsoft Security Research Center engineering staff. "Because these regions cannot be accessed while running at IOPL 3, the process will crash (Access Violate) and the attempt to run arbitrary code would fail," Cavenah said on a company blog today .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrews Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security, put that into plain English. "Versions newer than Windows 2000 have security provisions that prevents code execution of this vulnerability," he said. "Specifically, it's in the way that memory mapping happens. Running code will register certain opcodes in Windows XP and newer, and those versions then know not to allow code execution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richie Lai, the director of vulnerability research at security company Qualys, described it slightly differently. "It's more a hardening of the way Windows manages memory," he said, referring to the changes in Windows XP and later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Storms continued, he bet that -- barring the critical nature of the bug for Windows 2000 -- Microsoft would have passed on even patching the vulnerability. "I think this is one they probably wished they didn't have to patch," Storms argued, noting the impending retirement of Windows 2000 from Microsoft support. "Windows 2000 is on its last legs, and except for it, they wouldn't have bothered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 2000, which according to metrics firm Net Applications, accounted for only 0.6% of all operating systems last month, is slated for support retirement July 13, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The light month from Microsoft is no surprise, said Jason Miller, the data and security team leader at patch management vendor Shavlik Technologies. In an e-mail, Miller said that January is typically a minor patch month: Microsoft released just one update in January 2009, and two bulletins in the first month of both 2008 and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[But] administrators should be prepared for next month if trends hold true," Miller added, pointing out that in February 2009, Microsoft issued four updates, and in both February 2008 and February 2007 it released 11 bulletins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms suggested that users and IT staff take advantage of the single Microsoft update to "get caught up from last year," which he thought more important than applying the one patch for Windows. "And let's not forget the double header today. People should focus on Adobe's update, and maybe Oracle 's, rather than Microsoft's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe is slated to patch multiple bugs in its Reader and Acrobat software today, including one that's been exploited by attackers since November, sometimes in large-scale hacker campaigns . Oracle is also slated to issue a security update today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other researchers also urged a focus on Adobe. "Time would be better spent on Adobe," agreed Wolfgang Kandek, chief technology officer at security company Qualys. "Exploits are out for Adobe's software."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As anticipated, Microsoft did not patch the Windows 7 bug crash bug that went public nearly two months ago. Last week, Microsoft acknowledged it didn't have a fix finished for the vulnerability in SMB (Server Message Block), a Microsoft-made network file and print-sharing protocol that, if exploited, crashes Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 machines so thoroughly that users have had to power off the system to regain control. Microsoft has maintained that the vulnerability cannot be used to hijack PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is interesting to note that the SMB [denial-of-service] exposure is not being addressed, although Microsoft has been open about the fact that it would not be included, and does not have a history of rushing updates for denial-of-service conditions," said Josh Abraham, a security researcher with Rapid7, in an e-mail Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month's security update can be downloaded and installed via the Microsoft Update and Windows Update services, as well as through Windows Server Update Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Jan 12 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said a
gasoil hydrotreater was shut Tuesday afternoon at its 245,271
barrel per day San Francisco Bay-area refinery in Richmond,
California, to determine the source of localized odors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The refinery expects it will be able to continue to supply

Taylor catalytic cracking unit (TKC), said Chevron spokesman
Brent Tippen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No other units at the refinery were shut on Tuesday, Tippen
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A gasoil hydrotreater uses hydrogen to remove sulfur,
nitrogen and other substances from feedstock going to a
gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit.

&lt;p&gt; * Bank seeks to bar pay resolution from ballot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman Sachs describes error by activists&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Sponsor acknowledges error, says resolution should stand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ross Kerber&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
said a shareholder proposal targeting its executive pay
contains errors that should allow the bank to exclude the
controversial matter from its upcoming proxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman made the arguments in a letter dated Jan. 11 to the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the latest salvo in an ongoing
political struggle and public relations war over Wall Street's
high pay following taxpayer bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's historically high compensation has made the company
a lightning rod for criticism. The bank's chief executive, Lloyd
Blankfein, is among industry leaders scheduled to testify to
Congress on Wednesday. Goldman has said it already responded to
some pay concerns, including paying more top employees in stock
and requiring some charitable contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The charitable contributions requirement dates from before
the financial crisis, although the New York Times reported on
Monday that Goldman may demand more such giving in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has not returned phone calls seeking comment about
the proxy matter since Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But its Jan. 11 letter shows the company seeking to head
off a call by shareholders including the Nathan Cummings
Foundation in New York and the Benedictine Sisters of Mt. Angel
in Oregon for Goldman to review pay disparities between
executives like Blankfein and average workers at the company,
and to set forth a rationale for the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ERROR CITED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The groups also asked Goldman to include in its proxy
materials five paragraphs of text in support their proposal.
But Goldman's letter, a copy of which it sent to the Cummings
Foundation, cites at least one error in the activists' text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The groups had written that Federal Appeals Judge Richard
Posner had stated that "executive pay is out of control and the
marketplace cannot be trusted to rein it in." But those words
came from a New York Times column summarizing a Posner
decision, Goldman wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also accused the shareholders of referring
incorrectly to an act to restrict executive pay as if it had been
enacted, although it hadn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said the proposal contained "objectively false
statements" that would mislead shareholders unless the SEC
allowed Goldman to exclude the proposal from the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An SEC spokesman said it wouldn't comment until its staff
reviews the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Cummings Foundation's director of shareholder
activities, Laura Shaffer, acknowledged it misquoted Posner, but
said of Goldman's second claim that "they're really splitting
hairs there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Cummings Foundation, named after the Baltimore
immigrant who created what became Sara Lee Corp SLE.N in the
mid-20th century, owns 894 shares of Goldman, Shaffer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A representative for the Benedictine Sisters said it hadn't
had a chance to review Goldman's response. On its website the
group says its community tries to live according to the Gospel
and to the Rule of St. Benedict, early Christian guidelines
written by the sixth-century monk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ross Kerber; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska Jan 12 (Reuters) - An Alaska judge has
overturned the state's termination of the Exxon Mobil
Corp-operated (XOM.N) Point Thomson oil and gas field unit and
the leases within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Superior Court Judge Sharon Gleason, in a decision released
late Monday, said the state breached its contract with the oil
companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The Alaska Department of Natural Resources, while it holds
the right to reject development plans and terminate oil-field
units, is obliged to consider leaseholders' offers to remedy
deficiencies, Gleason said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the department failed to give Exxon and its partners --
BP (BP.L), Chevron (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) -- "their
constitutional right to procedural due process" because state
officials did not give the companies' latest development plan a
fair hearing, the judge said in her ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both sides said on Tuesday they are considering their next
moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "ExxonMobil is encouraged that Judge Gleason has agreed
with our position regarding the process DNR followed in
considering the Plan for Development for the Point Thomson
Unit," Exxon spokesman David Eglinton said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company believes its most recent plan is "the right
path forward to develop the Point Thomson Unit oil and gas
resources," Eglinton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Point Thomson, on the eastern North Slope, holds an
estimated 8 trillion to 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas
and hundreds of millions of barrels of crude oil and gas
condensate, according to state officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has been the subject of years of dispute between the
state and the oil companies. The state claims the companies
have delayed meaningful development of the liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State officials terminated the unit in 2006 and have
declared intentions of auctioning off the leases to potential
new developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies argue that they have worked diligently at
Point Thomson's, but special circumstances, including extremely
high reservoir pressure and remoteness, make development
difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Senior Assistant Alaska Attorney General Richard Todd said
that the decision focuses on process and procedural issues and
does not reverse the court's earlier decision affirming DNR's
right to approve or reject plans of development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Nor did the court require DNR to accept ExxonMobil's
(latest) Plan of Development. We are evaluating our legal
options and next steps," Todd said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon and its partners won a reprieve a year ago, when
Alaska Natural Resources Commissioner Tom Irwin ceded them two
of the 45 Point Thomson leases, on condition that two wells be
drilled there by the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since then, Exxon and its partners have built a 50-mile
(80-km) ice road, mobilized equipment, built a camp and started
drilling the wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies seek to start production of at least 10,000
barrels a day at Point Thomson by 2014, a project they say will
cost $1.3 billion.

&lt;p&gt; *Could generate peak sales of $1.5 billion annually&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 12 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Tuesday
said it plans to seek approvals this year for use of its
experimental Prevnar 13 vaccine among adults, with expectations
the product will eventually generate peak annual sales of more
than $1.5 billion for that population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer is awaiting U.S. approval of the improved version of
its blockbuster Prevnar vaccine for infants and young children.
The product, acquired through Pfizer's recent purchase of rival
U.S. drugmaker Wyeth, prevents a range of infections caused by
pneumococcal bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin Mackay, president of PharmaTherapeutics at Pfizer,
told investors at the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference

the company's products in late-stages of testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The current Prevnar vaccine, which protects against seven

13 strains of the bacterium, would be marketed to young
children as well as adults over 50 years of age, if approved by
regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said its other promising late-stage products
include: Tanezumab, an antibody used to treat osteoarthritis;
CP-690,550, a so-called JAK3 Inhibitor to treat rheumatoid
arthritis; Dimebon and Bapineuzumab to treat Alzheimer's
disease and PF-2341066 to treat non-small cell lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares were up 4 cents to $18.87 on the New York
Stock Exchange during mid-day trade.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, updates stock movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs started coverage of U.S.
mortgage insurance sector with a "neutral" rating, and said
lower valuations will help offset the potential for capital
losses at the mortgage insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage started MGIC Investment Corp (MTG.N) with a
"buy" rating and a price target of $10, while rating PMI
Mortgage Insurance Co PMI.N at "sell" with a $3 price target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said MGIC is in the best capital position to
weather its capital issues when compared with peers and should
be able to continue writing new business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On PMI, analysts led by Christopher Neczypor said the
company's losses from primary business alone will offset the
future premiums and a significant portion of the current
claims-paying resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We calculate a high probability that PMI will breach its
25-to-1 risk-to-capital (ratio) in the second quarter of 2010,
effectively preventing the company from writing new business in
certain states absent regulatory forbearance," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PMI said in November it was working on a plan that will
enable it to continue writing business in certain states, even
in the face of regulatory restrictions aimed at containing the
amount of risk mortgage insurers can take on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysts said the "neutral" rating on the sector
reflects the capital levels of mortgage insurers and not a
negative view of the viability of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mortgage insurance would likely be highly profitable with
pricing up about 30 percent and underwriting likely at its
tightest standards ever, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect elevated losses for the next two years as prime
defaults peak and reserves are increased for those loans
already delinquent. Severity should remain high as
unprecedented inventory levels keep home prices under
pressure," they wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts at Goldman see revenue pressure at mortgage
insurers as mortgage debt outstanding continues to contract,
but said market share could mitigate some of this pressure as
the insurers marginally loosen underwriting standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also started Radian Group Inc (RDN.N) with a
"neutral" rating and a price target of $9, saying investment
case for Radian is much less clear compared to the other two
mortgage insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PMI shares were down 9 percent at $2.76, while those of
Radian were trading down 5 percent at $8.66 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;DirectAccess, Microsoft's pairing of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 for connect-anywhere access, is possibly the best thing Redmond has produced in a long time. Unfortunately for many, it just may be about five years too early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those just getting up to speed on some of Windows 7's new features, DirectAccess is a way for Windows 7 clients to securely connect to the corporate network from any location without any type of traditional VPN. It provides an encrypted&#160;bidirectional connection between the enterprise domain and the client device prior to the user logging on to the system, allowing admins to manage the remote machine via Group Policy and the like, just as if it were physically connected to the network. The connection is always on, so users don't have to remember to manually launch a VPN client, and their applications, such as Microsoft Outlook and instant messaging, are always in communication with the corporate network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Windows 7 is an InfoWorld 2010 Technology of the Year Award winner. Take a quick tour of all 21 winners |&#160;Don't miss InfoWorld's top 10 Windows tools for IT pros and the best free open source software for Windows. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this standpoint, DirectAccess is fantastic. As the network admin, I love that I always have access to the remote device to make sure virus definitions and Windows updates are in place, and that my managed systems are always governed by my domain Group Policy. I also love that I don't have to maintain a bunch of VPN policies, and yet my users can still access e-mail and intranet sites without additional applications. Always on equals no user intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greater functionality means greater hardware and software requirements. The following list of DirectAccess requirements comes directly from Microsoft TechNet:&lt;/p&gt;

One or more DirectAccess servers running Windows&#160;Server&#160;2008&#160;R2 with two network adapters: one connected directly to the Internet, and a second connected to the intranet.
On the DirectAccess server, at least two consecutive, public IPv4 addresses      assigned to the network adapter that's connected to the Internet.
DirectAccess      clients running Windows 7.
At least one domain controller and DNS server running Windows&#160;Server&#160;2008 SP2 or Windows&#160;Server&#160;2008&#160;R2.
A public key infrastructure (PKI) to issue computer certificates, smart card certificates, and for NAP, health certificates.
IPsec policies to specify protection for traffic.
IPv6 transition technologies available for use on the DirectAccess server: ISATAP, Teredo, and 6to4. 
Optionally, a third-party NAT-PT device to provide access to IPv4-only resources for DirectAccess clients.&lt;p&gt;That is no small list of requirements. What it means is that to implement DirectAccess, I have to change, replace, or upgrade just about everything at my network edge. In addition to maintaining a public-facing firewall for Internet access, I have to add another direct-to-Internet server to act as the DirectAccess termination point. As servers are replaced and updated, I can see the enterprise eventually getting to the point where all of these things are already in place. But for most of us, this set of conditions can be a showstopper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a deployment standpoint, there are a couple of problems. First, DirectAccess runs over IPv6 and only connects to Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2008 with SP2. The Internet at large is still IPv4. In order for DirectAccess to communicate over the Internet, bridging protocols such as 6to4 or Teredo have to be used to encapsulate IPv6 packets over any IPv4 medium or network device. These technologies have been around for years, so they in themselves are not scary. But when we thought we were simplifying our remote access by eliminating VPN management, we are now adding more protocol support to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ DirectAccess is one of several "better together" features in Microsoft's new client and server. See "Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2: Joined at the hip."&#160;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, because other releases of Windows server operating systems don't support dual-layer IP, DirectAccess can't natively talk to them. If your enterprise has a bank of Windows Server 2003 or older machines that won't be upgraded anytime soon, that data is in a silo that DirectAccess can't directly access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are ways to provide access to these "legacy" servers using a NAT-PT (Network Address translation/Protocol Translation) appliance, such as Microsoft's Forefront Unified Access Gateway. Using a NAT-PT gateway will allow DirectAccess clients to connect to IPv4-based servers and resources -- a good thing. But now we have added another system to the network in order to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DirectAccess is one of the new "better together" features of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 that I was most excited about. I still believe it is the future of secure, managed remote access for Windows users, but unfortunately, I don't see many small or medium-size networks doing a forklift upgrade just to enable this new feature. It's too hard to justify the expense and the effort when VPN and other remote access options are already paid for and installed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more InfoWorld Test Center reviews of Microsoft technologies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BATON ROUGE, La.--(Business Wire)--
Manage-Trak, LLC, a leader in email encryption and secure messaging solutions,
announces the release of an add-on to the popular email messaging program,
Microsoft Outlook&#174;, allowing end-users to send secure, encrypted emails. 

The recent development of a full featured, web-based email client, Manage-Trak`s
Encrypt-A-Note solution, allows users to send sensitive data like protected
health care information utilizing encryption technology. Taking the same
principles of data security, the Outlook&#174; plug-in delivers the same HIPAA
compliant security without the barrier to entry and cost of adopting a new email
client. 

"Our goal is to provide easy to use, affordable, secure messaging to the masses.
The ability to utilize Microsoft Outlook in with our encryption solution is a
great example of this commitment," says Randy Gray, CEO of Manage-Trak. 

The Encrypt-A-Note Add-On for Outlook allows seamless integration of the widely
used email client with the ability to relay encrypted email messages all within
the same interface. Furthermore, the option to require the user to send all
messages via Encrypt-A-Note allows an organization to mitigate risk associated
with protected health information accidentally going out though standard email. 

"We knew our integration platform, which we released in November of 2009, would
be the key to user adoption. Taking the first step and building this unique
Outlook integration will allow organizations to quickly comply with the HITECH
Act", says Aaron G. Blackledge, CTO of Manage-Trak.

&lt;p&gt;Talk of Internet Explorer's demise is "far fetched," a researcher said Monday, citing data showing that more than 80% of enterprise PCs run Microsoft's browser during the workday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Devil Mountain Software, slightly more than 80% of the 22,0000 PCs in the company's community-based Exo.performance.network (Xpnet) run Internet Explorer (IE), typically for much of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devil Mountain's network collects "real-time system metrics and application usage data from Windows-based PCs and servers around the globe," according to the company's Web site. That information is then used to offer up what the company calls "an authoritative" look at market share trends affecting the Windows OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE isn't alone on the computers Devil Mountain monitors. A large chunk of business users run multiple browsers, said Craig Barth, the CTO at Devil Mountain. Almost 50% of the monitored PCs run Firefox, while approximately 20% run Google Chrome. "There's a lot of overlap," Barth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devil Mountain's performance measurement software, which has been installed on the 22,000 PCs -- most of which are enterprise systems -- tracks application use by monitoring processes in Windows' Tasklist. That approach, argued Barth, shows that IE is in no danger of vanishing from the landscape, at least the corporate landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea that IE will go away is far fetched," Barth said. "People who say those kinds of things simply don't have a grasp on the internal organization of enterprises, or the bureaucracy of companies. Until enterprises flush out the internal applications that rely on IE, that use unsupported and undocumented layout commands, IE isn't going anywhere. And those dinosaur applications are almost impossible to get rid of."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other means of browser measurement have tracked a steady decline in IE use from its usage share high of 95% in mid-2004. The most recent data from California-based Web metrics firm Net Applications, for instance, pegged IE's share of browser usage falling about 4.5 points in the last 18 weeks of 2009 to reach a new low of 63%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devil Mountain's XPnet data, on the other hand, shows IE use fluctuating during the same period, with the browser's process appearing on between 80% and 88% of PCs' Tasklists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barth acknowledged that XPnet's methodology counts instances of the IE process that may not be directly related to browsing, which may inflate its numbers somewhat. "The IE engine is often embedded in other applications, and sometimes is used for custom application front ends, like online help systems," Barth said. "The fact is that [IE's] tentacles permeate so many layers of Windows. So when Microsoft says it's painful to remove it, they're not kidding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has used that argument several times over the years when it's faced antitrust scrutiny. During the 1998 antitrust trial in the case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice and several states, Microsoft claimed that removing IE from Windows would cripple the operating system and make it unstable. Last year, however, Microsoft surrendered to pressure from European Union regulators, and agreed to give Windows users a way to remove the browsing components of IE if they wanted to run a rival -- but only after threatening to release Windows 7 minus a browser of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that IE pervades the enterprise -- in large part because of the need to support legacy Web applications or sites -- isn't all good news for Microsoft, Barth said. "They can move people forward, from IE6 to IE7 and IE8, but they can't scrap, say, the rendering engine and start all over," he said. "Microsoft may want something like Chrome -- mean, lean and fast -- but they may never get it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's one reason why many corporate users run multiple browsers. "There's really a dual personality there," said Barth. "They may have IE running for hours because they've logged into a company application or site, but they're often running Firefox, or increasingly, Chrome at the same time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In calling the three-way race between Microsoft's IE, Mozilla's Firefox and Google's Chrome, Barth also put down a contrarian bet. While most have tagged IE as the browser in a downward spiral, Barth thinks Firefox is the one in danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most vulnerable player is not Microsoft," Barth said, again citing IE's lock on the enterprise. "It's Firefox, as Chrome comes up from below. Chrome is cleaner looking, faster and has better security. Microsoft, because of its sheer weight and the legacy requirement, isn't going anywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves Firefox the odd browser out. "If anyone is going to get their lunch eaten, it's Firefox," Barth said. "It isn't the part of the big picture for anybody."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users who want to contribute to Xpnet's data collective can do so by downloading and installing a small utility, DMS Clarity Tracker Agent, from Devil Mountain's site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 12 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Bridgepoint
[BRDG.UL] has picked Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Royal Bank of
Scotland (RBS.L) to handle the possible listing of its portfolio
firm Pets at Home, people familiar with the matter said on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Bridgepoint has been pursuing a so-called dual-track
approach regarding Pets at Home and the mandate signals a step
forward to the company's possible flotation, though it is still
also actively pursuing a possible private equity buyout, the
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In October, Bridgepoint said it had hired JP Morgan Cazenove
(JPM.N) as sponsor, bookrunner and global coordinator to
investigate a possible listing in 2010 and Rothschild [ROT.UL]
as an adviser for all aspects of any exit process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far, four buyout firms are shortlisted to bid for the
British pet goods retailer. Apax Partners [APAX.UL], Bain, KKR
[DDR.UL] and TPG [TPG.UL] value the company at 700 million
pounds ($1.1 billion) or more, sources familiar with the matter
said. [ID:nLDE5BH1UC]

&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan`s Order-to-Pay Rapid Deployment Solution Brings a Simplified
Approach to Accounts Payable Automation
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan Treasury Services today announced the launch of Order-to-Pay Rapid
Deployment, a new platform designed with advanced integration and configuration
tools to eliminate the complexity associated with implementing Accounts Payable
(AP) Management solutions. With Order-to-Pay Rapid Deployment, clients can begin
to see a return on investment in as few as thirty days. 

The adoption of electronic invoicing and payments to date has been largely
limited to companies with the financial and technology resources to implement
large-scale automation initiatives. In today`s challenging economic environment,
more small and medium sized businesses are looking to take advantage of the
benefits associated with accounts payable automation. The greatest challenge
facing these firms is to rapidly demonstrate a return on their technology
investments. 

J.P. Morgan`s Order-to-Pay Rapid Deployment is targeted toward mid-size
companies with limited technology resources that want an AP automation solution
that is as easy and quick to implement as it is to use. With its new
configuration tools and pay-as-you-go model, Order-to-Pay Rapid Deployment
accelerates the benefits delivered through AP automation, such as the reduction
of AP processing costs and cycle times, the reduction of paper invoices, and the
ability to maximize early payment discount opportunities. 

"J.P. Morgan`s new Order-to-Pay Rapid Deployment solution enabled Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center to install and configure a fully functional test
environment in five days, and then deploy production in an hour," Barbara
Cassera, Manager of Financial Systems, Memorial Sloan-Kettering. "The complete
settlement functionality and comprehensive, standardized Order-to-Pay workflow
gave our users and vendors the ability to begin working in the environment
immediately." 

Order-to-Pay Rapid Deployment provides mid-size businesses with a range of AP
automation options. Organizations can choose to begin with Total SettlementSM
for robust payment automation that includes commercial card, ACH, wire transfer
and check. Beyond payments, discounting capabilities are offered to optimize
working capital or to complete invoice automation via paper and electronic
invoice processing. Buyers have the option to select from a list of pre-tested
packaged solutions that allow for business-specific, rule driven configuration. 

The unique, built-in solution integration, validation and "one-click" deployment
empowers business managers themselves to quickly configure, implement and
deploy. This new approach eliminates the need for extensive IT resources and
dramatically improves the ability for business managers to simply and quickly
adjust their AP automation application to suit changes in their business needs. 

"J.P. Morgan continues to invest in invoicing and payment capabilities that
enable our clients to operate more efficiently," said Eduardo Vergara, global
commercial card executive, J.P. Morgan Treasury Services. "With Order-to-Pay
Rapid Deployment, J.P. Morgan is helping mid-size companies take advantage of
accounts payable automation they can afford."

&lt;p&gt;Integration Enables IBM Cognos to Capture Distributed and Unstructured Data
LONDON &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
ClusterSeven (London and New York), an international provider of Enterprise
Spreadsheet Management solutions that enhance risk management, compliance and
business efficiency for financial institutions and Fortune 500 financial
reporting divisions, today announced that its flagship Enterprise Spreadsheet
Manager had been approved as a Global IBM Solution following integration and
certification completed by a mutual partner, Assimil8. 

The average CFO department routinely aggregates information from across multiple
systems for budgeting and reporting. Spreadsheets are the tool of choice, even
when more contemporary and reliable solutions are available. While spreadsheets
are fast and flexible for the user, they increase the risk of error for the
business and consume valuable time. 

The ClusterSeven solution allows IBM Cognos users to solve spreadsheet risk
exposure by addressing all parts of the spreadsheet lifecycle. This starts with
discovery and risk assessment of the organization`s spreadsheet inventory,
enabling targeted training and replacement. For those spreadsheets that will
remain in the business, ClusterSeven provides an automated version and
cell-level change control, with irregular activity reported directly to IBM
Cognos dashboards. In addition, critical data trends buried in historical
spreadsheet versions can now be viewed alongside all other business
intelligence. 

"Distributed data in spreadsheets is a major business and IT headache," said
Karl Mullins, CEO of Assimil8, an IBM Business Partner. "By integrating
ClusterSeven, IBM Cognos users can accelerate replacement or plan for their
control." 

"The integration provides a data viewing and reporting framework between our
database and IBM Cognos allowing users to enjoy the benefits of spreadsheets
while getting the transparency they need for replacement by more robust
systems," said Ralph Baxter, CEO of ClusterSeven. "By that time, more
spreadsheets will have emerged for us to manage."

ClusterSeven, contact Lydia Bennett at lbennett@clusterseven.com.

  (Updates with KB Home and Supervalu earnings)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Edward Krudy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures
dropped on Tuesday on a subpar start to earnings season
following Alcoa Inc's worse-than-expected results and Chevron
Corp's warning that its income would be "sharply lower."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alcoa (AA.N) recorded a narrower quarterly loss late
Monday, but Wall Street's forecast was for a small per-share
profit, and the aluminum company's stock fell 7.3 percent to
$16.18 before the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alcoa is the first Dow index component to report, and the
miss disappointed investors. [ID:nN11155201]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That disappointment was compounded when fellow Dow member
Chevron (CVX.N) warned Monday its fourth-quarter results would
be "sharply lower" than the previous quarter because of further
deterioration in oil refining margins. The shares fell 1.6
percent to $79.55 in premarket trading. [ID:nN11169455]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kevin Kruszenski, head of listed trading at KeyBanc Capital
Markets in Cleveland said that while Alcoa was a
disappointment, investors would look ahead to reports from
Intel Corp (INTC.O) and JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) later in
the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It seems that Alcoa always disappoints, but at the same
time it will be interesting to see how the week plays out," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 fell 9.1 points and were below fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 dropped

&lt;p&gt;Threshold Pharmaceuticals Provides Clinical Development Update at J.P. Morgan
Healthcare Conference

REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Jan. 12, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Threshold
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:THLD) today announced clinical trial results
related to Threshold's clinical stage hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302. The
results are being presented at the 28th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference
taking place in San Francisco from January 11 to 14, 2010.

The Company has three ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trials of TH-302. The "401
trial" is a trial of TH-302 as monotherapy in patients with advanced solid
tumors. The "402 trial" is a three arm trial of TH-302 in combination with
gemcitabine or docetaxel or pemetrexed in patients with advanced solid tumors.
The "403 trial" is a trial of TH-302 in combination with doxorubicin in patients
with advanced soft tissue sarcoma. To date, TH-302 has been administered to more
than 200 cancer patients.

The 402 trial is expected to enroll 120 patients in total and includes dose
escalation and dose expansion portions of the trial. In 81 patients assessed to
date, 23 patients (28%) had a RECIST criteria partial response (PR), 38 patients
(47%) achieved stable disease (SD) and 20 patients (25%) had progressive disease
(PD). The partial response included both confirmed and unconfirmed partial
responses. These results are consistent with what the Company presented at the
Congress of the European CanCer Organisation (ECCO) in September 2009.
Importantly, with TH-302 plus gemcitabine in 17 patients with first-line
pancreatic cancer, 16 patients (94%) achieved SD or better including 5 PRs and 8
continuing on the trial. With TH-302 plus docetaxel or pemetrexed in 10 patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 9 patients (90%) achieved SD or better
including 5 PRs and 5 with progression-free survival over 5 months.

In general, hematologic toxicity in the 402 trial was higher than might be
expected if chemotherapy was administered by itself. Some of the dose limiting
toxicities reported with each of the combination chemotherapies have been
hematologic. Skin and mucosal toxicities have been TH-302 dose dependent with a
trend for increased frequency and greater severity at higher doses. Dose
expansions were initiated at TH-302 doses of between 340 and 400 mg/m2. The
addition of TH-302 to standard chemotherapies does not appear to enhance the
toxicity in other body systems.

"We are extremely pleased with the activity of TH-302, especially when combined
with full dose chemotherapy," said Barry Selick, Ph.D., Threshold's chief
executive officer. "Within the next few weeks we will be finalizing which cancer
indication will be the target of our first controlled Phase 2 trial of TH-302,
which we expect will be either front-line pancreatic cancer or
relapsed/refractory non-small cell lung cancer. We believe that the Phase 1/2
results are sufficiently promising for each of these indications to warrant
continued development in either one alone, or both."

The 403 trial is expected to enroll up to 36 patients with soft tissue sarcoma.
In 20 patients assessed to date, 5 patients (25%) had a PR and 12 patients (60%)
achieved SD while 3 patients (15%) had PD. TH-302 continues to be tolerated and
there have been no new serious unexpected adverse events in patients assessed
for safety. Nausea was the most commonly reported adverse event. After observing
significant, but not dose limiting toxicity at a TH-302 dose of 240 mg/m2,
prophylactic growth factor support was initiated. The maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) has been established at 300 mg/m2. Skin toxicity and mucosal toxicities
are common with 50% of patients having at least one skin adverse event and 55%
of patients at least one mucosal adverse event. All were grade 1 or 2 with the
exception of the one patient with grade 3 cellulitis and one patient with grade
3 vaginitis.

The 401 trial is expected to enroll up to 126 patients. The primary objectives
of the 401 trial are to determine the MTD and dose-limiting toxicities of TH-302
in patients with advanced solid tumors and to make an assessment of the efficacy
of TH-302 in patients with metastatic melanoma, small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
and NSCLC. In 19 patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic melanoma, 11
patients (58%) achieved SD or better including 3 PRs. In 7 patients with
relapsed or refractory SCLC, 4 patients (57%) achieved SD or better including 2
PRs.

Starting on the afternoon of Thursday, January 14, a live webcast of the
Company's presentation will be available under the Webcasts section of the
Company's website. A replay of the presentation will be archived on the site for
90 days.

  (Updates with KB Home and Supervalu earnings estimates)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Edward Krudy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures
dropped on Tuesday on a subpar start to earnings season
following Alcoa Inc's worse-than-expected results and Chevron
Corp's warning that its income would be "sharply lower."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alcoa (AA.N) recorded a narrower quarterly loss late
Monday, but Wall Street's forecast was for a small per-share
profit, and the aluminum company's stock fell 5.7 percent to
$16.45 before the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alcoa is the first Dow index component to report, and the
miss disappointed investors. [ID:nN11155201]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That disappointment was compounded when fellow Dow member
Chevron (CVX.N) warned Monday its fourth-quarter results would
be "sharply lower" than the previous quarter because of further
deterioration in oil refining margins. The shares fell 1.5
percent to $79.69 in early trading. [ID:nN11169455]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "With Alcoa setting the earnings stage with a negative
report, investors will be questioning the extent and durability
of the economic recovery," said Andre Bakhos, president of
Princeton Financial Group in North Brunswick, New Jersey.
"Eventually it always comes down to earnings, and this is a
disappointing start to the season."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 fell 6.8 points and were below fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 dropped
66 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures NDc1 lost 14 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O slashed its fiscal 2010
forecast late Monday on weak holiday sales in Europe and a
shift in the way it distributes its video games. The stock fell
9.9 percent to $16.46 in premarket trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Homebuilder KB Home (KBH.N) is expected to post a quarterly
loss of 56 cents per share, versus a $3.96 a share loss a year
ago, while grocery retailer Supervalu Inc (SVU.N) is forecast
to earn a 40 cents per share quarterly profit compared to 62
cents a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. industrial shares lifted the Dow and the SP 500 on
Monday to new 15-month highs after China bolstered expectations
the world economy would strengthen, but the Nasdaq fell on
profit-taking in technology stocks.

&lt;p&gt;Network Frontiers Looks Ahead to 2010 After Breakout Year
LAFAYETTE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Network Frontiers, the leader in IT regulatory compliance management, is pleased
to announce Microsoft Corporation is the latest licensee of the Unified
Compliance Framework (UCF). Microsoft recently announced plans to integrate the
UCF into Microsoft`s System Center Service Manager 2010. 

The UCF harmonizes IT controls -- 20,004 citations mapped across 2,657 active
UCF Common Control IDs as of November 31, 2009 -- from over 400 international
regulatory requirements, standards and guidelines. 

Network Frontiers` unique methodology transforms this massive compilation of
data into a single set of straightforward requirements that clearly show the
many points where global, state and industry regulations overlap, enabling
businesses to leverage existing policies, processes and tools to meet regulatory
demands, cutting the cost and time invested in compliance efforts. 

The Unified Compliance Framework will serve as the central regulatory framework
for the Compliance and Risk Process Management Pack. The solution will ship
following the release of Service Manager in the first half of 2010. 

Network Frontiers` Breakout Year

The Microsoft license rounds out a stellar year for Network Frontiers. With
fourteen leading regulatory management solutions providers now licensing the
UCF, five pending announcements and an additional five licensing agreements
currently in progress, Network Frontiers' United Compliance Framework (UCF) has
become the industry standard database for compliance vendors. 

Gartner highlighted Network Frontiers and the UCF in its Cool Vendors in Risk
Management and Compliance report, 2009. Gartner defines a cool vendor as a
company "with innovative, impactful, and intriguing technologies or solutions
which enable users to do things they couldn't do before" and praised the UCF for
providing a tool that "reduce(s) complexity and cut(s) the costs of compliance
and audit &#8230;ensures a thorough legal review of the mappings to the authoritative
sources" and is inexpensive ... "just about anyone can get some value from the
UCF even if your organization has already put the effort into developing your
proprietary mapping." 

Additionally, the UCF was recently cited as the "common language for overlapping
compliance standards" by the IT Knowledge Exchange and described as "an
incredibly useful tool" by Paul Roberts, a senior analyst at The 451 Group, who
stated "Vendors such as CA, Inc., Archer Technologies LLC, McAfee, Inc.,
Lumension Security, Inc. and OpenPages, Inc. have all licensed UCF content for
use in their risk management products in recent months, and we expect more to
sign on in 2010, as customers look for help cutting through the Gordian Knot of
compliance mandates."

&lt;p&gt; * U.S. stock index futures pointed to a lower open on Wall
Street on Tuesday, with futures for the SP 500 SPc1 down 0.5
percent, Dow Jones DJc1 futures down 0.5 percent and Nasdaq
100 NDc1 futures down 0.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Alcoa Inc (AA.N) will be the main focus after posting a
narrower quarterly loss that fell short of expectations after
the bell on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company blamed higher power bills, a weak dollar and
costs of temporarily shutting smelters in Italy, and said while
aluminum prices were climbing, demand from some customers,
especially planemakers and the commercial construction sector,
was not expected to improve soon. [ID:nN11155201]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Frankfurt-listed shares in Alcoa (AA.F) were down 6.1
percent, while shares in rival Aluminum Corp of China Ltd

mining shares such as Rio Tinto (RIO.L) and Xstrata XTA.L were

after the bell on Monday after the energy company provided an
interim update on its fourth quarter. [ID:nN11169455]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Kraft Foods KFT.N will also be in the spotlight after
British confectioner Cadbury CBRY.L posted solid 2009 results
and an upbeat outlook in its last move to rebuff Kraft's $17
billion hostile takeover bid. [ID:nLDE60A1Q2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Also weighing on overall sentiment, China's central bank
signalled in its open market operations it was tightening
monetary conditions at a faster than expected pace in response
to increasing concerns about the economy overheating.
[ID:nTOE60B020]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * American Airlines AMR.N and partners in the Oneworld
alliance sweetened their offer to Japan Airlines 9205.T to
$1.4 billion to keep the struggling national carrier from
joining hands with rival Delta Air Lines (DAL.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Revenue at Airbus parent EADS EAD.PA fell almost 4
percent to around 41.7 billion euros ($60.6 billion) in 2009,
the European aerospace group said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Mattel (MAT.O), the world's leading toymaker, said it had
seen very strong sales for its Christmas hit Fashionista Barbie
doll following a recent revamp of its 50-year-old mainstay
product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) is set to pick a buyer
for its South Korean funds and brokerage units by February, in a
deal estimated at up to $900 million that could pressure other
struggling foreign financial firms to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * U.S. industrial shares lifted the Dow and the SP 500 on
Monday to new 15-month highs after China bolstered expectations
the world economy would strengthen, but Nasdaq fell on
profit-taking in tech stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 45.80
points, or 0.43 percent, to 10,663.99. The Standard  Poor's 500
Index .SPX rose 2.00 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,146.98. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 4.76 points, or 0.21
percent, to 2,312.41.

&lt;p&gt;  MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, Jan 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Clearwell Systems, Inc., a leader in intelligent e-discovery, today
announced Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), a Fortune 500 company,
has deployed the Clearwell E-Discovery Platform as a component of its
in-house e-discovery strategy. Microsoft's legal and IT teams use
Clearwell to increase the efficiency of the e-discovery process for
litigation, regulatory inquiries and internal investigations.

    "E-discovery costs are a significant portion of litigation costs," said
Rich Wallis, deputy general counsel of litigation at Microsoft. "With the
implementation of Clearwell's pre-processing, processing and analysis
solution, we are further streamlining our e-discovery processes, starting
with early case assessment, intelligent and appropriate minimization and
search."

    The Clearwell E-Discovery Platform is fully operational in less than 25
minutes and provides users with immediate visibility into case facts,
significantly accelerating early case assessment. Clearwell's Transparent
Search, metadata filters, and people analytics enable users to quickly and
defensibly eliminate irrelevant documents and false positives, lowering
processing costs and reducing review workload. The product's discussion
threading and relevance ranking capabilities display documents in context,
further increasing review throughput. Responsive documents can be produced
or seamlessly uploaded into litigation support databases via
EDRM-compliant XML and other major load file formats. In addition, the
Clearwell E-Discovery Platform automatically tracks all actions on case
documents throughout the e-discovery workflow, ensuring a defensible
e-discovery process.

    "The e-discovery expense will continue to increase as the amount of
electronically stored information grows," said Kamal Shah, vice president
of product management and marketing at Clearwell Systems. "To cope with
this, many companies like Microsoft are choosing Clearwell to perform
early case assessments in-house and gain control over e-discovery costs."

take effect once approved by the Turkish government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petrobras said last year it expected investments in the

billion barrels of oil and 1.5 trillion cubic metres of natural

&lt;p&gt; * Panasonic plans to outsource other large IT functions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Helps IBM catch up with rivals in cloud computing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp (6752.T) has

Japanese electronics giant's entire 380,000 strong workforce,
the industry's largest cloud computing contract to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is an important win for IBM, which has lagged behind

&lt;p&gt;Google's move to challenge Chinese censorship demands and threaten to pull its business from the country could pressure search rivals like Microsoft and Yahoo to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts said Google should generate positive reviews from its challenge to the Chinese government, which could prove a problem for rivals that still censor search results for users in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It depends on what ultimately happens," said Dan Olds, an analyst at Gabriel Consulting Group. "If Google pulls out of China, I would like to think it would give other companies the guts to stand up to it and any other country that wants to censor content and use them to settle scores with critics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google announced late last night that a major attack launched against its network from within China had forced it to consider pulling its business out of the country. After the attack, which was aimed at exposing the Google Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists, the search vendor said it was in the process of reconsidering earlier agreements with the government to censor search results of users in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an e-mail to Computerworld , a Microsoft spokesman said the company has found no evidence that its network was hacked in China. "We have no indication that any of our mail properties have been compromised," he wrote. The spokesman, however, would not respond to questions about whether Google's move will prompt it to also consider pulling out of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After noting that Google's image should benefit from its challenge to the Chinese government, industry observers said they were closely watching for subsequent moves by Microsoft and Yahoo, which run the second and third most popular search engines worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Enderle, an analyst at the Enderle Group, said it will now be harder for other companies to go along with China's high-handed tactics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we would all appreciate it if companies more often drew lines in the sand protecting their customers even against large hostile governments," said Enderle. "This is the way that the Obama administration would like all companies to behave -- put doing what is right ahead of what is financially expedient. It would be nice if this was a trend but with executives focused on quarterly results and the bottom line that is doubtful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while Google's rivals will likely face increasing pressure to deal more harshly with the Chinese government, they may also find themselves in a position to pick up some of Google's market share -- and advertising revenues -- in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This gives Google's rivals a big business opportunity," said Olds. "With Google out of the market, it gives them a clearer path to win a big chunk of the market -- but at what cost?" The cost could be measured in good will and reputation, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This may prevent further investment and transfer of other technology to China," said Jim McGregor, an analyst with In-Stat. "This is likely going to cause others to proceed cautiously, if at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Gaudin covers the Internet and Web 2.0, emerging technologies, and desktop and laptop chips for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft will invest US$250 million over three years on a product integration strategy meant to "significantly simplify" technology deployments for companies of all sizes, they said Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement will employ a new "infrastructure-to-application" model and result in prepackaged offerings that combine servers, storage, networking and software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a conference call, executives from both companies repeatedly insisted the pact has much more substance than a typical partnership announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the deepest level of collaboration and integration and technical work that we've done that I'm certainly aware of," said HP CEO Mark Hurd. "This is breakthrough for us. ... [Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer] and I would not be on this phone call if this was just another press release from HP and Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hurd acknowledged HP and Microsoft have bundled their products in the past, but said "there's a difference between a bundle and how deep it's integrated and how much engineering is done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is "the driving force behind this deal at this time," Ballmer said. Some companies may deploy applications to Microsoft's own Azure cloud infrastructure service but others will want to use a private version, he said. "That thing is going to need to be an integrated stack from the hardware layer to the management layer to the application model," he said. "We need to evangelize that same application model whether you host in the cloud or on-premises." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will be using HP hardware to support Azure, and HP will be providing services for Azure &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later this year, the partnership will spawn products around Microsoft Exchange and high-end data warehousing for SQL Server, said Bob Muglia, president of Microsoft's server and tools business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal also makes Microsoft "a preferred provider" of virtualization technology to HP. The companies plan to deliver a series of "Smart Bundles" aimed at small and medium-sized businesses. The products will combine HP servers, storage and networking technology along with Microsoft's Hyper-V virtualization platform and HP's Insight system management software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP will also resell Microsoft's own System Center on its hardware and work will be done to integrate Insight with System Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement should be viewed simply as an evolution of HP and Microsoft's relationship and not any sort of reaction to market events, such as Oracle's pending purchase of Sun Microsystems, according to Hurd. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That transaction, which is on hold while European regulators conduct an antitrust review, will usher Oracle into the hardware and systems business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[Oracle] is a great partner, but I'm here to talk about Microsoft," Hurd said. "I think Oracle will continue to be a very important partner."&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Obama Mulls Bailout Tax on Banks

The Obama Administration is considering imposing a tax on banks to recover the
losses incurred by the government on the bailout money provided to financial
firms as part of its $700 billion bailout program to rescue the financial
system. 

The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) by law requires the president to seek
ways to recover shortfalls in bailout money from financial institutions.
However, the law does not stipulate the process of recovery of the bailout
money. 

No final decision has yet been taken with respect to the type of fee. Details
about the fee on bailout banks are expected to be declared in next month's
budget. We expect this move to help reduce the deficit and lower risky exposures
of big banks. 

The Obama Administration is considering such a step as the big bailout banks
have already repaid their TARP money and are set to pay out large bonuses.
Despite the ongoing turmoil in the mortgage market, banks are now in a
comfortable position. Revenues have almost rebounded to pre-crisis levels. 

Last week, Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) said that it is likely to pay
bonuses to its investment bankers close to what they received in 2007, before
the financial crisis. 

Targeting banks to recover the shortfall in bailout money is justified, as they
are the major beneficiaries of taxpayer largesse. Most of the bailout loans were
provided to financial institutions; they form the backbone of the economy and
were the primary victims of the crisis. 

Major financial institutions that have already repaid the bailout money include
Bank of America, American Express (NYSE: AXP), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), Morgan
Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC). 

The government is already in the process of using the repaid bailout money to
create new jobs and cut the nation`s fiscal deficit. Imposition of a fee on
banks is expected to further help reduce the deficit.

&lt;p&gt;Two New Global Ads Launch on American Idol
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola is kicking off the year and Opening Happiness with fresh, new
advertising debuting this week on the new season of American Idol on FOX. 

"When families and friends come together to enjoy fun times like watching new
episodes of American Idol, Coca-Cola is always there," said Katie Bayne, Chief
marketing Officer, Coca-Cola North America. "These new ads are part of an
incredibly exciting start to 2010 that all begins with opening a little
happiness with Coca-Cola." 

"Snowball," which debuted last night, shows how even at the Athletes` Village
during the Olympic Games, Coca-Cola can spark spontaneity and fun. In this
global spot, which reminds people to "Open the Games. Open Happiness," Coke
serves as the catalyst that brings together athletes from around the world for a
friendly, high-energy snowball fight. 

In "Finals," which debuts this evening, when a college student falls asleep
studying for his history final, the historical figures chronicled in his
textbook come to life on a mission to awaken him before he misses his test.
After several failed attempts, Napoleon, Da Vinci and Cleopatra notice a Coke
bottle sitting on the student`s desk and devise a plan to use the familiar
"psshht" sound of bottle opening to awaken him. Thanks to historical rescuers,
after refreshing drink of Coca-Cola, the student heads out to ace his final. 

"Last night we shared our new global ad for the 2010 Olympic Winter Games, and
tonight we`re unveiling our first new `Open Happiness` commercial for 2010," Joe
Tripodi, Chief Marketing and Commercial Officer, The Coca-Cola Company. "Both of
these ads celebrate simple, uplifting moments that are part of enjoying a
refreshing Coca-Cola." 

These new ads are the first of several that will debut over the next month for
Coca-Cola and other brands, including Diet Coke, Coke Zero and Sprite. Both
"Snowball" and "Finals" will be used in markets around the world.

&lt;p&gt;World`s Largest Technology Company and No. 1 Software Provider Plan to Advance
Cloud Computing with Industry`s Most Integrated Technology Stack 
PALO ALTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:MSFT) today announced a three-year
agreement to invest $250 million to significantly simplify technology
environments for businesses of all sizes. 

The companies plan to deliver new solutions that will:

* be built on a next-generation infrastructure-to-application model; 
* advance cloud computing by speeding application implementation; and 
* eliminate complexities of IT management and automate existing manual processes
to lower the overall costs.

This agreement represents the industry`s most comprehensive technology stack
integration to date - from infrastructure to application - and is intended to
substantially improve the customer experience for developing, deploying and
managing IT environments. 

With this strategic partnership, HP and Microsoft will collaborate on an
engineering roadmap for data management machines; converged, prepackaged
application solutions; comprehensive virtualization offerings; and integrated
management tools. Delivered through the industry`s most extensive sales and
partner network, these dynamic IT solutions will provide:

* Increased business efficiency through solutions that respond to changing
business requirements by seamlessly converging server, storage, network and
application resources in a highly automated, self-managed environment. 
* Improved application performance, reliability and availability for some of the
industry`s top business applications, including Microsoft Exchange Server and
Microsoft SQL Server, by creating a deeply optimized "machine" environment. This
is achieved through turnkey, pre-integrated server, storage, networking and
application packages. These data management and email machines provide "push
button" simplicity in deployment and management. 
* Enhanced operations through integrated, interoperable virtualization and
management tools that allow technology environments to be automatically
provisioned, managed and continuously self-tuned. Through the integration of HP
Insight Software, HP Business Technology Optimization software and Microsoft
System Center, enterprise customers use a unified management solution to
automate application deployment along with infrastructure-to-application
monitoring. This integration also delivers power and performance optimization,
while ensuring interoperability in a heterogeneous data center environment. 
* Investment protection and low total cost of ownership, enabling customers to
deploy systems with confidence. The joint solutions are built on industry
standards and designed to utilize existing data center investments, all managed
through a common framework. This approach is designed to enable customers to
integrate private or public cloud computing models as their business requires.
HP and Microsoft will collaborate on the Windows Azure platform, with HP and
Microsoft offering services, and Microsoft continuing to invest in HP hardware
for Windows Azure infrastructure.

"Driving innovation helps businesses establish a competitive advantage," said
Mark Hurd, HP chairman and chief executive officer. "This collaboration will
allow HP and Microsoft to offer our customers transformative technology that
will reduce costs, generate business growth and accelerate innovation." 

The new infrastructure-to-application model from HP and Microsoft will be
delivered as integrated offerings for large, heterogeneous data center
environments as well as through solutions designed for small and midsize
businesses. Solutions are available immediately, with new offerings being
introduced throughout the next three years. 

"This agreement, which spans hardware, software and services, will enable
business customers to optimize performance with push-button simplicity at the
lowest-possible total cost of ownership," said Steve Ballmer, chief executive
officer, Microsoft Corp. "Our extended partnership will transform the way large
enterprises deliver services to their customers, and help smaller organizations
adopt IT to grow their businesses. Microsoft and HP are betting on each other so
our customers don`t have to gamble on IT." 

Driving opportunity for HP and Microsoft Frontline channel partners worldwide

Under the terms of the expanded partnership, the two companies will increase
their global investment by 10 times to drive new opportunities for the 32,000 HP
and Microsoft Frontline channel partners. Partners will support customers in
modernizing their environments through a combination of software and hardware
infrastructure-to-application packages and services. Partner benefits include:

* Quicker time to revenue with simplified and shortened sales cycles resulting
from Smart Bundles and all-inclusive packages as well as new offerings that
provide add-on application and service sales opportunities. 
* Flexible financing options through HP Financial Services, which will enable
resellers to drive customer adoption by making technology solutions more
accessible and easy to acquire. 
* Increased support with dedicated field resources focused on presales
initiatives and extensive partner training. 
* Jointly funded worldwide marketing campaigns, lead-generation programs and
sales tools, available at www.hpmspartners.com.

Driving customer success with HP professional services and Microsoft Services

To speed return on investment (ROI) and increase business value, the integrated
portfolio is complemented by new design, implementation and support services for
the joint solutions. Through more than 11,000 Microsoft-certified HP
professionals worldwide, HP Services, in partnership with Microsoft Services,
will support the entire integrated hardware and software solution from simple
implementations to the most critical enterprise infrastructure. Service
offerings include:

* Strategy workshops, ROI and business value services. Other available services
include architecture, design, pilot, global implementation, support for server
virtualization and management solutions, client virtualization, data management
and cloud computing as well as per-seat fixed-price Microsoft Exchange Server
upgrade/migration services. 
* Application modernization services for large-scale online transaction
processing (OLTP) implementations. 
* Planned customized Business Intelligence Solutions that provide faster time to
application value. 
* Assistance for customers who seek to run their technology on-premises,
outsourced or via the cloud.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
LiveOffice, the leading provider of software-as-a-service (SaaS) email archiving
and email continuity solutions, and Intermedia, the world`s largest Microsoft
Exchange hosting provider, today announced that together they are the first to
offer fully integrated, cloud-based email archiving with hosted Exchange 2010.
Intermedia is the first company to offer hosted Exchange 2010 and LiveOffice is
the first to announce archiving support for Exchange 2010. This joint offering
is the first to give hosted Exchange 2010 users the ability to perform
self-service restores on previously deleted items and conduct lightning-fast
searches of archived messages directly from Outlook. In addition, LiveOffice`s
centralized and secure online repository enhances customers` ability to quickly
and easily meet legal discovery and regulatory compliance requirements. 

"Just a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable to get this level of
enterprise technology delivered in a software-as-a-service model that works for
small, medium and large companies alike," noted Michael Osterman, principal
analyst at Osterman Research. "Together, LiveOffice and Intermedia are changing
the way people think about their corporate email and making the hosted model
extremely attractive. Customers maintain control while completely offloading the
security and administrative headaches common with on-premise email deployments.
It`s a win-win - companies get access to the latest technologies available and
free up internal IT resources to focus on other important business initiatives."


LiveOffice is the top provider of hosted email archiving services with more than
9,000 clients, while Intermedia operates the world`s largest hosted Exchange
service, hosting more than 225,000 premium Microsoft Exchange mailboxes. In
combination with Intermedia`s hosted Exchange 2010, LiveOffice offers:

* Outlook integration: End users can access LiveOffice Personal Archive from a
web-based folder available via Outlook, allowing them to rapidly search, view
and restore their historical emails and attachments from their archives, even if
they already permanently deleted them from their Exchange mailboxes. 
* Secure repository with lightning-fast search: LiveOffice offers an
independent, third-party cloud-based archive, where all messages are stored in
multiple, geographically dispersed SAS-70 Type II, Tier-4 data centers. With all
messages users have sent and received-even those already deleted from their
Exchange mailboxes-safely stored and indexed in their archive, customers can
instantly enforce email preservation for lawsuits/legal holds and protect
attorney-client privileged communications from further review. LiveOffice`s
real-time search and retrieval functionality helps customers significantly
reduce the time it takes to respond to e-discovery and audit requests,
maximizing resources and improving overall efficiency. 
* Free archive migration tools: With LiveOffice CloudMerge automated migration
tools, customers can easily and securely migrate their legacy email data
(messages and attachments) from their current archiving solution to LiveOffice`s
hosted archive and have it fully accessible via Outlook-without business
disruption. These tools can ingest data from on-premise email stores, other
hosted email stores, legacy email archives and personal archives (PST/NSF
files).

"We are excited to be working with an organization of Intermedia`s caliber and
for the opportunity to extend the reach of our archiving services to a new
client base," said Jim O`Hara, vice president, sales and business development
for LiveOffice. "Our archiving support for Exchange 2010 coupled with
Intermedia`s hosted Exchange puts a powerful toolset at the fingertips of
businesses that want the latest technology without dealing with lengthy
deployment times or large data center build outs." 

"We are pleased to work with a top archiving provider like LiveOffice to offer
customers increased levels of technology and service," says Bob Leibholz, vice
president of sales and business development, Intermedia. "The combination of our
hosted Exchange 2010 and the archiving features from LiveOffice are critical for
businesses of all sizes." 

In addition to the new features Microsoft has included in Exchange 2010,
Intermedia`s hosted Exchange 2010 service offers:

* Super premium infrastructure, spanning four data centers, to protect email and
speed routing: Customers are able to select the data center of their choice -
each with multiple Tier-1 Internet provider connections and hardware from Cisco,
Dell and EMC - to ensure the fastest round trip for their email. Email records
are mirrored in near real-time across data centers, assuring data protection and
email reliability even in the event of a disaster. Intermedia`s hosted Exchange
2010 includes the industry`s first 100 percent Data Protection Guarantee as well
as a 99.999 percent uptime guarantee. 
* Free full-service migration: Using proprietary migration tools, Intermedia is
capable of migrating customers to hosted Exchange 2010 from their current email
systems, often Exchange 2003 or 2000, Lotus Notes or POP/IMAP. Customers`
accounts can instantly be setup, enabling them to immediately begin using the
service. 
* Control of the Exchange environment: Unique in an industry that relies on
generic third-party control panels, Intermedia`s HostPilot Control Panel was
designed for small- and medium-sized businesses. It enables business owners and
IT managers to delegate complex Exchange administration - such as deleting data
from a lost BlackBerry Wireless Handheld - to non-technical staff. 
* Support with an average hold time of less than one minute: Support is
available by phone and email, 24 hours a day. Intermedia support representatives
are certified by Microsoft&#174; and RIM&#174;.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said on Wednesday that publicly disclosed stress tests of large financial firms and contingent capital could help minimize the perception that some firms are "too big to fail."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, in prepared testimony to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, also said his firm reaped rewards from government support during the financial meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that the government action was critical and we benefited from it," he said. "The system clearly needs to be structured so that private capital, rather than government capital, is used to stabilize troubled firms promptly before a crisis metastasizes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein's remarks were prepared for a 10-member panel formed by the U.S. Congress to examine the causes of the financial meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commission is holding its first public hearing on Wednesday and is set to hear from four top bank executives, including Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein also said his firm has consulted in recent months with many of its largest shareholders and there is an "overwhelming consensus" that its pay model was effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Karey Wutkowski and Steve Eder; Editing by Neil Stempleman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Wednesday the combination of investment and commercial banking at firms such as his did not contribute to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dimon, CEO of the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, defended the bank's model and responded to some lawmakers who have urged that large banks be broken up. Dimon's comments came in prepared testimony to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commission, a 10-member panel created by the U.S. Congress to examine the causes of the financial meltdown, is holding its first public hearing on Wednesday and is set to hear from four top bank executives, including Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seen as one of the banks that has best survived the credit crisis. Dimon argued the bank's diversification put it in a strong position even at the height of the financial crisis. JPMorgan bought investment bank Bear Stearns in March 2008 and, at the end of that year, it acquired the assets of failed Seattle thrift Washington Mutual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our economy needs financial institutions of all sizes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On compensation, another hot-button issue, Dimon said he thinks there may be some legitimate concerns that bonuses contributed to excessive risk taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he defended JPMorgan's pay practices, saying "they have been and remain appropriate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who was named Banker of the Year by American Banker magazine in December, has frequently spoken out against various regulatory changes and has publicly defended the bank's need to pay bonuses to talented staff.

&lt;p&gt;Enhanced Recovery to Yield 40 Million More Barrels; New Equipment Will Reduce
Air Emissions
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Production Company today announced a project at the Hawkins Field in
northeast Texas to recover the equivalent of an additional 40 million barrels of
oil, an amount equal to the annual energy needs of over one million Texas
households. 

The project will extend the life of the field, discovered by ExxonMobil in 1940,
for an additional 25 years. 

"ExxonMobil is applying some of its most advanced technologies to mature oil and
natural gas fields. The investment is part of an ongoing effort to find, develop
and produce more domestic supplies of oil and gas to meet the country`s growing
energy needs," said Kok-Yew See, ExxonMobil`s U.S. production manager. "These
advanced technologies breathe life into mature fields, thereby producing more
resources for energy consumers." 

He added, "ExxonMobil continues to invest in oil and natural gas development in
Texas. Over the past three years our capital expenditure in the state exceeded
$700 million. These investments help create jobs and contribute to the economic
growth of the region and state. They also help maintain Texas` position as the
leading U.S. oil and natural gas producing state." 

New facilities will be installed at the Hawkins Field to recover and reinject
nitrogen and other gases from the field`s natural gas production. This will
enable more oil and gas to be recovered from the reservoirs. The reinjection of
these gases will reduce the plant's air emissions by almost one-third. 

Construction is expected to begin in the first quarter 2010. At its peak, the
ExxonMobil project will employ a construction workforce of about 300 people.
Project start-up is anticipated in late 2011. 

The Hawkins Field is located in Wood County, Texas, about 100 miles east of
Dallas. Over the past 70 years, it has produced more than 800 million barrels of
oil. The field is one of the largest ever discovered in the state and provided
significant energy supplies to support America's effort during World War II. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Estimates, expectations, and business plans in this
release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including
resource recoveries, production rates, project plans and schedules, capital
expenditures, and the impact of new technology could differ materially due to
changes in market conditions affecting the oil and gas industry or long-term oil
and gas price levels; political or regulatory developments; reservoir
performance; timely completion of development projects; technical or operating
factors; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future
Results" in the Investor Information section of our website (www.exxonmobil.com)
and in Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K. References to barrels of oil and
similar terms include quantities of oil and gas that are not yet classified as
proved reserves under SEC regulations but that we believe will be produced in
the future. 

About ExxonMobil

ExxonMobil, the largest publicly traded international oil and gas company, uses
technology and innovation to help meet the world`s growing energy needs.
ExxonMobil holds an industry-leading inventory of resources, is the largest
refiner and marketer of petroleum products, and its chemical company is one of

&lt;p&gt;Invitation to Beta-Test Windows Workflow Foundation Follows Successful Pairing
on .NET Development
JOHANNESBURG--(Business Wire)--
SYSPRO, a leading, worldwide provider of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
software, today announced that the company has accepted an invitation to join
the Microsoft Technology Adoption Program (TAP) and is currently working with
Microsoft on the development of the Windows Workflow Foundation, which provides
a programming model, in-process workflow engine and re-hostable designer to
implement long-running processes as workflows within .NET applications. The TAP
is designed to provide a consistent experience for Microsoft partners to obtain
real-world customer feedback on Microsoft pre-release products. 

According to Phil Duff, SYSPRO CEO, "SYSPRO, a Microsoft Gold Partner and former
Microsoft Developer of the Year, has enjoyed a close working relationship with
Microsoft, as evidenced by the concurrent development of Microsoft.NET and
SYSPRO e.net solutions." When .NET was released in 2000, a Microsoft manager, in
fact, referred to SYSPRO as the ".NET Poster Child." 

Microsoft selected SYSPRO to be a part of the TAP after seeing the amazing work
SYSPRO had done developing the new .NET-based Workflow module embedded within
the award winning SYSPRO ERP solution. As a participant in the Microsoft TAP,
SYSPRO will provide feedback as well as suggested software enhancements during
Microsoft`s developmental phases. 

SYSPRO Workflow Services is part of SYSPRO 6.1, being introduced in early 20l0.
SYSPRO Workflow Services provides users with an easier way to orchestrate or
execute the complex processing of data in a visual form, much like flow charts,
but without the need to understand computers or programming. 

According to Duff, "The Workflow solution for SYSPRO is deeply embedded in the
SYSPRO product, meaning the workflow processes can be initiated from anywhere in
SYSPRO." The advantages of a .NET-based workflow solution are also numerous,
says Duff, including greater flexibility, improved process controls and the easy
development of .NET associated programs to augment business processes.

business solutions to some of the world's leading companies. As a global leader

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - More than three percent of sudden deaths in Europe are related to cocaine use and many of them are brought on by a "lethal cocktail" of the drug, alcohol and cigarettes, scientists said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results of a study on sudden death show there is no such thing as safe recreational cocaine use, the researchers said, and suggest the 12 million Europeans who use cocaine are putting their lives on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The notion that recreational cocaine use is 'safe' should be dispelled, since even small amounts may have catastrophic consequences, including sudden death," said Joaquin Lucena, head of forensic pathology at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Seville, Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucena and his team studied sudden deaths in south-west Spain between 2003 and 2006 and found 3.1 percent of them were related to taking cocaine, which had damaged the heart and arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found all the cocaine sudden deaths were in men aged between 21 and 45, and 81 percent of them also smoked, while 76 percent had also drunk alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethanol, the intoxicating ingredient in alcohol, enhances the high users get from cocaine and softens the subsequent low. But both smoking and alcohol are also linked with heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The combination of cocaine with either or both of these habits can be considered as a lethal cocktail that promotes the development of premature heart disease," Lucena wrote in the study, which was published in the European Heart Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucena also said he believed his findings could safely be extrapolated to much of the rest of Europe, suggesting cocaine use is a significant public health threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cocaine abuse is a growing public health issue in Europe and we can only monitor its prevalence by performing these detailed autopsies whenever someone dies suddenly," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts at the Spanish Institute estimate about 12 million Europeans use cocaine -- about 3.7 percent of the total adult population aged 15 to 64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 5 percent of adults in Britain, Spain and Italy say they have taken cocaine at least once in their lives and use is higher among those aged between 15 and 34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the estimated number of European young adult cocaine consumers is similar in Spain, UK and Italy, there is no reason to consider that cocaine-related sudden deaths in UK and Italy would be different to what we have found in our research in south-west Spain," said Lucena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fotini Rozakeas of the British Heart Foundation charity said the study showed the need "to dispel the myth that cocaine is a 'safe party drug'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The potential deadly consequences from cocaine use can happen to anyone who takes it, even in previously young healthy people with no history of heart disease," she said. "The reality is that there are risks every time you use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are working on vaccines and drugs to try to help cocaine and other drug users kick the habit, but their work is still in the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Charles Dick)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 13 (Reuters) - An executive from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc (GS.N) said the company in some cases profited by trading
ahead of or against its own clients, the New York Times said on
its website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Thomas Mazarakis, who heads Goldman's fundamental
strategies group, told select clients in an email that his unit
often provided investment ideas that the firm had already
traded on and the firm sometimes took the opposite approach,
betting against particular instruments recommended by the
group, the Times said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We may trade, and may have existing positions, based on
trading ideas before we have discussed those trading ideas with
you," the paper quoted Mazarakis as writing in the email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The paper quoted Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag as
saying in a statement the company has been "providing this
disclosure, which we think is best practice, for a number of
years and there is nothing new in the disclosure you were
sent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman Sachs spokesman in Hong Kong could not be
immediately reached for comment by Reuters.

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska Jan 14 (Reuters) - Agents from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency investigating possible
air-pollution violations spent two days searching Chevron
(CVX.N)-owned oil facilities in Alaska, company and government
officials said Thursday. Agents searched the facilities on
Tuesday and Wednesday, said Andrew Ames, a spokesman for the
U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. He declined to
provide further information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron spokesman Mickey Driver said the searches occurred
at the company's Trading Bay production facility and Granite
Point tank farm on the western side of Cook Inlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EPA is investigating air-emission compliance at those
facilities, Driver said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have been and will continue to cooperate with the
US-EPA in this matter. We have been working cooperatively with
the US-EPA since 2008 in responding to inquiries regarding the
Trading Bay facility," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We place the highest priority on protecting the
environment. Our policies and procedures are designed to
emphasize and monitor compliance with all environmental and
worker-safety laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials from EPA's regional office in Seattle were not
immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EPA investigation follows a similar air-pollution
investigation conducted by the state, said a spokeswoman for
the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We had an investigation," department spokeswoman Weld
Royal said. "We closed it and then we referred it to EPA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This week's EPA searches followed other recent problems at
Granite Point and Trading Bay, both aged fields in Alaska's
mature Cook Inlet basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Production from the fields was shut down for months last
year because of repeated eruptions of Redoubt Volcano. The
10,197-foot volcano began erupting last March, forcing the
shutdown of a nearby oil-storage and loading facility that
handled Granite Point and Trading Bay oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That shutdown prompted the temporary cessation of Granite
Point and Trading Bay production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil production, which had been about 7,500 barrels a day
prior to the eruptions, resumed in August.

&lt;p&gt; * Lawsuits claim Chantix led to attempted suicide, death&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Seek damages, jury trials&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer stands by drug
 (Adds Pfizer statement, plaintiff details, Chantix sales)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Three personal injury lawsuits
were filed against Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Thursday, claiming its
smoking cessation drug Chantix caused attempted suicides and
death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuits, filed in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan, claim that at the time the plaintiffs took Chantix,
Pfizer did not tell doctors and patients about dangers it
allegedly knew were related to the drug, including depression
and thoughts of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Pfizer subsequently added warnings to its package
insert, the law firm that filed all three lawsuits alleged the
drug's label is still inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer introduced Chantix in the United States in 2006,
hoping it would become a multibillion-dollar product and revive
flagging profits. The drug's sales have fallen off as concerns
about side effects increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chantix sales fell 15 percent to $155 million in the third
quarter of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attorney Marc Grossman alleged in the lawsuits that the
company "intentionally, recklessly, and/or negligently
concealed, suppressed, omitted, and/or misrepresented the
risks, dangers, defects and disadvantages of Chantix."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grossman is with Sanders Viener Grossman LLP in Mineola,
New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two lawsuits claim the plaintiffs tried to kill themselves
as a result of using Chantix. The third is a wrongful death
lawsuit filed on behalf of Indiana resident Annette Pine,
claiming she committed suicide after using Chantix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuits seek trials by jury, punitive and compensatory
damages, medical and legal expenses, and, in Pine's case,
funeral expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer issued a statement defending the drug, approved in
some 86 countries as a smoking cessation aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At all times, Pfizer has clearly communicated important
information about the safe use of Chantix, which is available
only with a prescription," Pfizer spokeswoman Sally Beatty said
in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We intend to vigorously defend this medicine," she said,
adding that Chantix has helped many smokers to quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuits claim that each of the plaintiffs used the
drug properly. They also claim that in each case the plaintiffs
and their doctors were "not aware and through diligent efforts
were not able to discover the risk of serious injury, and/or
depressed mood and/or suicide associated with and/or caused by
Chantix."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three personal injury lawsuits were filed against Pfizer Inc on Thursday, claiming its smoking-cessation drug Chantix caused attempted suicides or death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suits, all filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan by the same plaintiffs' law firm, claim Pfizer failed to notify doctors and patients about dangers the company allegedly knew about the pill -- including depression and suicidal thoughts--at the time the plaintiffs took the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even though Pfizer subsequently added warnings to its package insert, the law firm alleged the drug label is still inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer introduced Chantix in the United States in 2006, with hopes it would become a huge product that would help revive flagging company profits, but its sales have wilted amid concern about side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Defendant intentionally, recklessly, and/or negligently concealed, suppressed, omitted, and/or misrepresented the risks, dangers, defects and disadvantages of Chantix," attorney Marc Grossman alleged in all three lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grossman is with the Mineola, New York law firm of Sanders Viener Grossman LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp.'s announcement that it would begin renting Windows and Office 2007 left many initially euphoric on the notion that they wouldn't have to shell out several hundred dollars for Office anymore, and then disappointed when it became clear that for most of us that wouldn't be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things are clearly changing, though. Here's the real deal, in FAQ form:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, what are Microsoft's new Rental Rights?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a new one-time license that costs $32 for the Pro versions of Windows XP, Vista or 7, $64 for Office 2007 Standard and $83 for Office Professional Plus. Microsoft is offering a 30% discount on those prices until the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a sweet deal for me as a consumer or small business owner. Is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not exactly. First of all, Microsoft is not offering this straight to customers as a Web download or as a new box you'd see on Best Buy shelves. Rental Rights can only be purchased by Microsoft's army of channel partners, in particular: Internet cafes, executive business centers, airport or hotel kiosks, and computer leasing companies, for example&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes it legal for them to charge or give away access to a leased Windows PC to customers. The OEM copy of Windows that was pre-installed on the PC was not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2007 and Publisher 2007 are a different matter. Since neither comes pre-installed on PCs for free, partners would still have to buy a volume license for Office 2007 and/or Publisher 2007 first, a Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed, before they could buy Rental Rights and then offer Office 2007 to end users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That volume license -- Open, Select, or Select Plus -- is still going to start at about $350 per copy of Office. That makes the total cost for Office about $400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if I run a coffee shop or small hotel that lets guests use my PC for free, I would still need to buy Rental Rights?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, yes, but Microsoft isn't likely to go after you and other mom 'n pop shops. Rental Rights is aimed primarily at companies such as national PC leasing company SmartSource, FedEx Office (formerly Kinko's), airport business center operator Regus, and their many smaller competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regus Americas vice-president of marketing Rebecca Tann said that Microsoft enabling them to lease software to customers was a "great" thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A large portion of our client base are entrepreneurs and small business owners, and it would seem that this [renting] would be a popular option among these type companies, many of [which] are trying to control expenses and may not be able to afford traditional software licenses," Tann said in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if Rental Rights is a second license, why is this a good deal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before this, companies renting out Windows PCs or Office 2007 (if they were big and law-abiding) bought Service Provider Licensing Agreements (SPLA) from Microsoft. SPLAs are more expensive and complicated than Rental Rights, says Paul DeGroot, an analyst with the independent firm Directions on Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, many companies that were either too small or didn't consider themselves a Microsoft partner simply skipped the SPLA, figuring that they already were paying Microsoft once for the software. In Microsoft's eyes, they were "not in compliance," which is its way of saying you're a pirate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rental Rights is a compromise designed to encourage smaller partners to become legal without busting their bank account, DeGroot says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might I, as a consumer or small business owner, benefit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FedEx Office might lower the per-minute price to create your Christmas cards via Microsoft Publisher, or print out a PowerPoint presentation. Temporary office operators may be able to start charging customers for hourly PC usage rather than monthly rates, or come up with more creative pricing schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller companies that didn't pay the SPLA and thus hesitated to charge for access to Windows or Office may now be emboldened to do so. That could mean coffee shops or hotels might stop letting you surf the Web or print out your plane tickets for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, new types of business models might emerge that rent access to Windows and Office, especially as users move to alternatives such as Google's Chrome OS or its free Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this a defensive play against free productivity apps and cloud computing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, in the sense that it may win back some revenue from customers who have already switched most of their word processing and spreadsheet-jockeying to a free Office alternative, such as a small business owner who needs to create a PowerPoint once a year, or a consumer who wants to create a one-off newsletter with Publisher. It could also help win some revenue from corporations who were planning on displacing Office with Google Docs for its temp workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeGroot said this isn't Microsoft's chief weapon against Google Docs and OpenOffice.org. That's what the free, ad-supported Office Web Applications is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm considering this for a large corporation. Can I rent software from Microsoft rather than buy it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, if, for instance, you are leasing a bunch of PCs for temporary workers during holiday or tax season. In that case, renting Windows or Office via a PC leasing firm rather than buying a permanent volume license could help companies "stay low to ground on their upfront expenses," DeGroot said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've got temporary workers on PCs you already own, you can still lease Windows, Office and even server software like Exchange and SharePoint, just through a different program. Microsoft actually pushed this heavily last year, slashing lease prices by as much as 26% depending on the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was done to snag cash-strapped companies that were forgoing upgrades and dumping their software maintenance and support contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 14 (Reuters) - Three personal injury lawsuits
were filed against Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Thursday, claiming its
smoking-cessation drug Chantix caused attempted suicides or
death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The suits, all filed in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan by the same plaintiffs' law firm, claim Pfizer failed
to notify doctors and patients about dangers the company
allegedly knew about the pill -- including depression and
suicidal thoughts--at the time the plaintiffs took the
medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And even though Pfizer subsequently added warnings to its
package insert, the law firm alleged the drug label is still
inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer introduced Chantix in the United States in 2006,
with hopes it would become a huge product that would help
revive flagging company profits, but its sales have wilted amid
concern about side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Defendant intentionally, recklessly, and/or negligently
concealed, suppressed, omitted, and/or misrepresented the
risks, dangers, defects and disadvantages of Chantix," attorney
Marc Grossman alleged in all three lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grossman is with the Mineola, New York law firm of Sanders
Viener Grossman LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer could not immediately be reached for comment.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Google Out of China?

Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) has publicly stated that it is considering pulling
out of the fast-growing Chinese market. The statement was made as a result of an
investigation over several weeks into China`s Internet censorship system that
revealed a systematic and targeted hacking into Google`s corporate
infrastructure. 

Google stated that the hacking resulted in theft of intellectual property (IP)
and compromised gmail accounts related to human rights activists located both
within and outside China. Twenty other companies have also been impacted. It is
not yet clear however whether the Chinese government had a hand in the affair
and China has not yet put forward any comment. 

It is interesting to note however that Google has only made a public statement,
leaving the door open to further negotiations. It has not taken a strategic
decision to exit China as Yahoo Inc. (Nasdaq: YHOO) did when it sold off its
stake in Alibaba Group in September last year. 

We also don`t think that any of the other top IT companies, such as Cisco
Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO), which provides networking equipment, Microsoft
Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT), which generates significant revenue from
Windows-based PCs sold in China, or Hewlett Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ), which
sells a large number of PCs in China are likely to follow in Google`s footsteps.

&lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, Md.--(Business Wire)--
W. R. Grace &amp; Co. (NYSE: GRA) today announced that it completed the sale of a 5%
interest in Advanced Refining Technologies LLC (ART), a joint venture with
Chevron Products Company (Chevron), on November 30, 2009. Grace has reduced its
55% interest to 50% to achieve a balanced ownership structure. Grace and Chevron
have also amended certain agreements governing Grace's supply of catalyst to the
joint venture and the related funding of capital spending in support of the
joint venture. ART has grown significantly since it began operations in 2001,
and these changes to the agreements reflect the current scale and maturity of
the business and position the venture for future opportunities. 

ART is a leading global supplier of hydroprocessing catalysts which remove
sulfur and other contaminants from petroleum to produce more
environmentally-friendly transportation fuels, and allow refiners to process
less expensive feedstocks. The use of these catalysts is growing around the
world as fuel specifications are becoming more stringent. ART is a leader in
hydroprocessing catalyst technology for the residue processing segment, and has
recently introduced 420 DX catalyst, a next-generation offering for the
production of ultra-low sulfur diesel. 

"Grace is committed to providing our customers in the petroleum refining
industry with innovative, technology-leading catalysts and systems," said Greg
Poling, Vice President, W. R. Grace &amp; Co. and President, Grace Davison. "Our
relationship with Chevron, through ART, is integral to that commitment. Given
ART`s current size as a business and its growth prospects, this restructuring
provides ART with a stronger and more flexible platform to pursue continued
investment and growth opportunities." 

As a result of the sale, Grace intends to deconsolidate ART`s results of
operations, cash flows and financial position from its consolidated financial
statements on a prospective basis effective December 1, 2009. Previously, Grace
reported 100% of ART`s sales and 55% of ART`s income, with 45% of ART`s income
reported as Chevron`s noncontrolling interest. Subsequent to the sale, Grace
intends to record its investment in ART and its portion of ART`s income and
dividends using the equity method of accounting. Included in Grace`s previously
reported consolidated net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and
years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were sales of $234.1 million, $348.7
million, and $335.7 million, respectively, related to ART. 

As a result of this transaction, Grace expects to record a gain of approximately
$5 million. 

Grace is a leading global supplier of catalysts and other products to petroleum
refiners; catalysts for the manufacture of plastics; silica-based engineered and
specialty materials for a wide range of industrial applications; sealants and
coatings for food and beverage packaging, and specialty chemicals, additives and
building materials for commercial and residential construction. Founded in 1854,
Grace has operations in over 40 countries. For more information, visit Grace's

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 14 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has no
plans to pull its business out of China after rival Google Inc
(GOOG.O) threatened to quit the country over claims of cyber
attacks on its email service, the company's chief executive
said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS): Today certain media reports have
erroneously stated that, during testimony at the Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission in Washington, D.C. yesterday, Lloyd Blankfein said Goldman Sachs`
practices with respect to the sale of mortgage-related securities were
"improper." Mr. Blankfein said no such thing. 

Mr. Blankfein was responding to a lengthy series of statements followed by a
question that was predicated on the assumption that a firm was selling a product
that it thought was going to default. Mr. Blankfein agreed that, if such an
assumption was true, the practice would be improper. Mr. Blankfein does not
believe, nor did he say, that Goldman Sachs had behaved improperly in any way. 

In fact, his answer to the various statements explained the market making
function and how our practices were entirely appropriate. As he stated in his
testimony, the firm could not have known the future direction of housing prices.


The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a leading global financial services firm
providing investment banking, securities and investment management services to a
substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial
institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. Founded in 1869, the
firm is headquartered in New York and maintains offices in London, Frankfurt,

&lt;p&gt;VALLENDAR, Germany Jan 14 (Reuters) - A top Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) banker said new rules designed to improve the safety of the
financial system will not make it "bulletproof" and added banks "do
not have an obligation to promote the public good."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Alexander Dibelius, the head of Goldman Sachs in Germany,
Austria, Russia, Central and Eastern Europe, urged politicians and
regulators on Thursday to resist a flood of new rules that could end
up stifling the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There will be no bulletproof regulatory system," Dibelius said,
speaking to students at a business school in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He acknowledged that some financial institutions were
shortsighted and took too many risks, and that sanctioning
mechanisms needed to be developed to penalise misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Without question, we have to face up to our responsibility,"
Dibelius said. "Only those financial market players with a solid and
sustainable business model that focuses on clients and their needs
can look forward to a viable future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His remarks come as Wall Street bosses were grilled about their
role in the financial crisis and as the United States mulled
introducing a bonus tax. [ID:nN13220575] [ID:nN11158721]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dibelius, who gained fame for arranging Daimler-Benz AG's $36
billion merger with Chrysler Group in 1998, said banks' obligation
to clients and shareholders forced them to focus on the bottom line,
even in times when they were being urged to expand lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Terminating unprofitable relationships is not immoral or
reprehensible -- it is economically prudent and, ultimately, in the
interest of the public," Dibelius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Consequently, the expectation that banks should have an
altruistic relationship with their clients - for instance, when it
comes to lending - is unjustified and unrealistic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The public is best served when banks remain profitable and avoid
excessive risks, Dibelius explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If all banks had used so-called fair value accounting - which
forces lenders to disclose losses immediately - a buildup of risky
assets on balance sheets could have been identified early on,
potentially avoiding a systemic crisis for the banking system, he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has drawn fire for preparing to shell out more than $20
billion in compensation this year, only months after benefiting from
a $10 billion U.S. taxpayer bailout, putting the bank in the
spotlight on a debate on pay. [ID:nN1076736]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bonus policies at Goldman already included deferred payouts to
encourage long term and sustainable profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looking forward, Dibelius said he saw grounds for guarded
optimism because the most severe turmoil of the latest crisis had
already passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Philipp Halstrick and Edward Taylor in Frankfurt,

&lt;p&gt;
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 14, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc.
(Nasdaq:ALGN) today announced that it is adding an international distributor for
Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). As part of the distribution agreement
for EMEA, Gil Laks, Align Technology vice president, International will
transition from his current position and assume ownership of the distributor,
which will have sole distribution rights for the Invisalign system in over 85
countries.

"In the two years since Align established international distributors for Asia
Pacific and Latin America, growth has accelerated in those regions," said Thomas
M. Prescott, Align president and CEO. "The addition of a distributor for EMEA
will give us a complete footprint around the world so that our partners can help
develop smaller, emerging markets while Align continues its focus on larger,
established markets."

Prescott continued, "This is a very exciting time for Invisalign worldwide, and
I'm pleased to have a new distribution partner in the emerging growth region of
EMEA under the leadership of Gil Laks. Gil is a valuable member of Align's
management team and has made tremendous contributions to building our European
and Japanese operations and furthering international expansion. I look forward
to our continued partnership with Gil, and to working together to extend the
benefits of Invisalign to new regions."

Mr. Laks joined Align in 2001 and was promoted to vice president, International
in 2005. Under his leadership, Align's business outside of North America grew
substantially to represent 22 percent of worldwide sales. Over the last year,
Align has continued to build its international leadership team with the addition
of two seasoned professionals, Michael Lewis, vice president and managing
director of Europe and Michael Chang Wenderoth, managing director of China. Mr.
Lewis is responsible for all European operations and brings 15 years of senior
management experience in sales and marketing from companies such as Sybron
Dental, Becton Dickinson, and Sandoz Pharmaceuticals. Mr. Lewis was most
recently president of the EMEA region for Gambro, a global medical technology
company. Mr. Wenderoth re-joins Align after spending the past four years as a
consultant in China helping companies navigate the Chinese market and develop
new businesses. During his previous tenure at Align, Mr. Wenderoth served in
various marketing management roles in North America and in Europe. Prior to
Align, Mr. Wenderoth spent nearly a decade working in China. His industry and
local market experience combined with his extensive knowledge of the Invisalign
system will be invaluable as Align continues to develop the Chinese market.

Mr. Laks will continue as vice president, International through the first
quarter of 2010 to ensure a smooth transition of his responsibilities. Align has
initiated a search for a new vice president of International and has retained a
leading international executive search firm to assist in the process.

&lt;p&gt; * FDA: doctors should prescribe Spiriva as normal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer says findings back drug's safety profile
 (Adds details from FDA, company comment, share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. health officials on
Thursday said they found no increased risk of heart trouble
with use of Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) inhaled lung drug Spiriva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in a statement, said
it had finished reviewing data for the chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment and did not find a higher
chance of stroke, heart attack or death with the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doctors should continue to prescribe Spiriva as recommended
on the product's label, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The findings follow the agency's review of the drug that
began in March 2008 when the FDA said some Pfizer data
suggested a possible "small excess risks" of stroke in patients
using the inhaler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In November 2009, an FDA panel of outside experts concluded
that data from a company trial were adequate to address the
heart-related concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it was pleased with the FDA's findings. It
markets the drug with Boehringer Ingelheim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This reaffirms the well-established safety profile of
Spiriva HandiHaler," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The treatment for COPD, sometimes referred to as "smoker's
lung" had worldwide sales of about $3 billion in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the drugmaker were up more than 1 percent in late
afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDA posted the statement on its website here

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Jan 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Communications industry market research firm Infonetics Research
(http://twitter.com/infonetics) recently published two unified
communication reports, one a worldwide and regional market share and
forecast report, the other a survey of North American companies and their
plans for deploying unified communication equipment and services, as well
as their ratings of leading unified communication vendors.

    The first report, Unified Communication and IP Contact Center Market
Share, Size, and Forecasts, shows that worldwide revenue from unified
messaging platforms and communicator software clients is expected to drop
by 4% in 2009, a relatively mild decrease compared to the decrease in
overall enterprise telephony spending.

    The related Unified Communication Deployment Strategies and Vendor
Ratings: North American Enterprise Survey focuses on end-user perceptions
and plans, and names Microsoft, Cisco and AT the top communication
providers.

    ANALYST NOTE

    "Against the backdrop of significant enterprise spending reductions on all
kinds of products, the unified communication market is holding up
remarkably well. Perhaps it shouldn't come as a surprise, as these tools
are designed to allow users to communicate and collaborate more
effectively. But the provider landscape is far from being set in stone;
organizations are going beyond their traditional communication suppliers
and considering offerings from the likes of Skype and Google, making this
an interesting market to follow in coming years," notes Matthias
Machowinski, Infonetics Research's directing analyst for enterprise voice
and data.

    SELECT MARKET SHARE REPORT HIGHLIGHTS


--  Shipments of communicator clients grew almost 1,000% between the first
    half of 2008 (1H08) and the first half of 2009 (1H09), reaching 5.4
    million, with revenue nearly tripling, mainly due to aggressive bundling of
    communicator clients with core telephony system sales
--  In 1H09, Avaya shot to the top vendor spot for communicator licenses
    after running an aggressive One X upgrade promotion
--  The IP contact center and unified communication markets are forecast to
    return to strong double-digit annual growth once the world's economies
    recover, with sales surpassing $1 billion by 2012 and 2013, respectively
    

    
SELECT SURVEY REPORT HIGHLIGHTS


--  Microsoft and Cisco are the most widely deployed unified communication
    suppliers among survey respondents, enjoying high buyer awareness and
    receiving high marks from buyers on the most important buying criteria
--  AT and Cisco lead the list of VoIP equipment and services providers
--  Cost, complexity, and network capabilities are the leading barriers to
    deploying unified communication
--  The focus of unified communication is transitioning to mobility,
    multimedia, and collaboration, with respondents looking to integrate cell
    phones, IM, video, and conferencing
    

    
MARKET SHARE REPORT SYNOPSES

    In 2010, Infonetics will track unified communication market size, market
forecasts, and vendor market share quarterly in its expanded Enterprise
Unified Communication, VoIP, and TDM Equipment report.

    Infonetics' most recent unified communication and IPCC report, published
in December 2009, provides market share for Aastra, Alcatel-Lucent,
Aspect, Avaya, Cisco, Interactive Intelligence, Microsoft, Nortel,
Siemens, and Toshiba, and tracks UC and IPCC products offered by these
companies as well as 3Com, Altigen, AVST, CosmoCom, Fonality, IBM, Mitel,
NEC, ShoreTel, Vertical, Zeacom, and others.

    The report tracks manufacturer revenue, seats, licenses, and ports for
add-on IP PBX applications, including unified communication (unified
messaging and communicator), and three IP contact center categories: ACD
(automatic call distribution), IVR (interactive voice response), and CTI
(computer telephony integration). The report provides market share, market
size, forecasts, and analysis for North America, EMEA (Europe, Middle
East, Africa), Asia Pacific, and Central and Latin America (CALA).

    SURVEY SYNOPSES

    Infonetics' Unified Communication Deployment Strategies and Vendor
Ratings: North American Enterprise Survey takes an in-depth look at the
state of the unified communication market, how far along organizations
are in unifying disparate communication experiences, why they are doing
it, what capabilities they need, and which vendors and service providers
they are likely to use.

    The survey features end-user ratings of unified communication vendors,
including Avaya, Cisco, IBM, Microsoft, Mitel, Nortel, and Siemens.
Companies named by respondents in response to questions about vendor
familiarity, installed and future communication suppliers include AOL,
Apple, AT, Avaya, Bell Canada, Charter, Cisco, Comcast, Dell, Google,
HP, IBM, Microsoft, Motorola, Nortel, Rogers, Shoretel, Skype, Sprint,
Sun, Telus, Verizon, Vonage, and Yahoo.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's dazzling display at a Las Vegas tech extravaganza last week shows that it has not given up on the idea of joining Apple Inc as a leader in home consumer electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some investors would prefer the world's largest software maker to save its cash and stick to doing what it does best: pursuing steady but unglamorous growth in software platforms for corporations and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company thrust itself to the forefront of last week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas with a giant multimedia display that rivaled the likes of Samsung Electronics in the latest attempt to convince the world that it stands at the cutting edge of personal technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once again, most attention turned instead to the latest gadgets from Apple and Google Inc, which weren't even exhibitors at the world's largest tech show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a familiar story for Microsoft, which has struggled to translate its dominance in the business and home personal computer software market into leadership of hot new consumer sectors, or to capture the buzz that some rivals generate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for investors, does it even matter, given the success of their core business software?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, you should pay attention, but it's not where the value is being created for Microsoft," said Todd Lowenstein, a portfolio manager at Los Angeles-based HighMark Capital Management, which holds Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not clear whether the consumer side will ever get the returns the enterprise side has."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from users of Windows operating systems, Microsoft's consumer business is modest. Its entertainment and devices unit posted a profit of $169 million last fiscal year, a fraction of the almost $11 billion profit from its Windows franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox gaming system, which has sold 39 million units worldwide since its launch in 2001, is Microsoft's indisputable hit in the consumer sector. But it has not quite become the beachhead into living rooms it was intended to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RABBIT TRAILS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Windows mobile phone software is losing ground to a new array of smartphones and its Zune digital music player has not put a scratch on Apple's iPod. Bing, its search engine, is also struggling to take share from market leader Google. The company's online services unit lost $2.2 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors complain that Microsoft is wasting its time and money on markets it can't dominate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has never invented anything," said Bill Smead, chief executive of Seattle-based Smead Capital Management, which holds 340,000 Microsoft shares. "Why are they spending a great deal of management time and effort trying to invent a major product category?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft should act more like a mature company such as Johnson  Johnson, which makes shrewd purchases and manages them well, said Smead, rather than chasing what he calls "rabbit trails" that lead to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't expect them to be Apple, I don't want them to be Apple," he said. "They need to be really good at being 50, an elder statesman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that view underestimates the strength of Microsoft's long-term game plan, other investors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has potential upside and not a lot of downside," said Ken Allen, Baltimore-based portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price's Science and Technology Fund, which holds Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They bring a lot of resources to bear and have a lot of assets. It's classic Microsoft mode -- try to chip away and get better and better and eventually be in a great position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's top management certainly shows no signs of backing off. Chief Executive Steve Ballmer kicked off CES with a keynote speech casting Microsoft right at the center of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From the largest screen in the living room to the smallest screen in our pocket ..., we are delivering the experiences people want," Ballmer said, showing off a range of machines from big, touch-screen PCs to hand-held "slate" devices, all running Windows software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He demonstrated new ways of watching television on the PC or even a phone with its Mediaroom software, which powers online TV services such as ATT Inc's U-verse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xbox in particular is set for a strong year, he said, as Microsoft launches the controller-free Project Natal gaming system and a new installment of best-selling game Halo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors don't all share that optimism, especially in phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft makes good products but they have not been able to deliver the elegance of design or user experience that Apple does," said Toan Tran, an analyst at Morningstar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aside from buying someone like (BlackBerry maker) Research in Motion there's pretty much nothing they can do to be successful in this market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others are content to watch Microsoft try its luck, as long as it doesn't divert too much cash from the main business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They don't seem to have connected with the consumer in other areas outside of the PC," said HighMark's Lowenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But technology moves so fast, you just don't know where things are going to go, so you have to plant many seeds and see what sprouts," he said. "As an investor, as long as they keep deploying capital at very high returns, I'm OK with them making some side bets in the consumer space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edwin Chan and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
(This is a correction to the release that went out earlier today. It corrects
the Rating Outlook on the class A-J to Negative.) 

Fitch Ratings takes various actions on J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage
Securities Corp., Series 2005-CIBC13 commercial mortgage pass-through
certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this
release. 

The downgrades are the result of Fitch's loss expectations and its prospective
views regarding cash flow declines and commercial real estate market values.
Today's rating actions are based on the full losses of 9.8% as a majority of
loans mature in the next five years. The bonds with Negative Outlooks indicate
classes that may be downgraded in the future. 

To determine potential defaults for each loan, Fitch assumed cash flow would
decline by 10% from year-end 2008. That is consistent with the analysis used in
its review of recent vintage transactions whereby cash flow was assumed to
decline 15% from year-end 2007 projected over a three year period. If the
stressed cash flow would cause the loan to fall below 0.95 times (x) debt
service coverage ratio (DSCR), Fitch assumed the loan would default during the
term. To determine losses, Fitch used the above stressed cash flow and applied a
market cap rate by property type, ranging between 7.5% and 10.0%, to derive a
value. If the loan balance at default is less than Fitch's derived value, the
loan would realize that amount of loss. These loss estimates were reviewed in
more detail for loans representing 45.9% of the pool and, in certain cases,
revised based on additional information and/or property characteristics. Loss
expectations attributed to loans reviewed in detail represent approximately
70.7% of the 9.8%. 

Approximately 93.5% of the mortgages mature within the next five years as
follows: 15.0% in 2010, 0% in 2011, 10.9% in 2012, 0% in 2013, 0% in 2014, and
67.6% in 2015. All losses associated with these loans are fully recognized in
the rating actions. 

Fitch identified 44 Loans of Concern (27.3%) within the pool, 18 of which
(18.3%) are specially serviced, five of which are current (3.4%). 

Fitch's analysis resulted in loss expectations for seven of the top 15 loans.
Four of which (14.0%) are assumed to default during the loan term, as the
stressed cash flow is below 0.95x DSCR. Three additional loans (10.0%) are
assumed to incur losses at maturity based on their balloon loan balance being
greater than the implied value of the properties. Fitch expects that eight of
the top 15 loans may default at maturity based on an insufficient accrued equity
position as calculated in Fitch's refinance test; however, Fitch's analysis did
not result in a loss for these eight loans based on its derived values being
higher than the current loan amounts. A loan would pass the refinance test if
the stressed cash flow would achieve a 1.25x DSCR as calculated based on a
30-year amortization schedule and an 8% coupon. 

The largest contributors to loss are as follows: DRA-CRT Portfolio I (6.9%), The
Shore Club (4.3%) and Osceola Village (0.7%). 

The DRA-CRT Portfolio I loan is collateralized by four office parks, consisting
of 16 buildings located across three states and four submarkets. The office
properties total 1.47 million square feet (sf) and are located in Orlando, FL,
Jacksonville, FL, Rockville, MD, and Charlotte, NC. The loan transferred to the
special servicer in November 2009 due to monetary default and is a loan of
concern due to its poor performance and delinquent status (90 Days). The
servicer reported September 2009 DSCR and occupancy were 0.95 times (x) and
approximately 75%, respectively. As the loan is in special servicing, Fitch
assumed losses prior to the loan's maturity in 2010. 

The Shore Club loan is collateralized by a 322-room lodging property located in
the South Beach area of Miami, FL. The loan transferred to the special servicer
in September 2009 due to imminent default. The special servicer is currently in
negotiations with the borrower and the loan is 90 days delinquent. The servicer
reported September 2009 DSCR and RevPAR were 0.69x and $183 compared to the
issuance DSCR and 2007 RevPAR of 1.34x and $284, respectively. As the loan is in
special servicing, Fitch assumed losses prior to the loan's maturity in 2010. 

Osceola Village is a 278 unit student housing property located in Tallahassee,
FL. The loan transferred to the special servicer in August 2007 and is now real
estate owned (REO). Significant losses are expected.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Charged with Trying to Use Secret Tribunal to Undermine Rule of Law
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Representatives of Amazonian indigenous groups in Ecuador went to U.S. federal
court in New York today to enjoin Chevron from initiating a closed-door
international arbitration against Ecuador`s government designed to eliminate the
company`s potential $27 billion liability for contaminating a huge swath of
rainforest and devastating the local population. 

The Amazonian communities, who charge Chevron with dumping billions of gallons
of toxic waste onto their ancestral lands and causing hundreds of deaths, assert
that the oil giant`s attempt to have the same claims heard anew in a secret
arbitration proceeding against Ecuador - without their own participation -- is
"the latest tactical attempt" by the oil major to undermine the rule of law and
avoid accountability for what could be the world`s worst oil-related pollution. 

"Chevron`s attempt is an outrage against the rule of law and violates express
promises made to a U.S. federal court that Chevron would submit to jurisdiction
in Ecuador and abide by any ruling there," said Pablo Fajardo, the lawyer for
the communities in Ecuador. 

Chevron`s request to arbitrate represents the second time that the company has
violated its prior promises and sought to shift the underlying litigation away
from Ecuador, where a neutral Special Master found the oil giant might be liable
for up to $27 billion in clean-up damages. The earlier effort was denied by the
U.S. Supreme Court last June. 

The case began in U.S. federal court in 1993 but was sent to Ecuador at
Chevron`s request in 2002 after company lawyers argued the courts there were
better-suited to hear the environmental claims. The oil giant had argued
repeatedly before the U.S. federal court that the South American nation was a
fair and adequate forum, and that the trial should be moved there. Ultimately,
Chevron signed a written stipulation before the U.S. court that it would accept
jurisdiction in Ecuador. 

But with the evidence in Ecuador now piling up against it, Chevron shifted its
strategy and is now seeking to discredit Ecuador`s courts and use the latest
arbitration to try to force Ecuador`s government to assume the liability for the
clean-up. A decision by the Ecuadorian trial court is expected in the coming
months. 

The lawsuit asserts that Chevron`s arbitration "is a patently meritless and
brazen attempt to extinguish plaintiffs` claims in a forum where they cannot
participate" and violates the "very representations that induced the transfer of
the case to Ecuador in the first place." The petition also charges that Chevron
is undermining the rule of law by seeking an order to force Ecuador`s President
to violate his country`s Constitution by quashing a legal case brought by his
own citizens. 

"Chevron seeks to treat the Ecuadorian judiciary like a kangaroo court, where
the executive branch, under compulsion of an arbitration award, simply tells the
local judge to end the case and therefore the case is ended," the plaintiffs
assert in their petition. 

"Chevron is playing a cynical game of musical jurisdictions: find any court that
will relieve it of its responsibility to clean up one of the greatest man-made
environmental disasters in the world," said Ilann Maazel, of Emery Celli
Brinckerhoff &amp; Abady, New York-based counsel that is handling the lawsuit for
the plaintiffs. 

The latest dispute comes after Chevron suffered a string of embarrassing legal
defeats in the U.S. before a federal appellate panel and the U.S. Supreme Court
regarding a separate attempt by the oil giant to arbitrate the same issues
before yet another private forum. That dispute was to take place before the
American Arbitration Association in New York until it was permanently stayed by
a New York federal court in 2007. 

Chevron`s more recent arbitration filing was under a U.S.-Ecuador trade treaty,
but it is unclear if the company has a legal basis to proceed. Chevron`s legal
theory attempts to significantly expand the authority of the private arbitration
panel to decide issues that are pending in ongoing litigations elsewhere, a fact
which threatens to undermine human rights claims and the integrity of civil
justice systems worldwide, said Fajardo. 

If the latest arbitration attempt proceeds, a decision would be made by three
law professors or private lawyers paid hourly billing rates (usually $600 and
up) while maintaining their regular jobs. The arbitrators, who can generate
millions of dollars in fees for themselves in a single case, are not subject to
the rules of any public court, said Fajardo. 

Chevron is seeking an order from the arbitrators that it has "no liability" in
the environmental case based on a 1995 release the company obtained from
Ecuador`s government after what the company claimed was a limited environmental
clean-up. The plaintiffs assert that the clean-up was a sham and the release,
currently the subject of litigation in the Ecuador case, was obtained
fraudulently. 

In that case in Ecuador, now in its seventh year due to what the plaintiffs
assert are Chevron`s stalling tactics, the indigenous and farmer communities are
seeking remediation from pollution caused when Texaco (now Chevron) operated
several oil fields in the Amazon from 1964 to 1990. The lawsuit alleges Chevron
dumped billions of gallons of toxic "formation water" and abandoned hundreds of
unlined waste pits which still contaminate soils and groundwater. 

More than 1,400 excess cancer deaths in the region are related to Chevron`s
contamination, according to a Special Master appointed by the Court to assess
damages.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings takes various actions on J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage
Securities Corp., Series 2005-CIBC13 commercial mortgage pass-through
certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this
release. 

The downgrades are the result of Fitch's loss expectations and its prospective
views regarding cash flow declines and commercial real estate market values.
Today's rating actions are based on the full losses of 9.8% as a majority of
loans mature in the next five years. The bonds with Negative Outlooks indicate
classes that may be downgraded in the future. 

To determine potential defaults for each loan, Fitch assumed cash flow would
decline by 10% from year-end 2008. That is consistent with the analysis used in
its review of recent vintage transactions whereby cash flow was assumed to
decline 15% from year-end 2007 projected over a three year period. If the
stressed cash flow would cause the loan to fall below 0.95 times (x) debt
service coverage ratio (DSCR), Fitch assumed the loan would default during the
term. To determine losses, Fitch used the above stressed cash flow and applied a
market cap rate by property type, ranging between 7.5% and 10.0%, to derive a
value. If the loan balance at default is less than Fitch's derived value, the
loan would realize that amount of loss. These loss estimates were reviewed in
more detail for loans representing 45.9% of the pool and, in certain cases,
revised based on additional information and/or property characteristics. Loss
expectations attributed to loans reviewed in detail represent approximately
70.7% of the 9.8%. 

Approximately 93.5% of the mortgages mature within the next five years as
follows: 15.0% in 2010, 0% in 2011, 10.9% in 2012, 0% in 2013, 0% in 2014, and
67.6% in 2015. All losses associated with these loans are fully recognized in
the rating actions. 

Fitch identified 44 Loans of Concern (27.3%) within the pool, 18 of which
(18.3%) are specially serviced, five of which are current (3.4%). 

Fitch's analysis resulted in loss expectations for seven of the top 15 loans.
Four of which (14.0%) are assumed to default during the loan term, as the
stressed cash flow is below 0.95x DSCR. Three additional loans (10.0%) are
assumed to incur losses at maturity based on their balloon loan balance being
greater than the implied value of the properties. Fitch expects that eight of
the top 15 loans may default at maturity based on an insufficient accrued equity
position as calculated in Fitch's refinance test; however, Fitch's analysis did
not result in a loss for these eight loans based on its derived values being
higher than the current loan amounts. A loan would pass the refinance test if
the stressed cash flow would achieve a 1.25x DSCR as calculated based on a
30-year amortization schedule and an 8% coupon. 

The largest contributors to loss are as follows: DRA-CRT Portfolio I (6.9%), The
Shore Club (4.3%) and Osceola Village (0.7%). 

The DRA-CRT Portfolio I loan is collateralized by four office parks, consisting
of 16 buildings located across three states and four submarkets. The office
properties total 1.47 million square feet (sf) and are located in Orlando, FL,
Jacksonville, FL, Rockville, MD, and Charlotte, NC. The loan transferred to the
special servicer in November 2009 due to monetary default and is a loan of
concern due to its poor performance and delinquent status (90 Days). The
servicer reported September 2009 DSCR and occupancy were 0.95 times (x) and
approximately 75%, respectively. As the loan is in special servicing, Fitch
assumed losses prior to the loan's maturity in 2010. 

The Shore Club loan is collateralized by a 322-room lodging property located in
the South Beach area of Miami, FL. The loan transferred to the special servicer
in September 2009 due to imminent default. The special servicer is currently in
negotiations with the borrower and the loan is 90 days delinquent. The servicer
reported September 2009 DSCR and RevPAR were 0.69x and $183 compared to the
issuance DSCR and 2007 RevPAR of 1.34x and $284, respectively. As the loan is in
special servicing, Fitch assumed losses prior to the loan's maturity in 2010. 

Osceola Village is a 278 unit student housing property located in Tallahassee,
FL. The loan transferred to the special servicer in August 2007 and is now real
estate owned (REO). Significant losses are expected.

&lt;p&gt;Firm Commits $1 Million for Rescue and Recovery, Encourages Employees to Get
Involved 
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Following a devastating earthquake in Haiti this week that resulted in yet
untold casualties and severe infrastructure damage, JPMorgan Chase announced
today that it would commit $1 million to the relief and recovery of the country
and encourage employees to contribute to the rescue efforts. 

"Our deepest sympathies go out to the people of Haiti," said JPMorgan Chase CEO
and Chairman Jamie Dimon, who offered his condolences and the bank`s support to
Haitian Ambassador Raymond Joseph yesterday. "JPMorgan Chase is offering our
support today because a quick response following a disaster like this is
critical to saving lives. The American Red Cross, CARE and World Vision are
trusted organizations that are on the ground now and will be there to support
Haiti as they work through the aftermath." 

JPMorgan Chase will provide a total of $250,000 for urgent relief care from
humanitarian aid organizations The American Red Cross and CARE. This will assist
with efforts such as setting up temporary shelters, offering medical assistance,
helping with sanitation and handling the most pressing issues immediately
following the disaster. 

The bank will donate an additional $500,000 for future recovery and rebuilding
efforts, split between CARE, The American Red Cross and aid organization World
Vision. Exact allocations will be determined in the coming weeks following a
full assessment of the earthquake`s damage and the country`s needs. 

The bank also will encourage its more than 220,000 employees to contribute to
the relief efforts, matching up to a total of $250,000 of employee contributions
made to The American Red Cross or CARE via a special employee donation website.
Contributions eligible for the match must be made via the website. 

"The American Red Cross is rushing supplies and disaster management staff to
Haiti in the aftermath of this earthquake, and the generous contribution of
JPMorgan Chase is critical to our ability to provide help and hope for people
during their time of need," said Gail McGovern, President and CEO of the
American Red Cross. "We are grateful for this support of our humanitarian
mission." 

"This is an extremely serious situation. We currently have 133 personnel on the
ground in Haiti and are deploying additional staff immediately to distribute
food, hygiene kits and water, as well as to deliver emergency health services,"
said Helene Gayle, President and CEO of CARE USA. "We are extremely grateful to
JP Morgan Chase for this tangible expression of concern for the people of Haiti
in this time of dire need."

"Our deepest sympathies go out to the people of Haiti," said JPMorgan Chase CEO
and Chairman Jamie Dimon, who offered his condolences and the bank`s support to
Haitian Ambassador Raymond Joseph yesterday. "JPMorgan Chase is offering our
support today because a quick response following a disaster like this is
critical to saving lives. The American Red Cross, CARE and World Vision are
trusted organizations that are on the ground now and will be there to support
Haiti as they work through the aftermath." 

JPMorgan Chase will provide a total of $250,000 for urgent relief care from
humanitarian aid organizations The American Red Cross and CARE. This will assist
with efforts such as setting up temporary shelters, offering medical assistance,
helping with sanitation and handling the most pressing issues immediately
following the disaster. 

The bank will donate an additional $500,000 for future recovery and rebuilding
efforts, split between CARE, The American Red Cross and aid organization World
Vision. Exact allocations will be determined in the coming weeks following a
full assessment of the earthquake`s damage and the country`s needs. 

The bank also will encourage its more than 220,000 employees to contribute to
the relief efforts, matching up to a total of $250,000 of employee contributions
made to The American Red Cross or CARE via a special employee donation website.
Contributions eligible for the match must be made via the website. 

"The American Red Cross is rushing supplies and disaster management staff to
Haiti in the aftermath of this earthquake, and the generous contribution of
JPMorgan Chase is critical to our ability to provide help and hope for people
during their time of need," said Gail McGovern, President and CEO of the
American Red Cross. "We are grateful for this support of our humanitarian
mission." 

"This is an extremely serious situation. We currently have 133 personnel on the
ground in Haiti and are deploying additional staff immediately to distribute
food, hygiene kits and water, as well as to deliver emergency health services,"
said Helene Gayle, President and CEO of CARE USA. "We are extremely grateful to
JP Morgan Chase for this tangible expression of concern for the people of Haiti
in this time of dire need."

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, Jan 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Brands who can offer incentives to consumers are far more likely to be
successful in attracting and engaging them according to Reality Digital,
the leading provider of social network software for brands and businesses.

    Recent research from Razorfish Digital has shown that many consumers
choose to become part of a brand's community through social media outlets
in order to gain access to benefits. An overwhelming 44% responded that
they follow brands on Twitter for the deals and offers they could
receive, whilst 37% intimated a similar motive on Facebook.

    Reality Digital has indicated that it is brand incentives that are most
likely to get consumers connecting and talking about brands through
social networks. This could be in a number of forms, be it a competition
for prizes, discounts or giveaways. The implementation of an entire brand
focused social network also holds the potential for user generated
content contests, another strategy that will help give consumers a sense
of being valued by a brand whilst also giving them something in return.
Brands can benefit additionally from any materials and concepts created
as a result.

    Robert Proctor, Head of EMEA for Reality Digital, said: "Mobilising
current and potential consumers into a growing army of brand advocates is
undoubtedly a long process, but this can be aided significantly by
providing them with incentives. A great example of this was the Moonfruit
Twitter campaign of 2009.

    "Possessing an environment whereby consumers can interact, create brand
focused content and contribute to the community is an invaluable asset to
brands, and is why online community software such as Reality Digital Opus
is such a flexible platform for online marketing."

    Reality Digital Opus provides businesses with a comprehensive video
social network application complete with all of the latest engagement
tools to help them enhance their online presence through social media.
The community can be used as a focal point for an entire online marketing
campaign, acting as a hub for the distribution of content and engagement
of users.

series 3631 (PUTTERs) and a rating of 'AA-' to the derivative inverse tax-exempt
receipts, series 3631 (DRIVERs).

is extended or earlier terminated.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Acceleron Pharma, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company developing novel
therapeutics that modulate the growth of cells and tissues including red blood
cells, bone, muscle, fat, and the vasculature, announced that it has expanded
its development pipeline to seven molecules with the advancement of two novel
development candidates, which have been designated ACE-435 and ACE-661. 

"We are very excited by the discovery of ACE-435, which represents an entirely
different approach to treating metabolic disease," said Jas Seehra, Ph.D., Chief
Scientific Officer and Co-Founder of Acceleron Pharma. "In preclinical studies,
ACE-435 affects brown fat, resulting in reduced white fat mass and improvements
in numerous metabolic parameters. We are proud to be at the leading edge of
innovative metabolic drug development by targeting brown fat." 

ACE-435 is a novel protein therapeutic that inhibits signaling of members of the
TGF-beta protein superfamily. Unlike white fat, which is associated with obesity
and stores energy, brown fat is adipose tissue that burns calories to generate
heat and regulate body temperature. It was previously believed to exist only in
newborn humans and animals that hibernate or inhabit cold climates. However,
recent studies have discovered that brown fat also exists in adult humans and is
an attractive target for the treatment of various metabolic diseases. In
preclinical studies, obese animals treated with ACE-435 increased brown fat,
decreased white fat, increased skeletal muscle, and dramatically lowered
cholesterol and triglyceride levels. ACE-435 is being developed for the
treatment of metabolic disease. 

The second addition to Acceleron`s pipeline, ACE-661, is a novel anabolic bone
agent. ACE-661 inhibits members of the TGF-beta protein superfamily and blocks
two established pathways involved in bone formation. ACE-661 has demonstrated
profound activity in preclinical models and data will be presented at upcoming
scientific conferences throughout 2010. 

"Acceleron now has seven internally discovered programs in our pipeline that may
offer hope to patients with severe and life-threatening illnesses," said John
Knopf, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Acceleron Pharma. "We
are proud of our highly productive research, development and manufacturing
organizations that continue to generate such an unusually high number of novel
and promising therapeutics." 

About Acceleron 

Acceleron is a privately held biopharmaceutical company committed to discover,
develop, manufacture and commercialize novel biotherapeutics that modulate the
growth of red blood cells, bone, muscle, fat and the vasculature to treat
musculoskeletal, metabolic and cancer-related diseases. Acceleron`s scientific
approach takes advantage of its unique insight into the regenerative powers of
the TGF-&#946; superfamily of proteins. ACE-011 is currently being studied in two
Phase 2 clinical trials in cancer patients, in collaboration with Celgene
Corporation. ACE-031 is currently being studied in a Phase 1 clinical trial in
healthy volunteers and ACE-041 is being studied in a Phase 1 clinical trial in
patients with advanced cancer. In addition, the company is developing several
other new product candidates, including ACE-536, a novel blood-forming agent,
and ALKS-693, a long-acting TNF-inhibitor that has been partnered with Alkermes,
Inc. Acceleron utilizes proven biotherapeutic technologies and capitalizes on
the company`s internal GMP manufacturing capability to rapidly and efficiently
advance its therapeutic programs. The investors in Acceleron include Advanced
Technology Ventures, Alkermes, Bessemer Ventures, Celgene, Flagship Ventures,
MPM BioEquities, OrbiMed Advisors, Polaris Ventures, QVT Financial, Sutter Hill
Ventures and Venrock. For more information, visit www.acceleronpharma.com.

&lt;p&gt; * Says has been contacted by EU Commission&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says will cooperate fully, confident it is compliant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. drugs company Pfizer (PFE.N)
has been contacted by the European Commission about an antitrust
investigation into patent settlements between pharmaceutical
firms and generic drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Union's antitrust watchdog said on Tuesday it
had asked certain companies for copies of the settlements.
[ID:nLDE60B15S]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said on Thursday it was one of the firms involved,
and was confident its actions complied with competition and
patent laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will fully cooperate with the European Commission and
continue to partner with them to strengthen the competitiveness
of the pharmaceutical sector to benefit today's European
citizens and future generations," it said in a statement
released by its UK operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain's AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L),
France's Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) and Novartis (NOVN.VX) and
Roche (ROG.VX) of Switzerland have also said the Commission has
contacted them about drug patent settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Privately owned Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany's
second-largest drugmaker, also said it had received a
questionnaire from the Commission and was cooperating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tuesday's move followed a critical Commission report into
the pharmaceutical sector last July that promised action to end
delays in bringing less expensive generic drugs to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EU executive has pledged to pursue companies suspected
of anticompetitive behaviour after investigations revealed some
practices had cost healthcare providers about 3 billion euros
($4.4 billion) between 2007 and 2008.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Glide OS today announced the launch of GDrive, your private cloud storage
solution with 30 GBs of free storage. Users who want additional storage can
upgrade to Glide Premium now with 250 GBs for $50.00 a year or 20 cents per GB
per year. Store your photos, music, videos, documents, contacts, calendars and
bookmarks in your GDrive. There are virtually no restrictions on file types that
can be stored. 

GDrive can be accessed from Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris, Android, BlackBerry,
iPhone, Palm Pre, Symbian and Windows Mobile and over 100 mobile devices. Glide
OS provides sophisticated rights-based file management and sharing, file
synchronization and automated cross platform compatibility through device
recognition and file conversion technology for easy file sharing and
collaboration. Glide supports over 250 different file formats for automated file
conversion. 

Cloud Computing: The Glide Ad Free Alternative 

Consumers have unknowingly accepted a method of payment for online services they
believe to be free, effectively trading their personal information in exchange
for those services. 

"Your personal information is your most valuable asset, and protecting it has
been one of TransMedia's primary concerns in developing our cloud computing
approach from search to email, from file sharing and storage to web publishing,"
said TransMedia Chairman and CEO, Donald Leka. 

"TransMedia does not collect data on or from our users for the purpose of
selling targeted advertising. The Glide OS is an ad free alternative and
provides you with a truly private cloud." 

While certain leading online services are marketed to consumers as "free

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL and PLEASANTON, CA, Jan 14 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
In conjunction with IBM Lotusphere taking place next week in Orlando,
Fla., Polycom, Inc. (NASDAQ: PLCM), the global leader in telepresence,
video and voice communication solutions, today announced an expansion of
its integrated voice and visual communication solutions for customers
deploying IBM Unified Communication and Collaboration (UC2) environments
with support for Lotus Sametime and Lotus Notes. The combined solution is
designed to give users "one-click" access to on-demand voice and video
collaboration tools from within Lotus software applications that can
enhance teamwork, reduce costs, and help accelerate enterprise decision
making among colleagues, customers and business partners.

    "People are most effective when the communication and collaboration tools
they need are instantly available as part of the everyday workflow," said
Joe Sigrist, senior vice president and general manager of video solutions,
Polycom. "Polycom's integration with the IBM UC2 environment puts our
powerful, productivity enhancing collaboration tools just one-click away
within the applications that millions of people use every day to
communicate with others. This allows customers to extend the value of
their UC investment by adding scalable, standards-based telepresence,
video and voice collaboration capabilities that can further enhance
efficiency and reduce costs."

    The Polycom solution will allow users to "Click-to-Call" and
"Click-to-Conference" telepresence, video, voice and unified (combined
voice and video) conferencing from presence-enabled contacts within IBM
Lotus Sametime and Lotus Notes. In addition, Lotus Sametime Web
conferencing users will be able to launch Instant Meetings with voice and
video conferences, or include a voice or video conference as part of
scheduled web conference.

    The Polycom integrated solution will provide organizations with a
scalable, redundant, standards-based infrastructure platform for
rich-media conferencing within IBM UC2 environments. The solution will
feature integration with the latest release of Sametime Release 8.5, IBM
Lotus Sametime Server and IBM Lotus Domino Server, and provide seamless
call routing between the Lotus applications and Polycom immersive, room
and personal telepresence systems and desktop and conference room video
conferencing systems for point-to-point video calls, and the Polycom RMX
media conferencing platforms for multi-site voice, video or unified
conferences. The standards-based solution allows users to leverage
existing investments in visual communication systems for greater ROI and
provides a broad ecosystem of nearly two-million standards-based
telepresence and video conferencing systems in use today for extended
collaboration.

    This announcement expands existing integration that Polycom offers with
IBM UC2 and will complement the existing services offering between
Polycom and IBM Global Technology Services to deliver scalable,
security-enriched and highly-available unified communications solutions
to enterprise clients around the globe. Polycom is a sponsor and
exhibitor at Lotusphere 2010 (booth no. 611) and IBM is a Platinum
sponsor at the upcoming Polycom partner conference and sales event taking
place at the end of January.

    Polycom's integration efforts with IBM support Polycom's Open
Collaboration Network strategy, providing an open and interoperable
collaboration solution that gives customers greater flexibility and
investment protection for their UC environment. By working with IBM and
other leading unified communications platform providers, Polycom is able
to deliver its productivity-enhancing and cost-saving telepresence, video
and voice collaboration products as an integrated part of core unified
communication environments, making the technologies easily accessible as

&lt;p&gt;MINNEAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
U.S. Bank will increase the allowance it provides to FlexPerks Travel Rewards
Visa Signature card customers for airline fees in response to recent
announcements that some airlines are raising baggage fees again. 

Beginning January 20, when FlexPerks Travel Rewards cardholders redeem
FlexPoints for an airline award ticket they will also get a $25 allowance for
that trip to help pay for baggage, in-flight food and drink or other airline
fees. The innovative benefit, which was previously set at $20, was designed to
enhance the overall award travel experience and help drive home the notion that
free award travel should actually be free. 

U.S. Bank introduced FlexPerks in mid-2009 and in December was named the "Best
Credit Card if You Want Travel Perks" by Kiplinger`s Personal Finance. FlexPerks
enables customers to quickly earn points toward free flights - which can be
redeemed with as few as 20,000 FlexPointsSM for airline tickets valued up to
$400 on over 150 airlines with no blackout dates, capacity controls or e-ticket
booking fees. Cardholders earn one FlexPoint for each dollar spent, simply by
using their FlexPerks Travel Rewards card. Double FlexPoints are earned
automatically for gas, groceries or airline purchases - whichever is highest for
the customer during the month.

providers of payment processing, issuing and advisory services. RPS offers
credit, debit, and prepaid payment solutions to consumers and small businesses

CALCUTTA, India--(Business Wire)--
World football`s greatest prize is set to start the second leg of its biggest
ever global tour with a stop in India. Having visited 50 African nations,
travelling more than 72,000km, the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola
continues its five-continent journey to another 33 countries around the world. 

To date, nearly 200,000 fans across the African continent have attended the
Trophy Tour events and been given the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have

World Cup Trophy Tour celebrations, 37 heads of state have greeted the Trophy`s
arrival in their country, including Hifikepunye Lucas Pohamba, President of
Namibia, John Agyekum Kurfour, President of Ghana and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,
President of Liberia. 

Somali hip-hop artist K`NAAN will be performing his hit `Wavin Flag - Coca-Cola
Celebration Mix` at select FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour events giving fans an
exclusive live preview of the songwhich is the anthem of Coca-Cola`s 2010 FIFA
World Cup program. The African-inspired track will be widely used as the music
element throughout Coca-Cola`s FIFA World Cup marketing campaign. 

The tour, which began its journey from the FIFA Headquarters in Zurich,
Switzerland, September 21, 2009, will visit 83 countries travelling in total
138,902 kilometers (86,304 miles) or more than three times the circumference of
Earth. The Trophy Tour was developed through an exclusive partnership between
FIFA and Coca-Cola, a FIFA Partner and one of the organization`s
longest-standing corporate partners. 

"The response to the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola in Africa has been
incredible, we have been greeted by thousands of passionate fans who have
welcomed us to their countries and expressed their excitement and celebrations
at our events," said Emmanuel Seuge, group director, worldwide sports and
entertainment marketing, The Coca-Cola Company.

&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said it was
maintaining its outlook for oil and natural gas futures, with
U.S. crude CLc1 expected to average $90 a barrel in 2010 and
NYMEX natural gas futures NGc1 $6.00 per million British

natural gas is expected to average $6.50 per mmBtu.

 "We continue to expect improving developed market economic
growth during Q1 2010 on top of ongoing robust demand from
the emerging markets to lead to further upside for the more

in a research note dated Wednesday Jan. 13.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co reported deep losses on mortgage and credit card loans in the fourth quarter, damping hopes that consumer credit is on the mend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong investment banking results helped quarterly profit soar to $3.3 billion, topping Wall Street expectations. But analysts had been hoping for signs that the bank's credit costs were leveling off or even starting to fall, particularly for consumer loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consumer credit may be close to a bottom here, but it's not getting better, and people wanted JPMorgan to say it's getting better," said Ralph Cole, portfolio manager at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management, which owns JPMorgan shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losses at the second largest U.S. bank were in line with typically cautious guidance the bank had given in recent months but its projections for 2010 were hardly any more sunny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't know when the recovery is," Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call with investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the first of the major banks to report fourth-quarter numbers and its results may bode ill for competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank's overall quarterly profit amounted to 74 cents a share, beating analysts' average estimate of 61 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Year-earlier earnings were $702 million, or 6 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue, excluding the impact of assets that have been packaged into bonds and largely sold to investors, totaled $25.2 billion, falling short of analysts' average forecast of $26.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a graph on JPMorgan's results, see: link.reuters.com/gaz73h&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares fell 1 percent to $43.68. Shares of other major banks also fell, weighing on the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The logic is, as goes JPMorgan, so goes the rest of the banks," said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager and banking analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSUMER EXPOSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's large mortgage and credit card businesses have seen rising credit costs in the last year, offset only by record investment banking revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losses even on prime mortgages almost tripled to $568 million compared to a year earlier. The bank set aside a total of $4.2 billion to cover mortgage, home-equity and other consumer loan losses in the fourth quarter, up $653 million from the same quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, total credit losses excluding the impact of securitizations actually slipped to $7.8 billion from a high of $8.1 billion in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But much of that decline is due to a reduction in credit card losses related to a May offer allowing card customers to defer payments for a month. That deferral slowed the pace at which customers were delinquent at the end of last year, and pushes some customer defaults into the first quarter of 2010. Total credit losses were up 72 percent from the fourth quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan is the bellwether. It is the best, most well-capitalized, best-managed bank," said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Colonial Heights, Virginia. "You would hope they'd be the first bank to be able to begin the process of paring down loan loss reserves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's credit losses could indicate further trouble for Citigroup Inc, which reports quarterly results on Tuesday, and Bank of America Corp, which reports on Wednesday. Both banks have large consumer exposure. Bank of America shares fell 3 percent to $16.31, while Citi shares fell 1.4 percent to $3.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INVESTMENT BANK COMPENSATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For JPMorgan, which acquired investment bank Bear Stearns Cos in March 2008, investment banking profits helped mop up consumer and commercial losses, even though fixed income trading revenues fell from record levels in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit generated a fourth-quarter profit of $1.9 billion, compared with a loss of $2.4 billion in the same quarter a year earlier but down 1 percent from the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The profit was helped by JPMorgan setting aside less money than expected to pay its investment bank employees. For the year, compensation expense was just 33 percent of revenue, much less than the industry standard of 45 to 50 percent, contributing to the better-than-expected bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low compensation expense bamboozled even some of the most accurate analysts, as measured by Thomson Reuters StarMine. These analysts earlier this week expected earnings to be as much as 3.6 percent below the consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if compensation expense was lower than expected, JPMorgan is set to pay its banking staff handsomely. It set aside a record $9.3 billion to pay investment banking employees, even as executives appeared before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission this week to explain anticipated high bonuses and lack of loan growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's wholesale and consumer loan books shrank 22 and 11 percent respectively compared to the fourth quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who was named Banker of the Year by American Banker magazine in December, said he expects the bank to make more loans once the economy recovers. When pressed as to when he expects the recovery, he said, "There are some good signs out there, but we don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; additional reporting by Leah Schnurr, Clare Baldwin, Jonathan Spicer and Dan Wilchins; editing by John Wallace, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google's corporate network was hacked because its workers were running rival Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, a point that didn't escape the notice of security researchers and Web users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"More interesting than the IE zero-day, is why wasn't Google running Chrome?" asked Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security, shortly after Microsoft issued a security advisory that told users of a critical, unpatched bug in Internet Explorer (IE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday, Microsoft acknowledged that the IE exploit had been used in the attacks against Google and other major corporations. "We have determined that Internet Explorer was one of the vectors used in targeted and sophisticated attacks against Google and possibly other corporate networks," said Mike Reavey, director of Microsoft's Security Response Center (MSRC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the malware that Microsoft and others researchers have examined was designed to exploit IE6, the eight-year-old browser that's most often used with Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others, in addition to Storms, questioned why Google wasn't "eating its own dog food," the phrase used to describe software development companies running their own products, often in early editions long before they're made public. "I have to wonder, why the hell is Google using IE, and why IE6?" asked a Computerworld reader in a comment appended to a story on the IE bug. "In fact, why Windows-based servers? Eat your own dog food, Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Actually, it's the norm within companies, especially technology companies, for employees to run multiple browsers," said John Pescatore, Gartner's primary analyst on security subjects, noting that Google's workers may have, say, Chrome and IE on their machines. "But it's almost impossible for IE not to start up at some point during the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheri McLeish, a Forrester analyst who covers browsers, wasn't surprised by the fact that Google workers run IE, even the aged IE6. "I don't have first-hand knowledge of why Google is using IE6, but what's under the hood at enterprises isn't always best practices," McLeish said. "There are likely business reasons why Google runs IE, because if they were easily able to upgrade [to IE8], they would."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said, and independent researchers confirmed , that the exploits which struck Google would be largely deflected by IE7 and IE8, particularly the latter because it enables DEP (data execution prevention) by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What these attacks point to is the fact that a lot of companies are running IE6," McLeish said. "Microsoft wants to kill IE6, a lot of companies want to kill it. But they can't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As McLeish said, Microsoft has urged customers to upgrade from IE6 to newer editions of its browser. It kicked off a campaign last August when Microsoft's general manager for IE said, "Friends don't let friend use IE6." The efforts haven't been entirely successful. Last year, as users began switching to IE8, they were more likely to desert IE7 than the even older IE6. According to Web metrics company Net Applications, IE6 lost 38% of its usage share during 2009, but IE7 lost even more: It dropped by 56%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of IE's dominance in enterprises -- one recent estimate is that IE runs on 80% of corporate computers -- it remains a prime target, and exploits that leverage its vulnerabilities make ideal vectors for attacks against businesses, Pescatore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacks that exploited IE's unpatched flaw first came to light Tuesday, when Google announced that Chinese attackers had made off with intellectual property from its corporate network, and also tried to access the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Google said the attacks, along with increasing censorship of the Web by China's government, had prompted a reevaluation of its business in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at McAfee said their investigation showed that the attacks began in mid-December 2009 and stopped Jan. 4, 2010, when the hackers' command-and-control servers were taken offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google did not reply to a request for an explanation of why at least some of the company's workers use Microsoft's IE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government will have another month to seek an indictment against or reach a settlement with a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc programer accused of stealing trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas has delayed further proceedings to February 16 in the government's case against the former programer Sergey Aleynikov, court records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have accused Aleynikov of downloading stolen Goldman proprietary code onto a home computer, a theft that could cost the Wall Street bank millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government in a November filing indicated the case might be resolved with a deferred prosecution agreement or a misdemeanor plea, which could result in Aleynikov receiving no prison time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors often seek to postpone white-collar cases to engage in plea talks. Judges typically grant such requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A copy of the U.S. attorney's request for an extension was not immediately available. The request usually explains the status of communications between the parties. A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In typical deferred prosecutions, prosecutors agree to dismiss charges after a period of time, so long as defendants perform various requirements and do not break the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov has told investigators Goldman knew he had worked on the relevant code from home previously without complaint, and that he had no intent to steal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI arrested Aleynikov last July 3 at Newark Liberty International Airport. He was later freed on $750,000 bail following several days of detention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov worked at Goldman in New York for two years before joining Chicago-based Teza Technologies LLC in June. Teza suspended him following his arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Friday after JPMorgan Chase  Co reported deep fourth-quarter loan losses and raised concerns about bank profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a poor retail sales report earlier in the week, a weaker-than-expected Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers for early January hurt shares as consumer unease grew about incomes and unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first round of major quarterly earnings reports this week has been mixed, leaving investors uncertain about whether stocks can build on strong gains since March 2009. The Dow and SP 500 hit their highest levels in more than 15 months on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the first major bank to report quarterly results, announced heavy losses on mortgage and credit card loans, sending its shares down 2.3 percent to $43.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because JPMorgan is a bellwether and a very well-managed company, it definitely makes me pessimistic about the upcoming results from the sector," said Alan Lancz, president at Alan B. Lancz  Associates in Toledo, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other large banks also fell, including Bank of America Corp, down 3.3 percent to $16.26 and Wells Fargo  Co, off 3.1 percent to $20.08.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 100.90 points, or 0.94 percent, to 10,609.65. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index fell 12.43 points, or 1.08 percent, to 1,136.03. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 28.75 points, or 1.24 percent, to 2,287.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the week, the Dow ended down 0.1 percent, the SP fell 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq fell 1.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp, a Dow component and the world's largest chipmaker, late Thursday posted fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel shares fell 3.2 percent to $20.80 on Friday on what analysts said was profit-taking while a semiconductor index tumbled 3.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other data on Friday showed U.S. consumer prices rose modestly while industrial output rose, suggesting the economy was growing but not generating enough inflation to trouble the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CBOE Volatility Index, which can forecast risk, rose by nearly 7 percent at one point as expiration of January options approached. An analyst said the expiration had a downward influence on prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the New York Stock Exchange 1.41 billion shares changed hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 2.18 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 2.63 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 1.63 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a ratio of about 11 to 5, while on the Nasdaq nearly 7 stocks fell for every 5 that rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ryan Vlastelica; Editing by Kenneth Barry)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co reported deep losses on mortgage and credit card loans in the fourth quarter, damping hopes that consumer credit is on the mend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong investment banking results helped quarterly profit soar to $3.3 billion, topping Wall Street expectations. But analysts had been hoping for signs that the bank's credit costs were leveling off or even starting to fall, particularly for consumer loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consumer credit may be close to a bottom here, but it's not getting better, and people wanted JPMorgan to say it's getting better," said Ralph Cole, portfolio manager at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management, which owns JPMorgan shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losses at the second largest U.S. bank were in line with typically cautious guidance the bank had given in recent months but its projections for 2010 were hardly any more sunny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't know when the recovery is," Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call with investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the first of the major banks to report fourth-quarter numbers and its results may bode ill for competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank's overall quarterly profit amounted to 74 cents a share, beating analysts' average estimate of 61 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Year-earlier earnings were $702 million, or 6 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue, excluding the impact of assets that have been packaged into bonds and largely sold to investors, totaled $25.2 billion, falling short of analysts' average forecast of $26.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a graph on JPMorgan's results, see: link.reuters.com/gaz73h&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares fell 1 percent to $43.68. Shares of other major banks also fell, weighing on the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The logic is, as goes JPMorgan, so goes the rest of the banks," said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager and banking analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSUMER EXPOSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's large mortgage and credit card businesses have seen rising credit costs in the last year, offset only by record investment banking revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losses even on prime mortgages almost tripled to $568 million compared to a year earlier. The bank set aside a total of $4.2 billion to cover mortgage, home-equity and other consumer loan losses in the fourth quarter, up $653 million from the same quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, total credit losses excluding the impact of securitizations actually slipped to $7.8 billion from a high of $8.1 billion in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But much of that decline is due to a reduction in credit card losses related to a May offer allowing card customers to defer payments for a month. That deferral slowed the pace at which customers were delinquent at the end of last year, and pushes some customer defaults into the first quarter of 2010. Total credit losses were up 72 percent from the fourth quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan is the bellwether. It is the best, most well-capitalized, best-managed bank," said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Colonial Heights, Virginia. "You would hope they'd be the first bank to be able to begin the process of paring down loan loss reserves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's credit losses could indicate further trouble for Citigroup Inc, which reports quarterly results on Tuesday, and Bank of America Corp, which reports on Wednesday. Both banks have large consumer exposure. Bank of America shares fell 3 percent to $16.31, while Citi shares fell 1.4 percent to $3.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INVESTMENT BANK COMPENSATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For JPMorgan, which acquired investment bank Bear Stearns Cos in March 2008, investment banking profits helped mop up consumer and commercial losses, even though fixed income trading revenues fell from record levels in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit generated a fourth-quarter profit of $1.9 billion, compared with a loss of $2.4 billion in the same quarter a year earlier but down 1 percent from the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The profit was helped by JPMorgan setting aside less money than expected to pay its investment bank employees. For the year, compensation expense was just 33 percent of revenue, much less than the industry standard of 45 to 50 percent, contributing to the better-than-expected bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low compensation expense bamboozled even some of the most accurate analysts, as measured by Thomson Reuters StarMine. These analysts earlier this week expected earnings to be as much as 3.6 percent below the consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if compensation expense was lower than expected, JPMorgan is set to pay its banking staff handsomely. It set aside a record $9.3 billion to pay investment banking employees, even as executives appeared before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission this week to explain anticipated high bonuses and lack of loan growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's wholesale and consumer loan books shrank 22 and 11 percent respectively compared to the fourth quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who was named Banker of the Year by American Banker magazine in December, said he expects the bank to make more loans once the economy recovers. When pressed as to when he expects the recovery, he said, "There are some good signs out there, but we don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; additional reporting by Leah Schnurr, Clare Baldwin, Jonathan Spicer and Dan Wilchins; editing by John Wallace, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors sold shares globally and stepped up bids for safe-haven bonds and the U.S. dollar after JPMorgan  Co (JPM.N) reported deep losses on loans and its revenue fell short of Wall Street's expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results from the second-largest U.S. bank followed tepid U.S. data and a season of lackluster earnings that has kept alive worries about economic recovery in the United States and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New-York based JPMorgan reported a quarterly profit of 74 cents a share, a huge rise on the year earlier quarter. But its $25.2 billion revenue number was below estimates. Its shares fell more than 2 percent to $43.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equity gains were capped despite upbeat earnings from chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) late on Thursday. By the close of trade in New York on Friday world stocks .MIWD00000PUS had lost 0.9 percent, retreating further from 15-month highs hit earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European stock markets .FTEU3, which opened firmer on Intel results, reversed to end down 1.1 percent. Banks bore the brunt of selling. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei index .N225 rose about 0.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buoyant profit numbers for JPMorgan were overshadowed by loan losses and high bad-debt provisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan top-line (revenue) results were disappointing... There were pressures on credit-card lending and retail banking and it just shows the U.S. economy is far from out of the woods yet," said David Buik, partner at BGC Partners in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 100.90 points, or 0.94 percent, to 10,609.65. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.SPX slid 12.43 points, or 1.08 percent, to 1,136.03 and the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC declined 28.75 points, or 1.24 percent, to 2,287.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp (INTC.O), another Dow component, gave a bullish margin outlook on higher prices and firm demand for server chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geoff Lewis, head of investment services at JP Morgan Asset Management in Hong Kong, said corporate earnings alone will not lift markets for long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You still have to see continued good news on the economic front," he said. "Markets will want to see evidence of strength in private sector demand ... It's important the economy stand on its feet after the public fiscal stimulus starts to fade."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOLLAR, YEN, BONDS GAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. dollar rose broadly on Friday, helped by data showing a rise in manufacturing and stable consumer price inflation. Concerns about the struggling Greek economy weighed on the euro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts noted the string of reports released on Friday were mostly in line with expectations, showing some improvement in a regional manufacturing indicator and tame consumer prices. Meanwhile, a measure of U.S. consumer sentiment was little changed in early January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro, under pressure from worries over the struggling Greek economy and the growing public debt burden in some euro zone economies, slid 0.78 percent to $1.4389, compared with a previous session close of $1.4502.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar rose 0.59 percent to 77.186 .DXY. Against the yen the dollar fell 0.41 percent to 90.77 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Labor Department report showing consumer prices rose at a slower-than-expected pace in December helped fuel gains in U.S. Treasury securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dormant inflation favors long-dated bonds because inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments. Long maturities led the rally as dealers covered short positions after the Treasury's $13 billion 30-year bond sale on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note declined 0.06 percentage point to 3.68 percent, the lowest level since mid-December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Vivianne Rodrigues, Ellen Freilich and Angela Moon in New York; Editing by Kenneth Barry)&lt;/p&gt;

in private sector demand ... It's important the economy stand
on its feet after the public fiscal stimulus starts to fade."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DOLLAR, YEN, BONDS GAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. dollar rose broadly on Friday, helped by data
showing a rise in manufacturing and stable consumer price
inflation. Concerns about the struggling Greek economy weighed
on the euro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts noted the string of reports released on Friday
were mostly in line with expectations, showing some improvement
in a regional manufacturing indicator and tame consumer prices.
Meanwhile, a measure of U.S. consumer sentiment was little
changed in early January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The euro, under pressure from worries over the struggling
Greek economy and the growing public debt burden in some euro
zone economies, slid 0.78 percent to $1.4389, compared with a
previous session close of $1.4502.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar rose 0.59
percent to 77.186 .DXY. Against the yen the dollar fell 0.41
percent to 90.77 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Labor Department report showing consumer prices
rose at a slower-than-expected pace in December helped fuel
gains in U.S. Treasury securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dormant inflation favors long-dated bonds because inflation
erodes the value of fixed-income investments. Long maturities
led the rally as dealers covered short positions after the
Treasury's $13 billion 30-year bond sale on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note declined
0.06 percentage point to 3.68 percent, the lowest level since
mid-December.

H-P Joins Microsoft in the Clouds

Cloud computing is the new buzzword for big tech companies across the globe.
This new technology is opening up a plethora of business opportunities to tech
companies, while helping the end-user streamline their day-to-day workflow
without investing much on the hardware upgrade. 

Sensing the huge opportunities for growth in this segment, technology majors
Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ) and Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT)
have entered into a three-year agreement to jointly invest $250.0 million for
building an infrastructure model to enhance the application of cloud computing. 

Companies are expected to spend around $95.0 billion on cloud computing by 2011,
and another $160 billion is expected to be generated from end
consumer-applications, like mail and entertainment services offered by tech
companies like Google (Nasdaq: GOOG), Yahoo (Nasdaq: YHOO) and Apple (Nasdaq:
AAPL).

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Wall Street Brings It On Itself

We seem to have come a long way from this time last year, when Wall Street was
on its death bed in desperate need of a bailout. Storied brokerage houses such
as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch had disappeared altogether,
while many other household-name titans of finance such as Citigroup (NYSE: C)
and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) were deemed "too big to fail" and had to be
propped by the U.S. Treasury. 

The turnaround in the market from its March `09 lows and the subsequent economic
rebound has done wonders for Wall Street`s bottom lines. As a result, there is
talk of huge bonus payouts all over again. The top three firms -- Goldman Sachs
(NYSE: GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) are
reportedly planning to dole out billions in bonus payments. These companies say
that having paid back the TARP money already, they are no longer obliged to
restrict their payouts. 

President Obama`s announcement today of a new tax on banks, billed as the
"Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee," was just a matter of time, in my view. I
may be a tad cynical here, but the president`s choice to make this announcement
today may be related to get ahead of JP Morgan`s fourth-quarter earnings release
tomorrow. 

Given Wall Street`s popularity level amid a backdrop of over 10% unemployment in
the U.S., it makes perfect sense for the political leadership to beat up on
them. Wall Street`s inability to judge the public mood accurately is the most
surprising aspect of this whole episode, in my view.

&lt;p&gt;   * Peso, stocks hit by JPMorgan loan provisions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * IPC stock index sinks by most since late November&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Bonds pare gains after cenbank inflation caution
 (Adds closing stock prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEXICO CITY, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Mexico's peso slipped on
Friday and stocks fell by the most in more than 1-1/2 months
after JPMorgan's loan losses hurt hopes of a rebound in
consumer credit in the United States, Mexico's top trading
partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The peso MXN= MEX01 slipped 0.3 percent to 12.705 per
U.S. dollar while the IPC stock index .MXX lost 1.43 percent
to 32,262.3, its biggest one-day loss since Nov. 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mortgage and credit card businesses costs have been rising
at JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) in the last year. The bank said
it set aside $4.2 billion to cover mortgage losses in the
fourth quarter, up $653 million from the same quarter a year,
when the global credit crisis deepened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This makes you think that we are not out of the crisis
yet," said Carlos Alonso, a trader at brokerage Interacciones
in Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico, which sends around 80 percent of its exports to the
United States, is depending on a rebound in U.S. consumer
demand to recover from a deep local recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose broadly on Friday
after data showed a rise in manufacturing and stable consumer
price inflation in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other emerging market currencies were hurt more than the
peso, as news of economic recovery in the United States is seen
having a direct benefit for Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The dollar is strengthening due to a better performance of
the economy in the United States, which benefits Mexico," said
a trader in Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said the peso was likely to make a break toward its
recent 13-month highs near 12.50 next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Local bonds pared gains slightly after Mexico's central
bank warned it could raise interest rates if new taxes and
recent energy price hikes have a bigger impact on inflation
than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The yield on the government's benchmark 10-year bond
MX10YTRR, after bidding as low as 7.78 percent, bid at 7.80
percent, down 2 basis point from Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Mexican central bank left its benchmark interest rate
steady at 4.50 percent, saying weak economic growth would
dampen the effects of tax increases on inflation. For details,
see [ID:nN15113109]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank, however, said in its policy statement there was a
risk the tax hikes could broadly push consumer prices and
inflation higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market was expecting the statement to be a little more
soft," said Mario Correa, an economist at Scotiabank in Mexico
City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In stock trading, shares in America Movil (AMXL.MX), Latin
America's biggest cell phone provider, fell 1.85 percent to
29.66 pesos while miner Grupo Mexico (GMEXICOB.MX) gave up 2.54
percent to 30.66 pesos.

 (Updates to close)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Rodrigo Campos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Friday
after JPMorgan Chase  Co reported deep fourth-quarter loan
losses and raised concerns about bank profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following a poor retail sales report earlier in the week, a
weaker-than-expected Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of
Consumers for early January hurt shares as consumer unease grew
about incomes and unemployment. For details, see
[ID:nN15217547].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first round of major quarterly earnings reports this
week has been mixed, leaving investors uncertain about whether
stocks can build on strong gains since March 2009. The Dow and
SP 500 hit their highest levels in more than 15 months on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan (JPM.N), the first major bank to report quarterly
results, announced heavy losses on mortgage and credit card
loans, sending its shares down 2.3 percent to $43.68.
[ID:nN15183524].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Because JPMorgan is a bellwether and a very well-managed
company, it definitely makes me pessimistic about the upcoming
results from the sector," said Alan Lancz, president at Alan B.
Lancz  Associates in Toledo, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other large banks also fell, including Bank of America Corp
(BAC.N), down 3.3 percent to $16.26 and Wells Fargo  Co
(WFC.N), off 3.1 percent to $20.08.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 100.90
points, or 0.94 percent, to 10,609.65. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX fell 12.43 points, or 1.08 percent, to
1,136.03. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC lost 28.75 points,
or 1.24 percent, to 2,287.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the week, the Dow ended down 0.1 percent, the SP fell
0.8 percent and the Nasdaq fell 1.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intel Corp (INTC.O), a Dow component and the world's
largest chipmaker, late Thursday posted fourth-quarter results
that beat Wall Street forecasts. [ID:nN13151343].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intel shares fell 3.2 percent to $20.80 on Friday on what
analysts said was profit-taking while a semiconductor index
.SOXX tumbled 3.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other data on Friday showed U.S. consumer prices rose
modestly while industrial output rose, suggesting the economy
was growing but not generating enough inflation to trouble the
Federal Reserve. [ID:nN15217547]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, which can forecast risk,
rose by nearly 7 percent at one point as expiration of January
options approached. An analyst said the expiration had a
downward influence on prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the New York Stock Exchange 1.41 billion shares changed
hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 2.18
billion. On the Nasdaq, about 2.63 billion shares traded, above
last year's daily average of 1.63 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by
a ratio of about 11 to 5, while on the Nasdaq nearly 7 stocks
fell for every 5 that rose.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM's quarterly results should show a solid recovery in technology spending, but investors will likely want reassurance of stronger growth in 2010 before pushing its stock price much higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of International Business Machines Corp have risen almost 60 percent in the past year as the company sidestepped the worst of the downturn by cutting costs and shifting its business mix to more profitable services and software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not expect the kind of upside that we've had in the past," said Canaccord Adams analyst Peter Misek, who recommends holding the stock. "The sell-side in general, we over-estimated the impact of the recession and under-estimated IBM's ability to cut costs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analyst David Bailey held a similar view on IBM's results, which are due next Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we expect a solid December-quarter report from IBM, we do not think the results will serve as a major catalyst for the stock in either direction, given heightened expectations," he said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average expect IBM to report fourth-quarter revenue of around $27 billion, roughly flat from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit per share is seen rising to $3.47 from $3.27 a year earlier, with full-year earnings of $9.88. The company has forecast earnings of at least $9.85 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the main focus will be on IBM's 2010 outlook. Its last forecast was for earnings per share of around $10 to $11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi said he expects IBM to forecast "at least $11.00" for the full year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We note that IBM's playbook over the last two years has been to set achievable guidance and raise it," he said, citing IBM's record of beating consensus EPS in each of the last eight quarters and repeatedly raising guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMARTER PLANET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the global economic downturn certainly dented profit in 2009, IBM managed to weather the worst of the recession by reducing costs and shifting focus from hardware to IT software and services, which has helped bolster margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, it is the world's largest IT services provider. Technology outsourcing, automation and support are some of the areas that remained relatively strong during the downturn, as companies sought ways to improve cost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many analysts warned not to expect too much from Tuesday's results, there were some who believe IBM shares could still be bound for more gains, particularly if the global economic recovery turns out to be stronger than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sacconaghi, for example, has an "outperform" rating and $155 price target on the stock, which traded 0.5 percent lower at $131.62 late on Friday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key focus is corporate technology spending, which has lagged behind an upturn in the consumer segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some were also bullish about the company's longer-term strategies. Those include its "smarter planet" initiative, which aims to combine IBM's software and services with its budding analytics business, helping governments and companies like utilities run operations more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some analysts pointed to long-term risks as well, including the emergence of new rivals like Cisco Systems Inc in servers. While software and services account for a majority of the company's revenue, servers remain an key and integral part of its sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco announced last year that it was entering the server market, a move that put it in direct competition with IBM as well as Hewlett-Packard Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, for its part, has stepped up its partnership with Cisco's smaller rival, Juniper Networks Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MONTERREY, Mexico &amp; CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has upgraded the following credit ratings of Coca-Cola Femsa
S.A.B. de C.V. (KOF): 

--Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'A' from 'A-'; 

--Local Currency IDR to 'A' from 'A-'; 

In addition, Fitch has affirmed the following ratings for KOF: 

--National Scale long term rating at 'AAA(mex)'; 

--National Scale short term rating at 'F1+(mex)'; 

--Local Certificados Bursatiles at 'AAA(mex)'; 

The Rating Outlook for KOF is Stable. 

In conjunction with these rating actions, Fitch has upgraded and withdrawn the
following ratings of Corporacion Interamericana de Bebidas S.A. de C.V.(CIB): 

--Foreign Currency IDR to 'A' from 'A-'; 

--Local Currency IDR to 'A' from 'A-'. 

CIB was a subholding company of KOF for the $300 million notes that matured on
July 1, 2009. These notes were issued by Panamerican Beverages, Inc. (Panamco),
a company KOF acquired during May 2003. 

The rating upgrades reflect KOF's low leverage and increasing cash flow
diversification, which has reduced its dependence upon its Mexican operations.
The stability of the company's results during 2009 was also factored into the
rating upgrades. KOF's ratings continue to reflect its strong business position
and strategic relationship with The Coca-Cola Company (KO). 

The 'A' foreign currency rating of KOF exceeds Fitch's 'A-' Mexico country
ceiling rating due to KO's 31.6% ownership stake in KOF and KO's long history of
financially supporting its key bottlers. The geographic diversification of the
company's cash flows were also factored into the decision to rate the company
above the 'A-' country ceiling of Mexico. 

For the last 12 months (LTM) ended Sept. 30, 2009, KOF generated MXN19.2 billion
of EBITDA and MXN16.7 billion of funds from operations (FFO). These figures
compare with MXN17.1 billion of EBITDA and MXN12.7 billion of FFO during 2008.
The growth in EBITDA was primarily driven by volume growth of 8.1% and a
weakening of the Mexican peso versus the Brazilian real. The LTM EBITDA margin
as of Sept. 30, 2009 was 19.2%, a decline from 20.6% during 2008 and 20.8%
during 2007. Margins should remain under pressure as input costs are expected to
remain high in the following months, most significantly for sweeteners, as sugar
prices experienced a sharp rise during the second half of 2009. The integration
of the financial results of Brazilian bottler, Refrigerantes Minas Gerais, Ltda.
(Remil) during 2009, has also lowered margins as has the increase in concentrate
prices in Mexico. 

Since the Panamco acquisition in May 2003, KOF has reduced its total debt by
over USD1.6 billion and its net debt by close to USD2 billion. As of Sept. 30,
2009, KOF had MXN15.7 billion (approximately USD1.2 billion) of total debt and
MXN8.9 billion (approximately USD663 million) of cash. The company's leverage,
as measured by total debt-to-LTM EBITDA was 0.8x, an improvement from 1.1 as of
Dec. 31, 2008. Interest coverage remained high at 9.6x. Financial indicators
should continue to strengthen as the company continues to repay debt with
internally generated cash. 

Liquidity risk is manageable. KOF had MXN8.9 billion (USD663 million) of cash
and marketable securities as of Sept. 30, 2009 compared to short-term debt
obligations of MXN5.2 billion. During the next five years the company faces
annual debt amortizations no higher than MXN4.5 billion in a given year. During
the past five years its annual free cash flow has averaged MXN6.6 billion. 

Coca-Cola Femsa's debt profile is well-balanced between dollar- and
peso-denominated debt. At Sept. 30, 2009, KOF had 32% of its total debt
denominated in U.S. dollars, 55% denominated in Mexican pesos, 4.3% in Colombian
pesos, 7.9% in Argentine pesos and 1.1% in Venezuelan Bolivars. Given that the
company generates close to 50% of its EBITDA in Mexican pesos, the
peso-denominated debt eliminates a good portion of currency fluctuation risk.
The company has 55% of its debt at fixed rates and 45% at floating, with an
average cost of debt of 6.5%. 

KOF's main activity is the production, distribution and marketing of Coca-Cola
products in its franchise territories. With sales of over 2.1 billion unit cases
(UC) per year, KOF is the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Mexico and Latin America,
and the second largest in the world in terms of sales volume, representing 10%

 (Updates to afternoon, changes quotes, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Rodrigo Campos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid from 15-month
highs on Friday after JPMorgan Chase  Co reported deep
fourth-quarter loan losses that raised concerns about earnings
for the banking industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also weighing on stocks was consumers' caution about the
economy as reflected in The Reuters/University of Michigan
Surveys of Consumers. It showed preliminary sentiment was
weaker than expected in early January due to worries over
income and high unemployment. For details, see
[ID:nN15217547].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan (JPM.N), the first major bank to report quarterly
results, announced heavy losses on mortgage and credit card
loans, sending its shares down 2 percent to $43.81. Other large
banks also fell, including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), down 3
percent to $16.31 and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) off 3.7 percent
to $27.93. [ID:nN15183524].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even though the JPMorgan numbers were better than expected
on the earnings side, the revenues were slightly disappointing
to some people," said Robert Francello, head of equity trading
at Apex Capital in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said investors were also locking in recent gains before
a long weekend for U.S. markets, which will be closed on Monday
for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People have been reluctant to get extraordinarily long
before long weekends, especially with what's going on from the
sovereign risk perspective overseas," Francello said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors' appetite for riskier assets fell due to doubts
about Greece's fiscal health. European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said Greece must work out its own economic
problems. [ID:nLDE60E0JO].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI lost 137.70 points,
or 1.29 percent, to 10,572.85. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX fell 15.81 points, or 1.38 percent, to 1,132.65. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC dropped 33.24 points, or 1.43
percent, to 2,283.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow and the SP 500 hit their highest levels in more
than 15 months on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intel Corp (INTC.O), a Dow component and the world's
largest chipmaker, late Thursday posted fourth-quarter results
that beat Wall Street forecasts. [ID:nN13151343].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intel shares fell 2.9 percent to $20.86 on Friday on what
analysts said was profit-taking, and a semiconductor index
.SOXX tumbled 3.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other data on Friday showed U.S. consumer prices rose
modestly while industrial output rose, suggesting the economy
was growing but not generating enough inflation to trouble the
Federal Reserve. [ID:nN15217547]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CBOE Volatility Index .VIX jumped 5 percent as
investors adjusted their positions ahead of the monthly
expiration of January options, which expire after the close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The options expiration does have an influence on price and
creates more volatility, and this particular expiration has a
downside influence," said Frank Lesh, futures analyst and
broker at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The influential Subcommittee on Energy and Environment in the U.S. House of Representatives will hold a hearing into the ramifications for U.S. energy markets from the proposed merger OF Exxon Mobil Corp and XTO Energy Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon (XOM.N) Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson and Bob Simpson, chairman of XTO XTO.N, have been called to testify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee, which is chaired by Representative Edward Markey, could be considering a range of issues regarding the merger, including a controversial drilling technique used to tap oil and gas fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has said it can pull out of its $30 billion acquisition of XTO if U.S. lawmakers make hydraulic fracturing "illegal" or "commercially impracticable," according to the merger agreement filed by Exxon with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," injects a mixture of water, sand and chemicals into rock formations to stimulate production. Some environmental groups oppose the technique as unsafe and seek more regulation over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon plans to buy XTO Energy Inc in an all-stock deal and the combined companies will have 8 million acres of shale gas and other types of unconventional resources, the largest in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu said on Friday that fracking could be done in a way to remove oil or gas that would not harm the environment and suggested Congress should not outlaw the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it can be extracted in an environmentally safe way, then why would you want to ban it?" Chu told reporters. "I think it can be done responsibly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chu said companies should not use fracking in shale rock that is close to a water table or an unstable fault line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chu declined to comment on whether he was concerned a combined Exxon Mobil-XTO Energy would create a bigger company that might have too much control over U.S. oil and natural gas supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are companies that are big.

&lt;p&gt;Northwest Haiti Christian Mission Operates One of the Few Hospitals Not Damaged
by the Earthquake 
CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
EcoCanteen, Inc., an environmentally conscious distributor of re-useable
stainless steel water bottles, announced today their efforts to raise funds to
help one of the few remaining functioning hospitals in Haiti. 

Northwest Haiti Christian Mission operates and maintains the hospital and has
dispatched much of their medical staff to the Haiti Capital, Port-au- Prince to
assist with the overwhelming medical emergency in the wake of the recent
earthquake. 

One of Eco Canteen`s developers is a former Haiti missionary and worked with two
Northwest Haiti Christian orphanages and their hospital. Most of hospital staff
members raise their own financial support outside of the organization. So the
funding they get provides the maximum benefit. And in Haiti, a little money goes
a long way. Eco Canteen believes in this organization so much that its founders
have supported several of their missionaries and have contributed to their
medical program prior to this earthquake. 

Commenting on the fundraising efforts, EcoCanteen president Doug Hall said,
"When a disaster like this happens in the world, it is difficult to know how to
help. Do I donate food and water?Who do I donate to?I`ve found that great
results come from financially supporting groups that already have a local
infrastructure and know the land."

Thank You Gift with Donation

As a small token of appreciation, Eco Canteen is offering a gift of an adult Eco
Canteen stainless steel bottle to any individual making a donation of $75 or
more. A link to make donations is provided at www.StopDrinkingPlastic.org. Just
make a tax deductable donation of $75 or more online. Then simply forward the
donation confirmation email to Haiti@ecocanteen.org. and the individual will be
sent a 27 oz Eco Canteen. 

For more information about the Northwest Haiti Christian Mission and details for
the thank you gift, please go to www.StopDrinkingPlastic.org.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM's quarterly results should show a solid recovery in technology spending, but investors will likely want reassurance of stronger growth in 2010 before pushing its stock price much higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of International Business Machines Corp have risen almost 60 percent in the past year as the company sidestepped the worst of the downturn by cutting costs and shifting its business mix to more profitable services and software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not expect the kind of upside that we've had in the past," said Canaccord Adams analyst Peter Misek, who recommends holding the stock. "The sell-side in general, we over-estimated the impact of the recession and under-estimated IBM's ability to cut costs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analyst David Bailey held a similar view on IBM's results, which are due next Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we expect a solid December-quarter report from IBM, we do not think the results will serve as a major catalyst for the stock in either direction, given heightened expectations," he said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average expect IBM to report fourth-quarter revenue of around $27 billion, roughly flat from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit per share is seen rising to $3.47 from $3.27 a year earlier, with full-year earnings of $9.88. The company has forecast earnings of at least $9.85 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the main focus will be on IBM's 2010 outlook. Its last forecast was for earnings per share of around $10 to $11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi said he expects IBM to forecast "at least $11.00" for the full year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We note that IBM's playbook over the last two years has been to set achievable guidance and raise it," he said, citing IBM's record of beating consensus EPS in each of the last eight quarters and repeatedly raising guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMARTER PLANET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the global economic downturn certainly dented profit in 2009, IBM managed to weather the worst of the recession by reducing costs and shifting focus from hardware to IT software and services, which has helped bolster margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, it is the world's largest IT services provider. Technology outsourcing, automation and support are some of the areas that remained relatively strong during the downturn, as companies sought ways to improve cost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many analysts warned not to expect too much from Tuesday's results, there were some who believe IBM shares could still be bound for more gains, particularly if the global economic recovery turns out to be stronger than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sacconaghi, for example, has an "outperform" rating and $155 price target on the stock, which traded 0.5 percent lower at $131.62 late on Friday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key focus is corporate technology spending, which has lagged behind an upturn in the consumer segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some were also bullish about the company's longer-term strategies. Those include its "smarter planet" initiative, which aims to combine IBM's software and services with its budding analytics business, helping governments and companies like utilities run operations more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some analysts pointed to long-term risks as well, including the emergence of new rivals like Cisco Systems Inc in servers. While software and services account for a majority of the company's revenue, servers remain an key and integral part of its sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco announced last year that it was entering the server market, a move that put it in direct competition with IBM as well as Hewlett-Packard Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, for its part, has stepped up its partnership with Cisco's smaller rival, Juniper Networks Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * JPM risked less on commodities in Q4 and from year ago

 * Analysts says bank's risk management shows prudence
 (Adds table on historical commodities VaR of leading banks)

 NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
risked less on commodities trading in the fourth quarter of
2009, in what analysts described as a sign of prudence, despite
commodities ending the year with their best gains since 1973.

 The No. 2 U.S. bank said on Friday its value-at-risk for
commodities stood at $26 million in the fourth quarter, down 31
percent from the $38 million in the third quarter.

 A year ago, the figure was at $30 million.

 JPM, one of Wall Street's most-watched investment banks for
commodities, saw its VaR for commodities rise during the second
and third quarters of last year as markets from oil to metals
and agriculture rebounded from the financial crisis.

 The bank, which reported its fourth-quarter results on
Friday, also expanded its commodity trading operations during
that period, hiring four coal industry specialists in London.
[ID:nNN2831316]

 But it did not explain why the VaR fell in the fourth
quarter, even as commodity markets continued to rise to give
indexes, such as the Reuters-Jefferies CRB .CRB, some of
their best annual gains in 35 years. [ID:nLDE5BU0EW]

 At a glance, analysts said JPM appeared to have exercised
caution during the fourth quarter, although that was also
seasonally the time for profit-taking -- meaning less had to be
set aside for risk.

 "In any quarter, the numbers can jump around, but on the
overall, the business from a risk perspective seems to have
been managed in a very prudent way," said Michael Holland,
president at Holland  Co in New York.

 "This is certainly something to be watched for the future,"
he added.

 JPM Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh told
journalists after the release of the bank's results that he had
a cautious outlook for 2010. [ID:nLDE60E1IT]

 JPM, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported
better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit of $3.3 billion, or
74 cents a share, against analysts' expectations for 61 cents a
share profit. But losses from loans overshadowed the profit.
[ID:nN15183524]

 Typical of Wall Street investment banks, JPM did not break
down its commodities earnings. But it said revenue in fixed
income markets, which included commodities, rose to $2.7
billion in the fourth quarter from a loss of $1.7 billion a
year ago.

&lt;p&gt; * Peso, stocks hit by JP Morgan loan provisions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Bonds pare gains after cenbank inflation caution
 (Recasts, adds comments and background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Jan 15 (Reuters) - Mexico's peso slipped on
Friday and stocks fell after JPMorgan's loan losses hurt
confidence that there will be a rebound in consumer credit in
the United States, Mexico's top trading partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The peso MXN= MEX01 slipped 0.32 percent to 12.708 per
U.S. dollar while the IPC stock index .MXX lost 0.97 percent
to 32,410.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's large mortgage and credit card businesses have
seen rising credit costs in the last year. The bank said it set
aside $4.2 billion to cover mortgage losses in the fourth
quarter, up $653 million from the same quarter a year, when the
global credit crisis deepened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This makes you think that we are not out of the crisis
yet," said Carlos Alonso, a trader at brokerage Interacciones
in Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico, which sends around 80 percent of its exports to the
United States, is depending on a rebound in U.S. consumer
demand to recover from a deep local recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose broadly on Friday
after data showed a rise in manufacturing and stable consumer
price inflation in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other emerging market currencies were hurt more than the
peso, as news of economic recovery in the United States is seen
having a direct benefit for Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The dollar is strengthening due to a better performance of
the economy in the United States, which benefits Mexico," said
a trader in Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Local bonds pared gains slightly after Mexico's central
bank warned it could raise interest rates if new taxes and
recent energy price hikes have a bigger impact on inflation
than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After bidding as low as 7.78 percent, the yield on the
government's benchmark 10-year bond MX10YTRR bid at 7.80
percent, down 2 basis point from Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Mexican central bank left its benchmark interest rate
steady at 4.50 percent, saying weak economic growth would
dampen the effects of tax increases on inflation. For details,
see [ID:nN15113109]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank, however, in its policy statement said there was a
risk the tax hikes could broadly push consumer prices and
inflation higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market was expecting the statement to be a little more
soft," said Mario Correa, an economist at Scotiabank in Mexico
City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In stock trading, shares in America Movil (AMXL.MX), Latin
America's biggest cell phone provider, fell 1.89 percent to
29.65 pesos while cement maker Cemex (CMXCPO.MX) shed 1.64
percent to 14.95 pesos.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) on Friday announced a record $9.3 billion payday for its investment-banking employees, setting the stage for competitors like Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) to also make eye-popping payouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a per employee basis, JPMorgan investment bankers, sales staff and traders, on average, are set to make about $379,000 for 2009, up more than $100,000 from 2008, when the broader financial sector was mired in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People looking at it from the outside look at the dollars and say they are high," said Kenneth Raskin, the head of law firm White  Case's executive compensation practice. "There is no question the dollars are high. The question is whether they were deserving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Median U.S. household income in 2008 was $50,303.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Cavanagh, JPMorgan's chief financial officer, told reporters that even though pay is up overall, its investment bank still reduced the percentage of revenue that it set aside for pay, to 33 percent, from 62 percent for 2008 and historical averages of about 44 percent. Its investment bank had one of its strongest years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also expect Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which report their results next week, to show an upswing in pay. Citigroup Inc (C.N), however, could pay commercial and investment banking bonuses for 2009 that are similar to 2008 levels, sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks across the industry have changed their compensation plans to give managers more of their pay in the form of stock that must be held for multiple years. This sort of deferred compensation is meant to curb traders and others from taking short-term risks that could harm the investment bank several years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in compensation plans, however, have done little to bring down overall pay figures and quell public outrage over pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that the top 38 U.S. banks and securities firms are on pace to pay their people $145 billion, based the newspaper's analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public anger over banker pay led the New York Times to call on Congress to pass a one-off windfall tax on banker bonuses. Britain plans a one-time tax of half of banker bonuses above 25,000 pounds ($40,675).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks, which now face President Obama's bailout tax, have so far been successful in beating back other reforms, including plans for a consumer protection regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resistance of the banking industry to roll back pay is infuriating and short-sighted to some, especially with high unemployment and people losing homes to foreclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These people need some perspective on where we are and what they have done," said Cornelius Hurley, director of the Morin Center for Banking and Financial Law at Boston University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay, Clare Baldwin, and Dan Wilchins; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

after JPMorgan Chase  Co reported deep fourth-quarter loan
losses that raised concerns about earnings for the banking
industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan (JPM.N), the first major bank to report quarterly
results, shed 2 percent to $43.78 while other banks, scheduled
to announce results next week, also fell. Bank of America Corp

loser among SP sectors, down 2.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also weighing on stocks was the Reuters/University of
Michigan Surveys of Consumers, which showed preliminary
sentiment was little changed in early January as worries over
income and high unemployment offset news of an improving
economy. For details, see [ID:nN15147344].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intel Corp (INTC.O), another Dow component and the world's

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 15 (Reuters) - Overseas shares traded in the
United States dipped on Friday, weighed by consumer sentiment
figures that fell short of expectations and a decline in
banking shares after JPMorgan's results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Bank of New York Mellon index of leading American
Depositary Receipts (ADRs) .BKADR was down 1.9 percent by
midday, while the U.S. benchmark SP 500 index .SPX fell 1.5

loans continued to rise in the fourth quarter. For details, see

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday after U.S. consumer sentiment figures fell short of expectations and JPMorgan (JPM.N) loan losses overshadowed higher fourth-quarter profit, with banks in Europe weighing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top shares closed down 1.1 percent at 1,052.24 points.

However, quarterly profit soared to $3.3 billion, topping expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) and UBS (UBSN.VX) slipped 2.7 to 4.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy stocks fell as crude prices retreated 1.3 percent.

with bank shares leading the way, after JPMorgan Chase  Co
reported deep fourth-quarter loan losses that raised concerns
about earnings for the pivotal industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan fell 1.6 percent to $43.98, and other banks,

&lt;p&gt; * Compensation figures higher than boom years in industry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Other banks could follow lead, despite outrage on pay
 (Adds link to graph of JPMorgan compensation)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) on
Friday announced a record $9.3 billion payday for its
investment-banking employees, setting the stage for competitors
like Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) to also make eye-popping
payouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a per employee basis, JPMorgan investment bankers, sales
staff and traders, on average, are set to make about $379,000
for 2009, up more than $100,000 from 2008, when the broader
financial sector was mired in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People looking at it from the outside look at the dollars
and say they are high," said Kenneth Raskin, the head of law
firm White  Case's executive compensation practice. "There is
no question the dollars are high. The question is whether they
were deserving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Median U.S. household income in 2008 was $50,303.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a graf on JPMorgan compensation, please see:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; link.reuters.com/jud83h&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Cavanagh, JPMorgan's chief financial officer, told
reporters that even though pay is up overall, its investment
bank still reduced the percentage of revenue that it set aside
for pay, to 33 percent, from 62 percent for 2008 and historical
averages of about 44 percent. Its investment bank had one of
its strongest years. [ID:nN15183524]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts also expect Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and
Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which report their results next week, to
show an upswing in pay. Citigroup Inc (C.N), however, could pay
commercial and investment banking bonuses for 2009 that are
similar to 2008 levels, sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks across the industry have changed their compensation
plans to give managers more of their pay in the form of stock
that must be held for multiple years. This sort of deferred
compensation is meant to curb traders and others from taking
short-term risks that could harm the investment bank several
years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Changes in compensation plans, however, have done little to
bring down overall pay figures and quell public outrage over
pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that the top 38
U.S. banks and securities firms are on pace to pay their people
$145 billion, based the newspaper's analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The public anger over banker pay led the New York Times to
call on Congress to pass a one-off windfall tax on banker
bonuses. Britain plans a one-time tax of half of banker bonuses
above 25,000 pounds ($40,675).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks, which now face President Obama's bailout tax, have
so far been successful in beating back other reforms, including
plans for a consumer protection regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The resistance of the banking industry to roll back pay is
infuriating and short-sighted to some, especially with high
unemployment and people losing homes to foreclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These people need some perspective on where we are and
what they have done," said Cornelius Hurley, director of the
Morin Center for Banking and Financial Law at Boston
University.

reported deep fourth-quarter loan losses that raised concerns
about earnings for the pivotal industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan fell 1.6 percent to $43.98, and other banks,
scheduled to start reporting results next week, also fell. Bank
of America Corp lost 2.7 percent to $16.37 and Wells Fargo  Co was off 2.8 percent to $28.16. For details, see
ID:nN15183524&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The logic is, as goes JPMorgan, so goes the rest of the
banks," said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager and banking
analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also weighing on stocks was a survey showing that U.S.
consumer sentiment was little changed in early January as
worries over income and high unemployment offset news of an
improving economy. For details, see ID:nN15147344&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 107.77
points, or 1.01 percent, at 10,603.00. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX fell 12.64 points, or 1.10 percent, at
1,135.82. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC shed 25.61 points,
or 1.11 percent, at 2,291.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intel Corp, another Dow component and the world's largest
chipmaker, late Thursday posted fourth-quarter results that
beat Wall Street forecasts. It also gave a bullish margin
outlook on higher prices and firm demand for server chips. The
stock fell 2 percent to $21.05. ID:nN13151343&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Intel had a great quarter and now people are using the
results as an excuse to take some profits since it's up big for
the year so far," said Bennett Gaeger, managing director at
Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Data on U.S. consumer prices, also released Friday, showed
a modest rise last month while a cold snap lifted industrial
output, suggesting the economy was growing but not generating
enough inflation to trouble the Federal Reserve. ID:nN15217547&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Office supplies retailers advanced after JPMorgan analysts
upgraded both OfficeMax and Staples Inc to "overweight" from
"neutral," citing their "high correlation to modestly improving
labor markets." OfficeMax surged 8.8 percent to $15.06 and
Staples was up 1.7 percent at $25.43. ID:nSGE60E0G4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Congressional Democrats closed in on a final deal on a
landmark U.S. healthcare overhaul on Friday, but negotiators
still must resolve thorny issues on how to pay for the plan,
and the structure of the new insurance exchanges created under
the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor index .HMO rose 0.2
percent, while the SP Healthcare index .GSPA lost 0.7
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. stock markets are closed on Monday for the Martin
Luther King Jr. Day holiday.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By David Brett&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Britain's top share index ended
0.8 percent lower on Friday, echoing falls on Wall Street after
disappointing U.S. data weighed on sentiment with miners and
banks, spearheads of the recent recovery, the heaviest fallers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FTSE 100 .FTSE closed down 42.83 points at 5,455.37,
but the index remains 57 percent higher since its six-year
trough in March 2009, and up 0.8 percent so far in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the United States, the SP 500 .GSPC and Dow Jones
.DJI were around 1 percent lower as the British market closed,
after a survey showed consumer sentiment stalled in early
January. [ID:nN15147344]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The figures stateside were certainly sobering for the
markets given how far we have come and it has given those
investors looking for a opportunity to sell a reason to do so,"
said Jimmy Yates, head of equities at CMC Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank shares dipped as JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) reported
deep fourth-quarter losses on mortgage and credit card loans.
[ID:nN15183524]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays (BARC.L), HSBC (HSBA.L), Standard Chartered

said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America (BAC.N), Citigroup (C.N), Morgan Stanley

concerns. Antofagasta (ANTO.L), Anglo American (AAL.L), Vedanta
Resources (VED.L), Lonmin (LMI.L) and Kazakhmys (KAZ.L) shed
0.6-2.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pharmaceuticals surrendered some gains posted in the
previous session with heavyweight GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L)
falling 2.6 percent as Belgium cut its order for the company's
swine flu vaccine Pandemrix by a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peers AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and Shire (SHP.L) lost 0.7 percent
and 1.5 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In individual issues, hedge fund company Man Group (EMG.L)

flagship AHL fund saw $1.2 billion in performance losses in the
three months to December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heavyweight mobile phone network operator Vodafone (VOD.L)

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DEFENSIVES RALLY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the appetite for risk firmly took a back seat, defensive
issues came to the fore with tobacco, supermarkets and energy

Imperial Tobacco (IMT.L) gained 2.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Supermarkets, which have enjoyed robust Christmas trading
data of late, were also higher. Sainsbury (SBRY.L) and Tesco
(TSCO.L) added 0.3 percent and 0.8 percent respectively, while
Wm Morrison Supermarkets (MRW.L), yet to report, rose 1.1
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Power IPR.L was up 4.1 percent, topping
Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE gainers, with traders citing renewed
speculation that French power generator GDF Suez (GSZ.PA) was
planning a takeover.

&lt;p&gt; * Bank pays $9.3 bln compensation to investment bank&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Compensation figures higher than boom years in industry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Other banks could follow lead, despite outrage on pay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) on
Friday announced a record $9.3 billion payday for its
investment-banking employees, setting the stage for competitors
like Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) to also make eye-popping
payouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a per employee basis, JPMorgan investment bankers, sales
staff and traders, on average, are set to make about $379,000
for 2009, up more than $100,000 from 2008, when the broader
financial sector was mired in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People looking at it from the outside look at the dollars
and say they are high," said Kenneth Raskin, the head of law
firm White  Case's executive compensation practice. "There is
no question the dollars are high. The question is whether they
were deserving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Median U.S. household income in 2008 was $50,303.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Cavanagh, JPMorgan's chief financial officer, told
reporters that even though pay is up overall, its investment
bank still reduced the percentage of revenue that it set aside
for pay, to 33 percent, from 62 percent for 2008 and historical
averages of about 44 percent. Its investment bank had one of
its strongest years. [ID:nN15183524]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts also expect Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and
Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which report their results next week, to
show an upswing in pay. Citigroup Inc (C.N), however, could pay
commercial and investment banking bonuses for 2009 that are
similar to 2008 levels, sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks across the industry have changed their compensation
plans to give managers more of their pay in the form of stock
that must be held for multiple years. This sort of deferred
compensation is meant to curb traders and others from taking
short-term risks that could harm the investment bank several
years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Changes in compensation plans, however, have done little to
bring down overall pay figures and quell public outrage over
pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that the top 38
U.S. banks and securities firms are on pace to pay their people
$145 billion, based the newspaper's analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The public anger over banker pay led the New York Times to
call on Congress to pass a one-off windfall tax on banker
bonuses. Britain plans a one-time tax of half of banker bonuses
above 25,000 pounds ($40,675).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks, which now face President Obama's bailout tax, have
so far been successful in beating back other reforms, including
plans for a consumer protection regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The resistance of the banking industry to roll back pay is
infuriating and short-sighted to some, especially with high
unemployment and people losing homes to foreclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These people need some perspective on where we are and
what they have done," said Cornelius Hurley, director of the
Morin Center for Banking and Financial Law at Boston
University.

&lt;p&gt; * JPM risked less on commodities in Q4 and from year ago

 * Analysts says bank's risk management shows prudence

 NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
risked less on commodities trading in the fourth quarter of
2009, in what analysts described as a sign of prudence, despite
commodities ending the year with their best gains since 1973.

 The No. 2 U.S. bank said on Friday its value-at-risk for
commodities stood at $26 million in the fourth quarter, down 31
percent from the $38 million in the third quarter.

 A year ago, the figure was at $30 million.

 JPM, one of Wall Street's most-watched investment banks for
commodities, saw its VaR for commodities rise during the second
and third quarters of last year as markets from oil to metals
and agriculture rebounded from the financial crisis.

 The bank, which reported its fourth-quarter results on
Friday, also expanded its commodity trading operations during
that period, hiring four coal industry specialists in London.
[ID:nNN2831316]

 But it did not explain why the VaR fell in the fourth
quarter, even as commodity markets continued to rise to give
indexes, such as the Reuters-Jefferies CRB .CRB, their best
annual gains since 1973. [ID:nLDE5BU0EW]

 At a glance, analysts said JPM appeared to have exercised
caution during the fourth quarter, although that was also
seasonally the time for profit-taking -- meaning less had to be
set aside for risk.

 "In any quarter, the numbers can jump around, but on the
overall, the business from a risk perspective seems to have
been managed in a very prudent way," said Michael Holland,
president at Holland  Co in New York.

 "This is certainly something to be watched for the future,"
he added.

 JPM Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh told
journalists after the release of the bank's results that he had
a cautious outlook for 2010. [ID:nLDE60E1IT]

 JPM, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported
better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit of $3.3 billion, or
74 cents a share, against analysts' expectations for 61 cents a
share profit. But losses from loans overshadowed the profit.
[ID:nN15183524]

 Typical of Wall Street investment banks, JPM did not break
down its commodities earnings. But it said revenue in fixed
income markets, which included commodities, rose to $2.7
billion in the fourth quarter from a loss of $1.7 billion a
year ago.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 15 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday
after U.S. consumer sentiment figures fell short of expectations

quarter profit, with banks in Europe weighing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top

September 2009, but it fell short of analysts' median
expectation of a reading of 73.9, according to a recent Reuters

Friday, weighed by banking stocks after disappointing results
from JPMorgan Chase  Co set a gloomy tone for the coming
week's earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan (JPM.N), the second-largest U.S. bank by assets,
posted revenue that fell short of Wall Street's forecast,
raising concerns about the industry and pulling lower shares of
rivals Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stocks extended losses after a survey showed U.S. consumer
sentiment was little changed in early January, as worries over
income and high unemployment offset news of an improving
economy. For details, see [ID:nN15147344]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People are looking for more growth in the economy, and the

$28.36. Those banks are scheduled to begin reporting quarterly
earnings next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JPMorgan is the bellwether, (and) you would hope they'd be
the first bank to be able to begin the process of paring down
loan loss reserves," said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris
Financial Group in Colonial Heights, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP Financial Index .GSPF lost 1.8 percent, the worst
performing sector in the index, while the KBW Bank Index .BKX
shed 2.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intel Corp (INTC.O), another Dow component and the world's

and identifying the internal and external factors that are favorable and
unfavorable to achieving that objective. 

The aim of any SWOT analysis is to identify the key internal and external
factors that are important to achieving the objective. SWOT analysis groups key
pieces of information into two main categories: Internal factors - The strengths
and weaknesses internal to the organization. External factors - The
opportunities and threats presented by the external environment. 

The internal factors may be viewed as strengths or weaknesses depending upon
their impact on the organization's objectives. What may represent strengths with
respect to one objective may be weaknesses for another objective. The factors
may include all of the 4Ps, as well as personnel, finance, manufacturing
capabilities, and so on. The external factors may include macroeconomic matters,
technological change, legislation, and socio-cultural changes, as well as
changes in the marketplace or competitive position. The results are often
presented in the form of a matrix. 

SWOT analysis is just one method of categorization and has its own weaknesses.
For example, it may tend to persuade companies to compile lists rather than
think about what is really important in achieving objectives. It also presents
the resulting lists uncritically and without clear prioritization so that, for
example, weak opportunities may appear to balance strong threats.

SWOT Analysis, is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strengths,

unfavorable to achieving that objective.

&lt;p&gt; * Q4 wealth management revenue flat at $331 mln&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, North Carolina Jan 15 (Reuters) - JPMorgan
Chase  Co's (JPM.N) private bank reported a 15 percent rise in
fourth-quarter revenue as rallying markets boosted fees from
ultra-rich clients, but wealth management revenue from the
merely affluent was flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-largest U.S. bank reported $723 million in
private banking revenue, up from $630 million a year earlier,
reflecting a robust rally in stocks from the near collapse of
global financial markets in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said its wealth management business generated
revenue of $331 million, little changed from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank, which reported fourth-quarter results Friday, did
not provide details on client assets or break down sources of
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue from Bear Stearns Private Client Services, a more
traditional brokerage business with about 385 advisers, rose 6
percent to $112 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan was the first major U.S. bank to report
fourth-quarter results. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Morgan
Stanley (MS.N), Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) and others are
scheduled to report next week.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Jan 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Passengers aboard non-commercial aircraft bringing aid to and evacuating
people from Haiti that are making a technical stop or transiting through
Canada's airports temporarily will not require a visa, Citizenship,
Immigration and Multiculturalism Minister Jason Kenney announced today.

    "The devastation caused from Tuesday's earthquake has created an urgent
need for help and to be flexible," said Minister Kenney. "We are doing
what we can to facilitate the travel of those affected by the
humanitarian crisis in Haiti."

    Yesterday Minister Kenney agreed to exempt foreign nationals who are
directly responding to, or affected by, the humanitarian situation in
Haiti and will transit through Canada on a non-commercial aircraft for
the sole purpose of refuelling and/or making a technical stop from the
requirement to obtain a temporary resident visa. This measure will be in
place temporarily.

    Yesterday, one flight from China transited through Vancouver
International Airport returning from Haiti. At Gander International
Airport, a flight from Russia refuelled en route to Haiti. In the days
and weeks ahead, this special measure will serve to help more aircraft to
refuel or make technical stops in Canada on their way to or from Haiti.

    "This government is looking at other ways to provide assistance to the
victims of this tragedy," said Minister Kenney. "We will provide regular
updates on our efforts in the coming days."

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has no plans to pull out of China, its chief executive said on Thursday, playing down concerns about recent cyber-attacks and censorship raised by rival Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's stance indicates the world's largest software maker is not likely to support its fierce rival in its battle with China and rebuffs broad U.S. political backing for Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are attacks every day. I don't think there was anything unusual, so I don't understand," Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer told Reuters after a meeting on modernizing government services at the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're attacked every day from all parts of the world and I think everybody else is too. We didn't see anything out of the ordinary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Google threatened to pull out of China -- the world's biggest Internet market by users -- citing censorship and cyber-attacks on rights activists' email accounts there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google claimed more than 20 other large companies had been the target of cyber-attacks originating in China, but Microsoft has said it has no evidence any of its e-mail services or corporate networks being specifically attacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if Microsoft had any plan to pull its business out of China, Ballmer answered "No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't understand how that helps anything. I don't understand how that helps us and I don't understand how that helps China," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has high hopes for its Bing Internet search engine in China, which has only a small share of the market, but could benefit if Google, the No. 2 player behind dominating local rival Baidu Inc, pulls out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer's comments run counter to broad political support for Google. The White House said on Thursday it is backing Google's decision to no longer support China's censoring of searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of Republican lawmakers on Thursday called for tech heavyweights Cisco Systems Inc, Yahoo Inc and Microsoft to speak out against censorship, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged tech companies on Wednesday not to assist China's attempts to prohibit free exchange of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by John Poirier in Washington, Bill Rigby in Seattle; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Harpreet Bhal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - European shares turned negative
by midday on Friday, reversing a three-session gaining run,
pressured by weakness in banks as investors sentiment soured
after U.S. bank JPMorgan (JPM.N) reported earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 1241 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top
European shares was down 0.2 percent at 1,061.63 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks took the most points off the index, with Barclays
(BARC.L), BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and
Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) falling 0.6 to 1.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan posted net income of $3.3 billion, or $0.74 per

head of quantitative sales trading at global equities in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors had earlier drawn support from strong earnings

(TSCO.L), Sainsbury (SBRY.L) and Morrison (MRW.L) which were up
0.2 to 1.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among individual movers, hedge fund firm Man Group (EMG.L)
fell 5.7 percent on Friday after it said assets under management
fell 4 percent to $42.4 billion in the three months to December
due to losses from its underperforming flagship fund AHL and
client outflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier, data showed that more expensive fuel drove euro
zone consumer prices higher in December as expected, but core
inflation remained flat, indicating that any headline price
rises will be subdued over the coming months. [ID:nLDE60E0MN]

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Simon Falush&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Britain's top share index
retreated on Friday, weighed by weakness in pharmaceuticals and
Vodafone (VOD.L), as firm results from Wall Street bank JPMorgan
Chase  Co (JPM.N) failed to cheer investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 1246 GMT, the FTSE 100 .FTSE was down 10.20 points at
5,488.00 after it closed 24.72 points, or 0.5 percent higher on

share on revenue of $25.2 billion in the fourth-quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the results beat earlier market expectations, some

and Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) fell 0.2 to 1.5 percent,
though Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) added 3.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pharmaceuticals were the biggest drag on the index with
heavyweight GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) falling 1.9 percent as
Belgium cut its order for the company's swine flu vaccine
Pandemrix by a third. [ID:nLDE60E0JF]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peer AstraZeneca (AZN.L) fell 0.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, overall investors were still in wait-and-see mode,
after the JPMorgan results failed to give the market much
direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a case of waiting to see how the year to pans out, for
now its a case of drift, there's a bit of worry as some
companies which produce strong reports weaken," said Tim Rees,
fund manager at Insight Investment Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hedge fund company Man Group (EMG.L) was the biggest
blue-chip loser, down 5.9 percent after its flagship AHL fund
saw $1.2 billion in performance losses in the three months to
December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heavyweight mobile phone network operator Vodafone was a
significant drag on the index, down 1 percent, with earnings
estimates cuts by UBS one factor impacting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But other defensive stocks, like supermarkets and tobacco
firms lent the index support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sainsbury (SBRY.L) and Tesco (TSCO.L) added 1 and 0.1
percent respectively while British American Tobacco (BATS.L)
added 0.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the JPMorgan earnings out of the way, investors will
watch U.S. inflation numbers, due at 1330 GMT, with consumer
prices seen rising 0.2 percent on the month, after a 0.4 percent
increase in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Year-on-year U.S. consumer prices are seen up 2.8 percent
last month, up from a 1.8 percent increase in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; January's Empire State index will also be released at 1330

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase  Co, the second largest U.S. bank by assets, reported fourth-quarter profit jumped to $3.3 billion from $702 million in the previous year, helped by strong results from its investment bank unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank reported a quarterly profit of 74 cents a share, compared to 6 cents a share in the year earlier quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bank reported revenue of $25.2 billion in the fourth quarter, below analysts forecasts, and shares fell nearly 2 percent in early trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average expected a profit of 61 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GARY TOWNSEND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, HILL-TOWNSEND CAPITAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In general it looks like a pretty strong report and clearly most of their businesses are doing pretty well. The weakness appears to have been in their retail banking operation, more specifically in their consumer lending, where rates of charge-offs on credit card, home equity and prime mortgage remain quite elevated. They say that there are some signs of stability in consumer delinquency trends but they worry that the trends won't continue and it will be interesting to hear in the commentary whether they think the overall levels of provisioning will be declining from here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have built a very large, perhaps unprecedented allowance for loan loss. It's five and a half percent of total assets so that would seem to be quite robust to cover future losses, but we'll hear what they say. They will undoubtedly continue to reserve -- it's a question of the rate going forward, and much of that depends on the direction of the economy, which is outside of their control."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JAMIE COX, MANAGING PARTNER AT HARRIS FINANCIAL GROUP IN COLONIAL HEIGHTS, VIRGINIA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're continuing to add to loan loss reserves and I think that was the big disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody had high hopes that this would be the quarter where reserves would start to decline and that's one of the reasons for revenue being a little shallow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the profit line they're doing what we expect them to do, making record profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In every business line they're making an enormous amount of money but it's being tempered by the need to reserve against future losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dividend also didn't change. I think the dividend policy and the loan loss reserves were the pieces of information that made this a 99 percent perfect quarter versus a 100 percent perfect quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the bellwether, it is the best, most well capitalized, best managed bank. You would hope they'd be the first bank to be able to begin the process of paring down loan loss reserves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEIL SMITH, ANALYST AT WESTLB, GERMANY "There's a very big plus and a very big minus in investment banking. The big plus is that compensation expenses were massively lower in Q4, which shows they've been listening to the regulators. The minus is lower revenue, though a fall as expected. The big delta is less from principal transactions.. The question is how the market will interpret the fall. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVID BUIK, PARTNER AT BGC PARTNERS, LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan top-line results were disappointing. The provisions for bad-debt were disappointing, investment banking was a lot lower than people thought and clearly the fixed interest did not perform in the same manner as it did in the past."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were pressures on credit card lending and retail banking and it just shows the U.S. economy is far from out of the woods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIAN TEGLLUND BLAABJERG, CHIEF EQUITY STRATEGIST, SAXO BANK, COPENHAGEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Loan losses continue to put the earnings in JPMorgan under pressure and despite solid earnings in asset management and investment banking the question remains as to whether JPMorgan will be able to meet expectations for earnings in 2010. We remain skeptical."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GEOFF WILKINSON, HEAD OF INVESTMENT RESEARCH AT MINT SECURITIES, LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are very close to the recent short-term highs which are about $44.8. Before you get comfort about buying this (JPMorgan), you need to see it start to push up and maybe close above $44.80 levels. People are selling very near the highs, made the middle of last week. Bear in mind, you could have bought this yesterday at around $43 levels. It had rallied 4 percent ... yesterday. People might be cautious buying now ... You need to see above $44.80 to attract more buyers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL HOLLAND, PRESIDENT OF HOLLAND  CO IN NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers look excellent and once again Jamie Dimon and the management of JPMorgan have shown why they are regarded as the best in the business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The revenues were the reason the stock traded off a little bit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not only does the recent past look brighter than people expected, but the present and future look brighter today that people suspected for JPMorgan. All in all it is an excellent report."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVID DIETZE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, POINT VIEW FINANCIAL SERVICES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think we can take away from these results that we are any further along in the recovery than we thought we were. I think what was a little disappointing was the sharp increase in consumer loan loss reserves. That was almost double expectations just shy of $2 billion. We were looking for more in the lines of $900 million. That says to me there is still a great deal of caution out there as to the recovery and when credit quality was going to return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously revenues fell shy. It may have reflected a slowdown in trading in the fourth quarter a little bit more than due to holiday lightened schedules, which suggests some caution in the capital markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST AT MILLER TABAK  CO IN NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They missed revenue by a decent amount, and I think that's why the stock is falling right now. The earnings fell from the prior year but it looks like they beat estimates, so we'll see what happens. In general, I think the market has priced in a lot of these results, from JPMorgan to Alcoa to Linear Tech."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Blaise Robinson, Joanne Frearson.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported fourth-quarter 2009 net income
of $3.3 billion, compared with net income of $702 million in the fourth quarter
of 2008. Earnings per share were $0.74, compared with $0.06 in the fourth
quarter of 2008. For the full year of 2009, net income was $11.7 billion, or
$2.26 per share, up from $5.6 billion, or $1.35 per share, in 2008. 

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the results: "We
are gratified that we generated earnings of $3.3 billion for the fourth quarter
and nearly $12 billion for the year. Though these results showed improvement, we
acknowledge that they fell short of both an adequate return on capital and the
firm`s earnings potential. We benefited from the diversity of our leading
franchises, as demonstrated by the continued earnings strength of our Investment
Bank, Commercial Banking, Asset Management and Retail Banking franchises. We are
proud that, throughout these tumultuous times, we never stopped investing in the
fundamental growth drivers of our consumer businesses - such as checking and
credit card accounts in our Retail Banking and Card Services franchises - and
have developed new products and services to meet the needs of consumers and
small businesses. While we are seeing some stability in delinquencies, consumer
credit costs remain high, and weak employment and home prices persist.
Accordingly, we remain cautious." 

Commenting on the firm`s balance sheet, Dimon added: "In the fourth quarter, we
further strengthened our credit reserves to nearly $33 billion, or 5.5% of total
loans. Our earnings generated additional capital, and we ended 2009 with a very
strong Tier 1 Capital ratio of 11.1% and a Tier 1 Common ratio of 8.8%. We
remain confident that this capital and reserve strength, combined with our
significant earnings power, will allow us to meet the uncertainties that lie
ahead and still continue investing in our businesses and serving our clients and
shareholders over the long term." 

Dimon further remarked: "We remain committed to helping homeowners meet the
challenges of declining home prices and rising unemployment. Since 2007, we have
initiated more than 900,000 actions to prevent foreclosures through our own
programs and through government mortgage modification programs. During 2009
alone we offered approximately 600,000 new trial loan modifications to
struggling homeowners. Of these, 89,000 loans have achieved permanent
modification. By March 31, 2010, we will have opened 51 Chase Homeownership
Centers across the country, and we already have more than 14,000 employees
dedicated to mortgage loss mitigation." 

Reflecting on the events of the previous year, Dimon concluded: "Throughout this
period of financial turbulence, our employees have never lost focus on what a
bank should do - support and serve our 90 million customers and the communities
in which we operate; deliver consumer-friendly products and policies; and
continue to lend. We extended nearly $250 billion in new credit to consumers
during the year, and for our corporate and municipal clients, either lent or
assisted them in raising approximately $1 trillion in loans, stocks or bonds.
Lastly, I am very proud of our more than 200,000 employees around the world,
from our programmers to our receptionists to our bankers. Through their
tremendous efforts, we have been able to protect our company and keep it healthy
and vibrant, while doing our part to support the global financial system and
helping the countries where we do business." 

In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a
firm, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with
GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the
firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded; and for
each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a
tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other
non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of
each line of business, see page 13.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $1.9 billion, an increase of $4.3 billion from the prior year.
These results reflected significantly higher net revenue, a benefit from the
provision for credit losses, and lower noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $4.9 billion, compared with negative $272 million in the prior
year. Investment banking fees were up 38% to $1.9 billion, consisting of debt
underwriting fees of $732 million (up 58%), advisory fees of $611 million (up
6%), and equity underwriting fees of $549 million (up 66%). Fixed Income Markets
revenue was $2.7 billion, compared with negative $1.7 billion in the prior year,
reflecting modest gains on legacy leveraged lending and mortgage-related
positions, compared with markdowns of $2.9 billion in the prior year. Fixed
Income Markets revenue declined from a record 2009 third quarter, primarily due
to lower overall volumes and tighter spreads across products. Equity Markets
revenue was $971 million, compared with negative $94 million in the prior year,
reflecting solid client revenue across products and strong trading results.
Credit Portfolio revenue was negative $669 million, reflecting the negative
impact of credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities, and
mark-to-market losses on hedges of retained loans, partially offset by net
interest income on loans. 

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $181 million, compared with an
expense of $765 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision
reflected lower loan balances, driven by loan sales and repayments. The
allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was 8.25%, compared
with 4.83% in the prior year. Net charge-offs were $685 million, compared with
$87 million in the prior year. Nonperforming loans were $3.5 billion, up by $2.3
billion from the prior year and down by $1.4 billion from the prior quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $2.3 billion, down by $455 million, or 17%, from the
prior year, driven by lower performance-based compensation and
headcount-related1 expense.

Discussion of Results:

Retail Financial Services reported a net loss of $399 million, compared with net
income of $624 million in the prior year. 

Net revenue was $7.7 billion, a decrease of $1.0 billion, or 12%, from the prior
year. Net interest income was $5.1 billion, up by $360 million, or 8%,
reflecting the impact of wider loan spreads and a shift to wider-spread deposit
products, partially offset by lower loan balances. Noninterest revenue was $2.6
billion, down by $1.4 billion, or 35%, driven by lower MSR risk management
results and an increase in reserves for the repurchase of previously-sold loans.


The provision for credit losses was $4.2 billion, an increase of $653 million
from the prior year and $241 million from the prior quarter. Weak economic
conditions and housing price declines continued to drive higher estimated losses
for the mortgage and home equity portfolios. The provision included an addition
of $1.5 billion to the allowance for loan losses, compared with additions of
$1.9 billion in the prior year and $1.4 billion in the prior quarter. Included
in the $1.5 billion addition to the allowance was a $491 million increase in the
fourth quarter of 2009 related to estimated deterioration in the Washington
Mutual purchased credit-impaired portfolio; this compared with no addition in
the prior year and a $1.1 billion addition in the prior quarter related to the
portfolio. Home equity net charge-offs were $1.2 billion (4.52% net charge-off
rate1), compared with $770 million (2.67% net charge-off rate1) in the prior
year. Subprime mortgage net charge-offs were $452 million (14.01% net charge-off
rate1), compared with $319 million (8.08% net charge-off rate1) in the prior
year. Prime mortgage net charge-offs were $568 million (3.81% net charge-off
rate1), compared with $195 million (1.20% net charge-off rate1) in the prior
year. 

Noninterest expense was $4.3 billion, an increase of $256 million, or 6%, from
the prior year. 

Retail Banking reported net income of $1.0 billion, relatively flat compared
with the prior year. 

Net revenue was $4.5 billion, flat compared with the prior year,as an increase
in net interest income was offset by a decrease in noninterest revenue. Net
interest income benefited from a shift to wider-spread deposit products, largely
offset by a decline in time deposit balances. The decrease in noninterest
revenue was driven by declining deposit-related fees and investment sales
revenue, predominantly offset by an increase in debit card income. 

The provision for credit losses was $248 million, compared with $268 million in
the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in the Business Banking portfolio.


Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up by $41 million, or 2%, reflecting
increased FDIC insurance premiums and headcount-related1 expense, offset by
efficiencies resulting from the Washington Mutual transaction.

* Checking accounts totaled 25.7 million, up 5% from the prior year and 1% from
the prior quarter. 
* Average total deposits were $329.8 billion, down 3% from both the prior year
and prior quarter due to the maturity of time deposits acquired in the
Washington Mutual transaction.

* Branch sales of credit cards decreased 31% from the prior year and 6% from the
prior quarter. 
* Branch sales of investment products increased 48% from the prior year,
partially driven by significantly increased sales in the Washington Mutual

Consumer Lending reported a net loss of $1.4 billion, compared with a net loss
of $416 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower net revenue,
a higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $3.1 billion, down by $1.0 billion, or 24%, from the prior year.
The decrease was driven by lower mortgage fees and related income and lower loan
balances, partially offset by wider loan spreads. Mortgage fees and related
income decreased due to lower mortgage production revenue and lower net mortgage
servicing revenue. Mortgage production revenue was negative $192 million,
compared with positive $62 million in the prior year, as an increase in reserves
for the repurchase of previously-sold loans was largely offset by wider margins
on new originations and the absence of markdowns of the mortgage warehouse in
the prior year. Operating revenue, which represents loan servicing revenue net
of other changes in fair value of the MSR asset, was $564 million, up by $41
million. MSR risk management results were $109 million, compared with $1.4
billion in the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $4.0 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in
the prior year. The provision reflected an increase in the allowance for loan
losses of $1.5 billion in the current quarter, resulting in an allowance for
loan losses to ending loans retained1 of 5.04%, compared with 3.16% in the prior
year (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the provision for credit
losses, above, for further detail). 

Noninterest expense was $1.7 billion, up by $215 million, or 14%, from the prior
year, reflecting higher servicing and default-related expense.

Discussion of Results:

Card Services reported a net loss of $306 million, compared with a net loss of
$371 million in the prior year. The improvement was driven by higher net revenue
and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by an increase in the provision
for credit losses. 

End-of-period managed loans were $163.4 billion, a decrease of $26.9 billion, or
14%, from the prior year and a decrease of $1.8 billion, or 1%, from the prior
quarter. Average managed loans were $163.2 billion, a decrease of $24.1 billion,
or 13%, from the prior year and a decrease of $6.0 billion, or 4%, from the
prior quarter. Excluding the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
end-of-period and average managed loans were $143.8 billion and $142.8 billion,
respectively. 

Managed net revenue was $5.1 billion, an increase of $240 million, or 5%, from
the prior year. Net interest income was $4.3 billion, down by $55 million, or
1%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower average managed loan
balances, a decreased level of fees, the impact of legislative changes, and
higher revenue reversals associated with higher charge-offs, offset by wider
loan spreads. Noninterest revenue was $885 million, an increase of $295 million,
or 50%, from the prior year. The prior year reflected a write-down of
securitization interests. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $4.2 billion, compared with $4.0
billion in the prior year and $5.0 billion in the prior quarter. The
current-quarter provision was driven by continued high levels of charge-offs and
an addition of $400 million to the allowance for loan losses, reflecting
continued weakness in the credit environment. The managed net charge-off rate
for the quarter was 9.33%, up from 5.56% in the prior year and down from 10.30%
in the prior quarter. The current-quarter net charge-off rate included a benefit
of approximately 60 basis points from a payment holiday program offered in the
second quarter of 2009. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 6.28%, up from
4.97% in the prior year and 5.99% in the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of
the Washington Mutual transaction, the managed net charge-off rate for the
fourth quarter was 8.64%, and the 30-day delinquency rate was 5.52%. 

Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion, a decrease of $93 million, or 6%,
reflecting efficiencies resulting from the Washington Mutual transaction.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $224 million, a decrease of $256 million, or 53%, from the prior
year, driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses, lower net
revenue and higher noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $1.4 billion, a decrease of $73 million, or 5%, from the prior
year. Net interest income was $943 million, down by $160 million, or 15%, driven
by spread compression on liability products and lower loan balances, partially
offset by wider loan spreads, a shift to higher-spread liability products and
overall growth in liability balances. Noninterest revenue was $463 million, an
increase of $87 million, or 23%, reflecting higher lending-related fees,
investment banking fees, and other income. 

Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $760 million, a decrease of $36 million,
or 5%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending was $191

was $277 million, an increase of $34 million, or 14%. Revenue from Real Estate
Banking was $100 million, a decrease of $31 million, or 24%. 

The provision for credit losses was $494 million, compared with $190 million in
the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in the credit environment,
particularly real estate-related segments. Net charge-offs were $483 million
(1.92% net charge-off rate), compared with $118 million (0.40% net charge-off
rate) in the prior year and $291 million (1.11% net charge-off rate) in the

3.12%, up from 2.45% in the prior year and 3.01% in the prior quarter.
Nonperforming loans were $2.8 billion, up by $1.8 billion from the prior year
and $499 million from the prior quarter, reflecting increases in each business
segment. 

Noninterest expense was $543 million, an increase of $44 million, or 9%,
reflecting higher performance-based compensation and FDIC insurance premiums,
partially offset by lower headcount-related1 expense.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $237 million, a decrease of $296 million, or 56%, from the fourth
quarter of 2008. The decrease was driven by lower net revenue, primarily related
to declining liability balances, which had been elevated during the prior year
due to extraordinary market conditions. 

Net revenue was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $414 million, or 18%, from the prior
year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue was $917 million, a decrease of
$264 million, or 22%. The decrease was driven by lower balances and spreads on
liability products, lower securities lending balances, and narrower spreads in
foreign exchange, partially offset by the effects of market levels and net
inflows of assets under custody. Treasury Services net revenue was $918 million,
a decrease of $150 million, or 14%. The decrease reflected lower deposit
balances and spreads, partially offset by higher card product volumes. 

TSS generated firmwide net revenue1 of $2.5 billion, including $1.6 billion of
net revenue in Treasury Services; of that amount, $918 million was recorded in
the Treasury Services business, $645 million was recorded in the Commercial
Banking business, and $57 million was recorded in other lines of business. The
remaining $917 million of net revenue was recorded in Worldwide Securities
Services. 

The provision for credit losses was $53 million, an increase of $8 million, or
18%, reflecting continued weakness in the credit environment. 

Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion, an increase of $52 million, or 4%,
reflecting higher performance-based compensation and FDIC insurance premiums,
predominantly offset by lower headcount-related1 expense.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $424 million, an increase of $169 million, or 66%, from the prior
year. These results reflected higher net revenue offset largely by higher
noninterest expense and a higher provision for credit losses. 

Net revenue was $2.2 billion, an increase of $537 million, or 32%, from the
prior year. Noninterest revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of $631 million,
or 53%, predominantly due to higher valuations of seed capital investments,
higher performance fees, the effect of higher market levels and higher placement
fees. Net interest income was $372 million, down by $94 million, or 20%, from
the prior year, due to narrower deposit spreads offset partially by wider loan
spreads. 

Revenue from the Private Bank was $723 million, up 15% from the prior year.
Revenue from Institutional was $584 million, up 79%. Revenue from Retail was
$445 million, up 68%. Revenue from Private Wealth Management remained flat at
$331 million. Revenue from Bear Stearns Private Client Services was $112
million, up 6%. 

Assets under supervision were $1.7 trillion, an increase of $205 billion, or
14%, from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, an
increase of $116 billion, or 10%, from the prior year. The increases were due to
the effect of higher market levels and inflows in fixed income and equity
products offset partially by outflows in cash products. Custody, brokerage,
administration and deposit balances were $452 billion, up by $89 billion, due to
the effect of higher market levels on custody and brokerage balances, and
brokerage inflows in the Private Bank. 

The provision for credit losses was $58 million, an increase of $26 million from
the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in the credit environment. 

Noninterest expense was $1.5 billion, an increase of $257 million, or 21%, from
the prior year, reflecting higher performance-based compensation and FDIC
insurance premiums, partially offset by lower headcount-related1 expense.

(*) Presented on a managed basis; see notes on page 13 for further explanation
of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis was $23,164 million, $26,622
million and $17,226 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, third quarter of
2009 and fourth quarter of 2008, respectively. 

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $3.3 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion from the prior year.
The increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue, partially offset by
higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. 

Managed net revenue was $25.2 billion, an increase of $6.1 billion, or 32%, from
the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $10.8 billion, up by $7.6 billion. The
increase was driven by significantly higher principal transactions revenue and
higher investment banking fees, partially offset by lower MSR risk management
results and the absence of a gain from the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech
joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net interest income was $14.4
billion, down by $1.4 billion, or 9%, driven by lower trading-related net
interest income, lower loan balances and spread compression on liability and
deposit products, predominantly offset by wider loan spreads and higher
investment portfolio net interest income. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $8.9 billion, up by $360 million, or
4%, from the prior year. The resulting firmwide allowance for loan losses to
end-of-period loans retained1 was 5.51%, compared with 3.62% in the prior year.
The total consumer-managed provision for credit losses was $8.5 billion,
compared with $7.4 billion in the prior year; reflecting higher net charge-offs
across most consumer portfolios, partially offset by a lower addition to the
allowance for credit losses primarily relating to Card Services.
Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $6.6 billion, compared with $4.3 billion
in the prior year, resulting in managed net charge-off rates1 of 6.05% and
3.62%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $421 million,
compared with $1.1 billion in the prior year, reflecting releases in the
allowance for loan losses in the current quarter due to loan sales and
repayments offset by higher charge-offs. Wholesale net charge-offs were $1.2
billion, compared with net charge-offs of $217 million in the prior year,
resulting in net charge-off rates of 2.31% and 0.33%, respectively reflecting
continued weakening in the credit environment. The firm`s nonperforming assets
totaled $19.7 billion at December 31, 2009, up from the prior-year level of
$12.7 billion. 

Noninterest expense was $12.0 billion, up by $749 million, or 7%, reflecting
higher performance-based compensation, servicing and defaulted-related expense
and FDIC insurance premiums, largely offset by efficiencies resulting from the
Washington Mutual transaction and lower headcount-related1 expense.

* Tier 1 Common ratio was 8.8% at December 31, 2009 (estimated), 8.2% at
September 30, 2009, and 7.0% at December 31, 2008. 
* Headcount was 222,316, a decrease of 2,645, or 1%.

1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures:

a. In addition to analyzing the firm`s results on a reported basis, management
analyzes the firm`s results and the results of the lines of business on a
managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm`s definition of
managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the
following adjustments. 

First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of
credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit
losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services
results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been
securitized and sold in accordance with U.S. GAAP remain on the balance sheet,
and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner
as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase
uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall
financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations
are funded and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as employees
and capital, based on managed financial information. In addition, the same
underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on
the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the
sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing
customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards;
accordingly, the customer`s credit performance will affect both the securitized
loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes
managed basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand
both the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet
and the firm`s retained interests in securitized loans. 

Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each
of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax
credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to
assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt
sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded
within income tax expense. 

See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase`s Earnings Release Financial Supplement for a
reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase`s income statement from a reported basis to a
managed basis. 

b.The allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes purchased
credit-impaired loans and loans from the Washington Mutual Master Trust, which
were consolidated on the Firm`s balance sheet at fair value during the second
quarter of 2009. Additionally, Consumer Lending net charge-off rates exclude the
impact of purchased credit impaired loans. The allowance for loan losses
applicable to these loans was $1.6 billion at December 31, 2009. There was no
allowance for loan losses recorded for these loans at December 31, 2008. 

c. Tier 1 Common Capital ("Tier 1 Common") is defined as Tier 1 capital less
elements of capital not in the form of common equity - such as qualifying
perpetual preferred stock, qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries
and qualifying trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common capital, a
non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and
analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firm`s capital
with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1
common capital along with the other capital measures to assess and monitor its
capital position. 

d. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits, and other
noncompensation costs related to employees. 

e. TSS firmwide revenue includes certain TSS product revenue and liability
balances reported in other lines of business, mainly CB, RFS and AM, related to
customers who are also customers of those lines of business. 

f. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total
net revenue, which is, in management`s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax
performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into
consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate
the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective
competitors.

 (a) Pre-provision profit is total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.                           
 (b) For further discussion of managed basis, see Note 1.a on page 13.                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (c) Effective January 1, 2009, the Firm implemented new FASB guidance for participating securities. Accordingly, prior period amounts have been revised as required. For further discussion of the guidance, see Per share-related information on page 36 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. 
 (d) The calculation of full year 2009 earnings per share includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion, or $0.27 per share, resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital.                                                                                    
 (e) Quarterly ratios are based upon annualized amounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 (f) The calculation of full year 2009 net income applicable to common equity includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital. Excluding this reduction, the adjusted ROE for the full year 2009 was 7% and the adjusted ROTCE was 11%, respectively. The Firm views the adjusted ROE and ROTCE, both non-GAAP financial measures, as meaningful because they increase the comparability to prior periods. 
 (g) Net income applicable to common equity divided by total average common stockholders' equity (i.e., total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) and goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities. The Firm uses return on tangible common equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, to assess the Firm's use of equity.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported fourth-quarter 2009 net income
of $3.3 billion, compared with net income of $702 million in the fourth quarter
of 2008. Earnings per share were $0.74, compared with $0.06 in the fourth
quarter of 2008. For the full year of 2009, net income was $11.7 billion, or
$2.26 per share, up from $5.6 billion, or $1.35 per share, in 2008. 

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the results: "We
are gratified that we generated earnings of $3.3 billion for the fourth quarter
and nearly $12 billion for the year. Though these results showed improvement, we
acknowledge that they fell short of both an adequate return on capital and the
firm`s earnings potential. We benefited from the diversity of our leading
franchises, as demonstrated by the continued earnings strength of our Investment
Bank, Commercial Banking, Asset Management and Retail Banking franchises. We are
proud that, throughout these tumultuous times, we never stopped investing in the
fundamental growth drivers of our consumer businesses - such as checking and
credit card accounts in our Retail Banking and Card Services franchises - and
have developed new products and services to meet the needs of consumers and
small businesses. While we are seeing some stability in delinquencies, consumer
credit costs remain high, and weak employment and home prices persist.
Accordingly, we remain cautious." 

Commenting on the firm`s balance sheet, Dimon added: "In the fourth quarter, we
further strengthened our credit reserves to nearly $33 billion, or 5.5% of total
loans. Our earnings generated additional capital, and we ended 2009 with a very
strong Tier 1 Capital ratio of 11.1% and a Tier 1 Common ratio of 8.8%. We
remain confident that this capital and reserve strength, combined with our
significant earnings power, will allow us to meet the uncertainties that lie
ahead and still continue investing in our businesses and serving our clients and
shareholders over the long term." 

Dimon further remarked: "We remain committed to helping homeowners meet the
challenges of declining home prices and rising unemployment. Since 2007, we have
initiated more than 900,000 actions to prevent foreclosures through our own
programs and through government mortgage modification programs. During 2009
alone we offered approximately 600,000 new trial loan modifications to
struggling homeowners. Of these, 89,000 loans have achieved permanent
modification. By March 31, 2010, we will have opened 51 Chase Homeownership
Centers across the country, and we already have more than 14,000 employees
dedicated to mortgage loss mitigation." 

Reflecting on the events of the previous year, Dimon concluded: "Throughout this
period of financial turbulence, our employees have never lost focus on what a
bank should do - support and serve our 90 million customers and the communities
in which we operate; deliver consumer-friendly products and policies; and
continue to lend. We extended nearly $250 billion in new credit to consumers
during the year, and for our corporate and municipal clients, either lent or
assisted them in raising approximately $1 trillion in loans, stocks or bonds.
Lastly, I am very proud of our more than 200,000 employees around the world,
from our programmers to our receptionists to our bankers. Through their
tremendous efforts, we have been able to protect our company and keep it healthy
and vibrant, while doing our part to support the global financial system and
helping the countries where we do business." 

In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a
firm, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with
GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the
firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded; and for
each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a
tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other
non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of
each line of business, see page 13.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $1.9 billion, an increase of $4.3 billion from the prior year.
These results reflected significantly higher net revenue, a benefit from the
provision for credit losses, and lower noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $4.9 billion, compared with negative $272 million in the prior
year. Investment banking fees were up 38% to $1.9 billion, consisting of debt
underwriting fees of $732 million (up 58%), advisory fees of $611 million (up
6%), and equity underwriting fees of $549 million (up 66%). Fixed Income Markets
revenue was $2.7 billion, compared with negative $1.7 billion in the prior year,
reflecting modest gains on legacy leveraged lending and mortgage-related
positions, compared with markdowns of $2.9 billion in the prior year. Fixed
Income Markets revenue declined from a record 2009 third quarter, primarily due
to lower overall volumes and tighter spreads across products. Equity Markets
revenue was $971 million, compared with negative $94 million in the prior year,
reflecting solid client revenue across products and strong trading results.
Credit Portfolio revenue was negative $669 million, reflecting the negative
impact of credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities, and
mark-to-market losses on hedges of retained loans, partially offset by net
interest income on loans. 

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $181 million, compared with an
expense of $765 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision
reflected lower loan balances, driven by loan sales and repayments. The
allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was 8.25%, compared
with 4.83% in the prior year. Net charge-offs were $685 million, compared with
$87 million in the prior year. Nonperforming loans were $3.5 billion, up by $2.3
billion from the prior year and down by $1.4 billion from the prior quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $2.3 billion, down by $455 million, or 17%, from the
prior year, driven by lower performance-based compensation and
headcount-related1 expense.

Discussion of Results:

Retail Financial Services reported a net loss of $399 million, compared with net
income of $624 million in the prior year. 

Net revenue was $7.7 billion, a decrease of $1.0 billion, or 12%, from the prior
year. Net interest income was $5.1 billion, up by $360 million, or 8%,
reflecting the impact of wider loan spreads and a shift to wider-spread deposit
products, partially offset by lower loan balances. Noninterest revenue was $2.6
billion, down by $1.4 billion, or 35%, driven by lower MSR risk management
results and an increase in reserves for the repurchase of previously-sold loans.


The provision for credit losses was $4.2 billion, an increase of $653 million
from the prior year and $241 million from the prior quarter. Weak economic
conditions and housing price declines continued to drive higher estimated losses
for the mortgage and home equity portfolios. The provision included an addition
of $1.5 billion to the allowance for loan losses, compared with additions of
$1.9 billion in the prior year and $1.4 billion in the prior quarter. Included
in the $1.5 billion addition to the allowance was a $491 million increase in the
fourth quarter of 2009 related to estimated deterioration in the Washington
Mutual purchased credit-impaired portfolio; this compared with no addition in
the prior year and a $1.1 billion addition in the prior quarter related to the
portfolio. Home equity net charge-offs were $1.2 billion (4.52% net charge-off
rate1), compared with $770 million (2.67% net charge-off rate1) in the prior
year. Subprime mortgage net charge-offs were $452 million (14.01% net charge-off
rate1), compared with $319 million (8.08% net charge-off rate1) in the prior
year. Prime mortgage net charge-offs were $568 million (3.81% net charge-off
rate1), compared with $195 million (1.20% net charge-off rate1) in the prior
year. 

Noninterest expense was $4.3 billion, an increase of $256 million, or 6%, from
the prior year. 

Retail Banking reported net income of $1.0 billion, relatively flat compared
with the prior year. 

Net revenue was $4.5 billion, flat compared with the prior year,as an increase
in net interest income was offset by a decrease in noninterest revenue. Net
interest income benefited from a shift to wider-spread deposit products, largely
offset by a decline in time deposit balances. The decrease in noninterest
revenue was driven by declining deposit-related fees and investment sales
revenue, predominantly offset by an increase in debit card income. 

The provision for credit losses was $248 million, compared with $268 million in
the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in the Business Banking portfolio.


Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up by $41 million, or 2%, reflecting
increased FDIC insurance premiums and headcount-related1 expense, offset by
efficiencies resulting from the Washington Mutual transaction.

* Checking accounts totaled 25.7 million, up 5% from the prior year and 1% from
the prior quarter. 
* Average total deposits were $329.8 billion, down 3% from both the prior year
and prior quarter due to the maturity of time deposits acquired in the
Washington Mutual transaction. 
* Deposit margin was 3.06%, compared with 2.94% in the prior year and 2.99% in
the prior quarter. 
* Average Business Banking and other loans were $17.2 billion, down 5% from the
prior year and 3% from the prior quarter, while originations were $670 million,
down 13% from the prior year and up 40% from the prior quarter. 
* Branch sales of credit cards decreased 31% from the prior year and 6% from the
prior quarter. 
* Branch sales of investment products increased 48% from the prior year,
partially driven by significantly increased sales in the Washington Mutual
footprint, and declined 6% from the prior quarter. 
* Overhead ratio (excluding amortization of core deposit intangibles) was 55%,
compared with 54% in the prior year and 56% in the prior quarter. 
* Number of branches was 5,154, down 6% from the prior year and up 1% from the
prior quarter.

Consumer Lending reported a net loss of $1.4 billion, compared with a net loss
of $416 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower net revenue,
a higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $3.1 billion, down by $1.0 billion, or 24%, from the prior year.
The decrease was driven by lower mortgage fees and related income and lower loan
balances, partially offset by wider loan spreads. Mortgage fees and related
income decreased due to lower mortgage production revenue and lower net mortgage
servicing revenue. Mortgage production revenue was negative $192 million,
compared with positive $62 million in the prior year, as an increase in reserves
for the repurchase of previously-sold loans was largely offset by wider margins
on new originations and the absence of markdowns of the mortgage warehouse in
the prior year. Operating revenue, which represents loan servicing revenue net
of other changes in fair value of the MSR asset, was $564 million, up by $41
million. MSR risk management results were $109 million, compared with $1.4
billion in the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $4.0 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in
the prior year. The provision reflected an increase in the allowance for loan
losses of $1.5 billion in the current quarter, resulting in an allowance for
loan losses to ending loans retained1 of 5.04%, compared with 3.16% in the prior
year (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the provision for credit
losses, above, for further detail). 

Noninterest expense was $1.7 billion, up by $215 million, or 14%, from the prior
year, reflecting higher servicing and default-related expense.

Discussion of Results:

Card Services reported a net loss of $306 million, compared with a net loss of
$371 million in the prior year. The improvement was driven by higher net revenue
and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by an increase in the provision
for credit losses. 

End-of-period managed loans were $163.4 billion, a decrease of $26.9 billion, or
14%, from the prior year and a decrease of $1.8 billion, or 1%, from the prior
quarter. Average managed loans were $163.2 billion, a decrease of $24.1 billion,
or 13%, from the prior year and a decrease of $6.0 billion, or 4%, from the
prior quarter. Excluding the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
end-of-period and average managed loans were $143.8 billion and $142.8 billion,
respectively. 

Managed net revenue was $5.1 billion, an increase of $240 million, or 5%, from
the prior year. Net interest income was $4.3 billion, down by $55 million, or
1%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower average managed loan
balances, a decreased level of fees, the impact of legislative changes, and
higher revenue reversals associated with higher charge-offs, offset by wider
loan spreads. Noninterest revenue was $885 million, an increase of $295 million,
or 50%, from the prior year. The prior year reflected a write-down of
securitization interests. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $4.2 billion, compared with $4.0
billion in the prior year and $5.0 billion in the prior quarter. The
current-quarter provision was driven by continued high levels of charge-offs and
an addition of $400 million to the allowance for loan losses, reflecting
continued weakness in the credit environment. The managed net charge-off rate
for the quarter was 9.33%, up from 5.56% in the prior year and down from 10.30%
in the prior quarter. The current-quarter net charge-off rate included a benefit
of approximately 60 basis points from a payment holiday program offered in the
second quarter of 2009. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 6.28%, up from
4.97% in the prior year and 5.99% in the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of
the Washington Mutual transaction, the managed net charge-off rate for the
fourth quarter was 8.64%, and the 30-day delinquency rate was 5.52%. 

Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion, a decrease of $93 million, or 6%,
reflecting efficiencies resulting from the Washington Mutual transaction.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $224 million, a decrease of $256 million, or 53%, from the prior
year, driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses, lower net
revenue and higher noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $1.4 billion, a decrease of $73 million, or 5%, from the prior
year. Net interest income was $943 million, down by $160 million, or 15%, driven
by spread compression on liability products and lower loan balances, partially
offset by wider loan spreads, a shift to higher-spread liability products and
overall growth in liability balances. Noninterest revenue was $463 million, an
increase of $87 million, or 23%, reflecting higher lending-related fees,
investment banking fees, and other income. 

Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $760 million, a decrease of $36 million,
or 5%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending was $191
million, a decrease of $52 million, or 21%. Revenue from Mid-Corporate Banking
was $277 million, an increase of $34 million, or 14%. Revenue from Real Estate
Banking was $100 million, a decrease of $31 million, or 24%. 

The provision for credit losses was $494 million, compared with $190 million in
the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in the credit environment,
particularly real estate-related segments. Net charge-offs were $483 million
(1.92% net charge-off rate), compared with $118 million (0.40% net charge-off
rate) in the prior year and $291 million (1.11% net charge-off rate) in the
prior quarter. The allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was
3.12%, up from 2.45% in the prior year and 3.01% in the prior quarter.
Nonperforming loans were $2.8 billion, up by $1.8 billion from the prior year
and $499 million from the prior quarter, reflecting increases in each business
segment. 

Noninterest expense was $543 million, an increase of $44 million, or 9%,
reflecting higher performance-based compensation and FDIC insurance premiums,
partially offset by lower headcount-related1 expense.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $237 million, a decrease of $296 million, or 56%, from the fourth
quarter of 2008. The decrease was driven by lower net revenue, primarily related
to declining liability balances, which had been elevated during the prior year
due to extraordinary market conditions. 

Net revenue was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $414 million, or 18%, from the prior
year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue was $917 million, a decrease of
$264 million, or 22%. The decrease was driven by lower balances and spreads on
liability products, lower securities lending balances, and narrower spreads in
foreign exchange, partially offset by the effects of market levels and net
inflows of assets under custody. Treasury Services net revenue was $918 million,
a decrease of $150 million, or 14%. The decrease reflected lower deposit
balances and spreads, partially offset by higher card product volumes. 

TSS generated firmwide net revenue1 of $2.5 billion, including $1.6 billion of
net revenue in Treasury Services; of that amount, $918 million was recorded in
the Treasury Services business, $645 million was recorded in the Commercial
Banking business, and $57 million was recorded in other lines of business. The
remaining $917 million of net revenue was recorded in Worldwide Securities
Services. 

The provision for credit losses was $53 million, an increase of $8 million, or
18%, reflecting continued weakness in the credit environment. 

Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion, an increase of $52 million, or 4%,
reflecting higher performance-based compensation and FDIC insurance premiums,
predominantly offset by lower headcount-related1 expense.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $424 million, an increase of $169 million, or 66%, from the prior
year. These results reflected higher net revenue offset largely by higher
noninterest expense and a higher provision for credit losses. 

Net revenue was $2.2 billion, an increase of $537 million, or 32%, from the
prior year. Noninterest revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of $631 million,
or 53%, predominantly due to higher valuations of seed capital investments,
higher performance fees, the effect of higher market levels and higher placement
fees. Net interest income was $372 million, down by $94 million, or 20%, from
the prior year, due to narrower deposit spreads offset partially by wider loan
spreads. 

Revenue from the Private Bank was $723 million, up 15% from the prior year.
Revenue from Institutional was $584 million, up 79%. Revenue from Retail was
$445 million, up 68%. Revenue from Private Wealth Management remained flat at
$331 million. Revenue from Bear Stearns Private Client Services was $112
million, up 6%. 

Assets under supervision were $1.7 trillion, an increase of $205 billion, or
14%, from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, an
increase of $116 billion, or 10%, from the prior year. The increases were due to
the effect of higher market levels and inflows in fixed income and equity
products offset partially by outflows in cash products. Custody, brokerage,
administration and deposit balances were $452 billion, up by $89 billion, due to
the effect of higher market levels on custody and brokerage balances, and
brokerage inflows in the Private Bank. 

The provision for credit losses was $58 million, an increase of $26 million from
the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in the credit environment. 

Noninterest expense was $1.5 billion, an increase of $257 million, or 21%, from
the prior year, reflecting higher performance-based compensation and FDIC
insurance premiums, partially offset by lower headcount-related1 expense.

(*) Presented on a managed basis; see notes on page 13 for further explanation
of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis was $23,164 million, $26,622
million and $17,226 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, third quarter of
2009 and fourth quarter of 2008, respectively. 

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $3.3 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion from the prior year.
The increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue, partially offset by
higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. 

Managed net revenue was $25.2 billion, an increase of $6.1 billion, or 32%, from
the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $10.8 billion, up by $7.6 billion. The
increase was driven by significantly higher principal transactions revenue and
higher investment banking fees, partially offset by lower MSR risk management
results and the absence of a gain from the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech
joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net interest income was $14.4
billion, down by $1.4 billion, or 9%, driven by lower trading-related net
interest income, lower loan balances and spread compression on liability and
deposit products, predominantly offset by wider loan spreads and higher
investment portfolio net interest income. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $8.9 billion, up by $360 million, or
4%, from the prior year. The resulting firmwide allowance for loan losses to
end-of-period loans retained1 was 5.51%, compared with 3.62% in the prior year.
The total consumer-managed provision for credit losses was $8.5 billion,
compared with $7.4 billion in the prior year; reflecting higher net charge-offs
across most consumer portfolios, partially offset by a lower addition to the
allowance for credit losses primarily relating to Card Services.
Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $6.6 billion, compared with $4.3 billion
in the prior year, resulting in managed net charge-off rates1 of 6.05% and
3.62%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $421 million,
compared with $1.1 billion in the prior year, reflecting releases in the
allowance for loan losses in the current quarter due to loan sales and
repayments offset by higher charge-offs. Wholesale net charge-offs were $1.2
billion, compared with net charge-offs of $217 million in the prior year,
resulting in net charge-off rates of 2.31% and 0.33%, respectively reflecting
continued weakening in the credit environment. The firm`s nonperforming assets
totaled $19.7 billion at December 31, 2009, up from the prior-year level of
$12.7 billion. 

Noninterest expense was $12.0 billion, up by $749 million, or 7%, reflecting
higher performance-based compensation, servicing and defaulted-related expense
and FDIC insurance premiums, largely offset by efficiencies resulting from the
Washington Mutual transaction and lower headcount-related1 expense.

1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures:

a. In addition to analyzing the firm`s results on a reported basis, management
analyzes the firm`s results and the results of the lines of business on a
managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm`s definition of
managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the
following adjustments. 

First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of
credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit
losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services
results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been
securitized and sold in accordance with U.S. GAAP remain on the balance sheet,
and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner
as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase
uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall
financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations
are funded and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as employees
and capital, based on managed financial information. In addition, the same
underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on
the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the
sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing
customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards;
accordingly, the customer`s credit performance will affect both the securitized
loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes
managed basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand
both the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet
and the firm`s retained interests in securitized loans. 

Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each
of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax
credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to
assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt
sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded
within income tax expense. 

See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase`s Earnings Release Financial Supplement for a
reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase`s income statement from a reported basis to a
managed basis. 

b.The allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes purchased
credit-impaired loans and loans from the Washington Mutual Master Trust, which
were consolidated on the Firm`s balance sheet at fair value during the second
quarter of 2009. Additionally, Consumer Lending net charge-off rates exclude the
impact of purchased credit impaired loans. The allowance for loan losses
applicable to these loans was $1.6 billion at December 31, 2009. There was no
allowance for loan losses recorded for these loans at December 31, 2008. 

c. Tier 1 Common Capital ("Tier 1 Common") is defined as Tier 1 capital less
elements of capital not in the form of common equity - such as qualifying
perpetual preferred stock, qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries
and qualifying trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common capital, a
non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and
analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firm`s capital
with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1
common capital along with the other capital measures to assess and monitor its
capital position. 

d. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits, and other
noncompensation costs related to employees. 

e. TSS firmwide revenue includes certain TSS product revenue and liability
balances reported in other lines of business, mainly CB, RFS and AM, related to
customers who are also customers of those lines of business. 

f. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total
net revenue, which is, in management`s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax
performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into
consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate
the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective
competitors.

 (a) Pre-provision profit is total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.                           
 (b) For further discussion of managed basis, see Note 1.a on page 13.                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (c) Effective January 1, 2009, the Firm implemented new FASB guidance for participating securities. Accordingly, prior period amounts have been revised as required. For further discussion of the guidance, see Per share-related information on page 36 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. 
 (d) The calculation of full year 2009 earnings per share includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion, or $0.27 per share, resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital.                                                                                    
 (e) Quarterly ratios are based upon annualized amounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 (f) The calculation of full year 2009 net income applicable to common equity includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital. Excluding this reduction, the adjusted ROE for the full year 2009 was 7% and the adjusted ROTCE was 11%, respectively. The Firm views the adjusted ROE and ROTCE, both non-GAAP financial measures, as meaningful because they increase the comparability to prior periods. 
 (g) Net income applicable to common equity divided by total average common stockholders' equity (i.e., total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) and goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities. The Firm uses return on tangible common equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, to assess the Firm's use of equity. 
 (h) Tier 1 common is calculated as Tier 1 capital less qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities and qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries. The Firm uses the Tier 1 common capital ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firm's capital with the capital of other financial services companies. 
 (i) Estimated.

&lt;p&gt;By 0911 GMT the UK blue-chip was up 15.61 points at 5,513.81 after it closed 24.72 points, or 0.5 percent higher on Thursday, snapping two sessions of declines as miners bounced back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forecast beating results from Intel (INTC.O) in the U.S. after the closing bell provided some reassurance to the market but moves were relatively muted, with investors awaiting more clues on the outlook from JP Morgan results, due for release at 1200 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Results will dominate the newsflow and I would expect good numbers, but there will be little share price reaction unless companies increase expectations for the outlook, which they have little incentive to do," said Lars Kreckel, strategist at Exane BNP Paribas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miners were stronger, despite slightly weaker metal prices, adding to gains made in the previous session after Rio Tinto (RIO.L) released soaring output figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rio Tinto (RIO.L), Xstrata XTA.L, Lonmin (LMI.L), Anglo American (AAL.L), Kazakhmys (KAZ.L) and BHP Billiton (BLT.L) gained 0.9 to 1.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hedge fund company Man Group (EMG.L) was the biggest blue-chip loser, down 4.1 percent after its flagship AHL fund saw $1.2 billion in performance losses in the three months to December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavyweight mobile phone network operator Vodafone (VOD.L) was the biggest individual drag on the index, down 1 percent, with earnings estimates cuts by UBS one factor impacting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other defensive stocks, like supermarkets and tobacco firms lent the index support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sainsbury (SBRY.L) and Tesco (TSCO.L) added 0.4 and 1.1 percent respectively while British American Tobacco (BATS.L) added 0.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks were also firmer, unruffled by reports that Barclays (BARC.L), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and HSBC (HSBA.L) would have to pay billions of dollars over the next 10 years as part of a levy on financial companies proposed by U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks gained 0.2 to 1.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No important UK data is due on Friday so investors will focus on December U.S. inflation numbers, due at 1330 GMT, with consumer prices seen rising 0.2 percent on the month, after a 0.4 percent increase in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year-on-year U.S. consumer prices are seen up 2.8 percent last month, up from a 1.8 percent increase in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;January's Empire State index will also be released at 1330 GMT, followed by December U.S. industrial output and capacity utilization numbers at 1415 GMT, and the first reading for January's University of Michigan consumer sentiment index at 1455 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Simon Falush; Editing by Mike Nesbit)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Jan 15 (Reuters) - A senior JPMorgan (JPM.N)
executive praised China for allowing the introduction of index
futures as well as margin trading and short selling, saying the
bold moves will benefit China's casino-like stock market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; With such instruments, investors can sell excessively-valued
stocks short and buy cheap blue chips, thus bringing stability to
a highly volatile market, Frank Gong, JPMorgan vice chairman of
China Investment Banking, told a financial conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's admirable for the Chinese government to go ahead with
innovation at the heels of the global financial turmoil," Gong
said. "With the new tools, investors would care more about stock
valuation and the market would no longer look like a casino."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China this month approved the launch of index futures -
futures contracts on stock indexes, as well as short selling and
margin trading of shares, underscoring the government's
commitment to financial reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Margin trading allows investors to use borrowings to buy
stocks, while short selling allows investors to sell borrowed
shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gong said there are investment opportunities this year in
technology stocks, as companies revive plans to upgrade computers
and equipment as the economy rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the longer term, investors should buy into Chinese
companies with well-known brands and unique technology, betting
such firms would emerge as winners in the country's fast-growing
economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Gong expressed concern that Shenzhen's newly-established
second board, ChiNext, had become so hot that new private equity
investment into high-growth start-ups may be hampered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ChiNext stocks trade at more than 100 times companies'
reported earnings, compared with a ratio of 28 for the benchmark
Shanghai Stock Index .SSEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exorbitant secondary market prices have raised valuations in
the private equity market, making deals more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a big challenge for investors," Gong said. "China's
private equity industry has just taken root, but is getting more
and more difficult for players."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft issued a security advisory today that warned users of a critical and unpatched vulnerability in Internet Explorer (IE), and acknowledged that it had been used to hack several companies' networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have determined that Internet Explorer was one of the vectors used in targeted and sophisticated attacks against Google and possibly other corporate networks," said Mike Reavey, director of Microsoft's Security Response Center (MSRC), in a post to the group's blog .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, antivirus company McAfee said the IE bug had been exploited by hackers who had attacked computer networks of nearly three dozen major companies between mid-December 2009 and Jan. 4, 2010. McAfee said then that Microsoft would soon release this advisory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The security advisory said that the only version of IE not containing the critical flaw was IE 5.01 running on Windows 2000. All other versions, including IE6, IE7 and IE8 on Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 are vulnerable to attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Reavey downplayed the threat to average Windows users. "Microsoft has not seen widespread customer impact, rather only targeted and limited attacks exploiting IE6 at this time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An IE zero-day in all versions," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security, "so by no means is this good for Microsoft. The only encouraging news is that there are tools that protect Vista and Windows 7 on IE7 and newer, so that an exploit would crash [those browsers] rather than allow code execution." Storms was referring to security provisions within IE, including DEP (data execution prevention) and Protected Mode, on newer versions of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Reavey hammered that home as well. "Protected Mode in IE 7 on Windows Vista and later significantly reduces the ability of an attacker to impact data on a user's machine," Reavey said. "Customers should also enable Data Execution Prevention, which helps mitigate online attacks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although DEP is on by default in IE8, it must be manually switched on in IE6 and IE7. Users can enable DEP by using the "Fix it" tool Microsoft has posted on its support site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As McAfee noted earlier today that an IE user's PC could be hijacked simply by steering the browser to a malicious site, or to a compromised legitimate site that hosted attack code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said users could also protect themselves to some degree by setting the PC's Internet zone's security to the "High" option, but warned that it wasn't surefire. "It is important to note that the vulnerable code may be reached even with these protections in place," the company said in the advisory. "However, any attacks would be less successful with these workarounds in place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company did not set a timetable for producing patch, but Storms was certain that Microsoft would scramble to get something out as soon as possible. "For sure they'll do an out-of-band update," said Storms, using the term for a security fix that's released outside Microsoft's monthly patch schedule. "The public relations aspects are going to drive this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms was talking about the criticism that Microsoft is sure to harvest as the vendor whose software let hackers break into dozens of major Western companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft last issued an out-of-band update in late July 2009, when, ironically, it patched IE just hours before several researchers demonstrated the vulnerability at a security conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacks first came to light Tuesday, when Google announced that Chinese attackers had made off with intellectual property from its corporate network, and also tried to access the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said the attacks, along with increasing censorship of the Web by China's government, had prompted a reevaluation of it business in the country . The same day, Adobe acknowledged that its machines had also been hacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft tacitly acknowledged that the IE attack had been used by the Chinese hackers to break into the Google and Adobe networks by crediting the two companies with reporting the browser bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early reports, including one by Computerworld , pointed toward a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe's Reader as the bug that hackers exploited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McAfee today scotched such talk, saying that although it did not investigate every attack, it had worked with several targeted corporations and found evidence of only one vulnerability: the IE zero-day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next regularly-scheduled Microsoft Patch Tuesday is Feb. 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is scrambling to patch an Internet Explorer flaw that was used to hack into Google's corporate networks last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack was used to hack into networks at 34 companies, including Adobe, security experts say. Typically such hacks involve several such attacks, but the IE bug is the only one definitively linked to the hacking incident, which security experts say originated in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a security advisory released Thursday, Microsoft said IE 6 users on Windows XP are most at risk from the flaw, but that other users could be affected by modified versions of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it is developing a fix, but it did not say when it expects to patch the issue. The company is slated to release its next set of security updates on Feb. 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Google spokesman confirmed Thursday that the Internet Explorer attack was used against Google and that the company then reported the issue to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google learned of the issue in December and, after discovering the server used to control the hacked computers, notified other companies affected by the hack. Apparently convinced that the infiltration was sanctioned by the Chinese government, Google has threatened to effectively pull its business out of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McAfee released a description of the attack Thursday, saying that the people hit with the attack were probably "targeted because they likely had access to valuable intellectual property."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft condemned the attack Thursday, but said it had no indication that its corporate network or mail products were hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the IE attack has only been seen in "targeted and limited" incidents, Microsoft may release an emergency patch for the product, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The malicious code that hit Google "attacks IE6 on XP exclusively," but is thwarted by the Data Execution Prevention (DEP) technology used by Windows XP, said Dan Kaminsky, director of penetration testing with IOActive. However, he added, the bug could be leveraged in attacks that affected more recent versions of IE, running on Windows XP, he added. Vista and Windows 7 use a more advanced protection technology called ASLR (address space layout randomization) that makes exploiting this bug extremely difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does not plan to follow Google&#8217;s lead in pulling out of China, the software giant&#8217;s CEO told news outlets on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been quite clear that we&#8217;re going to operate in China,&#8221; Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said in an interview on CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, his hopes for China to produce growing revenue for the company seem to hinge on a thorny issue: a reduction of piracy and intellectual-property theft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China ought to be a source of growth,&#8221; Ballmer said. &#8220;Intellectual-property protection in China is very, very bad. Abysmal. ... We&#8217;re buying a lot of goods from China but the things that U.S. companies can sell -- pharmaceutical products, media, software -- it&#8217;s all intellectual property and design, and that stuff&#8217;s not getting paid for in China. It&#8217;s got to change.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His reference to the problem of IP theft points to bigger challenges Microsoft could face if it decided to leave China. Microsoft has been battling software piracy there for years, and pulling out of the country could amount to it giving up the battle and allowing piracy of its products to flourish unchecked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Ballmer did not raise the issue of censorship or human rights, which Google said were central to its new approach to the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said Tuesday that it planned to stop censoring its search results in China after discovering the theft of some of its intellectual property during a "sophisticated cyberattack" originating in the country, and learning that Gmail accounts of human rights advocates had been broken into. It acknowledged that, as a result, it would likely no longer be welcome to operate in China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, Google and many other companies have been criticized for complying with China's censorship laws in order to do business in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft continues to gain share in the search market, growing slightly faster in December than any of its competitors, according to a report by comScore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its share of searches in the U.S. reached 10.7 percent last month, up 0.4 percentage points from November, comScore said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is still attracting the majority of searches, with a 65.7 percent market share in December, up 0.1 percentage points from November, comScore said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s growth came at the expense of its partner Yahoo, as well as Ask and Aol. Yahoo&#8217;s share slipped slightly from 17.5 percent in November to 17.3 percent in December. Aol also lost share, slipping from 2.8 percent in November to 2.6 percent in December. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it launched Bing in June, Microsoft has steadily if slowly been gaining ground. The company has added new features over that time, perhaps contributing to the growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-November, Bing results began relying on computational information from Wolfram Alpha, allowing people to type complicated math equations or ask Bing to display a graph plotting an equation. The update also allows people to type in the name of a food item and receive nutritional information.&lt;/p&gt;

concerns about fiscal problems buffeting Greece, which has seen
its budget deficit balloon and its credit ratings cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Euro zone finance ministers had little patience left for
Greece after it misled them about the size of its deficit and
would be ready to impose sanctions on Athens if needed, euro
zone sources said. [ID:nLDE60E1AB]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. stocks fell by around 1 percent on Friday as

15-month high struck last week, with bank shares leading
declines over fears the market's recent rally was over done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JPMorgan's earnings dragged down other U.S. banking
shares, and Japanese peers may follow suit, but on the whole,
the bank's earnings helped lead to profit-taking as there were
concerns that those shares had already gone up too high," said
Hiroichi Nishi, general manager of equity marketing at Nikko
Cordial Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong .HSI and Shanghai .SSEC shares remained under

week. [ID:nTOE60G00H]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders say a raft of Chinese data this week, ranging from

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM's quarterly results should show a solid recovery in technology spending, but investors will likely want reassurance of stronger growth in 2010 before pushing its stock price much higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of International Business Machines Corp have risen almost 60 percent in the past year as the company sidestepped the worst of the downturn by cutting costs and shifting its business mix to more profitable services and software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not expect the kind of upside that we've had in the past," said Canaccord Adams analyst Peter Misek, who recommends holding the stock. "The sell-side in general, we over-estimated the impact of the recession and under-estimated IBM's ability to cut costs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analyst David Bailey held a similar view on IBM's results, which are due on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we expect a solid December-quarter report from IBM, we do not think the results will serve as a major catalyst for the stock in either direction, given heightened expectations," he said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average expect IBM to report fourth-quarter revenue of around $27 billion, roughly flat from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit per share is seen rising to $3.47 from $3.27 a year earlier, with full-year earnings of $9.88. The company has forecast earnings of at least $9.85 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the main focus will be on IBM's 2010 outlook. Its last forecast was for earnings per share of around $10 to $11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi said he expects IBM to forecast "at least $11.00" for the full year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We note that IBM's playbook over the last two years has been to set achievable guidance and raise it," he said, citing IBM's record of beating consensus EPS in each of the last eight quarters and repeatedly raising guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMARTER PLANET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the global economic downturn certainly dented profit in 2009, IBM managed to weather the worst of the recession by reducing costs and shifting focus from hardware to IT software and services, which has helped bolster margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, it is the world's largest IT services provider. Technology outsourcing, automation and support are some of the areas that remained relatively strong during the downturn, as companies sought ways to improve cost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many analysts warned not to expect too much from Tuesday's results, there were some who believe IBM shares could still be bound for more gains, particularly if the global economic recovery turns out to be stronger than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sacconaghi, for example, has an "outperform" rating and $155 price target on the stock, which traded 0.5 percent lower at $131.62 late on Friday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key focus is corporate technology spending, which has lagged behind an upturn in the consumer segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some were also bullish about the company's longer-term strategies. Those include its "smarter planet" initiative, which aims to combine IBM's software and services with its budding analytics business, helping governments and companies like utilities run operations more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some analysts pointed to long-term risks as well, including the emergence of new rivals like Cisco Systems Inc in servers. While software and services account for a majority of the company's revenue, servers remain an key and integral part of its sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco announced last year that it was entering the server market, a move that put it in direct competition with IBM as well as Hewlett-Packard Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, for its part, has stepped up its partnership with Cisco's smaller rival, Juniper Networks Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A lack of oxygen and nutrients below the surface of beaches in Alaska's Prince William Sound is slowing the dissipation of oil remaining from the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, U.S. researchers said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team conducted field studies over the past three summers using geologic information and hydraulics to try to determine why patches of oil linger on the beaches 20 years after the worst oil spill in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supertanker Exxon Valdez spilled more than 11 million gallons (50 million liters) of crude oil, blackening some 1,300 miles of Alaska's coastline. An estimated 20,000 gallons (90,920 liters) remain, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the oil remaining was trapped between two layers of beach and sheltered from the elements, according to the study posted on the journal Nature Geoscience's website (www.nature.com/ngeo/index.html)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The oil that is in the upper layer either gets flushed out or biodegraded.

&lt;p&gt; * Oil in lower layer sheltered from the elements * Oil-eating microorganisms lack oxygen By JoAnne Allen WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A lack of oxygen and nutrients below the surface of beaches in Alaska's Prince William Sound is slowing the dissipation of oil remaining from the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, U.S. researchers said Sunday. The team conducted field studies over the past three summers using geologic information and hydraulics to try to determine why patches of oil linger on the beaches 20 years after the worst oil spill in U.S. history. The supertanker Exxon Valdez spilled more than 11 million gallons of crude oil, blackening some 1,300 miles of Alaska's coastline. An estimated 20,000 gallons remain, the researchers said. They found that the oil remaining was trapped between two layers of beach and sheltered from the elements, according to the study posted on the journal Nature Geoscience's website (www.nature.com/ngeo/index.html) The oil that is in the upper layer either gets flushed out or biodegraded. In the lower layer, we found out there's not enough fresh water exchange to cause any flushing, co-author Michel Boufadel of Temple University said in a telephone interview. Boufadel also said oxygen levels in the lower layer were not high enough for the oil to disappear through natural biodegradation. Microorganisms that are indigenous in beaches are capable of breaking down the oil, of eating the oil, provided that they have oxygen to breathe and nutrients such as nitrate and phosphate, Boufadel said. He said earlier research uncovered nutrient deficiency in the area. But his team was the first to detect the low oxygen levels and the two-layer beaches. In the first five years after the accident, the oil was vanishing at a rate of 70 percent a year and calculations showed it would be gone within a few years, the researchers said. About eight years ago, the disappearance rate slowed to 4 percent a year. Boufadel's team is exploring ways to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the lower layer of beach in an effort to spur biodegrading of the remaining oil. The study was funded by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, established in 1991 when Exxon settled civil and criminal charges filed by the Alaska and the U.S. governments. The council has administered the $900 million that Exxon paid to settle the state and federal civil cases from the disaster.  (Editing by Eric Beech)

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) as the Bull of the
Day and Accuray Incorporated (Nasdaq: ARAY) the Bear of the Day. In addition,
Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company (NYSE: JPM),
American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP) and Con Ed (NYSE: ED). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) recently upgraded its guidance for the third quarter
of fiscal 2010. Xilinx now expects sales in the third quarter to increase
16%-20% sequentially, up from the previous guidance of around 6%-10%. The new
guidance implies revenues between $481 million and $498 million in the December
quarter. 

Management increased sales guidance, primarily due to the broad-based strength
across all end-market categories and geographies. The company now projects gross
margin around 64%, up from the earlier estimate of 62%-63%. 

The company is expected to report third quarter results on January 20, 2010. We
upgrade our rating on the stock from NEUTRAL to OUTPERFORM in view of the
expected strong performance in the coming quarters. 

Bear of the Day: 

Accuray Incorporated (Nasdaq: ARAY) designs, develops and sells the CyberKnife
System, an image-guided robotic radiosurgery system used for the treatment of
solid tumors. The company was badly affected by reimbursement uncertainties
surrounding its products. 

This was reflected in Accuray's top and bottom line performance in the first
quarter of fiscal 2010. Accuray reported a net loss of $0.06 per share in the
first quarter, compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a net loss of $0.03
per share and unchanged from the year-ago figure. 

Total revenues declined 9.5% year over year in the reported quarter. We
downgrade the stock to Underperform with a target price of $6.

JPMorgan Beats on Surging Profits

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company`s (NYSE: JPM) 4th quarter earnings came in at 74 cents
per share, substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents. This
also compares favorably with earnings of 6 cents in the prior-year quarter. 

Better-than-expected results of JPMorgan were primarily aided by continued
strong performance of the company's Investment Bank. All other segments except
Consumer Lending and Card Services also delivered solid results during the
quarter. However, high levels of consumer credit costs and increased provisions
for credit losses were primary factors, which negatively impacted results. 

Net income available to common shareholders was $3.3 billion, compared to $3.6
billion in the prior quarter and $702 million in the prior-year quarter. The
year-over-year increase was driven by higher net revenue, largely offset by
higher provision for credit losses and non-interest expense. 

For full year 2009, JPMorgan`s net income came in at $11.7 billion or $2.26 per
share, more than double that of $5.6 billion or $1.35 per share in 2008. 

Industrial Production Rises

The overall picture is one of an economy that lost a bit of steam in December
after a big surge in November. It is too early to tell if this is simply a
little bit of a pause, or if the November strength was just a sugar rush due to
economic stimulus efforts that will prove to be unsustainable. 

The fact that overall industrial production growth matched that of November is
deceptive; although to be fair, the cold snap that helped Utility output might
have had a bit of an adverse effect on manufacturing output (though that effect
is probably very small, certainly relative to the positive effect it had on
Utility output). While the surge in Utility output will help the earnings of the
major electric utilities like American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP) and Con Ed
(NYSE: ED) in the fourth quarter, it is not really a sign of better overall
economic health.

&lt;p&gt;Marks First Premera Customer to Integrate Paid Claims Data into Microsoft
HealthVault 
MOUNTLAKE TERRACE, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
Premera Blue Cross today announced an important collaboration with Microsoft
aimed at providing Microsoft employees with integrated, personal health records.
Premera is combining its data and expertise with Microsoft`s technology to
provide the company`s employees with greater visibility to their spending and
healthcare claims through a connection to Microsoft HealthVault - a personal
health application platform available to consumers. 

HealthVault Empowers Individuals &amp; Families

Microsoft employees and families accessing their Premera health benefits online
can now send Explanation of Benefits (EOB) data to their personal HealthVault
account. Users will then be able to share and take their health information
wherever, whenever, and however they wish. This flexibility includes the ability
to share health information with people such as family, healthcare providers,
and fitness professionals. 

"This is a continued step forward to provide peace of mind to our members about
their healthcare coverage," said Gubby Barlow, CEO of Premera. "We believe our
members will find great value in expanded access to their personal health
records. Premera is thrilled with this partnership with Microsoft and looks
forward to making HealthVault available to additional customers in 2010." 

Vivacity Adds to the Value of HealthVault

A unique feature of the HealthVault experience for Microsoft employees and
families will be the Vivacity Spending Scout, which allows users to analyze
their own claims data, track and understand their healthcare spending, and plan
for future expenditures. Vivacity is a company delivering integrated,
employer-based wellness programs. The Spending Scout tool will be an integral
part of an expanded HealthVault experience for Premera`s members. 

"At Microsoft, we encourage our employees to take an active role in managing
their health, which includes using tools such as HealthVault to store and share
their health information," said Brady Jensen, Group Manager, Global Benefits for
Microsoft. "This offering will enable our employees both to better understand
their healthcare spending and then share that information through HealthVault
with healthcare providers and applications to help them make more informed
decisions in support of their health." 

HealthVault Use to Expand Throughout 2010

This partnership between Premera and Microsoft marks the first time HealthVault
will incorporate paid claims data to allow users more complete access to
personal health information. Premera plans to make this innovation available to
additional customers throughout 2010.

coverage. We provide health coverage and related services to more than 1.4

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 10 years ago, on April 3, 2000, U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered that Microsoft be broken up into two companies -- one to develop and sell operating systems, and the other to develop and sell other types of software. The order came as a result of a federal antitrust suit against the company and a finding of fact that said Microsoft had abused its monopoly power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackson's order was overturned by an appeals court , and in November 2001, Microsoft and the U.S. Justice Department settled; Microsoft was allowed to stay intact. At the time, Microsoft officials breathed a sigh of relief that they would not have to break up the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years on, Microsoft is struggling to maintain its dominance in a world in which Google thrives, Apple is resurgent, and the Internet has arguably become more important than operating systems. Where would Microsoft be today if it had been split in two a decade ago? There's no way to know, of course, but I think there's a reasonable chance that the two resulting companies would have thrived and been better able to fend off Google, Apple and other competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would two Microsofts be better off today than one? The primary reason is that a split might have altered the corporate culture and led to different business and investment decisions. In 2000, Microsoft had no serious competition, either in operating systems or productivity suites. Both Windows and Microsoft Office were virtual monopolies. The company was a money machine with no serious challengers in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years since then, Microsoft behaved as corporations normally do when they have a monopoly or near-monopoly and have hit on a successful business plan that brought enormous success for several decades: It kept doing what made it a success. That meant milking Windows and Office for all they were worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, Microsoft knew that the Internet was important and would be increasingly so, but it felt no compelling need to change its way of doing business. It acted as if it had all the time in the world to become dominant on the Internet. After all, Internet Explorer had become the world's most dominant browser, and the company already had the most dominant operating system and the most dominant productivity suite. What could go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty, as it turns out. Because Microsoft moved so slowly on Internet search and other Web-based services, it allowed Google to become the dominant Internet company. And it also allowed competitors to beat it in creating operating systems for mobile devices -- just look at Apple's iPhone and Google's Android operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft had been split into two companies, all this may not have happened. The operating system company might have recognized that as a one-trick pony, it needed to expand its market in order to thrive, and thus may well have put more focus on developing a killer operating system for mobile devices. Mobile may have become a focus rather than an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the application software company may have had to expand beyond its core and may have recognized that Web-based applications and services were the future. That would have meant moving on Internet search earlier and not ceding the market to Google. And it would have meant moving Office to the Web much more quickly as well. Google Apps might have been no threat at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no proof that all this would have happened. It's possible that Microsoft, cut in two, would have been more vulnerable to competitors than it is as a single behemoth. But I think there's a good chance that it would be in a better position today if it had been split up 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preston Gralla is a contributing editor for Computerworld.com and the author of more than 35 books, includingHow the Internet Works(Que, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq and a group led by U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) will sign a final deal for the development of the 8.7-billion barrel West Qurna Phase One oilfield on January 25, an Iraqi Oil Ministry official said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Exxon Mobil-led consortium won the right to develop the supergiant oilfield in negotiations last year with the ministry following the country's June oilfield auction, the first since the 2003 U.S. invasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and its partners on Monday agreed to proposed contract amendments submitted by the Oil Ministry, paving the way for a final deal, said Sabah Abdul Kadhim, the head of the legal section of Iraq's Petroleum Contracts and Licensing Directorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We both signed onto the amendments and the Oil Ministry set the 25th of this month to sign the final contract to develop West Qurna Phase One with Exxon Mobil," Kadhim told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress on the agreement to boost output from the large oilfield to 2.325 million barrels per day from 279,000 bpd now came as the Oil Ministry signed a final contract with Malaysia's Petronas PETR.UL and Japan Exploration Co (Japex) (1662.T) to develop the smaller Gharaf oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gharaf, a field with estimated reserves of 900 million barrels, was won by Petronas and Japex in a fierce competition in Iraq's December auction of oil contracts, the second since the U.S. invasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a very proud moment for me and we are looking forward to working with our partner North Oil Company... I'm sure we will able to achieve targeted production levels," Datuk Abdullah Karim, Petronas' managing director, said in a speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi Oil Minister Hussain ad-Sharistani, who attended the signing ceremony, said his ministry will establish a new state-run oil company -- named Dhi Qar Oil Company after the province where Gharaf is located -- when production from the field reaches higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deals emerging as a result of the two tenders last year have the potential to take Iraqi capacity to 12 million barrels per day -- rivaling top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia -- from 2.5 million bpd now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD Jan 18 (Reuters) - Iraq and a group led by U.S. oil
major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) will sign a final deal for the
development of the 8.7-billion barrel West Qurna Phase One
oilfield on Jan. 25, an Iraqi Oil Ministry official said on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; An Exxon Mobil-led consortium won the right to develop the
super-giant oilfield in negotiations last year with the ministry
following the country's June oilfield auction, the first since
the 2003 U.S. invasion.

percent on Monday, hit by broad selling after JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) reported hefty fourth-quarter loan losses, raising
concern that the market's recent rally may be overdone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Political uncertainty also weighed, with investors worried a
funding scandal linked to a ruling party executive may hamper
parliamentary debate on an extra budget, although market players
said the impact was relatively limited so far. [ID:nTOE60G020]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There may be concern about the possibility of some disorder
in parliament," said Kiyoshi Noda, chief fund manager for MU
Investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But the reason equities have been rising has a lot to do
with the strength of external demand, and I do not think market
players have switched from that scenario," Noda said, referring
to market expectations for a recovery in the global economy to
continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benchmark Nikkei .N225 fell 127.02 points to 10,855.08
after rising 0.7 percent on Friday to its highest finish since
October 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broader Topix .TOPX retreated 0.9 percent to 957.55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Commodity trading advisers and hedge funds likely took
positions on Friday in Asian stocks, particularly Japanese
shares, expecting that U.S. stocks would climb, said Tsuyoshi
Segawa, an equity strategist at Mizuho Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Disappointing earnings from JPMorgan triggered a fall on
Wall Street and that is forcing these investors to reverse their
positions," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These foreign investors, who have supported the Tokyo market
since December, are also reluctant to take positions as U.S.
markets will be closed overnight, also dampening the market's
recent upward momentum."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. markets will be closed on Monday for Martin Luther King,
Jr. Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Japanese shares underperformed compared to their
overseas peers for the whole of 2009, they enjoyed a stellar
December and have stayed on a solid footing so far in January,
with the broader Topix having risen 5.5 percent this month
compared to a roughly 2 percent gain in MSCI's index of global
shares .MIWD00000PUS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dollar's rebound off a 14-year low against the yen hit in
late November, as well as strengthening expectations for a steady
recovery in the United States, have helped buoy Japanese equities
in the past couple of months, market players said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of companies that have recently booked sharp gains
amid the broad market rally lost ground on Monday on concern that
their prices may have advanced too far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Panasonic Corp (6752.T), the world's largest plasma
TV maker, fell 1.2 percent to 1,534 yen. Shares of Panasonic have
risen roughly 19 percent in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other declining shares included Nippon Oil 5001.T, which
fell 2.9 percent to 432 yen after Iraq's oil minister said on
Sunday a group of companies led by the Japanese refiner was
"stalling" in talks to develop the Nassiriya oilfield and that a
deal had to be done by Jan. 24 or Iraq would go it alone.

&lt;p&gt;IBM on Tuesday reported a 10 percent jump in profit for the fourth quarter as revenue increased at the company for the first time in more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM reported a profit of US$3.59 per share, up from $3.27 in the same quarter last year and ahead of the $3.47 that financial analysts had been expecting, according to Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue for the quarter was $27.2 billion, up 1 percent from the same period last year. Analysts had been expecting revenue to be essentially flat with the year earlier. It was the first year-over-year revenue growth IBM has reported since the third quarter of 2008. Quarterly net income was $4.8 billion, up 9 percent from the same quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are confident about 2010 and our ability to achieve the high end of our long-term roadmap," Chairman and CEO Sam Palmisano said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 3 percent drop in sales from the Americas was offset by a 2 percent increase in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and a 6 percent increase in Asia. IBM's results benefitted from currency fluctuations. At constant currency, IBM's overall revenue would have declined 5 percent, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from IBM Global Services was up 2 percent, and software revenue increased by the same amount. WebSphere sales were up 13 percent year over year, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales from its Systems and Technology segment, which includes IBM's servers, continued to decline, but by less than in recent quarters. Overall revenue for the segment was down 4 percent to $5.2 billion. System p and System z products saw revenue decline by 14 percent and 27 percent, respectively, while sales of System x servers increased 37 percent, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are the latest sign that IT spending is gradually recovering. Last week Intel reported a fourth-quarter profit of $2.28 billion, or $0.40, an improvement from a year earlier despite including a $1.25 billion legal settlement with Advanced Micro Devices. Intel's revenue was up 28 percent, though largely on consumer sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also last week Forrester Research said the U.S. IT market will grow by 6.6 percent this year and declared the tech downturn of 2008 and 2009 to be "unofficially over." As evidence it cited a 4 percent increase in fourth-quarter revenue reported by Oracle, and the "cautious optimism" for 2010 expressed by Accenture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today announced that it will issue an emergency security update for Internet Explorer (IE), but postponed setting a ship date for the fix until tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Given the significant level of attention this issue has generated, confusion about what customers can do to protect themselves and the escalating threat environment, Microsoft will release a security update out-of-band for this vulnerability," said George Stathakopoulos, general manager of the Trustworthy Computing Security group, in an entry on the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We take the decision to go out-of-band very seriously, given the impact to customers, but we believe releasing an update out-of-band update is the right decision at this time," Stathakopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was inevitable, given all the hubbub," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security, in an instant message today. Last week, Storms predicted Microsoft would rush out an update before the next regularly-scheduled Patch Tuesday of Feb. 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IE flaw has gained more attention than most zero-day bugs because it has been linked to the attacks that broke into Google 's corporate network last month. Google has claimed that the attacks originated in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have been busy building exploits since the original attack code went public last Thursday. Today, for example, a noted American vulnerability researcher and a French security company disclosed that they had created exploits that worked on the newer IE7 and IE8 , and could bypass the DEP (data execution prevention) protection that Microsoft has been touting since it acknowledged the bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he did over the weekend, Stathakopoulos downplayed the threat again today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to see very limited, and in some cases, targeted attacks," he said, adding that the only successful attacks found thus far have aimed at IE6. Stathakopoulos's phrasing, however, was different today than Sunday, when he last blogged, leaving it open to interpretation whether Microsoft has covertly confirmed reports from others that hackers are already leveraging the IE vulnerability in Web-based drive-by attacks .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rarely issues out-of-band security updates. The last time it did so was July 2009, when it patched IE just hours before several researchers demonstrated a critical vulnerability at a security conference. Prior to the 2009 fix, Microsoft's most recent emergency update was a Windows patch in October 2008. That vulnerability was later exploited by the notorious Conficker worm .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Government agencies and smaller businesses may be moving to low-cost online productivity suites like Google Apps, but enterprises, mostly because of security fears and Office compatibility, are still going the desktop route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A November survey of 2,000 IT decision-makers by research firm Forrester revealed that 80 percent of companies surveyed support some version of Microsoft Office, and 78 percent have no plans for implementing an alternative to Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, last June Forrester surveyed 152 IT decision-makers at companies of all sizes, and 92 percent were supporting either Office 2007 or Office 2003 or earlier. Only 3.3 percent were using Google Apps; 2.6 percent were using Sun StarOffice 8 or 9; and 1.9 percent were using Lotus Symphony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As enterprises plan for or deploy Windows 7, upgrades to Office 2010 and SharePoint 2010, both now in beta and set for general release in first half of this year, are more likely to be part of an overhaul strategy, according to a recent report from research firm Forrester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the changes that come with software upgrades can be difficult to manage. The Forrester report offers advice on how to deal the disruptions that will come with enterprise upgrades to Office 2010, which includes new and unproven social networking and Web-based features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three things for enterprises to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assess Licensing Program Options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies with license programs that allow free upgrades should plan to move to Office 2010 early in the year, writes Forrester, especially for power users that will make good use of productivity-enhancing features in Excel or benefit from the external collaboration updates with SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deal with Files Proactively, Not as Afterthoughts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same policies and tools for managing an enterprise's IT infrastructure should apply to managing Office files. Report author and Forrester analyst Sheri McLeish writes: "Given the potential disruption that can result from broken links and macros, file incompatibility, and other unforeseen challenges, firms will benefit from understanding what content is active and what is archived."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know Where Social Media Technologies Fit with Productivity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Office 2010, Microsoft is attempting to reinvent the e-mail inbox by integrating Outlook with social networking sites such as LinkedIn. But Forrester warns that it's not clear if and how this will boost productivity versus being a distraction and possible security risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep such features from becoming a hindrance, the social media integration tool, called Outlook Social Connector, can be turned off or limited to internal social sites such as SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As enterprises increasingly block access to sites like Facebook, it's important to know where greater connectivity and context can improve collaboration," writes McLeish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM raised its 2010 profit target and reported a stronger-than-expected, 9 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings, as cost cuts and a shift to more profitable contracts helped it weather a slump in corporate spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM's share price fell 2 percent after the results, however, as the results failed to encourage more buying in the shares which already rallied nearly 60 percent in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said International Business Machines Corp had set a high bar for itself, noting that the world's leading technology services company has not missed earnings estimates since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there were some pretty big expectations built in, and you really needed to wow it," Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Morgan, said after the results were issued on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ted Parrish, co-portfolio manager at Henssler Equity Fund, added: "While I think the long-term prospects for the company are good, I think the shares are a bit frothy, not overvalued but I would say the stock isn't going to do as well as it did in 2009."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While IBM's results failed to excite Wall Street, they added to evidence that corporate technology spending is recovering, coming just days after another technology powerhouse, Intel Corp, posted results that topped expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strong numbers also show IBM's efforts to cut costs and shift from commoditized hardware to services and software businesses are paying dividends, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, it is the world's largest IT services company, providing technology outsourcing, automation and support.

 NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) raised its 2010
profit target and reported a stronger-than-expected, 9 percent
increase in fourth-quarter earnings, as cost cuts and a shift
to more profitable contracts helped it weather a slump in
corporate spending.

 IBM's share price fell 2 percent after the results,
however, as the results failed to encourage more buying in the
shares which already rallied nearly 60 percent in the past
year.

 Some analysts said International Business Machines Corp had
set a high bar for itself, noting that the world's leading
technology services company has not missed earnings estimates
since 2005.

 "I think there were some pretty big expectations built in,
and you really needed to wow it," Stephen Massocca, managing
director at Wedbush Morgan, said after the results were issued
on Tuesday.

 Ted Parrish, co-portfolio manager at Henssler Equity Fund,
added: "While I think the long-term prospects for the company
are good, I think the shares are a bit frothy, not overvalued
but I would say the stock isn't going to do as well as it did
in 2009."

 While IBM's results failed to excite Wall Street, they
added to evidence that corporate technology spending is
recovering, coming just days after another technology
powerhouse, Intel Corp (INTC.O), posted results that topped
expectations.

 The strong numbers also show IBM's efforts to cut costs and
shift from commoditized hardware to services and software
businesses are paying dividends, analysts said.

 Today, it is the world's largest IT services company,
providing technology outsourcing, automation and support. Such
contracts have not only helped boost IBM's profitability, but
they have also helped shelter the company from the worst of the
global economic crisis.

 IBM said it now expects profit of at least $11 a share in
2010 compared with its previous target of $10 to $11 per
share.

 IBM's fourth-quarter profit rose 9 percent to $4.8 billion,
or $3.59 a share, from $4.4 billion, or $3.27 a share, a year
earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $3.47 per
share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

 Quarterly revenue rose 1 percent to $27.2 billion,
surpassing estimates, and IBM forecast more revenue growth in
the first quarter.

 Analysts said they were particularly impressed, if not
surprised, by the quarterly gross profit margin of 48.3
percent, up 0.4 points, in the quarter.

 "IBM is just a machine. Throughout the downturn, they have

Andy Miedler, an analyst with Edward Jones.

 Shares of IBM fell 2 percent after ending regular trading
at $134.14, up $2.36, on the New York Stock Exchange.

 Some analysts said the long-term outlook for the company
was still solid and that the shares could resume their gains if
the global economic recovery turns out stronger than expected.

 "There is far more for the global economy to go and there
is a significant amount of acceleration that is going on in the
global economy, and IBM will be a beneficiary of that," said

 (Adds IBM's after-hours stock activity and volume)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose broadly on
Tuesday, lifting the Dow and the SP 500 to fresh 15-month
closing highs as investors bet a potential Republican victory
in Massachusetts' Senate race could stall Obama's reform
agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street also got a boost from technology shares, which
rallied in anticipation of strong earnings from bellwether
International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), which rose 1.8
percent to $134.14, making it the Dow's top boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, after the bell, IBM delivered quarterly earnings
that beat Wall Street's forecasts. For details, see
[ID:nN19218960]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But healthcare shares rallied the most in the regular
session on hopes that policy gridlock in Washington would slow
the healthcare overhaul, removing a threat to the profits of
insurers and drug companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP Healthcare Index .GSPA climbed 2 percent, with
drug company Eli Lilly (LLY.N), up 4.4 percent at $37.41, among
the standouts. Health insurers' shares also rallied briskly,
with Humana Inc (HUM.N), up 7.1 percent at $51.94.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Massachusetts voters were deciding a tight race on Tuesday
to replace the late Edward Kennedy, a Democrat. The loss of one
seat in the U.S. Senate could hurt the Democrats' ability to
proceed to a vote on the planned healthcare overhaul that
seemed to be in the final stages of the legislative
process.[ID:nN18159712]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A Republican win would be a positive for the markets since
it would mean increased potential for gridlock in Washington,"
said Carmine Grigoli, chief U.S. strategist at Mizuho
Securities USA in New York. "This is probably especially true
now, given the very large social agenda of the Obama
administration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI jumped 115.78
points, or 1.09 percent, to end at 10,725.43. The Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX shot up 14.20 points, or 1.25 percent,
to 1,150.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC climbed 32.41
points, or 1.42 percent, to 2,320.40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reform bills under debate in Congress would reshape the
healthcare insurance market through new regulations, taxes and
other changes. The healthcare overhaul is President Barack
Obama's top domestic priority, and the White House said on
Tuesday that Obama does not believe healthcare reform is dead
even should the Democrat, Martha Coakley, lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) gained 4.2 percent to
$32.66. Drugmaker Merck  Co (MRK.N), a Dow component, gained 3
percent to $40.62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow also received a boost from McDonald's Corp (MCD.N)
after Credit Suisse upgraded the fast food giant, saying its
international businesses were a potential driver of earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McDonald's stock gained 1.9 percent to $63.48 and was the
Dow's third top percentage gainer, ranking behind 3M Co
(MMM.N), up 2.1 percent at $85.12. [ID:nSGE60I0I0]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All 10 SP 500 industry sectors ended in positive
territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strong momentum carried the Dow and the SP 500 to fresh
15-month closing highs and lifted the Nasdaq to its highest
close in 16 months. The SP 500 is now up 70 percent since
hitting bottom in early March 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM SLIPS DESPITE OUTLOOK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of large-cap technology companies, including Apple
Inc (AAPL.O), boosted the Nasdaq before IBM's earnings. Apple,
the maker of the iPhone, was up 4.4 percent at $215.04.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The PHLX Semiconductor Index .SOXX advanced 1.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp, a major technology
services company, also raised its profit target for 2010, but
its stock dipped 0.5 percent to $133.40 in after-hours trading
as some investors booked profits following their strong run-up
recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup Inc (C.N) rose 3.5 percent to $3.54 in regular
trading after it reported a fourth-quarter loss that narrowed
from the previous year. The loss came on charges linked to
repaying government funds, following JPMorgan Chase  Co's
(JPM.N) disappointing results on Friday. [ID:nN19205676]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N was the biggest drag on the Dow,
falling 0.6 percent to $29.41 after it agreed to a revised
cash-and-stock deal to buy Cadbury CBRY.L for about $19.6
billion. [ID:nL9294700]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other acquisition news, Tyco International (TYC.N)
agreed to buy Broadview Security, which operates as Brink's

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - IBM Corp on Tuesday raised its profit target for 2010 and reported higher fourth-quarter earnings, as cost cuts and a shift to more profitable contracts helped the world's leading technology services company weather a slump in corporate spending.&lt;/p&gt;

We believe shares are still attractively priced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The outlook for 2010 is positive. I think investors were already expecting a slightly raised outlook. We think there is still plenty of room for upside. Now IBM shares are trading at only 12 times (forward earnings) estimates. For a company that executes as consistently and has as solid a long-term earnings prospect as IBM, we think there is plenty of room for shares to move higher."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOU MISCIOSCIA, ANALYST, BRIGANTINE ADVISORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM took up the high end of its prior 2010 target to 'at least $11 per share.' Our current estimate for next year is $11.10 per share. We view that as being conservative, because we believe that technology spending is starting to improve broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Services signings of $18.8 billion beat our number by about $1 billion. That's a nice number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he was not surprised that the stock traded down on the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A bit of a selloff, even a couple of points, would not be unexpected, only because of today's rally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston, Gina Keating in Los Angeles and Caroline Valetkevitch in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced fourth-quarter 2009 diluted earnings of $3.59
per share compared with diluted earnings of $3.27 per share in the fourth
quarter of 2008, an increase of 10 percent. 

Fourth-quarter net income was $4.8 billion compared with $4.4 billion in the

to benefit from our strategic transformation, offerings that our clients value
in this economy, and our commitment to developing countries around the world. 

"In 2009, we invested in opportunities such as Smarter Planet solutions, cloud
computing and advanced analytics. These new capabilities position IBM to grow as
the economy recovers. The increased operational leverage we have established by
creating a globally integrated enterprise will enable us to drive greater
profits as revenue growth returns. We are confident about 2010 and our ability
to achieve the high end of our long-term roadmap." 

The company said it expects full-year 2010 diluted earnings-per-share
expectations of at least $11.00.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Longtime rivals Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc find themselves on different ends of the pay debate as the surviving Wall Street titans prepare to disclose their fourth-quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman is expected to finish its blockbuster year with another quarter of multibillion-dollar profits, padding its bonus pool -- all while bracing for a fresh round of criticism for its lavish pay soon after U.S. taxpayers rescued the financial services industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley -- widely seen as mistiming its pullback from risk -- is expected to report an annual loss and is stretching to stay competitive on pay with rivals. Morgan Stanley was late to the rebound, reporting a profit in the third quarter after three straight losing quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with political pressure in the backdrop, both firms are expected to pay up after bonus levels sagged last year amid the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is probably going to overshadow what will probably be decent quarters for both companies," said Walter Todd, a portfolio manager with Greenwood Capital Associates. "The market is going to focus on the compensation side of the equation and not necessarily on the fundamentals, which should be good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is on pace to set aside $22.3 billion for compensation last year, eclipsing the previous record $20.2 billion it set in 2007. Morgan Stanley is on pace to set aside $14.5 billion for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NUMBERS GAME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks could reduce those figures if they shrink their compensation ratios in the fourth quarter. Such a move would bow to public pressure, while bolstering earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banks historically set aside half of their net revenue for compensation expenses, but JPMorgan Chase  Co, for example, reduced its ratio to just 11 percent in the fourth quarter while still paying out record compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's ratio was 47 percent for the first nine months of the year and Morgan Stanley's was about 64 percent. Morgan Stanley's ratio was inflated by the addition of brokers stemming from the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture, and because of accounting charges related to the appreciation of the value of its debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Hecht, an analyst with JMP Securities, said a ratio reduction "could really move the needle" for earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It still leaves these companies in a position where they are paying people very competitively," Hecht said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs this week delayed announcing payouts to staff as the debate over bonuses heated up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters are also expecting to march on Goldman's headquarters after the firm reports earnings on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are expected to pay most of their top performers' and managers' salaries in equity instead of cash, a nod to an industry trend to reward long-term performance and curb short-term risk. Credit Suisse, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America have made similar changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCALING BACK RISK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If JPMorgan results are an indicator, Goldman and Morgan Stanley will have scaled back risk in the fourth quarter. JPMorgan reduced its total trading value at risk (VaR) to $163 million in the fourth quarter from $302 million a year ago, a 46 percent drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VaR, which is one measure of risk, stands for the maximum that could potentially be lost trading on a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk in fixed income trading at JPMorgan declined 38 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, foreshadowing a slump in an area which has bolstered investment banking profits in the first three quarters. Nearly half of Goldman's third-quarter revenue came from fixed income, currency, and commodities trading business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Goldman is expected to report earnings of $5.19 per share and Morgan Stanley is expecting profit of 36 cents per share, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Goldman lost $4.97 a share and Morgan Stanley lost $11.35 a share in fourth quarter of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of the taxpayer bailout and consequent rebound, the Obama administration is proposing a fee to help the government recover losses from the rescue. Goldman Sachs had an effective income tax rate of 32 percent in the first nine months, while Morgan Stanley reported an average rate of 38.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had a tax rate of less than 1 percent last year because of "changes in geographic earnings mix."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both banks were probably helped in the fourth quarter of 2009 by rebounding MA activity and a slew of new IPOs. Morgan Stanley ranked first in the worldwide MA rankings in 2009, while Goldman ranked second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's earnings could be as much 13.5 percent below the consensus according to Thomson Reuters StarMine's SmartEstimate, a consensus estimate that gives more weight to recent forecasts by top-rated analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, StarMine's SmartEstimates shows that Goldman Sachs' fourth-quarter earnings could be as much as 3.3 percent above the $5.19 a share consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission set a Feb. 19 deadline for its review of Microsoft's planned Internet search tie-up with Yahoo Tuesday.The deal will hand Microsoft full access to Yahoo's search engine so it can be used to help enhance its own search engine, Bing. Yahoo is the nearest challenger to Google, the most popular search engine  in Europe. Bing, launched last year, remains a tiny contender with a European market share Microsoft estimates at 2 percent.All mergers and joint ventures involving large corporations are routinely given a one-month examination by the Commission's competition department. If any concerns about the deal's impact on fair competition arise then officials can open a second phase review of an additional four months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM is helping iPhones go corporate this week, with the introduction of a free plug in that allows Notes users to read their encrypted e-mail on the Apple smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A version for Google's Nexus One and other Android handsets will be offered later this year, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also new this week at Lotusphere 2010: More IBM applications for BlackBerry users, who will get new clients for Lotus Quickr collaboration and Lotus Connections social networking. A client for Lotus Sametime instant messaging is already available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion said it was licensing Connections for use among its own employees. IBM, meanwhile, announced that, for the first time, it would begin selling BlackBerry hardware to its corporate customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and RIM are enterprise stalwarts, with many years of corporate IT sales. Not so for Apple's iPhone, which many IT departments view as an insecure consumer devices and don't allow them on their networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could change with the introduction of Lotus Notes Traveler Companion. The plug-in allows iPhone users to see encrypted Domino e-mail as a link that, after the user enters their Traveler password, can be opened and responded to on the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exiting Traveler clears the decrypted e-mail from the device, leaving no trace of the secure messages, IBM said. Basic calendar functions, such as accepting and declining meetings, are also provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, IBM added native iPhone support to its Domino e-mail platform, including push delivery and access to calendars and contact lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM announcements are just the latest sign that mobile enterprise applications are beginning to catch on: Last week, HP and Microsoft announced a $250 million effort to build infrastructure for corporate mobility customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, which recently introduced its Nexus One consumer smartphone has said the next version will be targeted at business customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Coursey has been writing about technology products and companies for more than 25 years.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced plans to cut the length of time it stores IP addresses of Web searchers using its Bing search engine from 18 months to six in a bid to improve its privacy track record. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rival Google cut retention times to nine months from 18 in August 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft executives said Tuesday that their initiative goes much further than Google did, because Microsoft will delete all parts of the IP (Internet Protocol) address after six months, while Google still retains part of the address after its self-imposed nine-month cut-off point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will take Microsoft between 12 and 18 months to introduce the new tighter data retention policy, it said in a blog posting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies are responding to pressure from European data protection officials, who are concerned about the privacy implications of retaining an IP address. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Article 29 committee, comprising data protection officials from all 27 E.U. countries, has asked the leading search engine makers to respond to their concerns by the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IP addresses cannot positively identify the person sitting at a computer or accessing the Net via their phone, but they can identify the computer or phone being used, and the hardware can often be linked to a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Google both argue that the less data the search engine has, the less well the search engine can respond to a person's specific needs. They also point out that keeping search data helps them combat Internet fraud and spam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However Brendon Lynch, Microsoft's director of privacy policy, said the Bing search experience won't be compromised by the reduction to a six-month retention time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Quality of search won't be reduced but privacy will be enhanced," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Vassallo, Microsoft's VP for E.U. affairs and its associate general counsel urged rival search companies and in particular the largest search provider, Google, to follow suit in further reducing retention times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There should be a common standard across the industry. The largest search provider collects more data than anyone else. We think it is critical that the market leader matches this," Vassallo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Yahoo, another popular search engine, weren't immediately able to comment on the move by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google spokesman Bill Echikson said his company would soon submit a written response to the Article 29 committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google will soon submit a written response to the Article 29 committee but it won't change its nine-month retention policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're committed to using data to both improve our services and our security measures for our users and protect their privacy, and we remain convinced that our current logs retention policy represents a responsible balance," said Google's global privacy counse, Peter Fleischer, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer says emerging markets will be profitable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Focus on China, Mexico, Turkey, Brazil, Russia, India&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Sees further acquisitions in emerging markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The head of Pfizer Inc's
(PFE.N) emerging markets unit said on Tuesday that the
drugmaker's plans for a big push into high-growth
underdeveloped countries is still very much a work in progress,
but one that will eventually yield solid profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The psychology that emerging markets is not profitable is
a myth," Jean-Michel Halfon, Pfizer's president of emerging
markets, told a group of reporters at the company's New York
headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Halfon said about 75 percent of pharmaceutical sales growth
will come from emerging markets in the next 3 to 5 years, and
the world's largest drugmaker aims to be a significant player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Pfizer has had a presence in emerging markets for
50 years but is gearing up for a much bigger and broader push
now, with an initial focus on the most promising of those
markets: China, Mexico, Turkey, Brazil, Russia and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also cited Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Taiwan as
promising areas of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer of course is not alone in its push, with most major
pharmaceutical companies looking to China and other emerging
markets as potential new sources of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer had third-quarter sales from emerging markets of
about $1.6 billion, which represented growth of 9 percent.
Including revenue from recently acquired Wyeth, that quarterly
figure would have been between $2 billion and $2.1 billion,
Halfon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although he declined to forecast emerging market sales for
2010, on an annualized basis that would be about $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Halfon said the childhood disease vaccine Prevnar and
rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel -- both acquired with Wyeth --
would be big growth drivers in developing markets, as would
oncology medicines and specialty drugs. He said the cholesterol
fighter Lipitor, kidney cancer drug Sutent and Lyrica pain and
anti-seizure medicine were also doing very well overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have a very broad portfolio because of our heritage of
acquisitions, but to build partnerships in emerging markets in
the future we will need a broader profile," Halfon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will need more Aurobindos to build our portfolio," he
added, referring to a licensing deal Pfizer signed with the
Indian company Aurobindo Pharma Ltd (ARBN.BO) last May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More recently, Pfizer struck a collaboration deal with
India's Strides Arcolab Ltd (STAR.BO) that will significantly
expand its injectable generics business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 2011 China is expected to become the world's
third-largest pharmaceutical market. Halfon called China, which
is currently No. 5 globally, "a market ready for consolidation"
and one in which Pfizer aims "to play a catalyst role" not only
commercially, but in research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He sees Shanghai becoming the nerve center of Pfizer's
Asian strategy. "We feel Shanghai will play a significant role
in China and Asia," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We need to move step by step," Halfon said. "This is
difficult. We're trying to manage profitability, but at the
same time reach patients we have not reached before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Halfon declined to provide any forecasts of just how
profitable emerging markets could become for Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Profitability comes from low-cost manufacturing. We're
working on it," Halfon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Governments in the developing world are looking for
low-cost solutions. Low-cost solutions developed in emerging
markets could be useful everywhere," Halfon predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm not talking about a quick win here, but a very
important direction."

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Disney's troubled Hong Kong Disneyland theme park made a net loss of HK$1.315 billion ($169.4 million) last year while attracting 4.6 million visitors, in its first major admission of its financial performance since its opening in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since opening to great fanfare, Disney's first magic kingdom in China has struggled to attract the expected flood of visitors from mainland China, although its performance had been difficult to gauge given Disney's initial refusal to fully disclose key results and attendance figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A paper by Hong Kong's Tourism Commission for local lawmakers, however, said Hong Kong Disneyland made the net loss in 2009 partly because of the "unfavorable impact" of the H1N1 swine flu outbreak and the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, released on Tuesday, added that the park made a net loss of HK$1.574 billion in 2008, while hotel occupancy rates stood at 70 percent in 2009, a drop of eight percent from 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would like to point out that (Hong Kong Disneyland) is a long-term asset that grows over time and it is still in its early years of development," the paper said, while noting the park's continued cost containment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong government, however, which has a 52 percent stake in the park -- the Walt Disney Company holds the other 48 percent -- expressed disappointment with the park's results, calling on it to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are concerned about the situation and are dissatisfied with the financial performance (of Hong Kong Disneyland)," said Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Rita Lau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The park saw 4.6 million visitors in 2009, 2 percent more than 2008, generating revenues of HK$2.541 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's attendance was lower than Disney's first-year attendance target of 5.6 million, which it just missed. After the park's expansion, however, the number of visitors is expected to swell to between 5.2 million-8 million visitors by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The park initially said it hoped to attract 10 million visitors per year after 15 years. With attendance falling short of targets, the government has been seeking ways to boost the number of visitors in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theme park, Disney's smallest, is now undergoing a $468 million expansion aimed at bolstering its competitiveness with a rival Disneyland that is scheduled to open in Shanghai in the next five or six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the expansion deal, partly financed by the Hong Kong government, Disney pledged to boost the transparency of its operations by releasing annual operating and financial results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by James Pomfret; editing by Ken Wills and Rupert Winchester)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is likely to unveil the details of multi-million pound bonuses to staff next week, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, after a delay as a row heats up over payouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, the focus of much of the public outrage over excessive bonuses, had been expected to give staff the outline of their payouts on Monday, in line with previous years when bankers are told a couple of days before full-year results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff were not told in advance this year, however, but will hear next week, the source said. The bank is due to announce results on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As banks head into one of the most controversial bonus seasons of recent years, they face mounting regulatory and political hurdles -- not least the introduction of a controversial 50 percent tax on bonuses in Britain and moves by France, the United States and other countries to prevent banks making hefty payouts so soon after being bailed out by taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has also shifted to a calendar year for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Daily Telegraph reported that the Financial Services Authority, Britain's financial regulator, had taken issue with Goldman's bonus plans, effectively blocking them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FSA and Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulator has in the past blocked awards due to issues with the structure of compensation, but not the level of pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to a 50 percent British tax on bonuses, the regulator has imposed tough pay rules across the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOD'S WORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has sparked outrage among critics for preparing to pay more than $20 billion in compensation this year, only months after benefiting from a $10 billion U.S. taxpayer bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some insiders have blamed the Wall Street powerhouse for not taking a more restrained approach and for stoking public anger. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein ruffled feathers last month when he said his and other banks were doing "God's work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top investment banks appear to have been stung by the latest backlash but it is unclear whether they will rein in pay plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan (JPM.N) on Friday said it would pay a record $9.3 billion to its staff, working out at about $379,000 per banker, up more than $100,000 from 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not say how much it will pay the British Treasury under the new bonus tax, though conservative estimates indicate its levy alone will be at least 300 million pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain had expected to raise 550 million pounds from the tax, but banks look likely to swallow the cost of the tax or spread it across their global workforces, leaving the industry with a potential tax bill of over 4 billion pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's bonus delay and increased attention over payouts come as the sector heads into reporting season and as politicians vow to stop bankers earning millions just months after being rescued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States last week proposed Wall Street pay $90 billion over 10 years to reimburse taxpayers for the financial bailout, as President Barack Obama slammed bankers for their "obscene bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks across the industry have changed their compensation plans to pay more in shares over several years, rather than an immediate cash sum, although the reform sparked by the financial crisis has done little to bring down overall pay figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Clara Ferreira-Marques; Editing by David Holmes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced plans to cut the length of time it stores IP addresses of Web searchers using its Bing search engine from 18 months to six in a bid to improve its privacy track record. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rival Google cut retention times to nine months from 18 in August 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft executives said Tuesday that their initiative goes much further than Google did, because Microsoft will delete all parts of the IP (Internet Protocol) address after six months, while Google still retains part of the address after its self-imposed nine-month cut-off point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will take Microsoft between 12 and 18 months to introduce the new tighter data retention policy, it said in a blog posting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies are responding to pressure from European data protection officials, who are concerned about the privacy implications of retaining an IP address. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Article 29 committee, comprising data protection officials from all 27 E.U. countries, has asked the leading search engine makers to respond to their concerns by the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IP addresses cannot positively identify the person sitting at a computer or accessing the Net via their phone, but they can identify the computer or phone being used, and the hardware can often be linked to a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Google both argue that the less data the search engine has, the less well the search engine can respond to a person's specific needs. They also point out that keeping search data helps them combat Internet fraud and spam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However Brendon Lynch, Microsoft's director of privacy policy, said the Bing search experience won't be compromised by the reduction to a six-month retention time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Quality of search won't be reduced but privacy will be enhanced," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Vassallo, Microsoft's VP for E.U. affairs and its associate general counsel urged rival search companies and in particular the largest search provider, Google, to follow suit in further reducing retention times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There should be a common standard across the industry. The largest search provider collects more data than anyone else. We think it is critical that the market leader matches this," Vassallo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Yahoo, another popular search engine, weren't immediately able to comment on the move by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google spokesman Bill Echikson said his company would soon submit a written response to the Article 29 committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Chevron to restructure refinery operations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Sees exits from markets, job cuts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares dip 0.5 percent
  (Adds background on refineries)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Giant oil company Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) plans to restructure its refinery operations, cutting
some jobs and exiting some markets, a company spokesman said on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. refiners have been shutting down operations as the
rising costs for crude oil squeeze margins and outpace
increases in prices for refined products such as gasoline,
heating oil, diesel fuel and jet fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, the fifth-largest refiner in the United States,
issued a memo to employees on Monday laying out the broad
outlines of the downstream restructuring, which also includes 
lubricants and supply and trading. It is expected to be
completed in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's going to be a leaner organization with fewer
positions, but we have not yet determined the number of
positions we need," Chevron spokesman Lloyd Avram said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company will exit from certain markets, he said,
although which markets the company will leave has not yet been
determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has also not decided whether to close any of its
refineries, he said. Further details are expected to be
released in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, Chevron warned that its fourth-quarter
results would be "sharply lower" than those of the previous
quarter due to a further deterioration in refining margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company operates more than 1 million barrels per day of
refining capacity in the United States, including major plants
at Pascagoula, Mississippi and El Segundo and Richmond in
California, as well as refineries in Singapore, Thailand, South
Korea and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) said it
will transform its Montreal East refinery into a fuel terminal.
Leading U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) said in
November it would permanently close its Delaware City,
Delaware, plant, three months after it indefinitely shut its
Aruba refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sunoco Inc SUN.N has also idled its Eagle Point, New
Jersey, plant, and Flying J shut its Bakersfield, California,
refinery a year ago.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Chevron dipped 0.5 percent to $78.83 in morning
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse said it would cut its global bonus pool by 5 percent to pay for a controversial 50 percent tax on UK investment bankers' bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first bank to specify the impact of the tax and said bonuses for its top 400 managers in Britain would be cut by a further 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank said on Tuesday it would raise fixed salaries for staff and cut variable pay, following Barclays Plc and other rivals in lifting base pay, potentially to reduce the burden of the tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Dutch government, plans to cut bonuses at nationalized bank ABN AMRO by 65 percent and cap the salaries of board members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK tax, announced suddenly less than six weeks ago, affects thousands of top bankers working in London and has forced banks to scramble to rework payout plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most were expected to swallow the cost of the tax themselves, rather than pass it on to staff but some bankers now appear set to take some of the hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks are heading into one of the most controversial bonus seasons of recent years, facing intense scrutiny and a fast-changing landscape as politicians vow to stop bankers earning millions just months after being rescued by state bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There had to be some movement on the part of banks, because digging in and sticking fingers in your ears just wasn't going to be a tenable position to take," said Ben Kingsley, partner at law firm Slaughter and May in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not surprising that banks should want to engage in the dialogue.

&lt;p&gt;WILMINGTON, Del. Jan 19 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)
asked a U.S. federal court to block Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA)TEVA.O from selling a generic form of
its Zyvox antibiotic that it said would infringe a patent,
according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; New York-based Pfizer asked the court for an injunction to

of Zyvox, according to the complaint filed on Friday in U.S.
District Court in Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zyvox, which is used to treat pneumonia and skin
infections, has annual global sales of about $1.1 billion. The
Teva generic would threaten Zyvox's U.S. sales, which totaled
about $575 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teva filed an abbreviated new drug application with the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, seeking approval to sell a
generic version of Zyvox. Pfizer said the move infringed its
patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said in the complaint that its Zyvox patent would
not expire until at least 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teva declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Pfizer were up 2 percent at $19.89 in morning
trading, while U.S.-traded shares of Teva rose 0.4 percent to

Rational And HP" report to their offering. 

Ovum's vision for application lifecycle management (ALM), encompassing solutions
designed to produce business results, is a distinct shift away from traditional
views of ALM as integrated software development lifecycle tools. In our previous
report, ALM: applying a business process-oriented paradigm, we proposed that ALM
be delivered as discrete business solutions that encompass the functionality of
one or more tools. We specified solution that areas address broad process goals
relating to software project direction, software warranties, business
priorities, business agility, product innovation and enterprise security. This
report provides an evaluation of how IBM Rational and HP Software address these
ALM business solution areas. 

Key Topics Covered:

* EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
* In a Nutshell 
* The ALM process model 
* ALM is process, not product 
* ALM is not about optimizing each task in isolation 
* ALM requires an enterprise solution sell 
* High-impact ALM business process solutions 
* Project direction 
* Software warranties 
* Business agility 
* Enterprise security 
* Business priorities 
* Product innovation 
* IBM Rational 
* Software project direction 
* Business whiteboarding 
* Software warranties 
* Closed-loop quality assurance

&lt;p&gt;  MINNEAPOLIS, MN and LAS VEGAS, NV, Jan 19 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
Analysts International Corporation (AIC) (NASDAQ: ANLY), a leading
systems integrator for state and local government, and Microsoft
Corporation today announced a new contract with Clark County, Nevada to
modernize the County's criminal history and wanted vehicle systems.

    "Clark County is facing challenges with the performance and cost of their
older mainframe-based public safety applications," said Skip Fogus,
General Manager of AIC's Government Solutions Practice. "The 16,000 users
of Clark County's criminal history and wanted vehicle systems require a
new solution that is easier to work with, provides complete and timely
information and is highly available. AIC's solution, based on the
Microsoft platform, will provide a cost-effective and flexible solution
to help Clark County achieve and sustain success for many years to come."

    Clark County's criminal history and wanted vehicle systems are currently
utilized by over fifty local, state and federal agencies. These systems
deliver front-line support to justice and public safety officials,
providing them with criminal and vehicle information critical to the
County's justice process. Both the criminal history and the wanted vehicle
systems are more than thirty years old. The new solution, designed by AIC,
utilizes open architecture principles and leverages best-of-breed
technologies such as Microsoft Office SharePoint Server, Microsoft BizTalk
and Microsoft SQL Server combined with proven national standards such as
the Global Justice Reference Architecture and the National Information
Exchange Model.

    "Collaboration is the foundation for successful public safety operations,"
said Microsoft's Joe Rozek, Executive Director of Homeland Security and
Counter-Terrorism. "A key component to our success is AIC's deep industry
expertise in justice and public safety, enabling Clark County to move to a
more flexible approach while still leveraging best practices. Our shared
goal is to improve these Clark County systems and bolster the safety of
Southern Nevada's officers and citizens alike."

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse is spreading the pain of a UK tax on bonuses across bankers globally and Goldman Sachs has delayed announcing payouts to staff as a row over remuneration heated up on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse said it will cut its global bonus pool by 5 percent to pay for a controversial 50 percent tax on UK investment bankers' bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first bank to specify the impact of the tax, and said bonuses for its top 400 managers in Britain will be cut by a further 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank said on Tuesday it will raise fixed salaries for staff and cut variable pay, following Barclays Plc and other rivals in lifting base pay, potentially to reduce the burden of the tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK tax, announced suddenly less than six weeks ago, has forced banks to scramble to rework payout plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most were expected to swallow the cost of the tax themselves, rather than pass it on to staff, but some bankers now appear set to take some of the hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks are heading into one of the most controversial bonus seasons of recent years, facing intense scrutiny and a fast-changing landscape as politicians vow to stop bankers earning millions just months after being rescued by state bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Britain's move, France, the United States and other countries are attempting to rein in pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"OBSCENE BONUSES"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States last week proposed Wall Street pay $90 billion over 10 years to reimburse taxpayers for the financial bailout, as President Barack Obama slammed bankers for their "obscene bonuses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers at Goldman Sachs, the focus of much of the public outrage over excessive bonuses, will hear about their payouts next week, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment bank had been expected to give staff the outline of their payouts on Monday, in line with previous years when they were told a couple of days before full-year results, which are due on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has sparked outrage among critics for preparing to pay more than $20 billion in compensation this year, only months after benefiting from a $10 billion U.S. taxpayer bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some insiders have blamed the Wall Street powerhouse for not taking a more restrained approach and for stoking public anger. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein ruffled feathers last year when he said his and other banks were doing "God's work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain had expected to raise 550 million pounds from the tax, but the industry is now expected to pay out over 4 billion pounds unless there is a swift U-turn in plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan on Friday said it would pay a record $9.3 billion to its investment bankers, working out at about $379,000 per person, which could see its UK levy alone top 300 million pounds, according to a conservative estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Edward Taylor in Frankfurt and Clara Ferreira-Marques in London; Editing by David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) announced today the renewal of its partnership with the
International Paralympic Committee (IPC) through 2012, which includes the 2010
Vancouver Paralympic Winter Games and the 2012 London Paralympic Games. 

Visa, the first global sponsor of the IPC and sponsor of four Paralympic Games
since 2002, remains the official payment service and only card accepted at all
Paralympic Games venues to purchase Paralympic tickets, official Games
merchandise, or food and beverages in venues. 

As part of the renewal agreement, Visa will retain exclusive marketing and
promotional rights within the Payment Services category and activation
opportunities for financial institution clients and merchants throughout the
world. New benefits include title sponsorship of the Paralympic Hall of Fame and
branding opportunities on various IPC media assets including ParalympicSport.TV.


This renewal follows the recent extension of Visa`s Olympic Games sponsorship
for another eight years - through 2020 - enabling Visa`s financial institution
clients and merchant partners to continue to build strong relationships with
their customers through unique Visa marketing programs. 

"At Visa, we are dedicated to the continued support and success of the
Paralympic Games, the participating athletes and the entire Paralympic
Movement," said Antonio Lucio, Chief Marketing Officer of Visa Inc. "With more
than 500 million people worldwide living with a disability, we understand the
importance of providing continued support to this community. Through events such
as the Paralympic Games, we at Visa are proud to support the values of
empowerment and inclusion." 

"We are extremely pleased that Visa has extended its partnership with the IPC,
helping to raise awareness of the Paralympic Games and the achievements of
Paralympic athletes worldwide," said Sir Philip Craven, President of the IPC.
"Visa`s involvement through technology, expertise, products and personnel is
fundamental to the staging of the Paralympic Games and we look forward to a
successful relationship in the years ahead." 

By engaging in dialogue, raising awareness of existing Visa products and
services (e.g., online banking and bill payment, Visa Paralympic website),
developing new technologies specifically for the needs of persons with a
disability (e.g., voice-activated and Braille ATMs), extending issuance, and
creating an affinity with Visa`s global network of financial institution
clients, Visa provides this global community with greater access and choice. 

Athlete Support &amp; Paralympic Hall of Fame

Visa has created a unique global athlete program, Team Visa, to provide
long-term support to Paralympic and Olympic hopefuls as they prepare for one of
the greatest challenges of their lives: competing at the Paralympic and Olympic
Games. Since 1986, Visa has helped athletes achieve their dreams by providing
many of them with financial support, financial literacy training and valuable
marketing exposure in pursuit of their goals. In the run-up to the 2010 Winter
Games, Visa will support selected Paralympic and Olympic athletes, all with the
potential to be selected for their National Teams. Paralympic hopefuls that are
members of Team Visa Vancouver include: Alexi Salamone, Ice Sledge Hockey (US);
Colette Bourgonje, Cross-Country Skiing (Canada) and Brian McKeever,
Cross-Country Skiing (Canada). 

Extending its commitment to the athletes, Visa`s Paralympic Games sponsorship
includes the continuation of the Visa Paralympic Hall of Fame, which was
established in 2006 to celebrate the achievements and spirit of Paralympic
athletes and their coaches for the betterment of people with a disability as a
whole. It is the first and only program of its kind and honors Paralympic
athletes and coaches who have demonstrated successful athletic performance, a
history of fair play, and participation in community service. 

The Visa Paralympic Hall of Fame election and induction ceremonies are held in
conjunction with the Summer and Winter Paralympic Games. To date, a total of six
Paralympians and two coaches have been inducted into the Hall of Fame in
ceremonies in Torino, Italy and Beijing, China. For the Vancouver 2010
Paralympic Winter Games, three inductees - two Paralympians and one coach - will
be inducted into the Visa Paralympic Hall of Fame. The sponsorship of the Visa
Paralympic Hall of Fame is anchored in its vision of greater worldwide
acceptance of people with a disability. Visa helps to facilitate progress toward
such acceptance by providing products and services that promote access for the
community of people with a disability and by promoting awareness of athletes
with a disability. For more information, please visit:

Paralympic Games Sponsorship History

Prior to becoming the first global sponsor of the IPC in 2002, Visa supported of
a number of Paralympic sports federations around the world and is a two-time
sponsor of the Paralympic Congress. The Nagano 1998 Paralympic Winter Games were
the first Paralympic Winter Games that Visa directly supported by providing an
international ATM network for visitors and athletes, online customer services
for Visa cardholders, and extending merchant acceptance locations within select
Paralympic venues.

&lt;p&gt;Quest`s Enterprise Migration Solutions Ramping up to Support Growing Migration
Trend
ALISO VIEJO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
In recognition of its track record of migrating more than 20 million users to
Microsoft platforms in the last 10 years,Quest Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: QSFT) has
been named a recommended independent software vendor (ISV) in Microsoft`s
Enterprise Notes Migration (ENM) program. The ENM program helps simplify the
process of moving from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint in the
cloud and on-premises, in part with an affordable offering of Quest products and
support. 

Quest just released a new version of Quest Notes Migrator for Exchange, with
support for Exchange 2010. Notes Migrator simplifies the migration process,
increasing predictability, mitigating the risks and reducing the costs
associated with Notes migrations. Notes Migrator for Exchange is part of Quest`s
suite of Notes transition solutions. Quest provides a complete migration
solution to Exchange, SharePoint, Office Communications Server and the Business
Productivity Online Suite (BPOS), along with products for pre-migration
assessment, coexistence and application rebuilding. Quest also offers a global
sales force, a certified partner community and 24/7/365 support. 

"I recommend Notes Migrator for Exchange to other organizations migrating to
Exchange Online," said Joakim Pettersson-Winter, IT manager, The Swedish Red
Cross, who recently transitioned more than 700 users to Microsoft`s cloud-based
applications over a single weekend. "It is clearly a great tool that does
exactly what it is supposed to do." 

"The current economic climate has produced an increase in Lotus-to-Microsoft
migrations, as many organizations simplify their enterprise to cut costs, or
streamline after company mergers or acquisitions," said Bill Evans, vice
president, SharePoint and Notes Transition business unit, Quest Software. "To
meet this demand, Quest has developed analysis, migration and coexistence tools
to help customers mitigate risk throughout the transition. Through our
partnership with Microsoft and our mutual certified partners, customers can
purchase these solutions and execute a predictable and affordable migration with
a trusted migration expert." 

Quest is gaining momentum with Microsoft Exchange Online and SharePoint Online
migrations, and has helped deliver some of the first migrations from Notes to
Exchange Online, in both the U.S. and Europe. Quest tools also were selected for
the first Notes-to-SharePoint Online migration to Microsoft`s dedicated cloud
infrastructure, a physically separate cloud optimized for larger enterprises,
governments and other organizations requiring enhanced capabilities, security
and privacy. 

"Quest is a leading Microsoft ISV Partner and 2009 Notes Transition Partner of
the Year finalist," said David Scult, general manager in information worker
marketing at Microsoft Corporation. "The company provides an excellent option
for customers looking to transition from Lotus Notes to Microsoft`s business
productivity platform for the well-integrated capabilities, flexibility and
familiarity it delivers. We look forward to our continued success with Quest as
we meet the worldwide demand for Notes migration tools and services."

&lt;p&gt; * HK Disneyland loses $169 mln in 2009&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Attendance in 2009 4.6 mln, up 2 pct yr-on-yr

 (Adds further details, government comment in paragraphs 6-7)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Jan 19 (Reuters) - Disney's troubled Hong Kong
Disneyland theme park made a net loss of HK$1.315 billion
($169.4 million last year while attracting 4.6 million visitors,
in its first major admission of its financial performance since
its opening in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since opening to great fanfare, Disney's first magic kingdom
in China has struggled to attract the expected flood of visitors
from mainland China, although its performance had been difficult
to gauge given Disney's initial refusal to fully disclose key
results and attendance figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A paper by Hong Kong's Tourism Commission for local
lawmakers, however, said Hong Kong Disneyland made the net loss
in 2009 partly because of the "unfavourable impact" of the H1N1
swine flu outbreak and the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The paper, released on Tuesday, added that the park made a
net loss of HK$1.574 billion in 2008, while hotel occupancy
rates stood at 70 percent in 2009, a drop of eight percent from
2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We would like to point out that (Hong Kong Disneyland) is a
long-term asset that grows over time and it is still in its
early years of development," the paper said, while noting the
park's continued cost containment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hong Kong government, however, which has a 52 percent
stake in the park -- the Walt Disney Company (DIS.N) holds the
other 48 percent -- expressed disappointment with the park's
results, calling on it to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are concerned about the situation and are dissatisfied
with the financial performance (of Hong Kong Disneyland)," said
Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Rita Lau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The park saw 4.6 million visitors in 2009, 2 percent more
than 2008, generating revenues of HK$2.541 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year's attendance was lower than Disney's first-year
attendance target of 5.6 million, which it just missed. After
the park's expansion, however, the number of visitors is
expected to swell to between 5.2 million-8 million visitors by
2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The park initially said it hoped to attract 10 million
visitors per year after 15 years. With attendance falling short
of targets, the government has been seeking ways to boost the
number of visitors in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The theme park, Disney's smallest, is now undergoing a $468
million expansion aimed at bolstering its competitiveness with a
rival Disneyland that is scheduled to open in Shanghai in the
next five or six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the expansion deal, partly financed by the Hong
Kong government, Disney pledged to boost the transparency of its
operations by releasing annual operating and financial results.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and
Markets(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/3fa2e1/romania_food_and_d)
has announced the addition of the "Romania Food and Drink Report Q1 2010" report
to their offering. 

The Romania Food and Drink Report provides industry professionals and
strategists, corporate analysts, food and drink associations, government
departments and regulatory bodies with independent forecasts and competitive
intelligence on Romania's food and drink industry. 

In BMI's Food and Drink Business Environment Ratings (BER) table for Q110,
Romania places ninth out of the 15 key markets surveyed in the emerging Europe
region, which now includes Turkey. Economic difficulties will conspire to pose
challenges to the development of Romania's food consumption volumes, especially
as the country's GDP trails that of its more developed Central and Eastern
European (CEE) peers, and given the latest political turmoil and the collapse of
coalition government. Additionally, the country's food and drinks market will
continue to be shaped by low per capita incomes and the fact that large sections
of rural population that have few opportunities for modern shopping in mass
grocery retail (MGR) outlets, although this is changing ,with the expansion of
pan-European operators, such as Carrefour, both organically and through
acquisition of local companies. 

Nevertheless, the Romanian food and drinks marketplace has remained a dynamic
one throughout the past quarter. Local producer of Tuborg beer, United Romanian
Breweries Bereprod (URBB), reported an increase in its share of the domestic
beer market in volume terms to 12% for the month of July 2009, with the brewer
expecting to end the year with a 10% share. Additionally, URBB is planning to
diversify its offering, having built a new EUR10mn factory for the production of
mineral water, which is increasing in popularity. In fact, a leading Austrian
mineral water producer, V&#246;slauer, reportedly set aside EUR22mn for an
acquisition of a Romanian water producer, although to date none of the local
companies approached have met its specifications. Similarly, PepsiCo's new
EUR150mn production plant in Romania will threaten Coca- Cola HBC Romania's
supremacy in the local soft drinks market, especially as the latter continues to
move manufacturing out of the country. 

On the other hand, Romania's alcoholic beverages industry has recorded some
negative developments. Flagging beer sales have led Belgian brewing behemoth
Anheuser-Busch InBev (A-B InBev) to sell its CEE operations, including Romania,
to CVC Capital Partners. Additionally, the brewer is to temporarily suspend
production at its Blaj bottling plant, from October 1 2009 to end-March 2010.
The company has stated that the decision was taken to optimise the supply-demand
ratio, avoid permanent layoffs and maintain a competitive edge amid the ongoing
economic slowdown which has led to a drop in beer sales on a regional scale. 

In the meantime, one of the major developments in the food industry has been the
stellar market performance of global consumer products giant Unilever, now among
the top three ice cream companies in the country, having only entered the
segment earlier in the year. The success of the company's Algida ice cream
business was supported by a major advertising campaign as well as the
acquisition of the Napoca brand from Friesland Food in 2009. Unilever now has a
market share of over 13%, providing major competition to local producers as well
as the other foreign player in the sector, namely Swiss-based Nestl&#233;.

&lt;p&gt; * Delay comes as row over payouts heats up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Due to announce results on Thursday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Banks face mounting regulator, political backlash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds detail, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Slater&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) is likely to unveil the details of multi-million pound
bonuses to staff next week, a person familiar with the matter
said on Tuesday, after a delay as a row heats up over payouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, the focus of much of the public outrage over
excessive bonuses, had been expected to give staff the outline
of their payouts on Monday, in line with previous years when
bankers are told a couple of days before full-year results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staff were not told in advance this year, however, but will
hear next week, the source said. The bank is due to announce
results on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As banks head into one of the most controversial bonus
seasons of recent years, they face mounting regulatory and
political hurdles -- not least the introduction of a
controversial 50 percent tax on bonuses in Britain and moves by
France, the United States and other countries to prevent banks
making hefty payouts so soon after being bailed out by
taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has also shifted to a calendar year for the first
time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Daily Telegraph reported that the Financial Services
Authority, Britain's financial regulator, had taken issue with
Goldman's bonus plans, effectively blocking them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FSA and Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The regulator has in the past blocked awards due to issues
with the structure of compensation, but not the level of pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to a 50 percent British tax on bonuses, the
regulator has imposed tough pay rules across the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOD'S WORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has sparked outrage among critics for preparing to
pay more than $20 billion in compensation this year, only months
after benefiting from a $10 billion U.S. taxpayer bailout.
[ID:nN1076736]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some insiders have blamed the Wall Street powerhouse for not
taking a more restrained approach and for stoking public anger.
Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein ruffled feathers last month when
he said his and other banks were doing "God's work".
[ID:nL8280358]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top investment banks appear to have been stung by the latest
backlash but it is unclear whether they will rein in pay plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan (JPM.N) on Friday said it would pay a record
$9.3 billion to its staff, working out at about $379,000 per
banker, up more than $100,000 from 2008. [ID:nN15114920]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It did not say how much it will pay the British Treasury
under the new bonus tax, though conservative estimates indicate
its levy alone will be at least 300 million pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain had expected to raise 550 million pounds from the
tax, but banks look likely to swallow the cost of the tax or
spread it across their global workforces, leaving the industry
with a potential tax bill of over 4 billion pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's bonus delay and increased attention over payouts
come as the sector heads into reporting season and as
politicians vow to stop bankers earning millions just months
after being rescued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The United States last week proposed Wall Street pay $90
billion over 10 years to reimburse taxpayers for the financial
bailout, as President Barack Obama slammed bankers for their
"obscene bonuses." [ID:nN13152862]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks across the industry have changed their compensation
plans to pay more in shares over several years, rather than an
immediate cash sum, although the reform sparked by the financial
crisis has done little to bring down overall pay figures.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 19 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is likely to
unveil details of multi-million pound bonuses to staff next
week, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, after a

this year, while Goldman has also shifted to a calendar year for
the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) said on Tuesday it was raising
fixed salaries for staff and cutting variable pay to keep
remuneration competitive amid the clampdown on bonuses.

Britain, the regulator has imposed tough pay rules across the
sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman set aside nearly $17 billion in the first nine
months of 2009 and may award over $20 billion to staff for the
full year, sparking outrage from some critics.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - The founder of Mount Kellett Capital is finding that not everything he touches turns to gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark "Goldfinger" McGoldrick, who earned a reported $40-$70 million annual bonus when at Goldman Sachs in 2006, has struggled to get his new investment fund off the ground, underscoring how tough it can be for hot-shot Wall Street bankers to strike out on their own as investors, especially in volatile Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mt. Kellett has downsized its staff by around a third in Hong Kong and has ditched plans for a Beijing office, according to three financial industry sources with business ties to the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the firm's three co-founders has left, and it also recently lost its Greater China head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of high-profile managers is likely to cause concern among institutional investors, who typically commit hundreds of millions of dollars to private equity firms and hedge funds. They will want to know what's behind the departures and whether or not there will be a strategy shift as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who agreed to invest in the firm are Singapore state investor Temasek and several Goldman Sachs partners, according to media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGoldrick, a 1981 graduate of Bowdoin College in Maine, earned his monicker at Goldman Sachs where, as co-head of the bank's Global Special Situations Group, he turned the unit into a money making machine, according to sources at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He saw the 2008 financial crisis as a rare chance to snap up assets cheaply, according to the three sources cited above, but Mt. Kellett has not yet executed a single high-profile deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Hopu Investments, a China-focused fund run by Goldman veterans, has struck several large deals since it launched a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGoldrick's specialty is distressed investing, though Mt. Kellett was billed as both a private equity and hedge fund-styled group. He and other ex-Goldman colleagues initially aimed to raise about $5 billion for Mt. Kellett with an investment focus in Asia, particularly Greater China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm originally hired around 50 people, but is scaling back, according to a corporate recruiter in charge of placing financial executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By last June, the firm had raised around $2.5 billion, Reuters reported, a lower-than-expected target due in part to the lingering financial crisis. With less money in the fund, the firm needed fewer people, said the recruiter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad Landes, the firm's managing director and deputy head of Asia, didn't respond to an email and a call by Reuters seeking comment. McGoldrick could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A TOUGH START&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a company filing obtained by Reuters, Mt. Kellett formed in April 2008. One of the co-founders was Jason Maynard, a former Goldman partner and head of Asia Special Situations Group at Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm, named after a mountain in Hong Kong, also hired Andrew Wise, former head of Morgan Stanley's principal investments in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Zhu Jianyi, head of Greater China for Mt. Kellett, resigned for personal reasons, according to a senior Asia executive at an investment firm who is close to Zhu but did not want to be named in this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhu, a veteran Chinese banker who worked for Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs in Asia before joining Mt. Kellett, is currently on vacation, the source told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhu's exit came after Blake Hutcheson, a co-founder of Mt. Kellett, who ran its distressed real estate investing, resigned late last year to join the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS), according to a veteran hedge fund manager based in Hong Kong. Canadian media also reported Hutcheson's hiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 10 investment professionals, including Zhu, have resigned or been let go from Mt. Kellett's 30-person office in Hong Kong in recent months, said two of the sources, who declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BYE-BYE, CHINA?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mt. Kellett came close to sealing traditional private equity deals in China, according to Hong Kong-based investment banking sources, but was ultimately left empty-handed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like private equity peers, the firm found that valuations in China remained high despite the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's too early to say whether it's right, but apparently Mt. Kellett is losing interest in private equity deals in China," said one of the banking sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mt. Kellett is now focusing more on hedge fund-like investing and is eyeing distressed U.S. real estate assets, the sources said, where it may come up against China Investment Corp, the $300 billion sovereign fund, which is also looking at that market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mark McGoldrick is definitely a big name on Wall Street, but not really in China," said one of the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Michael Flaherty and Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Jan 19 (Reuters) - Disney's troubled Hong Kong
Disneyland theme park made a net loss of HK$1.315 billion last
year while attracting 4.6 million visitors, in its first major
admission of its financial performance since opening in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Since opening to great fanfare in 2005, Disney's first magic
kingdom in China has struggled to attract the expected flood of
visitors from mainland China, although its performance was
difficult to gauge given Disney's initial refusal to fully
disclose key results and attendance figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a legislative paper by Hong Kong's Tourism Commission to
local lawmakers, however, it said Hong Kong Disneyland made a net
loss of HK$1.315 billion ($169.4 million) in 2009, partly because
of the "unfavourable impact" of the H1N1 swine flu outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The paper added that the park made a net loss of HK$1.574
billion in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We would like to point out that HKD is a long-term asset
that grows over time and it is still in its early years of
development," the paper said while noting the park's continued
cost containment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The paper added that Hong Kong Disneyland had brought Hong
Kong well over HK$30 billion of economic benefit over the past
four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The park's attendance in 2009 was 4.6 million, 2 percent more
than 2008, generating revenues of HK$2.541 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The theme park, Disney's smallest, is now undergoing a $468

Shanghai in the next five or six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by James Pomfret; editing by Ken Wills)

but did not want to be named in this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zhu, a veteran Chinese banker who worked for Deutsche Bank
(DBKGn.DE) and Goldman Sachs in Asia before joining Mt.
Kellett, is currently on vacation, the source told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zhu's exit came after Blake Hutcheson, a co-founder of Mt.
Kellett, who ran its distressed real estate investing, resigned
late last year to join the Ontario Municipal Employees
Retirement System (OMERS), according to a veteran hedge fund
manager based in Hong Kong. Canadian media also reported
Hutcheson's hiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least 10 investment professionals, including Zhu, have
resigned or been let go from Mt. Kellett's 30-person office in
Hong Kong in recent months, said two of the sources, who
declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the
media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BYE-BYE, CHINA?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mt. Kellett came close to sealing traditional private
equity deals in China, according to Hong Kong-based investment
banking sources, but was ultimately left empty-handed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like private equity peers, the firm found that valuations
in China remained high despite the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's too early to say whether it's right, but apparently
Mt. Kellett is losing interest in private equity deals in
China," said one of the banking sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mt. Kellett is now focusing more on hedge fund-like
investing and is eyeing distressed U.S. real estate assets, the
sources said, where it may come up against China Investment
Corp [CIC.UL], the $300 billion sovereign fund, which is also
looking at that market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Mark McGoldrick is definitely a big name on Wall Street,
but not really in China," said one of the sources.

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing vendors need to band together to create rules on privacy and security or face the prospect of having the U.S. Congress pass regulations, Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a speech at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank, Smith called for new "truth-in-cloud-computing" principles that would let consumers and businesses know how their information will be accessed by service providers and how it will be stored online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These principles should ensure that there is transparency over how data is protected," he said. "Simply put, it should not be enough for service providers simply to say that their services are private and secure," Smith added. "There needs to be some transparency about why this is the case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud providers should maintain a comprehensive security program and should disclose whether their security efforts meet security standards, Smith said. Customers should know how they can reclaim their documents and data, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing vendors could create a self-regulatory code, or they could face regulation from Congress, Smith said. Action from Congress is "likely," he said. If regulation happens, Microsoft would prefer it on the national, rather than state level, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Simply put, it should not be enough for service providers simply to say that their services are private and secure," Smith added. "There needs to be some transparency about why this is the case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also called for the U.S. government to work with other nations on an agreement that would allow cloud providers to operate without having to comply with laws in every country they have customers. The U.S. and other countries should establish a multilateral "free trade zone" for data packets, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful of other governments have already tried to gain access to data stored in the U.S., he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where different laws conflict, a decision to comply with a lawful demand for user data in one jurisdiction may place a provider at risk of violating laws elsewhere," he said. "This also makes it more difficult to provide consumers with accurate information about when and how their personal information might be accessed by law enforcement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also supports efforts to update privacy protection laws to deal with online activities, and it wants changes to computer crime laws that would make it easier for prosecutors to charge cybercriminals, Smith said. In some cases, it's difficult for prosecutors now to place monetary values on stolen documents, e-mail or digital photos, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way of dealing with this problem would be a change in the law that would fix the value of such items for each victim, then allow prosecutors to multiply that amount by the number of victims to determine charges, Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also called for Congress to allow cloud providers greater latitude to pursue civil lawsuits against attacks, and he called for larger fines for attackers that break into data centers. In most cases, the fines for breaking into a data center are the same as for attacking a single computer, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith didn't directly address critics who say that cloud computing locks customers into one vendor, but he noted that a recent survey commissioned by Microsoft found that 75 percent of senior business leaders said safety, security and privacy are the top potential risks of cloud computing. More than 90 percent of the general population and business leaders would be concerns about the security and privacy of their own data in a cloud computing environment, according to the survey, by Penn Schoen  Berland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But cloud computing, although not well understood by the general public, offers great potential benefits, Smith added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cloud computing, properly implemented, provides users with greater flexibility, portability and choice in their computing options," he said. "You can rely on the cloud for as little or as much of your computing needs -- and keep as much data and computing functions locally on site -- as you want."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is working with a company it once tried to acquire, Intuit, in an effort to boost delivery of Web applications to small businesses, leveraging cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies plan to integrate the Intuit App Center online application store with Microsoft's Windows Azure cloud application deployment platform, enabling development of applications on Azure for access via App Center. Azure becomes a "preferred platform" for small business cloud application development on the Intuit Partner Platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ InfoWorld's Savio Rodriguez says Intuit's open source play last year was all business. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers and channel partners can offer solutions to small business that use Intuit QuickBooks financial software. Applications ranging from CRM to event management to Web conferencing are anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we're doing for the developer is combining the Intuit Partner Platform and Azure," said Alex Chriss, director of the Intuit Partner Platform. Services will be provided for the applications including billing, authentication and data APis to connect to QuickBooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is basically bringing the Azure platform to all of those developers so they can quickly build cloud applications and have them integrated into the QuickBooks data stores," said Kim Akers, &#160;general manager of evangelism at &#160;Microsoft. "Then, [developers] have a channel so they can sell those applications that they just built."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's a pretty significant announcement for these two SMB-focused industry leaders to come together and work together," said analyst Sanjeev Aggarwal, founder and partner at SMB Group. Microsoft's recent discontinuance of its Microsoft Office Accounting software, which competed with Intuit, probably helped in bringing about the partnership, Aggarwal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm sure that [lent] positive synergy to the deal," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azure will be named by Intuit as a "preferred platform" for small business cloud application development on the Intuit Partner Platform. Developers can access the free beta version of the Windows Azure SDK&#160; for Intuit Partner Program. Developers can use the Microsoft Visual Studio development platform or other tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also as part of the announcement, Microsoft in the fourth quarter of this year plans to make available Microsoft Online Services applications, including Exchange Online, Office Live Meeting, and Office Communications Online via Intuit App Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had tried to acquire Intuit in 1994 but later abandoned the effort after facing opposition from the U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft and Intuit forge small business Web apps partnership," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow suffered its worst drop of 2010 on Wednesday as U.S. stocks succumbed to fears that China's curbs on bank lending might jeopardize the global economic recovery, while IBM's outlook sparked caution about the technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities have ordered some major banks to curb their lending over the rest of this month after an early burst of credit, banking industry sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signals that China, the world's third-largest economy, may restrain its economic expansion hurt shares of natural resource companies, including Alcoa Inc, off 2.5 percent at $15.23, and big manufacturers, with Caterpillar Inc, down 1.9 percent at $59.76.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SP materials sector index fell 1.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is really a direct result of concerns around the tightening of credit in China," said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although IBM posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit late on Tuesday, investors had misgivings about its guarded 2010 outlook, sending the stock down nearly 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 122.28 points, or 1.14 percent, to end at 10,603.15. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index fell 12.19 points, or 1.06 percent, to finish at 1,138.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 29.15 points, or 1.26 percent, to close at 2,291.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow suffered its largest daily percentage decline since late December, while the Nasdaq took its largest daily percentage loss in a week. It was the worst drop for the SP 500 since Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the Dow and the SP 500 ended at 15-month highs on bets the Democrats would lose a Senate seat. The SP 500 is up 68.2 percent since bottoming out in early March 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Wednesday, the major indexes had dropped about 2 percent or more, but recovered some ground in the last hour of the session, thanks to some buying of bank stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LATE JUMP FOR eBAY, STARBUCKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest earnings season picked up pace after the bell, when e-commerce company eBay Inc and coffee chain Starbucks Corp posted stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of eBay rose 4.6 percent to $23.25 in extended trade, after ending the regular session at $22.23 on Nasdaq. Starbucks shares jumped 3 percent to $24 in after-hours trading, after ending on Nasdaq at $23.29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, in the regular session, shares of International Business Machines Corp, a major technology services company, ended down 2.9 percent to $130.25 as investors perceived that its 2010 outlook is pointing to a potential slowdown in profit growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM was the Dow's biggest drag, followed by energy company Chevron Corp, down 1.9 percent at $78.15. Diversified manufacturer United Technologies Corp, another Dow component, was down 1.2 percent at $71.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SP energy index dropped 1.7 percent. A run-up in the U.S. dollar weighed on dollar-denominated commodity prices. U.S. February crude fell 1.8 percent, or $1.40, to settle at $77.62 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. dollar index was up 1.1 percent against major currencies, helped by worries about Greece's ability to refinance its deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Nasdaq, Apple Inc was the heaviest weight, down 1.5 percent at $211.725. Other tech bellwethers off 1 percent or more were Google, Microsoft and Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors count on emerging economies like China to underpin a nascent global recovery, so any restrictive policy there could be a setback for those that bet on a sustainable rebound and recently propelled the SP 500 to 15-month highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare stocks, which led an advance on Tuesday on signs that a healthcare overhaul could face new hurdles in Congress, declined on Wednesday as some investors booked profits. The Morgan Stanley healthcare payor index lost 2.1 percent and an index of pharmaceutical companies dipped 0.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a busy earnings day for U.S. banks, Wells Fargo  Co and U.S. Bancorp reported better-than-forecast quarterly earnings, helped by recent acquisitions, while a larger rival, Bank of America, got a boost from Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the top U.S. bank by assets, reported a wider-than-expected loss, but said its credit problems were beginning to stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bancorp shares rose 2.1 percent to $25.01 and Bank of America gained 1 percent to $16.49. The KBW bank index rose 1.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the New York Stock Exchange, about 1.05 billion shares changed hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 2.18 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 2.39 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 1.63 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declining stocks outnumbered advancing on both the NYSE and Nasdaq by a ratio of about 3 to 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ellis Mnyandu; Additional reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Jan Paschal)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said it will issue a patch to fix the old version of its Internet Explorer browser that allowed recent attacks on Google Inc's network in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch, due out on Thursday, "addresses the vulnerability related to recent attacks against Google and a small subset of corporations," said Jerry Bryant, senior security program manager at Microsoft. "Once applied, customers are protected against the known attacks that have been widely publicized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said last week it had been the target of sophisticated cyber-attacks in China, along with more than 20 other companies. Microsoft acknowledged that the hackers took advantage of a weakness in Internet Explorer 6 to mount the attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it continues to see some attacks, with the only successful attacks against Internet Explorer 6. The most recent version of the software is Internet Explorer 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congress should enact a law laying the groundwork for protecting consumers who use the Internet "cloud" to store data before states come in with an unwieldy patchwork of conflicting legislation, said Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith, who said Microsoft had invested "billions" to build a cloud infrastructure, called for federal laws that would  improve privacy protections and strengthen law enforcement in going after hackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also urged companies building massive amounts of remote storage for data -- which is essentially what the cloud is -- to be upfront with consumers about how their photos, email and other data in the cloud might be used and what measures are being taken to fend off hackers and thieves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would mean that cloud service providers would be obligated to provide consumers in plain language about ... what rights they have -- the cloud service providers -- to use the information," he said. "It would ensure that consumers get clear information on their rights."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also was interested in discussing what sort of notification should be required of his company and others if their data storage facilities were hacked into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If their information was stolen, typically I think people would say that the consumer ought to be notified. If somebody got access and looked at their account and read their email that might be an area where typically you would want people to be notified," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a speech at the Brookings Institution and in comments after the speech, Smith advocated legislation that would require cloud security be extremely tight but urged lawmakers to steer of requiring a particular sort of security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You run the risk of it coming outdated," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senators John Rockefeller and Olympia Snowe introduced legislation last April which would have addressed cybersecurity issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill, which stalled amid vehement opposition in the tech sector, would have created a clearinghouse of information about cyber threats, established enforceable cybersecurity standards and required the licensing of cybersecurity professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about that measure, Smith said: "What we're really trying to advocate is that we all step back and look at these various areas of the law and address them more comprehensively."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diane Bartz; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *Forecast for 2010 SP 500 realized volatility is 15 pct&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *Regulatory clarity likely to lower financials volatility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *Product launches to add volatility in big cap tech names&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHICAGO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Volatility is expected to
moderate this year, in line with the later part of 2009, which
should lead to a more favorable stock-picking environment,
Goldman Sachs derivative strategists said in a webcast on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combination of 2.1 percent expected real GDP growth
this year, robust industrial activity, low inflation and
Federal Reserve interest rate policy on hold should help keep
volatility near long-term average levels, Goldman said in a
supplementary report linked to the webcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman expects realized volatility for the Standard 
Poor's 500 index .SPX to be in the 15 to 17 percent range at
year-end, consistent with levels in late 2009, based on its
macro volatility model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strategists said at the index level, options have
started to price this view. But they still have further to go,
and at the sector level, option prices remain at a premium to
long-term averages, particularly in the financial and basic
materials sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would make 2010 a good year for options-selling
strategies in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman noted that for the past six months, realized
volatility for the SP 500 was in the more normal range of 15
to 16 percent, with the exception of a somewhat higher read in
October and a lower read in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Realized volatility measures how volatile the SP benchmark
has been in the past on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman expects volatility to remain moderate throughout
2010 and not return to the single-digit levels seen before the
financial crisis barring a strong upside economic surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Upside risks include a weaker-than-expected economy and
unexpected inflation or rate increases, the strategists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The options market has started to agree with Goldman's view
for more normalized volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The VIX, the Chicago Board Options Volatility Index .VIX,
Wall Street's favorite barometer of investor anxiety, has
fallen below the 20 level this year and longer-dated volatility
has fallen notably, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, the strategists said financials volatility is
likely to moderate further, driven by regulatory clarity and
potential supply of warrants related to the Troubled Asset
Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financials volatility remains at a large premium to average
realized volatility levels, partially driven by the current
lack of regulatory clarity, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the situation resolves, the strategists expect greater
transparency for investors to dampen volatility expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman recommends selling longer-dated options in Bank of
America (BAC.N), Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) and Fifth Third
Bancorp (FITB.O), banks that have outstanding TARP warrants
that could come to market at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The expectation of a clearer picture of the financial
regulatory framework in 2010 could be a significant catalyst
for shares and a downward catalyst for forward-looking
volatility, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strategists also said that key product launches this
year will put some of the largest technology companies in
direct competition for users and subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They recommended buying options in Google Inc (GOOG.O),
Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), which are all key
stocks exposed to new technology products.

&lt;p&gt;NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(Business Wire)--
During a Nashville Health Care Council panel discussion on the future and
current state of health care information technology (HIT), Microsoft CEO Steve
Ballmer said the time is now for rapid change in the industry. 

Ballmer joined fellow panelists Harry Greenspun, M.D., chief medical officer,
Dell Perot Systems; George Lazenby, CEO, Nashville-based Emdeon; and Glen
Tullman, CEO, Allscripts in a lively discussion about technology-enabled
advancements in health care, business opportunities and adoption as a result of
federal HIT incentives and stimulus funds, and potential "game-changers" in the
HIT space. The lunchtime panel, which attracted more than 450 to the Nashville
Downtown Hilton, was moderated by Brad Perkins, M.D., executive vice president
for Strategy and Innovation and chief transformation officer, Vanguard Health
Systems. 

"`The time is now` is the theme for all kinds of different reasons," said
Ballmer. "Technology lets us do things we couldn`t previously do. I`m optimistic
that the advances we`ve made will actually help our platforms to enable
innovation and transformation in the industry and to step up and make a
difference." 

Nashville`s health care leaders heard from panelists on the importance of
leadership in community level innovation, a focus on the patient, consumer
incentives to drive greater use of electronic medical records, standards for
meaningful use of technology in the delivery system and stimulus funding.
Panelists said change must be made incrementally even though transformation of
the nation`s health care system promises to be rapid; especially in the wake of
federal stimulus dollars. 

"What we are witnessing is the beginning of the single largest transformation we
have seen in the history of our country in a major industry," Tullman said.

about Nashville`s role as the for-profit health care industry capital. 

"Nashville continues to be a leader in health IT policy and implementation,"
said Nashville Health Care Council President Caroline Young. "More than 300
health care companies call Nashville home, including strong representation from
the health IT sector. This city is widely recognized as an important voice in

 (Updates with results from eBay, Starbucks; adds volume)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The Dow suffered its worst
drop of 2010 on Wednesday as U.S. stocks succumbed to fears
that China's curbs on bank lending might jeopardize the global
economic recovery, while IBM's outlook sparked caution about
the technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chinese authorities have ordered some major banks to curb
their lending over the rest of this month after an early burst
of credit, banking industry sources said. For details, see
[ID:nTOE60J09N].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Signals that China, the world's third-largest economy, may
restrain its economic expansion hurt shares of natural resource
companies, including Alcoa Inc (AA.N), off 2.5 percent at
$15.23, and big manufacturers, with Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N),
down 1.9 percent at $59.76.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP materials sector index .GSPM fell 1.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is really a direct result of concerns around the
tightening of credit in China," said Peter Kenny, managing
director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although IBM posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly
profit late on Tuesday, investors had misgivings about its
guarded 2010 outlook, sending the stock down nearly 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI tumbled 122.28
points, or 1.14 percent, to end at 10,603.15. The Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX fell 12.19 points, or 1.06 percent, to
finish at 1,138.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC dropped
29.15 points, or 1.26 percent, to close at 2,291.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow suffered its largest daily percentage decline since
late December, while the Nasdaq took its largest daily
percentage loss in a week. It was the worst drop for the SP
500 since Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, the Dow and the SP 500 ended at 15-month highs
on bets the Democrats would lose a Senate seat. The SP 500 is
up 68.2 percent since bottoming out in early March 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier on Wednesday, the major indexes had dropped about 2
percent or more, but recovered some ground in the last hour of
the session, thanks to some buying of bank stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LATE JUMP FOR eBAY, STARBUCKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest earnings season picked up pace after the bell,
when e-commerce company eBay Inc (EBAY.O) and coffee chain
Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O)  posted stronger-than-expected
quarterly earnings. [ID:nN20152285]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of eBay rose 4.6 percent to $23.25 in extended
trade, after ending the regular session at $22.23 on Nasdaq.
Starbucks shares jumped 3 percent to $24 in after-hours
trading, after ending on Nasdaq at $23.29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, in the regular session, shares of International
Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), a major technology services
company, ended down 2.9 percent to $130.25 as investors
perceived that its 2010 outlook is pointing to a potential
slowdown in profit growth. [ID:nSGE60J0I7].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM was the Dow's biggest drag, followed by energy company
Chevron Corp (CVX.N), down 1.9 percent at $78.15. Diversified
manufacturer United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), another Dow
component, was down 1.2 percent at $71.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP energy index .GSPE dropped 1.7 percent. A run-up
in the U.S. dollar weighed on dollar-denominated commodity
prices. U.S. February crude CLGO fell 1.8 percent, or $1.40,
to settle at $77.62 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. dollar index .DXY was up 1.1 percent against
major currencies, helped by worries about Greece's ability to
refinance its deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the Nasdaq, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) was the heaviest weight,
down 1.5 percent at $211.725. Other tech bellwethers off 1
percent or more were Google (GOOG.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and
Cisco (CSCO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors count on emerging economies like China to
underpin a nascent global recovery, so any restrictive policy
there could be a setback for those that bet on a sustainable
rebound and recently propelled the SP 500 to 15-month highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Healthcare stocks, which led an advance on Tuesday on signs
that a healthcare overhaul could face new hurdles in Congress,
declined on Wednesday as some investors booked profits. The
Morgan Stanley healthcare payor index .HMO lost 2.1 percent
and an index of pharmaceutical companies .DRG dipped 0.3
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a busy earnings day for U.S. banks, Wells Fargo  Co
(WFC.N) and U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) reported better-than-forecast
quarterly earnings, helped by recent acquisitions, while a
larger rival, Bank of America, got a boost from Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America (BAC.N), the top U.S. bank by assets,
reported a wider-than-expected loss, but said its credit
problems were beginning to stabilize. [ID:nN20148741].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Bancorp shares rose 2.1 percent to $25.01 and Bank of
America gained 1 percent to $16.49. The KBW bank index .BKX
rose 1.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the New York Stock Exchange, about 1.05 billion shares
changed hands, below last year's estimated daily average of
2.18 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 2.39 billion shares traded,
above last year's daily average of 1.63 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Declining stocks outnumbered advancing on both the NYSE and
Nasdaq by a ratio of about 3 to 1.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

IBM Beats, Down in After-Market

IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM) posted a positive earnings report after the bell Tuesday.
For the company's 4th quarter of 2009, its $3.59 per share beat the Zacks
Consensus Estimate of $3.47 by 12 cents, and was up 10% year over year. 

Quarterly revenue of $27.2 billion was essentially flat from the year-earlier
level (up 0.8%), but down 5% if we exclude the impact of exchange rates.
Quarterly gross margin of 48.3% was up from 47.9% from the year-earlier period. 

For the full-year 2009, earnings of $10.01 per share were up 13% year over year,
and net income of $13.4 billion rose 9% from fiscal year 2008 totals. Both
figures also happen to be record numbers for IBM. For fiscal year 2010, the
company now expects earnings of at least $11 per share, up from a previously
expected $10-11 per share range. 

Analysts covering IBM had been standing pat in their earnings estimates over the
past month. There had been no movement either way in earnings estimate revisions
from any of the 19 analysts covering the company. 

It is not particularly surprising to see IBM beat estimates; the company has
averaged a 6+% positive earnings surprise over the previous 4 quarters. IBM
shares before the bell had been up 1.76% on an up-day overall in the market. But
since the earnings announcement, shares have given back all of today's gains and
then some. 

Parker Hannifin Tops Expectations

Parker Hannifin Corporation (NYSE: PH) reported second quarter 2010 earnings per
share of 64 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 34 cents. Its fiscal
second-quarter profit fell to $104.5 million, or 64 cents a share, from $155.4
million, or 96 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. 

Fiscal 2010 second quarter revenues were $2.4 billion, an increase of 5.3%
compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and a decline of 12.4% from $2.7
billion in the second quarter in the year-ago period. Parker also reported a
decline of 7% in total orders for the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2009, compared
with the same quarter a year ago. 

Orders declined 3% in the Industrial North America segment, compared with the
same quarter a year ago. Orders were unchanged in the Industrial International
segment, compared with the same quarter a year ago. Orders declined 27% in the
Aerospace segment on a rolling 12-month average basis. Orders increased 6% in
the Climate and Industrial Controls segment, compared with the same quarter a
year ago. 

PetMed Beats Zacks Estimate

PetMed Express, Inc. (Nasdaq: PETS), America`s largest Pet Pharmacy, recently
reported third-quarter fiscal 2010 results. The quarterly earnings of 25 cents a
share were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents, and rose 19% year over
year from 21 cents posted in the prior-year quarter. 

Net sales climbed 11.5% to $48.4 million during the quarter. Reorder sales
jumped 17% to $37.6 million. New customer additions for the quarter came in at
151,000 compared to 154,000 new customer additions in the year-ago period, down
2%. Advertising spending, which is the prime factor behind the addition of new
customers, climbed 6%, while general and administrative expenses declined 2%.
Sales over the Internet in the quarter came in at $33.6 million, up 18%.
Approximately 70% of PetMed's orders were placed online. 

Gross profit increased 8.7%, driven by an increase in net sales, partially
offset by a rise of 13.2% in cost of sales. Total operating expenses increased
3.3% to $10.4 million due to the rise in advertising expenses and depreciation
and amortization expenses, partially offset by the decline in general and
administrative costs. Operating income increased 16% to $8.4 million. 

US Bancorp Earnings Preview

US Bancorp (NYSE: USB) is scheduled to release its fourth quarter and full year
2009 financial results prior to the market open Wednesday, Jan. 20. According to
the Zacks Consensus Estimate, US Bancorp will report earnings of 28 cents per
share for the fourth quarter and 96 cents per share for the full year. 

US Bancorp remains one of the more profitable large-cap banks in the industry.
With a wide range of product offerings, the company remains well positioned for
organic growth. Its strong retail banking franchise and leadership in payment
processing should continue to create growth opportunities over time. 

Given the economic conditions and the company`s strategic operations, we expect
net interest income to be up modestly in the fourth quarter compared to the
prior quarter. Growth in fee income is expected to be somewhat moderated due to
lower mortgage revenues and core expenses to be flat compared to the previous
quarter, primarily driven by the expense control initiatives. 

On the other hand, given the continued stress in the commercial and residential
real estate and consumer loan portfolios, we expect credit losses and
nonperforming assets to continue to trend higher in the fourth quarter. However,
we noticed that the rate of deterioration has somewhat moderated in the third
quarter. 

US Bancorp reported third quarter earnings of $603 million or 30 cents per
share. Results were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents. Results
reflected higher revenue and an increase in fee income, partially offset by a
deterioration of credit metrics. 

We have been encouraged by US Bancorp`s exit from the Treasury`s Capital
Purchase program. Despite the dilutive impact, the capital bolstering
initiatives are also positive as these will not only reduce government
intervention but also help in maintaining a strong capital base in a soft
economic environment. 

Earnings Preview: Plexus

Plexus Corporation (Nasdaq: PLXS) is scheduled to release its first quarter of
fiscal 2010 earnings ended January 2 after the market closes on January 20.
Plexus Corp. is currently rated as a Zacks Rank #3 (Neutral) stock, indicating
that it should perform in line with the overall market over the next 1&#8722;3 months.


Plexus had provided an encouraging guidance for the reportable quarter. The
company expects modest revenue growth in the range of $405 - $430 million, up 6%
quarter over quarter at the mid point due to the ramp-up of new business wins
and improving customer demand. 

The company expects earnings per share in the range of 31 cents - 36 cents, up
12% at the mid point excluding restructuring charges but including 5 cents per
share in stock-based compensation expense. 

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter of 2010 currently stands at 34
cents, down 22.7% from the year-ago period with a potential negative surprise of
2.94%. This implies that there may be a downward price movement. 

Management expects gross margin to be within 9.5% to 9.8%. Depreciation is
expected to be approximately in the $9.0 - $9.3 million range. Plexus expects
SG expenses to be in the range of $24.5 - $25.0 million. The company expects
to witness a modest increase in headcount and other spending in the second
quarter of 2010. For the full year 2010, capital spending is expected to be in
the range of $60 - $70 million.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Goldman Postpones UK Bonuses

Mulling over the new UK tax issues laid on executive bonus payments, according
to a report in this morning's The Daily Telegraph, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
(NYSE: GS) has reportedly deferred the announcement. 

According to the paper, Goldman Sachs was supposed to announce the structure and
magnitude of bonus payments worth more than $20 billion that will also be shared
by its 32,000 employees. This will result in highest average payout in the
banking industry, all exceeding the super-tax limit. After the deferment, they
will have to wait until next week, possibly as late as January 28, according to
the paper, to find about their personal bonuses. 

Earlier this month, it was reported that Goldman Sachs had seriously considered
various alternatives to prevent UK`s new 50% super-tax on the bonus payments.
One such option reportedly included Goldman Sachs making a complete exit from
the UK. 

On Dec. 9, 2009, the British government declared a 50% tax for banks on bonuses
exceeding &#163;25,000, effective immediately. The bonus tax on banks was aimed to
gain control over the multimillion-pound bonus payouts by an industry bailed out
with taxpayer cash. The British authorities justify this logic as a simple
encouragement tactic to retain more equity and less payout. 

After the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) issue, the UK`s new bonus tax law
is reportedly causing a furor among the hundreds of non-British banks operating
in the UK such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C),
Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), all of whom are
expected to announce their bonus payments soon. Although most of these companies
have completely canceled or deferred cash bonuses and arranged the bonus in
stock payments with a vesting period of 3-5 years, they have been under the
radar for the high scale of bonuses that could otherwise be used for capital
enhancement and growth purposes. 

Hence, Goldman Sachs has deferred its payment announcement in order to consider
effective steps to reduce this extra charge on the company and its staff. On
Dec. 21, 2009, the company had reportedly warned the UK Treasury that it may
move 20% of its London personnel to Spain as a result of this issue. 

Goldman Sachs has ample leverage in the UK as it was the only bank that paid
more than &#163;2 billion to the Exchequer`s ailing reserves in corporation tax alone
in fiscal 2008. Hence, it holds a bargaining position in the country. Goldman
Sachs condemned the government for not providing a predictable tax environment
and has appealed to take back or amend the new tax laws. While negotiations
among the UK tax authority and the non-British bankers continues, we believe
Goldman Sachs might also end up making no changes at all. 

Generally, 45% of Goldman Sachs' revenues are utilized for staff compensation.
However, the company is expected to report a rise of 81% in its staff
compensation for fiscal 2009 as compared to 2008. For the time being, we await
further developments that are expected to be disclosed when the company releases
its fourth quarter earnings on Jan. 21, 2010.

"Old" &amp; "New" Energy Show Improvement

Two industries that in one sense are polar opposites of each other, but in other
respects are similar both showed fairly significant improvements in their
industry scores this week. Both are in the Energy sector, but one is synonymous
with the old, Coal, while the other is supposed to be the salvation of the
future, Alternative Energy. 

Of the two, based on the Zacks Rank, which is a very effective short-term (up to
about 3 months) tool for trading, Coal looks better on both the absolute
increase, and on the weekly improvement. Coal is currently in 52nd place out of
the 206 industries we rank. That in and of itself would not be enough to get it
mentioned here. However it improved by 52 spots over the last week, with the
average (unweighted) Zacks Rank improving to 2.75 from 2.94. Two stocks that
stand out with Zacks number one rankings are Alpha Natural Resources (NYSE: ANR)
and Walter Industries (NYSE: WLT). 

With 16 firms in the industry, it is easier for Coal to make a big move in the
ranking (in either direction) than it is for the Alternative Energy Industry,
which has 32 names. The more firms there are in an industry, the more the
industry rank is going to tend towards 3.00, and the less impact any individual
stock`s rank will have on the overall industry rank. 

The Alternative Energy Industry did move up 12 spots this week to 63rd place.
The Coal industry only had one stock with a Zacks Rank #4 weighing on its total
(an no Zacks Rank #5s), while the Alternative Energy industry is more
differentiated when it comes to the Zacks rank. It has three Zacks Rank #1 firms
that are worth taking a look at: Canadian Solar (Nasdaq: CSIQ), Solarfun Power
(Nasdaq: SOLF) and Trina Solar (NYSE: TSL), as well as seven Zacks Rank #2
stocks.

 (Updates to close)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Wednesday
and the Dow suffered its worst drop of 2010 due to fears that
China's curbs on bank lending might jeopardize the global
economic recovery, while IBM's outlook sparked caution about
the technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chinese authorities have ordered some major banks to curb
their lending over the rest of this month after an early burst
of credit, banking industry sources said. For details, see
[ID:nTOE60J09N].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Signals that China, the world's third-largest economy, may
restrain its economic expansion hurt shares of natural resource
companies, including Alcoa Inc (AA.N), off 2.5 percent at
$15.23, and big manufacturers, with Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N),
down 1.9 percent at $59.76.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP materials sector index .GSPM fell 1.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is really a direct result of concerns around the
tightening of credit in China," said Peter Kenny, managing
director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although IBM posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly
profit late on Tuesday, investors had misgivings about its
guarded 2010 outlook, sending the stock down nearly 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI tumbled 122.28
points, or 1.14 percent, to end at 10,603.15. The Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX fell 12.19 points, or 1.06 percent, to
finish at 1,138.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC dropped
29.15 points, or 1.26 percent, to close at 2,291.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow suffered its largest daily percentage decline since
late December, while the Nasdaq took its largest daily
percentage loss in a week. It was the worst drop for the SP
500 since Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, the Dow and the SP 500 ended at  15-month
highs on bets the Democrats would lose a Senate seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier on Wednesday, the major indexes had dropped about 2
percent or more, but recovered some ground in the last hour of
the session, thanks to some buying of bank stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, shares of International Business Machines Corp
(IBM.N), a major technology services company, fell 2.9 percent
to $130.25 as investors perceived that its 2010 outlook is
pointing to a potential slowdown in profit growth.
[ID:nSGE60J0I7].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM was the Dow's biggest drag, followed by energy company
Chevron Corp (CVX.N), down 1.9 percent at $78.15. Diversified
manufacturer United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), another Dow
component, was down 1.2 percent at $71.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP energy index .GSPE dropped 1.7 percent. A run-up
in the U.S. dollar weighed on dollar-denominated commodity
prices. U.S. February crude CLGO fell 1.8 percent, or $1.40,
to settle at $77.62 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. dollar index .DXY was up 1.1 percent against
major currencies, helped by worries about Greece's ability to
refinance its deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the Nasdaq, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) was the heaviest weight,
down 1.5 percent at $211.725. Other tech bellwethers off 1
percent or more were Google (GOOG.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and
Cisco (CSCO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors have counted on emerging economies like China to
underpin a nascent global recovery, so any restrictive policy
there could be a setback for investors whose bets on a
sustainable rebound recently propelled the SP 500 to 15-month
highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Healthcare stocks, which led an advance on Tuesday on signs
that a healthcare overhaul could face new hurdles in Congress,
declined on Wednesday as some investors booked profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Morgan Stanley healthcare payor index .HMO dropped
2.1 percent and an index of pharmaceutical companies .DRG
dipped 0.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a busy earnings day for U.S. banks, Wells Fargo  Co
(WFC.N) and U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) reported better-than-forecast
quarterly earnings, helped by recent acquisitions, while a
larger rival, Bank of America Corp, got a boost from Merrill
Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America (BAC.N), the top U.S. bank by assets,
reported a wider-than-expected loss, but said its credit
problems were beginning to stabilize. [ID:nN20148741].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Bancorp shares rose 2.1 percent to $25.01 and Bank of
America gained 1 percent to $16.49. The KBW bank index .BKX
rose 1.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 is now up 68.2 percent since bottoming out in
early March 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Hoping to get a bigger piece of the U.S. defense budget, IBM announced Wednesday that it is buying security and analytics consultancy National Interest Security Company for an undisclosed sum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privately held NISC is based in Fairfax, Virginia, and focuses on the public sector, particularly national defense and security agencies. The company has more than 1,000 employees around the world, according to its Web site. Its clients include the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NISC itself has grown through acquisition. In 2008, it bought consultancy Multi-Threaded, which specialized in helping intelligence officials process data gathered during operations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NISC appears to have deep ties in the U.S. defense and security community. Jose Rodriguez, a former head of the Central Intelligence Agency's national clandestine service, joined the company in 2008, and its board members include former CIA director Michael Hayden, a retired U.S. Air Force general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will be rolled into IBM's Global Business Services unit and work in concert with Big Blue's Business Analytics and Optimization Services for Public Sector teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pending deal will also include an NISC affiliate, Technology and Management Services, and is expected to close in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Jan 20 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said it
will issue a patch to fix the old version of its Internet
Explorer browser that allowed recent attacks on Google Inc's

&lt;p&gt; The patch, due out on Thursday, "addresses the

security program manager at Microsoft. "Once applied, customers
are protected against the known attacks that have been widely

other companies. Microsoft acknowledged that the hackers took

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday expressed concern that the merger of Exxon Mobil and XTO Energy would reduce competition in the oil and gas industries and increase the use of a controversial drilling technique that could pollute water supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said last month it planned to buy XTO Energy XTO.N in an all-stock transaction worth about $30 billion, creating the largest U.S. natural gas producer and holder of gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Exxon Mobil-XTO deal may prompt its peers to move forward similarly, consolidate an already tight oil and gas market, and create additional concerns for the regulatory bodies that oversee the oil and gas supply," Representative Doris Matsui said at a House Energy and Environment Subcommittee hearing on the effects of the merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representative Edward Markey, who chairs the subcommittee, raised questions about whether hydraulic fracturing, which the combined Exxon-XTO plans to use when drilling for natural gas locked in shale rock, could pollute drinking water supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This merger heralds a fundamental long-term shift in U.S. energy markets and one that deserves our close attention," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," injects a mixture of water, sand and chemicals into rock formations to stimulate production. Some environmental groups oppose the technique as unsafe and seek more regulation over it and some lawmakers want to curb the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Markey said more supplies of natural gas, which the merged company would produce, would be critical in serving as a "bridge fuel" as the United States moves from burning coal to generate electricity to a clean energy future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Exxon Mobil was putting a "smart bet" on what America's energy future will be by merging with XTO, but he would rely on guidance from the Federal Trade Commission, which is reviewing the deal, on whether the combined company would stifle competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Chairman Rex Tillerson told lawmakers the merger "is unlikely to change the competitive balance" in the oil and gas industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are thousands of players," he said. "The fact that this merger occurs still leaves enormous amounts of opportunity for others to come in and participate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson defending fracking, saying the combined company would use the drilling technique to develop vast U.S. natural gas resources without harming the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With recent advances in extended reach horizontal drilling, combined with the time-tested technology of hydraulic fracturing ... we can now find and produce unconventional natural supplies miles below the surface in a safe, efficient and environmentally responsible manner," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XTO Energy Chairman Bob Simpson also stressed the importance of fracking in terms of increasing the nation's energy independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Additional production of domestic unconventional gas will result in increased supplies of energy, which will lead to expanding markets, all of which significantly enhance our energy security," Simpson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fracking is so important to the combined company's success that Exxon and XTO can call off the merger if Congress passes legislation banning the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without hydraulic fracturing, the gas that is locked in the shale rock stays locked," Tillerson said. "So, obviously our deal would make no sense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representative Fred Upton, the top Republican on the subcommittee, said fracking was safe and cited comments made by U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu last week backing the drilling technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it can be extracted in an environmentally safe way, then why would you want to ban it?" Chu asked reporters about fracking. "I think it can be done responsibly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

Subcommittee hearing on the effects of the merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representative Edward Markey, who chairs the subcommittee,
raised questions about whether hydraulic fracturing, which the
combined Exxon-XTO plans to use when drilling for natural gas
locked in shale rock, could pollute drinking water supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This merger heralds a fundamental long-term shift in U.S.
energy markets and one that deserves our close attention," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," injects a mixture of
water, sand and chemicals into rock formations to stimulate
production. Some environmental groups oppose the technique as
unsafe and seek more regulation over it and some lawmakers want
to curb the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Markey said more supplies of natural gas, which
the merged company would produce, would be critical in serving
as a "bridge fuel" as the United States moves from burning coal
to generate electricity to a clean energy future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Exxon Mobil was putting a "smart bet" on what
America's energy future will be by merging with XTO, but he
would rely on guidance from the Federal Trade Commission, which
is reviewing the deal, on whether the combined company would
stifle competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil Chairman Rex Tillerson told lawmakers the merger
"is unlikely to change the competitive balance" in the oil and
gas industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are thousands of players," he said. "The fact that
this merger occurs still leaves enormous amounts of opportunity
for others to come in and participate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson defending fracking, saying the combined company
would use the drilling technique to develop vast U.S. natural
gas resources without harming the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With recent advances in extended reach horizontal
drilling, combined with the time-tested technology of hydraulic
fracturing ... we can now find and produce unconventional
natural supplies miles below the surface in a safe, efficient
and environmentally responsible manner," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; XTO Energy Chairman Bob Simpson also stressed the
importance of fracking in terms of increasing the nation's
energy independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Additional production of domestic unconventional gas will
result in increased supplies of energy, which will lead to
expanding markets, all of which significantly enhance our
energy security," Simpson said.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fracking is so important to the combined company's success
that Exxon and XTO can call off the merger if Congress passes
legislation banning the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Without hydraulic fracturing, the gas that is locked in
the shale rock stays locked," Tillerson said. "So, obviously
our deal would make no sense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representative Fred Upton, the top Republican on the
subcommittee, said fracking was safe and cited comments made by
U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu last week backing the drilling
technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If it can be extracted in an environmentally safe way,
then why would you want to ban it?" Chu asked reporters about
fracking. "I think it can be done responsibly."

details on Richmond refinery)

 SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is
likely to close its oldest refinery, in Richmond, California,
in a wider restructuring of downstream operations, the local
newspaper's business editor wrote in a column on Wednesday.

 The second-largest U.S. oil company halted work on a $1
billion upgrade of Richmond last July after a state judge
ordered it, agreeing with environmentalists who brought a
lawsuit that the refinery's environmental impact report was
incomplete. The company later filed an appeal. [ID:nN20122859]

 Chevron said on Tuesday it planned to cut refinery jobs and
exit some markets, and the Contra Costa Times business editor,
Drew Voros, expects details to be unveiled in March to include
the closure of the 108-year-old refinery.

 "If Chevron had been allowed to complete the retrofit in
Richmond, there would be a strong fiscal argument to keep it
open. Instead, there is a strong fiscal argument to close it,"
Voros concluded in his column for the paper, serving the county
that is home to Richmond and Chevron's San Ramon headquarters.

 Chevron spokesman Lloyd Avram said the company had not yet
made any announcements on assets, jobs or markets.

 "We've operated in Richmond for more than 100 years, and we
would hope to continue operating," he said of the San Francisco
Bay refinery, which has capacity to refine more than 240,000
barrels of crude a day, ranking it 21st in the United States.

 A Richmond closure would be only the latest response by
refiners to a devastating squeeze on margins due to demand
weakened by the economy, coupled with high crude oil prices.

 Leading U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) said in
November it would close its plant in Delaware City, Delaware,
three months after indefinitely shutting its Aruba refinery.
Sunoco Inc SUN.N has idled its plant in Eagle Point, New
Jersey.

 Chevron said last week it expected to report sharply lower
refining earnings for the fourth quarter, and highlighted a $4
drop in U.S. West Coast refining margins.

 Stricter regulations in California, in particular,
historically have contributed to relatively fatter margins for
refined products in the state, but the West Coast premium over
the U.S. Gulf Coast disappeared last quarter.

 Chevron's largest U.S. refinery is on the Gulf Coast, in
Pascagoula, Mississippi, while its second-largest is about 400
miles down the coast from Richmond, in El Segundo, California.

 Voros cited sources at Chevron who said last year that the
company had talks with Chinese buyers who would have dismantled
and shipped the Richmond refinery to China, while the land
would be kept as an offloading facility for refined products.

 Just this month, larger rival Royal Dutch Shell Plc
(RDSa.L) said it would transform its Montreal East refinery
into a fuel terminal.

 Richmond sits at the southern end of a water artery that
gives tankers direct access from the Pacific Ocean to smaller
refineries in Rodeo, owned by ConocoPhillips (COP.N); Benicia,
owned by Valero; and Martinez, where one is owned by Shell and
the other by Tesoro Corp (TSO.N).

(Updates to afternoon)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Rodrigo Campos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Wall Street suffered its worst
slide of 2010 on Wednesday as investors worried that lending
restrictions in China could hurt the global economic recovery,
while a conservative outlook from IBM dented recent optimism
about the technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Official media and banking sources said Chinese authorities
instructed some major banks to curb their lending over the rest
of this month after an early burst of credit. For details, see
[ID:nSGE60J0A8]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Signals that China may curb its economic expansion hurt
shares of commodity-related companies, dragging the SP

sentiment here," said Michael James, senior trader at Wedbush
Morgan in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) fell 3.8
percent to $129.07. An analyst pointed out that the company's
earnings per share outlook for 2010 implies a slowdown in EPS
growth compared to recent years. [ID:nSGE60J0I7].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "IBM reported a good number, but I don't think it was good
enough relative to expectations, and tech is in general selling
off," said James.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI lost 194.98 points,
or 1.82 percent, to 10,530.45. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index

percent, to 2,274.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow and the Nasdaq had their largest daily percentage
losses since late October and the SP 500 had its biggest drop
since late November, a day after reaching new multi-month highs

the Republican candidate was victorious in (the) Massachusetts
(senatorial race), it would be a net positive for the market,"
Wedbush Morgan's James said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A lot more proof is going to be needed for the market to
resume its uptrend because people are more in the mindset of
selling the news right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Healthcare stocks, which led Tuesday's advance on
expectations that an overhaul of the healthcare system could

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) is in exclusive talks to buy the RBS Sempra commodities joint venture, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, in a deal expected to be worth about $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Australia's Macquarie (MQG.AX) had each submitted offers worth nearly $4 billion for the RBS Sempra unit by an early January deadline. JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank were seen as the frontrunners, but the latter was no longer in the running, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was willing to pay a higher price for the business, sources said, although details of the likely purchase price were not immediately known. One source said RBS was also keen for a quick transaction and due diligence process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's commodities unit, run by Blythe Masters, has been expanding in recent years. The March 2008 acquisition of Bear Stearns significantly increased the second-largest U.S. bank's commodities business, and Masters a year ago told Reuters it was aiming to be a top-tier franchise globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS Sempra is 51 percent-owned by Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), which has been forced by European regulators to sell its stake. Sempra Energy (SRE.N) is also set to sell its 49 percent stake in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sempra, RBS, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS Sempra trades commodities ranging from oil and natural gas to metals and agricultural products and would add to JPMorgan's existing commodities business to challenge market leaders Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Barclays Capital (BARC.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan has picked up assets and market share after weathering the financial crisis better than most rivals. It last week reported a fourth-quarter profit of $3.3 billion, fueled by strong investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS Sempra was formed in 2008 when RBS bought its controlling stake for $1.7 billion and California utility Sempra Energy invested $1.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FORCED SALE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS Sempra, whose antecedents include such colorful names as Enron and Metallgesellschaft Ltd, is a big player in the London metals market, while its energy business is largely focused on U.S. utility Sempra Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of its business centers on Michael Hutchinson, a towering figure in the closely knit metals community, who stood down as non-executive chairman of RBS Sempra last year, after four decades in the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS, which is 84 percent-owned by the British government, was given four years by Brussels to sell its stake but wants to sell it quickly as Chief Executive Stephen Hester is eager for a streamlined RBS to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS Sempra would also lose value if staff leave or uncertainty about the business persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank said recently it aimed to be among the world's top five commodities companies, from its current position of sixth.

&lt;p&gt; * $1 bln upgrade of Richmond refinery halted last July&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Columnist says Chevron looked at refinery sale last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Jan 20 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is
likely to close its oldest refinery, in Richmond, California,
in a wider restructuring of downstream operations, the local
newspaper's business editor wrote in a column on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The major U.S. oil company halted work on a $1 billion
upgrade of Richmond last July after a state judge ordered it,
agreeing with environmentalists who brought a lawsuit that the
refinery's environmental impact report was incomplete. The
company later filed an appeal. [ID:nN20122859]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said on Tuesday it planned to cut refinery jobs and
exit some markets, and the Contra Costa Times business editor,
Drew Voros, expects details to be unveiled in March to include
the closure of the 240,000 barrel-per-day refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If Chevron had been allowed to complete the retrofit in
Richmond, there would be a strong fiscal argument to keep it
open. Instead, there is a strong fiscal argument to close it,"
Voros concluded in his column for the paper, which serves the
county that is home to both the 108-year-old refinery and
Chevron's San Ramon headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Voros cited sources at Chevron who said last year that the
company had discussions with Chinese buyers who would have
dismantled and shipped the refinery to China, while the land
would have been kept as an offloading facility for refined
products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron spokesman was not immediately available for
comment.

&lt;p&gt; * Deutsche Bank seen no longer in running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Deal likely to be worth near $4 billion
 (Adds Sempra declines to comment, JPM background, contributor
 line. Updates stock prices.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Slater and Luke Pachymuthu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON/DUBAI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) is
in exclusive talks to buy the RBS Sempra commodities joint
venture, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, in
a deal expected to be worth about $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Australia's
Macquarie (MQG.AX) had each submitted offers worth nearly $4
billion for the RBS Sempra unit by an early January deadline.
JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank were seen as the frontrunners, but
the latter was no longer in the running, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan was willing to pay a higher price for the
business, sources said, although details of the likely purchase
price were not immediately known. One source said RBS was also
keen for a quick transaction and due diligence process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's commodities unit, run by Blythe Masters, has
been expanding in recent years. The March 2008 acquisition of
Bear Stearns significantly increased the second-largest U.S.
bank's commodities business, and Masters a year ago told
Reuters it was aiming to be a top-tier franchise globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RBS Sempra is 51 percent-owned by Royal Bank of Scotland
(RBS.L), which has been forced by European regulators to sell
its stake. Sempra Energy (SRE.N) is also set to sell its 49
percent stake in the deal. [ID:nLDE606192]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sempra, RBS, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RBS Sempra trades commodities ranging from oil and natural
gas to metals and agricultural products and would add to
JPMorgan's existing commodities business to challenge market
leaders Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and
Barclays Capital (BARC.L). [ID:nN09168115]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York-based JPMorgan has picked up assets and market
share after weathering the financial crisis better than most
rivals. It last week reported a fourth-quarter profit of $3.3
billion, fueled by strong investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RBS Sempra was formed in 2008 when RBS bought its
controlling stake for $1.7 billion and California utility
Sempra Energy invested $1.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FORCED SALE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RBS Sempra, whose antecedents include such colorful names
as Enron and Metallgesellschaft Ltd, is a big player in the
London metals market, while its energy business is largely
focused on U.S. utility Sempra Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much of its business centers on Michael Hutchinson, a
towering figure in the closely knit metals community, who stood
down as non-executive chairman of RBS Sempra last year, after
four decades in the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RBS, which is 84 percent-owned by the British government,
was given four years by Brussels to sell its stake but wants to
sell it quickly as Chief Executive Stephen Hester is eager for
a streamlined RBS to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RBS Sempra would also lose value if staff leave or
uncertainty about the business persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank said recently it aimed to be among the
world's top five commodities companies, from its current
position of sixth. But it has said it can achieve this
organically, and it has been aggressively investing in the
business, including new offices in Houston and Calgary to build
out its physical commodities trading to add to its commodities
derivatives activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In New York midday trading Wednesday, Sempra's shares fell
78 cents to $51.75, and shares of JPMorgan fell 31 cents to
$42.97. RBS shares dipped 0.9 percent to close at 38 pence in
London.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic lawmakers on
Wednesday expressed concern that the merger of Exxon Mobil and
XTO Energy would reduce competition in the oil and gas markets
and increase the use of a controversial drilling technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said last month it planned to buy XTO
Energy XTO.N in an all-stock transaction worth about $30
billion, creating the largest U.S. natural gas producer and
holder of gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The ExxonMobil-XTO deal may prompt its peers to move
forward similarly, consolidate an already tight oil and gas
market, and create additional concerns for the regulatory
bodies that oversee the oil and gas supply," Representative
Doris Matsui said at a House Energy and Environment
Subcommittee hearing on the effects of the merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representative Edward Markey, who chairs the subcommittee,
raised questions about whether hydraulic fracturing, which the
combined Exxon-XTO plans to use when drilling for natural gas
locked in shale rock, could pollute drinking water supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This merger heralds a fundamental long-term shift in U.S.
energy markets and one that deserves our close attention," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," injects a mixture of
water, sand and chemicals into rock formations to stimulate
production. Some environmental groups oppose the technique as
unsafe and seek more regulation over it and some lawmakers want
to curb the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Markey said more supplies of natural gas, which
the merged company would produce, would be critical in serving
as a "bridge fuel" as the United States moves from relying on
coal to produce electricity to a clean energy future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil Chairman Rex Tillerson told lawmakers the
combined company could use fracking to develop vast U.S.
natural gas resources without harming the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With recent advances in extended reach horizontal
drilling, combined with the time-tested technology of hydraulic
fracturing ... we can now find and produce unconventional
natural supplies miles below the surface in a safe, efficient
and environmentally responsible manner," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Additional production of domestic unconventional gas will
result in increased supplies of energy, which will lead to
expanding markets, all of which significantly enhance our
energy security," said XTO Energy Chairman Bob Simpson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fracking is so important to the combined company that Exxon
and XTO can call off the merger if Congress passes legislation
banning the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representative Fred Upton, the top Republican on the
subcommittee, said fracking was safe and cited comments made by
U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu last week backing the drilling
technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If it can be extracted in an environmentally safe way,
then why would you want to ban it?" Chu asked reporters about
fracking. "I think it can be done responsibly."

(Recasts, updates to midday, changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Rodrigo Campos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were having their
worst day of 2010 on Wednesday as lending restrictions in China
worried investors about the global economic recovery, while a
conservative outlook from IBM weighed down technology shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Official media and banking sources said Chinese authorities
instructed some major banks to curb their lending over the rest
of this month after an early burst of credit. For details, see
[ID:nSGE60J0A8]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Signals that China may curb its economic expansion hurt
shares of commodity-related companies, dragging the SP
materials sector .GSPM down 2.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Concerns over Greek debt helped push the euro to a
five-month low against the U.S. dollar, weighing down commodity
prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You combine what's going on in China with the strength in
the dollar and you have an unwind of the commodity trade," said
Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak  Co in New
York. "Then you throw in mediocre earnings relative to
expectations, and the market is taking a well-needed
correction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 185.61
points, or 1.73 percent, to 10,539.82. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX fell 18.70 points, or 1.63 percent, to
1,131.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC lost 44.48 points,
or 1.93 percent, to 2,275.92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) fell 3.6
percent to $129.34 after an analyst said the company's earnings
per share outlook for 2010 implies a slowdown in EPS growth

quarterly profit after the bell on Tuesday. [ID:nSGE60J0I7].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a busy earnings day for U.S. banks, Wells Fargo  Co and
U.S. Bancorp reported better-than-forecast quarterly earnings,
helped by recent acquisitions, while larger rival, Bank of
America Corp, got a boost from Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America (BAC.N), the top U.S. bank by assets,
reported a wider-than-expected loss, but said its credit
problems were beginning to stabilize. For details see

&lt;p&gt;Companies Expand Cloud Opportunity for Developers and Channel Partners
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. &amp; REDMOND, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq:INTU) and Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:MSFT) plan to create new
opportunities for software developers to deliver and market Web applications to
small business customers through the Intuit App Center. The two companies plan
to integrate the capabilities of their cloud services platforms - the Intuit
Partner Platform and Windows&#174; Azure platform - to enable developers and channel
partners to deliver solutions to the millions of employees within businesses
that use QuickBooks&#174; financial software. In addition, the two companies will
provide small businesses with Microsoft`s cloud-based productivity applications
via the Intuit App Center. 

Intuit will name Windows Azure as a "preferred platform" for small business
cloud application development on the Intuit Partner Platform. The companies
expect this to jump-start development and distribution of new Web-based
applications to help small businesses in today`s challenging economy. The free
Windows Azure software development kit (SDK) (Beta) for Intuit Partner Platform
is available today at http://developer.intuit.com/azure. 

"Intuit and Microsoft are trusted technology partners to small business," said
Walid Abu-Hadba, Microsoft Corporate Vice-President of the Developer &amp; Platform
Evangelism organization. "By combining the pooled technology assets of our
developer communities, we stand to produce an outpouring of new applications to
help small businesses enhance their competitive edge." 

Immense Ecosystem of Developers and Channel Partners Benefits Small Businesses

As two leading technology platform providers to small businesses, Intuit and
Microsoft are creating a vast ecosystem of more than 750,000 development firms
and channel partners to create more new innovative applications and services
that will reach the market more quickly.

* For Microsoft developers, the ability to develop applications for Intuit`s
loyal customers will open a new landscape of sales prospects looking for small
business solutions. 
* For Intuit`s developer community, Microsoft provides a cloud platform and
tools that will boost developer productivity and expand the possibilities to
extend Intuit`s core application functionality.

"Intuit is driven to help small businesses succeed by improving their bottom
line," said Bill Lucchini, Vice President and General Manager of Intuit`s
Platform as a Service Group. "The Intuit App Center is a huge breakthrough,
allowing us to get innovative apps that solve real problems in users` hands
faster than ever before. Now, Microsoft developers can enhance their businesses
with access to the small business channel, the Intuit App Center will get
stronger and small businesses will reap the rewards of all this innovation." 

"The Windows Azure SDK for Intuit Partner Platform is great news for .NET and
Intuit Partner Platform developers," said Joe Dwyer, CTO of Propelware, a
longstanding member of the Intuit Developer Network, specializing in integrating
software applications with QuickBooks. "Our developers are already very familiar
with Visual Studio, and with the Windows Azure platform, we will no longer have
to worry about maintenance, reliability and scale and can focus on creating
richer applications for small businesses faster and respond quickly as their
needs change." 

New Opportunities for Developers and Channel Partners

The Intuit Partner Platform will give Windows Azure developers the ability to
build applications that their customers can use to take advantage of their
QuickBooks data. In addition, developers get instant access to a pre-built
channel for acquiring customers - a potential market of millions of employees at
small businesses that use QuickBooks. A simple click from the QuickBooks Pro and
Premier 2010 toolbar takes small businesses to the Intuit App Center where they
can find, buy and use Web-based business applications built on or integrated
with the Intuit Partner Platform. Applications in the App Center can also be
accessed via any Web browser. 

Integrated Microsoft Online Services on the Intuit App Center Later This Year

Later this year, Microsoft plans to make Microsoft Online Services, including
Microsoft Exchange Online, Microsoft SharePoint Online, Microsoft Office Live
Meeting and Microsoft Office Communications Online, available for purchase in
the Intuit App Center. These cloud-based applications streamline business
communication and collaboration with comprehensive security, high reliability
and simplified IT management. As a result, small businesses will have a complete
set of high-quality Web applications that deliver the capabilities, flexibility
and value they need.

&lt;p&gt;Project Will Empower Farmers in Uganda and Kenya as They Sell Their Fruit for
Use in Locally Produced Coca-Cola Juices
KAMPALA, Uganda--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company, nonprofit TechnoServe, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates
Foundation today launched a partnership to enable over 50,000 small fruit
farmers in Uganda and Kenya to increase their productivity and double their
incomes by 2014. 

This four-year, $11.5 million partnership will enable mango and passion fruit
farmers to participate in the Company`s supply chain for the first time. With a
$7.5 million grant provided by the Gates Foundation to TechnoServe, $3 million
provided by The Coca-Cola Company, and $1 million by bottling partner Coca-Cola
Sabco, the project aims to create new market opportunities for local farmers
whose fruit will be used for Coca-Cola`s locally-produced and sold fruit juices.
As the implementing partner, TechnoServe will train participating farmers in
improving quality, increasing production, getting organized into farmer groups,
and will facilitate access to credit. 

"This partnership is a great example of sustainability. By partnering with tens
of thousands of local farmers, we can help increase their incomes while meeting
our needs for locally sourced fruit, benefiting both the community and our
business," says Nathan Kalumbu, Coca Cola`s East &amp; Central Africa business unit
president. 

As global and local demand for fruit juice grows, there is a critical need to
increase production. Small farmers can benefit from this increased demand by
supplying fruit that meets the needs of local buyers such as Coca-Cola. Through
this partnership, farmers who were previously unable to access this market
opportunity will be provided with the tools to do so. This partnership will also
serve as a model for Coca-Cola as it grows its juice business in other markets
and has been designed to be easily replicated. 

"This partnership is the type of innovative approach needed to foster economic
empowerment across the globe and we are proud to be a part of this effort in
East Africa," says Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. "We
and our partners the Gates Foundation and TechnoServe believe that investing in
farmers is a proven strategy to reduce poverty and build sustainable
communities." 

"Empowering small farmers to increase productivity, improve crop quality and
access reliable markets is critical to addressing global hunger and poverty,"
says Sylvia Mathews Burwell, president of the Global Development Program of the
Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The foundation has committed more than $1.4
billion, focused on Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, to strengthen the entire
agricultural value chain-from seeds and soil to farm management and market
access-so that progress against hunger and poverty is sustainable over the long
term. "Partnerships like this provide farmers with the tools and resources that
can help revitalize African agriculture and increase opportunities for small
farmers so they build better lives for themselves and their families." 

TechnoServe`s implementation of this partnership will build on a track record of
similar partnerships underway across Africa including banana, cashews, cocoa and
coffee. They will ensure that sustainable environmental and social standards are
embedded into the program at the farm level. 

"We are honored to be a part of this innovative collaboration as it represents a
significant step forward for private sector development in Africa," says
TechnoServe President and CEO Bruce McNamer. "This investment will drive
momentum toward reducing poverty across Africa by helping entrepreneurial
farmers connect to markets and get the support they need." 

This project will be implemented in close collaboration with the governments of
Kenya and Uganda, given its significance in the context of their poverty
reduction strategies. It is intended to produce lasting benefits for
participating farm communities, enabling them to benefit from improved
livelihoods for many years to come.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Vladimir Soldatkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOSCOW, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Oil output at Russia's Exxon
Mobil-led Sakhalin-1 project fell more than 14 percent last year
due to natural depletion, an Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) spokesman said
on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said crude extraction at Sakhalin-1, which is run under a
production sharing deal, dropped last year to about 8.2 million
tonnes from more than 9.6 million tonnes in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project has been producing oil for several years and
reached peak production of 11.2 million tonnes in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The production declined due to the natural process of field
depletion," the spokesman of Exxon's Russian affiliate Exxon
Neftegas Limited (ENL) said by telephone from the Pacific island
of Sakhalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "ENL has met and continues to meet or exceed the project
production targets, approved by relevant Russian authorities,"
he added, declining to provide output forecast for this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, Russian oil output rose 1.5 percent to 9.925
million barrels per day, or 494.228 million tonnes, due to the
commissioning of several new fields, including state oil company
Rosneft's (ROSN.MM) Vankor field in the Arctic.[ID:nLDE60102I]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon operates Sakhalin-1 along with Rosneft, Japan's Itochu
(8001.T), Marubeni (8002.T) and India's ONGC (ONGC.BO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ENL also said on Wednesday it had successfully completed the
first two extended-reach wells in the Odoptu field of the
project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The field is anticipated to begin producing oil in the
second half of 2010," it said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sakhalin-1 project includes the phased development of
three fields with an estimated total resource of 2.3 billion
barrels (307 million tons) of oil and 17 trillion cubic feet
(485 billion cubic meters) of natural gas.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft mobile chief Robbie Bach may believe that the Linux OS will lose out to Windows Mobile in the smartphone space, but Linux Foundation director Jim Zemlin is having none of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blog post this week, Zemlin fired back at comments Bach made to financial analysts at CES (consumer electronics show) that there is too much complexity in Linux and too many versions for phone carriers to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By Bach's count there are 17 variants of Linux available on mobile phones," writes Zemlin. "He sees this as a bad thing for customers. We, unsurprisingly, see this as a bad thing for Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At CES, Bach, president of Microsoft's Entertainment and Devices division, predicted a mobile OS shake-out where carriers will reject some Linux mobile operating systems because they complicate support issues. He stated that that various versions of Linux on mobile are "a little quirky and a little different, require separate network certifications, network product support, and the like that goes along with that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bach also said that mobile Linux's "quality bar won't stack up, and they won't get the scale that they need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that line of argument, Zemlin countered that Linux mobile variants such as Android, Moblin, Palm WebOS, Maemo and others are growing rapidly on mobile devices ranging from smartphones to netbooks precisely because of the choice they offer hardware makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Palm, Motorola and others have jumped ship from Windows Mobile to Linux-based offerings in recent years," writes Zemlin. "LG is now using Android on 50 percent of its handsets. According to Gartner Group, Windows Mobile's global market share fell to 7.9 percent in the third quarter of 2009 down from 11.1 percent the same quarter of last year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Gartner report also cites that Android's market share grew from 0 percent in Q3 of 2008 (because it was brand new) to 3.9 percent in Q3 of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Windows Mobile has been losing market share for the past two years while the iPhone and BlackBerry devices have had steady growth. An October survey by market researcher comScore marked the first time Windows Mobile's market share has fallen behind the iPhone, putting the iPhone in second place below BlackBerry and dropping Windows Mobile to third place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't help Microsoft that the poorly-received Windows Mobile 6.5 is seen as a placeholder for when the real deal Windows Mobile 7 hits the market. Yet WinMo 7 delays - it reportedly may not be released until 2011 - have curbed momentum for the OS and allowed Google's Linux-based Android time to win over phone makers, consumers and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his post, Zemlin criticizes Windows Mobile's entire business model, pointing out that phone carriers and manufacturers have to pay Microsoft a per-device charge for Windows Mobile, but pay nothing for Linux-based platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also attacks the branding and licensing restrictions of Windows Mobile. "Basically Microsoft wants to 'own the glass.' With Linux you have multiple ways to brand and market your product, making it your product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zemlin admits that individual variants of Linux may come and go and that working with Linux on mobile is a complex task, but with this complexity comes more choice in technology and branding flexibility for carriers and manufacturers, he says, "instead of getting the technology and pricing dictated to them from Redmond."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zemlin also stresses that building a phone on Linux is simpler now than it was just a few years ago when "handset manufacturers had to build from scratch their own OS if they didn't want to give up a big percentage of their margins to Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Microsoft cannot deny is the sudden demand for Android phones with the recent release of devices like the Motorola Droid, Droid Eris and the new "Google phone" Nexus One. A December report from research firm Forrester forecasts that Android phones will take 10 percent of the mobile market in 2010 due to increased acceptance of the open OS by developers and industry support from partners such as Verizon, Qualcomm, Motorola and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zemlin references the Android surge in his blog post, offering a warning to Bach and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I suppose if he [Bach] truly believes choice is a bad thing, he may truly believe Linux will lose, but unfortunately the market momentum and adoption numbers are proving quite the opposite."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft patched the Internet Explorer (IE) vulnerability that was used to break into Google's network, it also acknowledged that it had known of the bug since August 2009, when an Israeli security company reported the flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As part of [our] investigation, we also determined that the vulnerability was the same as a vulnerability responsibly reported to us and confirmed in early September," said Jerry Bryant, a senior program manager with the Microsoft Security Response Center, on the MSRC blog today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MS10-002 bulletin that accompanied the IE update credited Meron Sellem of BugSec for reporting the bug that has raised a ruckus since Google accused Chinese cybercriminals with hacking its network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sellem said that BugSec, a penetration testing and security firm in Rishon LeZion, Israel, reported the vulnerability to Microsoft on Aug. 26, not in September as Microsoft indicated. And he was critical of Microsoft for taking this long to release a patch. "I think yes, it took too long," he said. "But Microsoft is a big organization and we don't know how much time it takes them. We asked them why it was taking such a long time, and they said it was because of the testing they had to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security, said the fact that Microsoft knew of the vulnerability months before it crafted a patch -- months before Chinese criminals used the flaw -- shouldn't come as a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's pretty par for the course, really," said Storms. "We know that patches sit for a good month or so in QA [quality assurance] at Microsoft. So if it was reported to Microsoft in September, it might not have been added to the [patch] cycle until October, and the code not written until November. A February release isn't crazy then."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms refused to use hindsight to say that Microsoft was tardy to the party. "Unless you have real evidence that it's being used, you can't take that into account when you prioritize patches," he argued. "You take into account the skill level necessary to exploit it. But if it's responsibly disclosed, you have to assume that it's not going to release [publicly]. And without partners saying that they're seeing signs of it being exploited, Microsoft probably thought they could just roll it into their normal IE release cycle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft last patched IE in December 2009, and on average, updated its browser every two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn't surprise Sellem that others found the vulnerability, then decided to use it maliciously. "We found this vulnerability very easily," said Sellem, "and we didn't think it would be hard for others to find." BugSec spent about two weeks researching IE before it discovered the flaw, Sellem added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There have certainly been cases when multiple people have reported the same bug, so it's not hard to fathom that more than one could have found this at around the same time," said Storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the patch for the vulnerability used to attack Google and others, Microsoft also patched seven other bugs in IE in today's update. Of the eight flaws fixed today, seven were rated "critical" by Microsoft, the highest threat ranking in its four-step scoring system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Actually, we're getting February's IE update early," said Storms, referring to Microsoft's admission that this "out-of-band" was previously planned for Feb. 9, the company's next regularly-scheduled Patch Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Earlier, I was a bit surprised how quickly they said they would patch [the Google] bug, but now it all makes sense," said Storms. "These were already in QA -- they would have had to be if there were going to release them in February -- so it's no surprise that they were able to release a fix in two weeks time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Bryant said that the company was alerted that hackers were actively using the IE vulnerability only on Jan. 11. Google, however, said it first uncovered evidence of attacks on its network in mid-December 2009, and began reaching out to other companies that may have been victimized shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter when this patch would have hit, Google attack or not, it would have been a big deal. "If this had come out in February, it would have been the most important patch of the day," Storms argued. "It's client side, it's IE, it has a good handful of remote code vulnerabilities, so this would have been the No. 1 to go out and patch immediately." In fact, Storms expects that researchers, both legitimate and criminal, will be digging into the cumulative update, looking for hints that will lead them to other exploits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So I guess we can be thankful that we're getting it early," said Storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IE security update can be downloaded and installed via the Microsoft Update and Windows Update services, as well as through Windows Server Update Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) is considering buying a controlling stake in Russian juice maker Nidan Soki from London-based private equity group Lion Capital, sources familiar with the deal participants said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal would allow Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft drink maker, to take over a leading position on the Russian juice market from rival PepsiCo (PEP.N), which together with Pepsi Bottling Group Inc PBG.N, owns Russia's largest juice maker Lebedyansky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lion Capital bought a 75 percent stake in Russia's fourth-largest juice maker in 2007 and is now offering to sell it, two sources close to Nidan Soki told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Coca-Cola is one of the pretenders," a source close to the deal participants said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source, familiar with Lion Capital's plans, said that the fund had been looking for a buyer since November 2009, adding that "the deal between Nidan and Coca-Cola is very likely this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola owns Russian juice maker Multon, through which it controls nearly 22 percent of the Russian juice market, according to research group Business Analitika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pepsi has a 32 percent market share, Wimm-Bill-Dann WBD.N has 19 percent and Nidan Soki has a 14 percent share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Maria Plis and Maria Kiselyova; Editing by Hans Peters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), under fire for gold-plated pay packages, cut average pay per employee by about a quarter from record 2007 levels, helping boost its profit to a record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the forecast-beating results were quickly overshadowed by anxiety about the impact of the Obama administration's proposed crackdown on financial risktaking, and shares in Wall Street's biggest proprietary trading institution slumped 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman Sachs is not a banking or financial story now, it's a political story," said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager at Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had been on track to shatter its compensation record from 2007, but instead decided to set aside nothing for compensation in the fourth quarter and give $500 million to charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move, which cut average compensation per employee to $498,000, helped the Wall Street bank report a record profit for 2009 and a better-than-expected fourth-quarter net income of $4.95 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average pay was still up from $317,000 last year, but down from $661,490 in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move helped Goldman answer critics who have lambasted the bank for setting aside so much for bonuses months after U.S. taxpayers rescued the banking industry during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman Sachs is not deaf to the calls for restraint," the bank's chief financial officer, David Viniar, told reporters on a conference call. The bank consulted U.S. pay czar Kenneth Feinberg regarding its bonus policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political scrutiny of Wall Street firms is intensifying. President Barack Obama on Thursday proposed stricter limits on financial risk-taking. This could wallop Goldman, which often trades its own funds to help bolster the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FALLING SHARES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares rose in early trading but later fell after Obama proposed steps including preventing major banks from owning, sponsoring or investing in hedge funds for their own profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman became a bank holding company in 2008 during the financial crisis as a signal of safety to investors, but also opening itself up to more regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like Goldman Sachs has been given a reason to give back their bank charter," said Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer of the Omnivest Group in Princeton, New Jersey. "Moreover, it also looks as though banks may be going down the path of being regulated like utilities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman denied it had any intention of giving back its bank charter, but its shares fell as much as 6.6 percent and were down 3.5 percent at $161.90 in late afternoon trade. Goldman shares are down 18 percent from their highs in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's debt protection costs also jumped after Obama's proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responding to outrage over high pay, the bank set aside 36 percent of net revenue for compensation for 2009, Goldman's lowest percentage as a public company. Compensation for the year totaled $16.19 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A protest demonstration over Wall Street excess was planned for Thursday in front of Goldman's headquarters in New York. The investment bank, famously referred to as "a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity" in a scathing piece in Rolling Stone last summer, is seen as a poster child for the excesses of Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NOT DEAF"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will alleviate some political pressure," said Keith Davis, a bank analyst at money manager Farr, Miller  Washington in Washington, D.C. "They've been in everyone's cross-hairs for how much money they make. I think they'll still be there, but the fact that they took down the bonuses will help incrementally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank recorded negative compensation expense in the fourth quarter because of the contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives, the firm's charitable arm. The contribution was part of total commitments to charitable and small business initiatives during 2009 in excess of $1 billion, the firm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compensation total was far below the record $20.2 billion the firm paid in 2007, and well below what the firm was expected to pay this year as it reported blockbuster profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's British staff is likely to bear the brunt of the bonus cut as the firm curbed payouts in light of Britain's supertax on bonuses, an industry source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm last month moved to deflect criticism on pay by announcing its top 30 managers would receive their bonuses entirely in long-term stock. The banking industry has moved to pay in equity in an effort to tie compensation to long-term performance and curb risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which has also changed its pay structures, on Wednesday reported an annual loss for 2009 but still paid out more than $14 billion as it ratcheted up its compensation ratio to 62 percent from 51 percent in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, led by Rep. Barney Frank, will hold a hearing on Friday to discuss compensation for top executives in the finance sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, a commission investigating the financial crisis called Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein to testify on Capitol Hill, quizzing him on the firm's role in the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after Goldman curbed its pay, it faced a fresh lawsuit from the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority alleging excessive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OVERSHADOWED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's fourth-quarter profit amounted to $8.20 a share, topping analysts' average forecast by $3. In the year-earlier fourth quarter it posted a loss of $2.12 billion, or $4.97 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth-quarter compensation actions boosted profit dramatically. If the company had set aside $3.3 billion in the quarter for pay, which would have brought total compensation expense to about $20 billion for the year, Goldman would have earned less than $4.00 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But low compensation expense may be difficult to repeat in the future, raising questions about how strong Goldman's performance really was in the fourth quarter, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's trading momentum fell off in the quarter. Goldman reported trading and principal investments revenue of $5.1 billion, down 43 percent from the third quarter. Rivals reported similar declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking was strong as Goldman reported revenue of $1.6 billion, up 58 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman reported revenues of $9.62 billion, which were in line with analyst expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also drew down risk in the fourth quarter as its average Daily Value at Risk (VaR) declined to $181 million from $197 million a year earlier and $208 million in the third quarter. VaR, one measure of risk, stands for the maximum that could potentially be lost trading on a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm paid $6.44 billion in corporate taxes, resulting in a tax rate of 32.5 percent for 2009. That is up from less than 1 percent in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Obama's announcement, credit default swaps insuring Goldman's debt jumped by around 25 basis points to 120 basis points, or $120,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yield spreads on Goldman's 7.5 percent notes due in 2019 widened by 12 basis points to 150 basis points over Treasuries, according to MarketAxess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder, Dan Wilchins, Elinor Comlay, Jennifer Ablan, Karen Brettell, Dena Aubin; Editing by John Wallace, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday released a patch to protect users of its Internet Explorer browser from attacks similar to those directed at Google Inc's operations in China last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company, which said hackers targeting Google and at least 20 other companies in China exploited a weakness in its browser, said its new patch was "critical" and people should apply it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other hackers have begun to exploit the flaw, according to researchers with Symantec Corp, the world's biggest security software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symantec has found viruses that take advantage of the weakness in Microsoft's browser on some 100 websites, security researcher John Harrison said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are dangerous because they can infect the PC of any user who visits those sites. Unlike less powerful viruses, it is not necessary for people to download software for their machines to become infected, Harrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCs are safe if they apply the patch, which resolves eight vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, Microsoft said. The most serious could allow hackers to gain control of a computer remotely via Web sites people visit while using the browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're always working, we have fewer vulnerabilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;than our competitors," said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer at an energy conference in Houston, addressing cyber-security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gave no indication that Microsoft would change its business in China after Google threatened to quit the country last week. "We respect the laws of China, it's the only appropriate thing for us to do," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The viruses Symantec has found only successfully attack Internet Explorer 6, though hackers could figure out how to break through the defenses of Internet Explorer 7 and 8, the most recent version of the software, Symantec's Harrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Internet Explorer customers, who have automatic updating enabled on their systems, will not need to take any action on the security patch, Microsoft said. For manual updating, it directed users to its website (here).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, Jim Finkle and Anna Driver; Editing by Richard Chang and Robert MacMillan)&lt;/p&gt;

Explorer browser from attacks similar to those directed at
Google Inc's (GOOG.O) operations in China last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company, which said hackers
targeting Google and at least 20 other companies in China
exploited a weakness in its browser, said its new patch was
"critical" and people should apply it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other hackers have begun to exploit the flaw, according to
researchers with Symantec Corp (SYMC.O), the world's biggest
security software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Symantec has found viruses that take advantage of the
weakness in Microsoft's browser on some 100 websites, security
researcher John Harrison said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are dangerous because they can infect the PC of any
user who visits those sites. Unlike less powerful viruses, it
is not necessary for people to download software for their
machines to become infected, Harrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PCs are safe if they apply the patch, which resolves eight
vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, Microsoft said. The most
serious could allow hackers to gain control of a computer
remotely via Web sites people visit while using the browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're always working, we have fewer vulnerabilities
 than our competitors," said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve
Ballmer at an energy conference in Houston, addressing
cyber-security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He gave no indication that Microsoft would change its
business in China after Google threatened to quit the country
last week. "We respect the laws of China, it's the only
appropriate thing for us to do," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The viruses Symantec has found only successfully attack
Internet Explorer 6, though hackers could figure out how to
break through the defenses of Internet Explorer 7 and 8, the
most recent version of the software, Symantec's Harrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most Internet Explorer customers, who have automatic
updating enabled on their systems, will not need to take any
action on the security patch, Microsoft said. For manual
updating, it directed users to its website
(here).

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

BofA Disappoints on TARP Payback

Bank of America Corporation`s (NYSE: BAC) fourth quarter 2009 loss came in at 60
cents per share, a nickel worse than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of
55 cents. This compares unfavorably with the loss of 48 cents in the prior-year
quarter. 

Results for the quarter included dividends on preferred stock and a $4.0 billion
negative impact associated with repaying the bailout money. Since the end of
2009, BofA has been absolutely free from pay restrictions as it has repaid the
full TARP funds. 

The worse-than-expected results came in due primarily to challenges in the U.S.
and global economies as well as stress on the consumer, which continues to
result in high credit costs. However, credit costs were lower than the prior
quarter. 

Behind the Headlines

Improved non-interest income has also helped offset the negative impact of the
TARP-related loss to some extent. Non-interest income increased as a result of
an improvement in trading and much higher income from investment and brokerage
services, equity investments and investment banking. However, net interest
income was on the downside, which declined on a year-over-year basis as a result
of lower asset liability management portfolio levels and reduced loan demand. 

During the reported quarter, a cash dividend of 1 cent per common share was paid
and the company reported $5.0 billion in preferred dividends. 

For full year 2009, BofA reported a loss of $2.2 billion or 29 cents per share,
compared to a net income of $2.6 billion or 54 cents in the year ago. 

Fully taxable-equivalent revenue net of interest expense was $25.4 billion, up
59% from $16.0 billion in the prior-year quarter, reflecting in part the
addition of Merrill Lynch. 

Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $11.9 billion, down
11% from $13.4 billion in the year-ago quarter. 

Net interest yield decreased 69 basis points (bps) year-over-year to 2.62%. The
decrease was a result of the addition of lower yielding assets from Merrill
Lynch. 

Non-interest income increased to $13.5 billion from $2.6 billion in the
prior-year quarter. Reported non-interest income included a $1.1 billion gain on
BofA's investment in BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) as a result of its purchase of
Barclays` (NYSE: BCS) asset management business. On the negative side, there was
a loss of $1.6 billion mostly related to mark-to-market adjustments on the
Merrill Lynch structured notes, as BofA's credit spreads improved during the
reported quarter. 

Non-interest expense increased to $16.4 billion from $10.9 billion in the
prior-year quarter. The increase in non-interest income reflects higher
personnel and general operating expenses, driven partially by the acquisition of
Merrill Lynch. The increase was also due to an increase in pretax merger and
restructuring charges to $533 million from $306 million in the year-ago quarter.


The efficiency ratio on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was 64.47% compared to
68.51% in the prior-year quarter. Book value per share of common stock as of Dec
31, 2009 was $21.48, compared to $22.99 as of Sep 30, 2009 and $27.77 as of Dec
31, 2008. 

Questions Regarding Credit Quality

Though credit costs remained high, overall credit quality was mixed during the
quarter. Though the provision for credit losses increased 18.5% on a
year-over-year basis, it decreased 13.6% sequentially. Non-performing assets
increased 5.7% sequentially to $35.7 billion, reflecting a slower rate of
increase than in the recent quarters as a result of some early signs of economic
recovery. Net charge-offs decreased 12.5% sequentially to $8.4 billion. Net
charge-off ratio improved 42 bps sequentially to 3.71% but nonperforming assets
ratio deteriorated 26 bps sequentially to 3.98%. 

At the end of the reported quarter, the company`s Tier 1 capital ratio
deteriorated to 10.40% from 12.46% at the end of prior quarter. Tier 1 common
ratio improved to 7.81% from 7.25% at the end of the prior quarter. 

The market turmoil was more harmful to BofA than to its peers. However, the
company has concluded its biggest acquisitions. BofA acquired brokerage giant
Merrill Lynch almost during the height of the financial crisis last year. It
also acquired Countrywide Financial Corporation on July 1, 2008. The CEO views
these deals as beneficial for stakeholders of the company. Furthermore, this
will allow the bank to focus on rebuilding customer relationships. 

Though BofA`s earnings benefited from the improvement in trading, investment and
brokerage income, the company experienced continued net interest yield
compression and a mixed credit quality. Additionally, since the acquisition of
Merrill Lynch, BofA has had differences of opinion with regulators and lawmakers
over Merrill's 2008 bonus payments issues amid escalating losses. We think the
new CEO should focus on the integration of Merrill Lynch and smooth relations
with regulators. 

Struggling Along with Peers

Most of the major banks are suffering from losses related to mortgages and
credit cards of their retail banking operations. Yesterday, in its earnings
release Citigroup (NYSE: C) said that its full year 2009 loss of $1.6 billion or
80 cents per share partly came from losses in its mortgage and credit card
businesses. Similarly, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) said last week in its earnings
release that its full year net income of $11.7 billion or $2.26 per share, which
more than doubled compared to 2008, was impacted by the outflow of money from
its consumer and credit card businesses.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Four free stock picks are being made available today on Zacks.com. The
industry`s leading independent research firm highlights one Zacks #1 Rank Strong
Buy or a Zacks #2 Rank Buy stock for each of the four main styles of investing:
Aggressive Growth, Growth &amp; Income, Momentum, and Value. 

The four highlighted picks are: Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT), Best Buy Co. (NYSE:
BBY), 51job, Inc. (Nasdaq: JOBS) and The Hartford Financial Services (NYSE:
HIG). 

Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Four daily picks
are offered free at http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

Zacks #1 Rank Stocks have nearly tripled the S 500 since 1988, producing an
average annual return of +26%. Performance has been notable even during volatile
and down times. For example, during the last bear market, 2000-2002, the market
tumbled -37.6% - but Zacks #1 Rank stocks gained +43.8%. 

Here is a summary of today's selected stocks that are now highly rated by Zacks:

Aggressive Growth - Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT) 

Walter Energy analysts are projecting impressive growth in 2010 as shares
continue to climb.

Growth &amp; Income - Best Buy Co.(NYSE: BBY) 

Best Buy Co., Inc. saw robust sales in December. Revenue of $8.5 billion was up
13% year-over-year. The gain can in part be attributed to a jump of 8.2% in
comparable store sales.

Momentum - 51job, Inc. (Nasdaq: JOBS) 

51job, Inc. more than tripled in 2009, rising on the strong Chinese economy and
strong Q3 results from late November that saw a big jump in revenues from the
company's online recruitment services division.

How to Regularly Access Picks from the Zacks Rank Discovery for
Free:http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

Underlying the four free stock picks is a simple truth that first appeared in a
Financial Analysts Journal article published in 1979. Leonard Zacks, a Ph.D. in
Mathematics from M.I.T. found that "earnings estimate revisions are the most
powerful force impacting stock prices." Zacks #1 Rank is awarded to a stock when
analysts sharply upgrade their estimates of what the company will earn. 

Today, Zacks is promoting its stock recommendations by offering four daily picks
free to those who register at http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Producer Price Increases Slow

On a year-over-year basis, intermediate goods are up 3.0% while crude goods are
up 12.3%. Crude goods are essentially commodities, and as such their prices tend
to be far more volatile than those of finished goods, so the more extreme
readings there are not a real surprise. Nor were there any big surprises
relative to consensus expectations, although the headline number was expected to
be 0.0%, so it was two ticks higher; the core number was expected to be up 0.1%
so it was a tick lower, and provided an offset. 

The big swing factor in the finished goods level was energy. Energy prices were
down 0.4% (seasonally adjusted) in December after surging 5.7% in November on
top of a 5.4% increase in October and are up 20.1% year over year. Food prices,
however, moved the other direction, rising 1.4% in December after a 0.5%
increase in November, but over the last year they are just up 1.1%. 

Finished consumer goods have, however, increased in price over the last year far
faster at 6.0% than capital goods, which are unchanged over the last year.
Mostly that is from the non-durable side, specifically energy, which is up
20.1%. Finished consumer goods excluding energy are up just 1.5% over the last
year. Prices for finished durable consumer goods have increased by just 0.3%. 

Energy prices had collapsed at the end of 2008, so we are looking at a very low
base. Of course, energy prices had also surged to very high levels early in
2008, which made for very easy year-over-year comparisons for most of 2009. The
rebound in energy prices should, of course, bode well for the earnings of the
big oil firms like Exxon (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). 

Overall, this report provides more evidence that inflation is not a serious
concern right now. Getting the economy moving and seeing some actual job
creation is a far higher priority right now. This means to comply with its dual
mandate of trying to achieve both price stability and full employment the Fed
will have to keep interest rates at extraordinarily low levels for an extended
period of time. 

Permits Rise, But Starts Fall

There is a huge "shadow inventory" of existing homes that are far behind on
their mortgage payments but have not been foreclosed upon yet. In part, the
trail modifications under the HAMP program have slowed down the foreclosure
process. However, the vast majority of trial modifications in the HAMP program
have not become permanent, and a very large percentage of the ones that do
become permanent will run into trouble again. 

In part, that is because the HAMP program -- not to mention other voluntary
efforts by the big banks like Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:
JPM) -- are mostly about lowering the monthly payments to more affordable
levels. Sometimes this just means extending the term of the mortgage, and
tacking the missed payments onto principal. Other times it means reducing the
interest rate. 

While these actions are helpful, if a homeowner is deeply underwater on their
home, it still makes economic sense for them to stop paying on their mortgage,
even if they are still employed and have the cash flow available to pay it. I
expect a second wave of foreclosures to hit later in 2010. Most of the time, a
used home is an excellent substitute for a new home. If there is going to be a
huge supply of existing homes coming on the market in the near future, perhaps
it is not a good thing to be putting lots of resources into creating more new
homes. 

CSX Earnings Down on Rev Miss

CSX Corporation`s (NYSE: CSX) fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations
of 77 cents per share were only a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
Earnings were down 16% from 92 cents last year. 

Results were dragged down by lower revenues due to volume declines in coal,
construction and consumer-related markets caused by the weak economy. Lower fuel
surcharge recovery caused by a decline in fuel costs also strained earnings. 

Revenue declined 13% year-over-year to $2.3 billion due to lower utility coal
shipments resulting from diminished demand caused by continuing weakness in
steel production, and lower global demand for exports. Coal is expected to
remain a headwind into 2010, due to low domestic and global demand, utility
stockpiles that are above target levels (and are at the highest level in a
decade) and natural gas substitution. 

Operating expense fell to $1.7 billion in the quarter, down 12% compared to last
year, due to the company`s ongoing cost-cutting efforts network modifications,
equipment storage, employee furloughs, reduced crew overtime, lower incentive
compensation and layoffs. The number of employees was 29,417, lower than 33,363
in the comparable period last year.

&lt;p&gt;A start-up teaming up with IBM to build "Microsoft-free" virtual desktops and deliver them through a cloud computing model has secured $4 million in first-round venture financing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAQ: Desktop virtualization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtual Bridges, founded in 2006, is part of IBM's attempt to undercut Microsoft's Windows 7 with a set of cloud- and Linux-based desktop packages.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtual Bridges this week announced it received funding from Austin Ventures, reportedly in the amount of $4 million. The money will help expand sales, marketing and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company just released the third version of its Verde (virtual enterprise remote desktop environment) software, which lets companies run both Windows and Linux desktop sessions. Although the software does work with Windows, Virtual Bridges is also part of IBM's Client for Smart Work initiative, which aims to provide a cheaper, Linux-based alternative to Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership combines Linux, Virtual Bridges' Verde software, plus IBM Lotus applications including Symphony, Sametime and Notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By making these desktops 'virtual', a user can access the same desktop environment whether they are at home, the office, the road or anywhere where there is a machine connected to the network," Virtual Bridges says on its Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The desktop virtualization market is expected to grow significantly this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see tremendous potential for disruption and value creation in the burgeoning desktop Cloud and VDI market space," Austin Ventures investor Chris Pacitti said in the funding announcement. "Virtual Bridges has demonstrated innovative leadership in delivering not only best-of-breed VDI but also in combining VDI with managed desktops and disconnected use."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jbrodkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

 (Recasts that average pay per employee is cut, adds

(GS.N), under fire for gold-plated pay packages, cut average
pay per employee by about a quarter from record 2007 levels,
helping boost its profit to a record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the forecast-beating results were quickly overshadowed
by anxiety about the impact of the Obama administration's
proposed crackdown on financial risktaking, and shares in Wall
Street's biggest proprietary trading institution slumped 5
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman Sachs is not a banking or financial story now,

at Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman had been on track to shatter its compensation
record from 2007, but instead decided to set aside nothing for
compensation in the fourth quarter and give $500 million to
charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move, which cut average compensation per employee to
$498,000, helped the Wall Street bank report a record profit
for 2009 and a better-than-expected fourth-quarter net income
of $4.95 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Average pay was still up from $317,000 last year, but down
from $661,490 in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move helped Goldman answer critics who have lambasted
the bank for setting aside so much for bonuses months after
U.S. taxpayers rescued the banking industry during the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman Sachs is not deaf to the calls for restraint," the
bank's chief financial officer, David Viniar, told reporters on
a conference call. The bank consulted U.S. pay czar Kenneth
Feinberg regarding its bonus policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Political scrutiny of Wall Street firms is intensifying.
President Barack Obama on Thursday proposed stricter limits on
financial risk-taking. This could wallop Goldman, which often
trades its own funds to help bolster the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FALLING SHARES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares rose in early trading but later fell after
Obama proposed steps including preventing major banks from
owning, sponsoring or investing in hedge funds for their own
profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman became a bank holding company in 2008 during the  
financial crisis as a signal of safety to investors, but also
opening itself up to more regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It looks like Goldman Sachs has been given a reason to
give back their bank charter," said Tom Sowanick, chief
investment officer of the Omnivest Group in Princeton, New
Jersey. "Moreover, it also looks as though banks may be going
down the path of being regulated like utilities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman denied it had any intention of giving back its bank
charter, but its shares fell as much as 6.6 percent and were
down 3.5 percent at $161.90 in late afternoon trade. Goldman
shares are down 18 percent from their highs in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's debt protection costs also jumped after Obama's
proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Responding to outrage over high pay, the bank set aside 36
percent of net revenue for compensation for 2009, Goldman's
lowest percentage as a public company. Compensation for the
year totaled $16.19 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A protest demonstration over Wall Street excess was planned
for Thursday in front of Goldman's headquarters in New York.
The investment bank, famously referred to as "a great vampire
squid wrapped around the face of humanity" in a scathing piece
in Rolling Stone last summer, is seen as a poster child for the
excesses of Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a graphic on Goldman's earnings, click on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; link.reuters.com/buz84h&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To read a Breakingviews commentary on Goldman, click on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [ID:nN21212456]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "NOT DEAF"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It will alleviate some political pressure," said Keith
Davis, a bank analyst at money manager Farr, Miller 
Washington in Washington, D.C. "They've been in everyone's
cross-hairs for how much money they make. I think they'll still
be there, but the fact that they took down the bonuses will
help incrementally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank recorded negative compensation expense in the
fourth quarter because of the contribution to Goldman Sachs
Gives, the firm's charitable arm. The contribution was part of
total commitments to charitable and small business initiatives
during 2009 in excess of $1 billion, the firm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The compensation total was far below the record $20.2
billion the firm paid in 2007, and well below what the firm was
expected to pay this year as it reported blockbuster profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's British staff is likely to bear the brunt of the
bonus cut as the firm curbed payouts in light of Britain's
supertax on bonuses, an industry source said. [ID:nLDE60K1XT]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm last month moved to deflect criticism on pay by
announcing its top 30 managers would receive their bonuses
entirely in long-term stock. The banking industry has moved to
pay in equity in an effort to tie compensation to long-term
performance and curb risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which has also changed its pay
structures, on Wednesday reported an annual loss for 2009 but
still paid out more than $14 billion as it ratcheted up its
compensation ratio to 62 percent from 51 percent in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The House of Representatives Financial Services Committee,
led by Rep. Barney Frank, will hold a hearing on Friday to
discuss compensation for top executives in the finance sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, a commission investigating the financial crisis
called Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein to testify on Capitol Hill,
quizzing him on the firm's role in the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even after Goldman curbed its pay, it faced a fresh lawsuit
from the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority
alleging excessive compensation. [ID:nN21211638]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OVERSHADOWED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's fourth-quarter profit amounted to $8.20 a share,
topping analysts' average forecast by $3. In the year-earlier
fourth quarter it posted a loss of $2.12 billion, or $4.97 a
share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fourth-quarter compensation actions boosted profit
dramatically. If the company had set aside $3.3 billion in the
quarter for pay, which would have brought total compensation
expense to about $20 billion for the year, Goldman would have
earned less than $4.00 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But low compensation expense may be difficult to repeat in
the future, raising questions about how strong Goldman's
performance really was in the fourth quarter, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's trading momentum fell off in the quarter.
Goldman reported trading and principal investments revenue of
$5.1 billion, down 43 percent from the third quarter. Rivals
reported similar declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment banking was strong as Goldman reported revenue
of $1.6 billion, up 58 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman reported revenues of $9.62 billion, which were in
line with analyst expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also drew down risk in the fourth quarter as its
average Daily Value at Risk (VaR) declined to $181 million from
$197 million a year earlier and $208 million in the third
quarter. VaR, one measure of risk, stands for the maximum that
could potentially be lost trading on a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm paid $6.44 billion in corporate taxes, resulting
in a tax rate of 32.5 percent for 2009. That is up from less
than 1 percent in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After Obama's announcement, credit default swaps insuring
Goldman's debt jumped by around 25 basis points to 120 basis
points, or $120,000 per year for five years to insure $10
million in debt, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yield spreads on Goldman's 7.5 percent notes due in 2019
widened by 12 basis points to 150 basis points over Treasuries,
according to MarketAxess.

&lt;p&gt;A federal judge has killed class-action allegations in a lawsuit that accused Microsoft of misleading consumers when it fed them anti-piracy software under the auspices of a critical security update, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move means that Microsoft will not be faced with millions in potential damages. Last fall, Microsoft's lawyers argued that a class-action lawsuit could involve "tens of millions" of customers who might be owed "hundreds of millions of dollars" if the company lost the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class-action would have let virtually anyone who owned a Windows XP PC in mid-2006 to join the case without having to hire an attorney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an order filed on Jan. 15, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Jones denied several motions by the plaintiffs, including one that would have let them modify their complaint a third time, which in turn put an official end to their attempts to turn the case into a class-action lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three-and-a-half-year-old lawsuit claims Microsoft duped customers by labeling its Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) software a critical security update, failed to tell them that WGA collected information from their PCs, then frequently "phoned home" that data to Microsoft's servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2006, Microsoft began pushing WGA to Windows XP users via Windows Update, the company's default update service, as a "high priority" update that was automatically downloaded and installed to most machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that, Microsoft acknowledged that WGA transmitted information whenever a user logged on to Windows XP. Under pressure from critics , it later reduced the frequency of the anti-piracy checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft relies on WGA, and its successor, Windows Activation Technologies (WAT), to detect bootlegged copies of Windows. If the software sniffs out a counterfeit, it posts nagging messages on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had opposed the class-action certification last September, at the time calling the lawsuit "fictional," "demonstrably false" and from an "alternate universe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the plaintiffs withdrew most, but not all, of their class action allegations, but said they were reserving the right to revisit one of those claims, breach of contract, because an earlier court decision related to that charge is currently on appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his order of last week, Jones said that all class allegations had to be withdrawn because they "need not be included for appellate purposes and would create unnecessary confusion if they were included."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones also said that Microsoft could demand compensation for the money it spent contesting the class-action charges, even though the plaintiffs withdrew most of those allegations prior to trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While Plaintiffs maintain a 'no harm, no foul' perspective, it is too late for that argument," Jones said. "If Plaintiffs had withdrawn their class-certification motion before Microsoft had prepared its Opposition, that would be a 'no harm, no foul' situation. But here, the 'harm' was irreversibly inflicted when Plaintiffs' motion required Microsoft to prepare a defense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has until Feb. 12 to submit its expense list to the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones also rejected the plaintiffs' motion to add a misrepresentation charge to the lawsuit, and said that they could not change the complaint to seek additional forms of relief from injunction. Earlier this month, Microsoft had called those moves "a cynical attempt to game the system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was once scheduled to go to trial on Jan. 25, but Jones asked counsel for both parties to suggest a new calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's anti-piracy software has often made news. In August 2007, a day-long server outage riled thousands of users who were mistakenly fingered for running counterfeit copies of Windows. More recently, hackers revealed ways to bypass Windows 7's activation process .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp.'s top legal official yesterday called on Congress to create new laws that would give data stored in the cloud the same protections as data stored on a PC. He also called for tougher penalties for hackers who access data centers, citing significant damage that's often done in such attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Smith, senior vice president and general counsel at Microsoft, told an audience at a Brookings Institution forum here today that laws now protecting electronic data were written in the early days of PCs. "We need Congress to modernize the laws and adapt them to the cloud," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many consumers have adopted cloud computing by subscribing to e-mail services like Google Gmail, to social networks like Facebook and to Microsoft's increasing online services offerings, enterprises have been somewhat cautious about moving corporate data to hosted systems due to legal and security concerns both here and abroad. Those fears have been causing problem for IT vendors, forcing some to provide significant protections to large users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of City of Los Angeles' move to implement Google Apps is one example of how cloud providers must tweak contracts to win business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city's $7.2 million agreement with Google to move 30,000 employees to Google Apps included an unlimited damages provision that makes the Google legally responsible for the release of data in violation of a non-disclosure agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the contract signed last October obligates Google to keep the city's data physically located in the United States. The contract allows the city to audit the data to ensure compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith outlined a number of changes to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act that he says are needed to clearly extend privacy rights to data stored in the cloud and to boost penalties for hacking data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Providers of cloud computing products, meanwhile, are also hoping for an international accord that would ensure similar rules to data regardless of whether it is stored on servers in India, France or Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are we going to end up with a Tower of Babel version of the cloud where there are different rules in different countries?" said Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies, the Brookings Institution, who led a panel discussion on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need a free trade agreement for data and information,' said Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Nelson, a visiting professor at Georgetown University, offered a stark warning about the future if Congress fails to act. "We are going to see the cloud as something that is controlled by two or three companies," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He called for creating a cloud environment built on open source technology and open standards so users can take something from one cloud and combine it with another. "We don't want to be locked into one company's solution," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users of cloud services will need to know what is happening to their data, Nelson added. Cloud providers will not only have to ensure data is safe, but "we are going to have to show them why it is safe," he said, and that will mean having technology that can show customers when their data is accessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Rochelle, a group product manager at Google, said there is nothing special about the privacy and security risks in the cloud, but those risk are "more transparent, more collective and more open. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can keep their data on their PCs, but "while it feels more comfortable, the same way the money under your mattress feels more comfortable, it may not be the best way to manage your information,' said Rochelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick Thibodeau covers SaaS and enterprise applications, outsourcing, government IT policies, data centers and IT workforce issues for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will release its emergency patch for Internet Explorer (IE) on Thursday, the company said today as it also admitted that attacks can be hidden inside rigged Office documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are planning to release the update as close to 10:00 a.m. PST as possible," Jerry Bryant, a program manager with the IE group, said in an entry on the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Microsoft confirmed speculation that it would issue an "out-of-band" update for the IE vulnerability, but postponed specifying a ship date until today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also updated the security advisory it originally published last week when it acknowledged a zero-day IE vulnerability had been used by hackers to break into the corporate networks of Google and other major Western companies. Google has alleged that the attacks were launched by Chinese attackers. Subsequently, security experts have offered evidence that links the attacks to China .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revised advisory also addressed claims made by researchers that it's possible to exploit the newer IE7 and IE8 browsers, and even circumvent Microsoft's recommended defensive measure, DEP (data execution prevention). However, the advisory waffled on whether DEP bypass was effective, neither confirming or denying the researchers' allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a report of a new Data Execution Prevention (DEP) exploit," Microsoft said in the advisory. "We have analyzed the proof-of-concept exploit code and have found that Windows Vista and later versions of Windows offer more effective protections in blocking the exploit due to Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even a follow-up post by Jonathan Ness, an MSRC engineer, on the company's Security Research  Defense blog declined to spell out whether the DEP bypass attacks were effective. Ness, however, did reiterate Microsoft's point that the only in-the-wild attacks seen thus far have been aimed at IE6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also touted the additional security that ASLR and IE's Protected Mode provide, and published a table that spelled out the current attack and threat situation for IE and Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also admitted that the vulnerability could be exploited through malicious Office documents, a vector that had not been disclosed previously. "We are also aware that the vulnerability can be exploited by including an ActiveX control in a Microsoft Access, Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file," said Bryant. "To prevent exploitation, we recommend that customers disable ActiveX Controls in Microsoft Office."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow's update for IE will patch all attack avenues, Bryant added, including the Office document vector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IE vulnerability has gained considerable attention because it has been connected to the attacks that broke into Google's corporate network. McAfee was the first to reveal that the attacks against Google had been conducted using exploits of the IE vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, hackers have exploited the bug via drive-by attacks from malicious sites, and researchers have crafted new attack code that works on IE7 and IE8 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time Microsoft shipped an emergency security update was July 2009, when it patched IE just hours before several researchers demonstrated a critical vulnerability at a security conference. In October 2008, Microsoft rushed out a patch for Windows; that vulnerability was later exploited by the notorious Conficker worm .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft late yesterday issued its second advisory of the last week, warning users that a 17-year-old bug in the kernel of all 32-bit versions of Windows could be used by hackers to hijack PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability in the Windows Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) subsystem was disclosed Tuesday by Google engineer Tavis Ormandy on the Full Disclosure security mailing list. Coincidentally, Ormandy received credit for reporting the single vulnerability that Microsoft fixed last week on its regular Patch Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VDM subsystem was added to Windows with the July 1993 release of Windows NT, Microsoft's first fully 32-bit operating system. VDM allows Windows NT and later to run DOS and 16-bit Windows software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday's advisory spelled out the affected software -- all 32-bit editions of Windows, including Windows 7 -- and told users how to disable VDM as a workaround. Windows' 64-bit versions are not vulnerable to attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Microsoft's second advisory in seven days; last week, the company posted a warning of a critical flaw in Internet Explorer after Google said its corporate computers had been hacked by Chinese attackers. That bug is to be patched later today .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode," said the newest advisory. "An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jerry Bryant, a program manager with the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), said that the company had not seen any actual attacks using the vulnerability, and also downplayed the threat if hackers do exploit the flaw. "To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must already have valid logon credentials and be able to log on to a system locally, meaning they must already have an account on the system," Bryant said in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, Microsoft ranks this kind of vulnerability -- which it classified as an elevation of privilege flaw -- as "important," the second-highest of the four ratings in its four-step system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ormandy said that the vulnerability goes back nearly 17 years to Windows NT 3.1's release, and exists in every version of Windows since. He reported the bug to Microsoft more than seven months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Regrettably, no official patch is currently available," Ormandy wrote on Full Disclosure Tuesday. "As an effective and easy-to-deploy workaround is available, I have concluded that it is in the best interest of users to go ahead with the publication of this document without an official patch." The workaround Ormandy included in his message was the same as Microsoft's: Edit group policies to block 16-bit applications from running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Ormandy divulged information about the vulnerability, even posted attack code that works on Windows XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008 and Windows 7, Microsoft didn't take him to task in the advisory for prematurely revealing the bug, as it almost always does researchers who spill the beans before a patch is ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presumably, Microsoft will issue a fix for the flaw at some point, but as is its practice in security advisories, it didn't promise to do so. The next regularly-scheduled security update is slated for Feb. 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Jan 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on
Thursday released a patch to protect users of its Internet
Explorer browser from attacks similar to those directed at
Google Inc's (GOOG.O) operations in China last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company, which acknowledged
that a weakness in its browser was exploited by hackers
targeting Google and at least 20 other companies in China, said
its new patch was "critical" and should be applied as soon as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The patch resolves eight vulnerabilities in Internet
Explorer, the most serious of which could allow hackers to gain
control of a computer remotely via Web sites visited while
using the browser, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most Internet Explorer customers, who have automatic
updating enabled on their system, will not need to take any
action, Microsoft said. For manual updating, it directed users
to its website

&lt;p&gt;SANAA (Reuters) - Yemen will stop issuing tourist visas on arrival to foreigners in an effort to prevent militants entering the country as it steps up its war on al Qaeda, a government official and state media said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move will mostly affect visitors from Western countries, including the United States, where a recent report said some U.S. citizens suspected of training in al Qaeda camps in Yemen may pose a serious threat to their home country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the framework of efforts by our country to fight terrorism and strengthen security measures to prevent the infiltration of terrorist elements into the country, the granting of visas at airports to foreigners will be canceled," the Yemeni Defense Ministry's September 26 newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanaa declared war on al Qaeda last week as pressure grew for a crackdown on the global militant group after its Yemen-based wing said it was behind a December 25 attempt to bomb a U.S.-bound passenger plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yemen also is battling a Shi'ite revolt in the north and separatism in the south. Western countries and neighboring oil giant Saudi Arabia fear al Qaeda could exploit the chaos in Yemen to turn it into a launch pad for further attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yemen gained a reputation as an al Qaeda haven after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, and came under a renewed spotlight after crackdowns on the group in Pakistan and Afghanistan raised fears Yemen was becoming a training and recruiting center for militants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security concerns have also prompted Britain to suspend direct flights from Yemen in a wave of measures to tighten border security, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Wednesday, warning that militant cells were actively planning attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chairman of Yemenia airline said the national carrier would resume flights to London soon, after British officials inspected the Sanaa airport over the past two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were very happy, there were some small remarks, that will be fixed ... we will resume flights to the UK very soon," Abdulkhaled Al-Kadi told Reuters at an air show in Bahrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a spokesman for British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: "That's news to me."

&lt;p&gt; * Yemen stops issuing tourist visas on arrival to foreigners * Rule will not apply to Arab states with bilateral deals * Yemenia to resume London flights soon, chairman says    (Adds airline official, British spokesman comment) By Mohamed Sudam and Mohammed Ghobari SANAA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Yemen will stop issuing tourist visas on arrival to foreigners in an effort to prevent militants entering the country as it steps up its war on al Qaeda, a government official and state media said on Thursday. The move will mostly affect visitors from Western countries, including the United States, where a recent report said some U.S. citizens suspected of training in al Qaeda camps in Yemen may pose a serious threat to their home country. In the framework of efforts by our country to fight terrorism and strengthen security measures to prevent the infiltration of terrorist elements into the country, the granting of visas at airports to foreigners will be cancelled, the Yemeni Defence Ministry's September 26 newspaper said. Sanaa declared war on al Qaeda last week as pressure grew for a crackdown on the global militant group after its Yemen-based wing said it was behind a Dec. 25 attempt to bomb a U.S.-bound passenger plane. Yemen also is battling a Shi'ite revolt in the north and separatism in the south. Western countries and neighbouring oil giant Saudi Arabia fear al Qaeda could exploit the chaos in Yemen to turn it into a launch pad for further attacks. Yemen gained a reputation as an al Qaeda haven after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, and came under a renewed spotlight after crackdowns on the group in Pakistan and Afghanistan raised fears Yemen was becoming a training and recruiting centre for militants. Security concerns have also prompted Britain to suspend direct flights from Yemen in a wave of measures to tighten border security, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Wednesday, warning that militant cells were actively planning attacks. The chairman of Yemenia airline said the national carrier would resume flights to London soon, after British officials inspected the Sanaa airport over the past two days. They were very happy, there were some small remarks, that will be fixed ... we will resume flights to the UK very soon, Abdulkhaled Al-Kadi told Reuters at an air show in Bahrain. But a spokesman for British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: That's news to me. Brown said on Tuesday he hoped flights could resume soon, but the security of our citizens must be our priority, he said.  RULES MOSTLY AFFECT WESTERN AND ASIAN VISITORS Sanaa's move to stop granting visas on arrival will affect tourists previously able to obtain entry at the airport, including those from Canada, Europe, Australia and Japan, the government official said. The granting of visas to foreigners will only happen via Yemeni embassies abroad, and after turning to the responsible security apparatus to investigate the identities of travellers to bar the infiltration of suspected terrorist elements, September 26 quoted a security source as saying. Visitors to Yemen from Arab states with bilateral agreements on entry such as Egypt, Syria, Sudan and Jordan, will not be affected by the new rules, said the official, who asked not to be identified. But citizens of those states who travel to Yemen from a third country are required to get visas in advance, he added. Two groups of Americans based in Yemen are causing concern for U.S. counter-terrorism experts in the Gulf region, according to a report by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff. The report was prepared for release at a hearing on Wednesday. Most worrisome is a group of up to 36 former U.S. convicts who converted to Islam in prison and arrived in Yemen in the past year, ostensibly to study Arabic, the report said.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Jan 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
EuroGas, Inc. (PINKSHEETS: EUGS) (FRANKFURT: EUG) (XETRA: EUG) (HAMB:
EUG) (STUT: EUG) today announced that Walter Storm has exercised his
contractual right to subscribe to a $ 7,000,000 convertible debenture
that was previously announced on October 16, 2009. In so doing, Mr. Storm
has given EuroGas notice that he will take over the interest previously
held by Forstgarten International GmbH (Forstgarten) which was
participating in the financing with Mr. Storm under the previously
announced agreement. EuroGas has already received funds sent by Mr. Storm
for the first tranche of the convertible debenture financing.

    Mr. Storm increased his participation in the financing when EuroGas and
Forstgarten agreed to terminate their agreement. The terms of the
agreement with Mr. Storm will remain unchanged from those previously
announced. Mr. Storm will have the right to convert his debenture into
restricted EuroGas common shares at $ 0.25 per share during the first
year, $ 0.35 per share during the second year and $ 0.50 per share during
the third year.

    "EuroGas is pleased by the vote of confidence that Walter Storm has given
us by increasing his participation to 100% of the convertible debenture
private placement," said Wolfgang Rauball, CEO, EuroGas. "Walter has been
a long time shareholder of the company and has been steadfast in his
support of the company. More than simply a financier, Walter's breadth of
knowledge of international oil and gas exploration will be another
resource on which EuroGas will rely to build shareholder value. We are
fortunate to have Walter as a partner."

    Mr. Walter Storm is a highly successful industrialist with international
resource and industrial holdings. He is also the founder and a major
indirect shareholder of EurAsia, which is the largest shareholder of
Osisko Mining Corp., a TSE-listed company with a current market valuation

Switzerland EurAsia owns 42 million shares of Osisko's common stock which
are currently valued at in excess of USD 330,000,000. Mr. Storm, through
EurAsia, was Osisko's major financial backer through its exploration and
development stages. The capital provided to Osisko by EurAsia enabled
Osisko's management team to build its market capitalization from USD 15
million to its current level of more than USD 2 billion in less than five
years. EurAsia's shareholder also own significant producing oil and gas
interests in Canada and Kazakhstan, as well as important global resource
sector related companies and assets. (http://eurasiaholding.com)

&lt;p&gt;WILMINGTON, Del. Jan 21 (Reuters) - A shareholder sued
Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) board for excessive bonuses
and wants bank executives to pay the $500 million in charitable
donations that Goldman is making after being criticized for its
compensation policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs bonuses substantially exceed what competitors
pay "even though, on a risk-adjusted basis, Goldman's officers
and managers have performed over the past several years in a
manner that is, at best, only average," the lawsuit says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority
(SEPTA), which runs public transit in the Philadelphia area,
filed the lawsuit on Wednesday in Delaware's Chancery Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEPTA said Goldman has been allocating nearly half of its
revenues to staff bonuses even though the company's performance
has been less a benefit of management skill than risks it has
taken with investors capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman's employees are unreasonably overpaid for the
management functions that they undertake, and shareholders are
vastly underpaid for the risks taken with their equity," it
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit is entirely without merit, a Goldman spokesman
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs released its earnings report on Thursday and
dramatically changed course on pay by setting aside nothing for
compensation in the fourth quarter. That helped the company
report better earnings than analysts had forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it would give $500 million to charity, in
part to improve its public image. The SEPTA suit demanded that
Goldman's board make company management pay any charitable
contributions that are intended to apologize for its
compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Large bonuses and the government's $700 billion bailout of
banks have outraged many Americans who are struggling with
double-digit unemployment. Several groups planned to protest
against Wall Street excess outside Goldman Sachs offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Members of Congress have proposed taxing bonuses paid by
banks that received government bailout money, which includes
Goldman Sachs. SEPTA's suit demanded such a tax be paid by
Goldman Sachs managers, not shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority derivatively on behalf of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc
v Lloyd C. Blankfein et al, Court of Chancery, State of
Delaware, No. 5216.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs will curb payouts to UK staff in particular because of Britain's supertax on bonuses, an industry source said, as the U.S. investment bank dramatically reversed its course on remuneration on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bank set aside nothing for compensation in the fourth quarter, limiting its 2009 compensation pool to $16.2 billion -- well below expectations of a record $22 billion -- and helping push net income above forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source said Goldman's 5,500 UK staff would see pay restrained in the wake of Britain's 50 percent tax on bonuses over 25,000 pounds ($40,810) announced six weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment on specific payouts. Staff will be told share awards next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said the bank took the UK bonus tax into account when it made its compensation decision. The bank had attempted to be fair to both staff and investors and show restraint with its compensation, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news is further evidence that banks are reducing payouts amid a public backlash and a vow by politicians to stop bankers earning millions just months after being rescued by state bailouts. Goldman has borne the brunt of much anger, and its move could influence rivals as many European banks finalize their own pay plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly what your competitors are doing is of great relevance to any bank," said Nicholas Stretch of law firm CMS Cameron McKenna. "At the shareholder level, I expect they will be pleased."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK staff could be particularly hit as banks assess the tax implications. Swiss bank Credit Suisse said this week it would cut its global bonus pool by 5 percent and slash payouts to its top 400 managers in Britain by about a third to compensate for the levy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK tax will affect thousands of top bankers working in London. Most banks had been expected to swallow the cost of the tax themselves rather than risk paying staff less and risk becoming less competitive employers. But bankers now look more likely to have to share the hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the mood is more to passing on some of the hit to employees, whereas if we had had this discussion before Christmas, I would have said the mood was to ensure those earning very high bonuses would see an immaterial change to their bonuses," noted Jon Terry, partner and head of reward at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's Barclays Plc will kick off the UK bank reporting season on February 16. Chairman Marcus Agius said earlier on Thursday he expected this pay round to be "very different" from past years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.6126 Pound)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Kirstin Ridley; Editing by Hans Peters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Thursday posted a stronger than forecast fourth quarter profit while capping off its 2009 compensation pool at $16.19 billion in 2009, below record levels set in 2007 and shy of what many expected it to set aside for pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earnings were reported ahead of an expected proposal from President Barack Obama to clamp down on financial risk taking by Wall Street banks that could affect Goldman and its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bank reported a quarterly net income to the company of $4.95 billion, or $8.20 a share for shareholders, compared to a loss of $2.12 billion, or $4.97 a share in the year earlier quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average expected a profit of $5.20 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, although it was not immediately clear whether the EPS number was comparable to the estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares were up less than one percent in premarket trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVID DIETZE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, POINT VIEW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINANCIAL SERVICES, SUMMIT, NEW JERSEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman was a blowout. I think the most telling metric I saw was the change in revenues. They had $9.6 billion in the fourth quarter and that was up dramatically. It shows what a steep yield curve and return of confidence can do for the premier trading firm on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was also a decrease in percentage of revenue it paid to employees. For the entire year they are paying out just under 36 percent. Historically these banks have paid out 50 to 60 percent. I think it's fear of populist backlash. The firm has done everything possible to limit that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Think about Lehman, think about Bear . . . The bottom line is they don't need to pay the people quite as much as they used to because the competition for that talent is limited."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Obama's proposal to limit risk-taking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a grand slam in terms of profiting from their risk-taking expertise but investors are wondering how much they can continue to profit in light of the all out attack from Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one thing that Wall Street hates is uncertainty. It's nothing if not uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that there is tremendous popular majority sentiment to restrict the banks and reign them in. This is the final button that Washington has left to push and I think they're going to push it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MALCOLM POLLEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, STEWART CAPITAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADVISORS, INDIANA, PENNSYLVANIA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like the earnings were strong pretty much across the board, so it wasn't just trading that provided their numbers, which is a real positive. What we've seen from other banks that have reported in the last couple of days is that they had pretty big numbers last year because of trading revenues. Those trading revenues largely dried up and when they're forced to rely on their core franchise, the earnings just aren't there yet. It just shows you the power of Goldman's franchise right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Obama's risk regulation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first question is how are you going to limit risk taking? Are you going to limit it based on capital? Well that's fine. Goldman has plenty of capital. I think if by limiting risk taking he means that he's actually going to allow companies that take bad risks and get hurt from it to go away, then that's a good thing. Will that hurt Goldman? Probably not. I would say it actually probably helps them because you get rid of the walking wounded. Goldman from a trading perspective as JP Morgan from a banking perspective is the class act in the business. That's not to say they might not have their day in the toilet but that's not now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to limit risk taking then you allow people to take the responsibilities of the risks that they take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way you get a higher return is to take more risk but you have to be willing to accept the risks if you want the higher return."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MATT MCCORMICK, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT BAHL  GAYNOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INVESTMENT COUNSEL IN CINCINNATI:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The low compensation ratio is in response to political pressure. Goldman Sachs is not a banking or financial story now, it's a political story. Obama wants to make financial companies utilities, and they're trying to install Glass Steagall-lite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It makes sense -- if you're going to take on outsized risk, you should be able to fail on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is all happening now because of Brown. They could have done this a week or a month or a year ago, but clearly Obama has turned the page, and people like Goldman are squarely in his scope."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The devil is in the details-I'm not opposed to Glass-Steagall lite, but I don't want them to get too deeply involved in making trading decisions for these banks. We saw what happened when Barney Frank and Chris Dodd told Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac how to lend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST AT AVALON PARTNERS,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From market reaction, the numbers are being well-received by the market. Obviously Goldman Sachs is a big deal for the financial sector and the whole market, but we will have to see what President Obama has to say on his regulations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEITH DAVIS, BANK ANALYST AT MONEY MANAGER FARR, MILLER &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON IN WASHINGTON, DC.:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results look great. Revenues are in line, and that could have been a surprise to some given the weakness in fixed income trading that everyone else has been reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big issue is that the compensation ratio came down so significantly, which I think is a good thing. I don't know whether they switched to restricted stock or what, but it didn't run through the income statement so they posted a blowout number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will alleviate some political pressure. They've been in everyone's cross-hairs for how much money they make. I think they'll still be there, but the fact that they took down the bonuses will help incrementally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It sounds more to me like they're (the Obama administration) trying to separate the commercial banking activities from the trading desks. They want to make sure there's not FDIC-insured deposits subsidizing trading activities. If that's the case, Goldman really doesn't have much in the way of deposits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm sure in some way it will affect them (Goldman) -- since they're talking about trying to shrink the overall size of the biggest banks. I could see how this would affect Bank of America, JPMorgan, Citi, and perhaps a couple others, but I'm not exactly sure how they would go about shrinking Goldman when they don't really have a huge deposit base."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TODD LEONE, HEAD OF LISTED TRADING, COWEN  CO. IN NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman's earnings were ridiculous. But they brought their comp ratio way down, earnings were higher and comp ratios were down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman makes all their money off prop trading. But they did bring their comp ratio down, which is very interesting -- It's the lowest it's been, I think ever. That will help alleviate some of the pain. Financials have been driving the market the market the last few months. We'll see how Goldman pans out today. Typically they move down after the earnings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WALTER TODD, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GREENWOOD CAPITAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASSOCIATES, GREENWOOD, SOUTH CAROLINA:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman Sachs continues to print money. Revenue was in line with expectations, but earnings were a blow-out. Part of that has to do with the negative compensation expense during the quarter. Goldman more than most is under the microscope in terms of compensation. Their comp ratio was very low. They're playing the game as they see fit, and lower pay means more money drops to the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama's proposals might impact Goldman, which is a bank after all. They may want to stop being a bank now. It's politically expedient to vilify these institutions, but that doesn't mean it's the right thing to do. They're trying to win back political points after losing the Massachusetts election. Obama comes out with something different every day for financial reform. It creates a very uncertain environment for these companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Wilchins, Clare Baldwin, Angela Moon, Chuck Mikolajczak and Jonathan Spicer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
HARRISBURG, Pa. and ARMONK, N.Y., Jan. 21, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Worldwide
industrial services company Harsco Corporation (NYSE:HSC) has selected IBM
(NYSE:IBM) as its consulting partner for a business transformation initiative
designed to create significant operating and cost efficiencies throughout
Harsco's global supply chain, the companies announced today.

The intelligent supply chain of the future aligns perfectly with our One
Harsco objectives for creating long-term strategic advantage as a more globally
integrated and optimized enterprise, said Harsco Chairman and CEO
Salvatore D. Fazzolari. Working with IBM gives us access to one of the
premier leaders in this field. Moreover, when completed at the end of 2010, we
expect this project to improve our Return on Invested Capital and also
contribute to Harsco's Economic Value Added (EVA(R)) growth.

IBM will perform an analysis to determine where improvements in Harsco's supply
chain can be made. IBM will then develop the roadmap for a fully integrated
supply chain that encompasses sourcing, procurement, logistics, planning (demand
and supply), inventory and order management, and cash management. Work is
scheduled to begin this month with IBM teams in place at Harsco's headquarters.

The project is expected to generate significant improvements in internal supply
chain planning, logistics, scheduling and integration throughout Harsco's
worldwide operations. It will better connect the company with its suppliers,
partners and customers for faster execution.

IBM will also work with Harsco to help improve efficiencies and economies in
Harsco's worldwide selling, general and administrative (SG) cost structure.

The supply chain is at the heart of Harsco Corporation's global,
diversified businesses, said Michael Laroche, global supply chain strategy
leader, IBM. By creating an intelligent business ecosystem that supports
the company's growth objectives while reducing bottlenecks and lead times,
Harsco will increase its flexibility and responsiveness in the global
marketplace.

Harsco Corporation is one of the world's leading diversified industrial services
companies, serving key industries that play a fundamental role in worldwide
economic growth, including infrastructure, metals, railways and energy. The
company's common stock is a component of the S MidCap 400 Index and the

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Addressing the increasing threat to online privacy from search, social media and
cloud computing, TransMedia today changed Glide`s default search engine at
http://www.GlideLife.com from Google to Microsoft Bing and introduced the Glide
OS Privacy Protection Bill of Rights. 

"In recognition of Microsoft`s decision to adhere to privacy standards
established by data protection officers of the European Union (the Article 29
committee) and place the privacy of consumers as a priority, TransMedia has
determined to change the default search engine in Glide from Google to
Microsoft`s Bing," said TransMedia Chairman and CEO, Donald Leka. "We hope that
the other leading search engines will follow Microsoft`s lead." 

TransMedia also announced the adoption of a User Privacy Protection Bill of
Rights for the users of the Glide OS. The Glide OS Privacy Protection Bill of
Rights is set forth below.

on Thursday ahead of quarterly results from Goldman Sachs Group

data on the labor market and a leading economic index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs is set to report earnings at about 8 a.m.
[1300 GMT], with analysts in a Reuters survey forecasting the
company to earn $5.20 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Economic data expected Thursday includes U.S. weekly

along with the earnings, but if we see the dollar beginning to
stabilize, you'll see the resumption of the upward market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China easily beat its 2009 growth target after a blistering

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said it will issue a patch to fix the old version of its Internet Explorer browser that allowed recent attacks on Google Inc's network in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch, due out on Thursday, "addresses the vulnerability related to recent attacks against Google and a small subset of corporations," said Jerry Bryant, senior security program manager at Microsoft. "Once applied, customers are protected against the known attacks that have been widely publicized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said last week it had been the target of sophisticated cyber-attacks in China, along with more than 20 other companies.

"I have one of the most loyal and active followings on Twitter and I`m hoping
through the Best Western `Official Tweet Crew Team` promotion I`ll be able to
find three likeminded fans who want to help me share the ins-and-outs of a race
team with millions of people all over the world," said two-time Daytona 500

SP 500 SPc1 down 0.04 percent, the Dow Jones industrial
average 0.1 percent lower and the Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures down
0.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

fourth-quarter numbers from Goldman Sachs (GS.N), with analysts

shares in Frankfurt (GS.F) advanced 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * After the market close, investors will eye Google's
(GOOG.O) fourth-quarter earnings, with analysts in a Reuters

The company late on Wednesday forecast 2010 results would be
above expectations after posting double-digit revenue growth in

high on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * European shares were flat in early trade on Thursday, with
weakness in banks and miners just offsetting gains in defensive
drugmakers, as investors stayed cautious ahead of further
corporate earnings from the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * The Dow suffered its worst drop of 2010 on Wednesday as
U.S. stocks succumbed to fears that China's curbs on bank
lending might jeopardize the global economic recovery, while
IBM's outlook sparked caution about the technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI tumbled 1.1 percent,

&lt;p&gt;Le projet am&#233;liorera la situation des agriculteurs en Ouganda et au Kenya vu
qu`ils vendent leurs fruits pour la production locale des jus Coca-Cola
KAMPALA, Ouganda--(Business Wire)--
La Coca-Cola Company, TechnoServe, l`organisation &#224; but non lucratif, et la
Fondation Bill &amp; Melinda Gates ont annonc&#233; aujourd`hui la signature d`un accord
de partenariat visant &#224; permettre &#224; plus de 50,000 petits cultivateurs de fruits
en Ouganda et au Kenya d`augmenter leur productivit&#233; et doubler leurs revenus
d`ici l`an 2014. 

Ce partenariat de quatre ans et de USD 11.5 millions permettra aux cultivateurs
de la mangue et des fruits de la passion de faire partie de la cha&#238;ne
d`approvisionnement de la soci&#233;t&#233; pour la premi&#232;re fois. Avec un don de USD 7.5
millions fournis par la Fondation Gates &#224; TechnoServe, USD 3 millions fournis
par la Coca-Cola Company et USD 1 million fournis par la SABCO, l`entreprise
d`embouteillage de boissons pour Coca-Cola, le projet vise &#224; cr&#233;er de nouvelles
opportunit&#233;s de march&#233; aux agriculteurs locaux qui cultivent des fruits utilis&#233;s
pour la production locale et la vente des jus de fruits Coca-Cola. En tant que
partenaire charg&#233; de la mise en &#339;uvre de l`accord, TechnoServe assurera aux
agriculteurs participants la formation n&#233;cessaire pour l`am&#233;lioration de la
qualit&#233;, l`augmentation de la production et l`organisation en groupes
d`agriculteurs. Elle facilitera &#233;galement l`acc&#232;s aux cr&#233;dits. 

"Ce partenariat est un exemple parfait de durabilit&#233;. En s`associant avec des
dizaines de milliers d`agriculteurs locaux, nous aidons ces derniers &#224; augmenter
leurs revenus tout en r&#233;pondant &#224; nos besoins en fruits locaux, faisant ainsi
b&#233;n&#233;ficier la communaut&#233; et nos affaires," a affirm&#233; Nathan Kalumbu, Directeur
du d&#233;partement de Coca-Cola pour l`Afrique Orientale et Centrale. 

Comme la demande locale des jus de fruits cro&#238;t, le besoin d`en augmenter la
production s`av&#232;re &#234;tre pressant. Les petits agriculteurs pourraient b&#233;n&#233;ficier
de cette demande croissante en fournissant plus de fruits, de mani&#232;re &#224; r&#233;ponde
aux besoins des acheteurs locaux tels que Coca-Cola. Gr&#226;ce &#224; ce partenariat, les
agriculteurs qui &#233;taient au pr&#233;alable incapables d`acc&#233;der &#224; cette opportunit&#233;
du march&#233; seront dot&#233;s des outils n&#233;cessaires pour ce faire. Ce partenariat
servira &#233;galement de mod&#232;le &#224; Coca-Cola puisqu`il accro&#238;t la vente des jus de
cette soci&#233;t&#233; dans d`autres march&#233;s et qu`il a &#233;t&#233; con&#231;u pour en en faire
facilement plusieurs r&#233;pliques. 

"Ce partenariat est un type d`approche innovante n&#233;cessaire pour promouvoir
l`&#233;mancipation &#233;conomique &#224; travers le globe et nous sommes fiers d`en faire
part en Afrique de l`Est," a d&#233;clar&#233; Muhtar Kent, Pr&#233;sident et PDG de la
Coca-Cola Company. "Nos partenaires, la Fondation Gates et TechnoServe, et nous
croyons que l`investissement dans l`agriculture est une strat&#233;gie prouv&#233;e pour
r&#233;duire la pauvret&#233; et &#233;tablir des communaut&#233;s durables." 

"Permettre aux petits agriculteurs d`augmenter leur productivit&#233;, d`am&#233;liorer la
qualit&#233; des r&#233;coltes et d`avoir acc&#232;s aux march&#233;s fiables est essentiel pour
lutter contre la faim et la pauvret&#233; dans le monde," a indiqu&#233; Sylvia Mathews
Burwell, Pr&#233;sidente du Programme de D&#233;veloppement Mondial de la Fondation Bill &amp;
Melinda Gates. La fondation a consacr&#233; plus de USD 1.4 milliards pour l`Afrique
Subsaharienne et l`Asie du Sud dans le but de renforcer la cha&#238;ne de valeur
agricole tout enti&#232;re - &#224; partir des graines et du sol jusqu`&#224; la gestion
agricole et l`acc&#232;s aux march&#233;s - de telle fa&#231;on que la lutte contre la faim et
la pauvret&#233; demeure durable &#224; long terme. "Les partenariats comme celui-l&#224;
offrent aux agriculteurs les outils et les ressources qui les aident &#224;
revitaliser l`agriculture africaine et augmentent le nombre d`opportunit&#233;s
offertes aux petits agriculteurs pour am&#233;liorer leur mode de vie et celui de
leurs familles." 

La mise en oeuvre de ce partenariat par TechnoServe s`appuie sur des
partenariats similaires actuellement en cours &#224; travers l`Afrique, y compris des
partenariats portant sur les bananes, les noix, le cacao et le caf&#233;. Ceux-ci
veilleront &#224; ce que les crit&#232;res sociaux et &#233;cologiques durables soient int&#233;gr&#233;s
dans le programme au niveau des exploitations. 

"Nous avons l`honneur de faire partie de cette collaboration innovante &#233;tant
donn&#233; qu`elle repr&#233;sente une &#233;tape importante dans le cadre du d&#233;veloppement du
secteur priv&#233; en Afrique," a expliqu&#233; Bruce McNamer, Pr&#233;sident et PDG de
TechnoServe. "Cet investissement acc&#233;l&#233;rera la r&#233;duction de la pauvret&#233; en
Afrique en aidant les agriculteurs auto-entrepreneurs &#224; acc&#233;der aux march&#233;s et &#224;
recevoir l`appui dont ils ont besoin." 

Ce projet sera mis en place en collaboration avec les gouvernements du Kenya et
de l`Ouganda vu son importance dans le contexte de leurs strat&#233;gies visant &#224;
r&#233;duire la pauvret&#233;. Il a pour but de faire b&#233;n&#233;ficier les agriculteurs
participants en leur permettant de tirer profit d`un gagne-pain am&#233;lior&#233; durant
des ann&#233;es &#224; venir.

&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - European shares pointed to a higher start on
Thursday following sharp falls in the previous session as traders noted the
sell-off on Chinese lending concerns was unwarranted.

 Investors will also focus on fourth-quarter earnings from Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) and Google (GOOG.O).

 Financial bookmakers expected Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE to open up 34-35
points, Germany's DAX .GDAXI to open up 42-45 points, and France's CAC-40
.FCHI to open up 28-30 points.

 The Dow suffered its worst drop of 2010 on Wednesday although ended off lows
as U.S. stocks succumbed to fears that China's curbs on bank lending might
jeopardize the global economic recovery. [ID:nN20138705]

 Meanwhile, China easily beat its 2009 growth target after a blistering
performance in the fourth quarter that forms a powerful springboard for it to
jump over Japan this year to become the world's second-largest economy.
[ID:nTOE60K011]

 The dollar surged to a four-month high on Thursday and Asian shares were
mostly lower, but the Nikkei Average .N225 bucked the trend and gained 1.2
percent.

 European shares slipped on Wednesday from a 15-month closing high as banks
fell after worse-than-expected earnings from Bank of America (BAC.N) and Morgan
Stanley (MS.N) and miners dropped on China concerns.

&lt;p&gt;  PORTLAND, OR, Jan 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
CompanionLink(R) Software is currently shipping synchronization for
Microsoft(R) Exchange calendar and Nexus One(TM). In addition to calendar
sync, CompanionLink products handle tasks, notes, and contacts for the
Nexus One phone.

    "Mobile professionals depend on their schedule and contact information
being up-to-date with the Nexus One," says Rushang Shah, Director of
Marketing for CompanionLink Software, Inc. "CompanionLink supplies a key
missing link that ensures calendar information flows accurately from the

maximum efficiency by, for instance, ordering contacts by last name on the

    CompanionLink offers two methods of synchronizing between the Exchange

Nexus One. Both solutions install on desktop PCs and not the server, and
retail for $39.95. Telephone support is included at no cost. A 14-day

&lt;p&gt;  CALGARY, ALBERTA, Jan 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
BioteQ Environmental Technologies Inc. ("BioteQ") (TSX: BQE) and Newalta
Corporation ("Newalta") (TSX: NAL) announced that the previously
announced private placement was completed today. 

    Newalta acquired 3,636,364 common shares, at a price of $1.10 per share
(the "Issue Price"), from the treasury of BioteQ for consideration of $4
million. Each share purchased includes a warrant to acquire an additional
common share of BioteQ at 125% of the Issue Price during the first year
and 150% of the Issue Price thereafter. The warrants expire after 5
years. In addition, Newalta has the right to nominate a representative of
Newalta to the board of directors of BioteQ, for as long as Newalta holds
greater than 5% of a proportional interest in BioteQ's common shares. 

    The majority of the proceeds from the private placement will be used by
BioteQ to pursue joint projects that could apply the innovative
environmental technologies and operating expertise of both BioteQ and
Newalta. Once suitable candidate projects for development have been
identified, BioteQ and Newalta will work to jointly commercialize these
projects, capitalizing on the strengths of both of these parties.

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Alaska's governor and a senior Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) executive on Friday struck a conciliatory tone about settling a long-running legal dispute over the Point Thomson oil and gas field on the North Slope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, a judge ruled that Alaska officials improperly voided leases held by Exxon and its partners in the field that holds up 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and hundreds of millions of barrels of gas condensate and oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state has accused that Exxon and its partners of delaying development and warehousing liquids that should have already been pumped and shipped down the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. Some Point Thomson leases date back to the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we are at a place where we need to resolve the Point Thomson litigation. I am working at that already," Gov. Sean Parnell said in a speech at an oil industry conference. "If I can resolve that litigation in Alaska's interest, I will do so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the field operator, and its partners argue that development is hampered by extreme reservoir pressure, remoteness and other challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich Kruger, president of Exxon Mobil Production Co, said his company and its partners BP (BP.L), Chevron (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) have already spent $1 billion at Point Thomson and also want the legal fight to end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is important that we work to resolve our outstanding issues with the Alaska Department of Natural Resources," Kruger told the conference audience. "We stand ready to work together to do so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a partial settlement struck a year ago, Exxon and its partners retained two leases, on condition that they drill two wells there by the end of this year, the first Point Thomson wells in nearly two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kruger said one of the wells has already been drilled and extends two miles horizontally, into the offshore region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kruger and Parnell, a Republican, spoke at the annual conference held by the Alaska Support Industry Alliance, an association of oil-service companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Arrow Electronics, Inc. (NYSE: ARW) as the Bull
of the Day and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) the Bear of the Day. In addition,
Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), JPMorgan
(NYSE: JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Arrow Electronics, Inc. (NYSE: ARW) recently upgraded its outlook for the fourth
quarter of 2009. The company now expects revenues to come between $3.8 billion
and $4.2 billion in the December quarter, up from the previous guidance of $3.65
billion to $4.25 billion. 

Management stated that the upgrade in guidance was driven by stronger than
expected growth in the components business. However, sales in the last few weeks
of December will determine sales of the computing solutions business. Earnings
per share (EPS) are now projected between $0.57 and $0.63, up from the earlier
estimate of $0.44 to $0.56. 

We expect overall demand to improve going forward with the economy showing signs
of recovery. We upgrade our rating to OUTPERFORM from NEUTRAL. 

Bear of the Day: 

GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) reported third quarter income of $0.92 per American
Depository Share (ADS), 3 cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company
reported earnings of $0.94 in the year-ago period. Third quarter revenue
increased 3%. 

While the company's diversified base and presence in different geographical
areas should help support revenues, we remain concerned about future growth
prospects given the patent challenges being faced by several of Glaxo's
products. With several products expected to lose exclusivity and the swine flu
opportunity likely to miss expectations, we expect the company's topline to
remain under pressure in the coming quarters. 

Glaxo's pipeline needs to deliver in order to make up for lost revenues and any
development or regulatory setbacks would be a major disappointment for the
company. We are downgrading the stock to Underperform with a target price of
$37.

Obama Gets Tough on Wall Street

President Obama: &#8230;I'm proposing a simple and common-sense reform, which we're
calling the "Volcker Rule" .... Banks will no longer be allowed to own, invest,
or sponsor hedge funds, private equity funds, or proprietary trading operations
for their own profit, unrelated to serving their customers. If financial firms
want to trade for profit, that's something they're free to do. Indeed, doing so
-- responsibly -- is a good thing for the markets and the economy. But these
firms should not be allowed to run these hedge funds and private equities funds
while running a bank backed by the American people.

This brings back the spirit of Glass-Stiegel. Essentially saying the bank cannot
take insured deposits and run off to Vegas to try their luck. Risk-taking is
vital to the economy, but it should not be done by insured banks. 

Ideally we would go back to the days of 3-6-3 banking, where bankers borrow at
3% from depositors, lend it out at 6% on safe, well-collateralized loans, and
can make it to the first tee by 3pm. The big-risk taking should be in separate
financial institutions. 

I suspect that if this proposal goes through, banks will have to make a choice,
or possibly split themselves up. Firms like Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) -- which
only became a bank holding company last year during the crisis -- will go back
to being investment banks, free to essentially be hedge funds. Others will
decide to become safe stable commercial banks, ones with less risk, but also
less profitable, and which would probably deliver utility-like returns. 

The Goldmans of the world could earn very high returns, but if they messed up,
their shareholders and even their unsecured creditors would take a big hit.
Firms like JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) would probably
spin off their investment banks to shareholders as separate firms (basically
undoing the acquisitions of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch).

How the Stimulus Package Has Helped

In the first three months of fiscal year 2010, Federal Spending on unemployment
benefits was $19.0 billion -- higher than it was in the first three months of
fiscal 2009. Aside from increased aid to states to pay for Medicare, it was the
single-biggest increase of any line item in the Federal budget. 

Without those extended benefits, almost six million people (and their families)
would be left with no income at all. That is a near-perfect recipe for them to
default on all their debts, especially their mortgages if they are underwater on
their house. Thus indirectly, the extended benefits are another way of propping
up the big banks that own those mortgages, like Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and
JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM). Those six million would probably max out their credit
cards and then default on them, so the banks are benefiting on that front as
well. 

The income from the extended benefits also means that people can continue to buy
basic goods from Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) or Big Lots (NYSE: BIG). As they do, it
keeps the workers in those stores employed, as well as the workers who make and
transport those goods on the job. 

According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, increasing aid to the
unemployed is one of the most cost-effective ways to create jobs there is. In
fact, of all the policy options they looked at, the only other one that carries
close to as much bank for the buck would be to reduce payroll (Social Security
and Medicare) taxes on employers who show a net increase in their payrolls.
Thus, it is wise spending from a hard-nosed economic point of view as well as
from a humanitarian point of view. 

Southwest Airlines Outperforms

Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) declared encouraging fourth quarter 2009
financial results. Quarterly operating revenue of $2,712 million was down 0.8%
year-over-year, but better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,644 million.
Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $116 million or 16 cents per share compared
to a GAAP net loss of $56 million or 8 cents per share in the prior-year
quarter. 

However, excluding special items, adjusted net income was $74 million or 10
cents per share compared to $61 million or 8 cents per share in the year-ago
quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS of 10 cents was significantly higher than
the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents per share. 

Despite facing an extremely challenging airline industry, Southwest Airlines has
achieved its 37th consecutive year of profitability in 2009. The introduction of
new products and programs, coupled with implementation of cost-effective
processes, are the main reasons for these impressive results. The company
already has seen strong revenue and booking trends in early 2010, which has
prompted management's year-over-year increase in revenue guidance for the first
quarter of 2010.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Google Beats, But Stock Slides

Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) announced solid growth numbers in its fourth quarter
and fiscal 2009 earnings after the bell today. The Internet services giant
reported earnings of $6.13 per share for the quarter, soundly beating the Zacks
Consensus Estimate of $5.69 per share. In contrast to the general treatment on
the Street, we at Zacks prefer the expensing of stock-based compensation, which
is reflected in the reported EPS ($6.13) and the Zacks Consensus ($5.69). 

And, in anticipation of Google's earnings report, GOOG shares were up very
slightly, even as the Nasdaq as a whole was down on the day. Nevertheless, once
Google's earnings hit the wires, after-market trading sold off GOOG shares. 

Sometimes good just isn't good enough? "As we enter 2010, we remain hugely
optimistic..." said CEO Eric Schmidt in Google's press release. It would seem
difficult to read anything negative in that expression. But then the search
engine business has been maturing, and impressive growth rates of the last few
years may be getting difficult to replicate going forward for GOOG. 

Goldman Sachs Reports Big Beat

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.`s (NYSE: GS) fourth quarter 2009 earnings of $8.20 per
share were significantly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.18. Results
reflected strong performance in investment banking and increased inflows which
offset the weak performance in the trading operations. The company also reported
a significant drop in expenses on a sequential basis. 

GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $4.8 billion compared to $3.0
billion or $5.25 per share in the prior quarter, and a loss of $2.3 billion or
$4.97 per share in the prior-year quarter. 

Total revenue decreased 22% sequentially but was significantly higher than the
negative revenue in the prior-year period to $9.6 billion. Fourth quarter
revenue by business segment are as follows: 

Investment Banking generated revenue of $1.6 billion, up 82% sequentially and
58% year-over-year. Results reflected an increase in revenue of debt and equity
underwriting. Also, revenues were spurred by the financial advisory business as
a result of significant increase in high-yield client activity across the
industry. 

Trading and Principal Investments generated revenue of $6.4 billion, down 36%
sequentially but significantly higher than the prior-year quarter. Sequentially
results were down as a result of a decrease in revenues in fixed income (down
34%) and equity trading (down 45%). Even the Principal Investment portfolio
declined 60% sequentially. 

Asset Management and Securities Services generated revenue of $1.6 billion, up
8% sequentially but down 10% year-over-year. Results reflected higher incentive,
management and other fees coupled by strong inflows in fixed income assets. This
was partially offset by outflows in money market assets and market appreciation
across all asset classes. 

eBay Soars on Skype Sale

eBay Inc. (Nasdaq: EBAY) reported third quarter pro forma earnings that beat
consensus estimates by a penny. However, shares were up 8.1% after hours, as the
company recorded a $1.1 profit per share on the sale of Skype. 

Gross revenue of $2.37 billion was up 5.9% sequentially and 16.5% year over
year. Around 88% of total revenue was transactions-based, while the remaining
12% came from marketing services. Both existing segments contributed to the
revenue increase in the last quarter. 

Marketplaces revenue increased 7.2% sequentially and 15.4% compared to the
year-ago quarter. The sequential revenue increase was driven by a 5.9% increase
in transaction revenue and a 14.2% increase in marketing services revenue. The
year-over-year increase was due to a 16.6% increase in transaction value and a
10% increase in marketing services. Vehicles volume continued to decline both
sequentially and year over year. The segment generated 62% of total revenue. 

Payments revenue increased 15.6% sequentially and 27.7% from the year-ago
quarter. Revenue from transactions was up 16.6% sequentially and 25.3% year over
year, as both the number of active users and the number of transactions
increased. Although the revenue generated per transaction declined, this was
partially offset by the lower cost per transaction and lower transaction loss
rate. Marketing services revenue was flat sequentially (down 0.8%), but up a
whopping 104.2% from the year-ago quarter. The segment generated 34% of total
revenue. 

Communications revenue was down 39.5% sequentially and 22.9% from the year-ago
quarter. Both comparisons were impacted by the sale of the unit (Skype) in
November 2009. Transactions represented 92% of communications revenue, while
marketing services accounted for the rest. 

Starbucks Reports Strong Q1

Starbucks Corporation (Nasdaq: SBUX) reported first quarter results with
earnings of 33 cents per share. Earnings were 5 cents above the Zacks Consensus
Estimate of 28 cents per share, and were up 120% compared to 15 cents in the
prior-year quarter. The strong results were driven by continued innovation and
implementation of efficient cost structure. 

Net revenues for the quarter increased 4.1% year-over-year to $2.7 billion,
primarily due to a 4% increase in comparable stores sales and the positive
impact of foreign currency translation related to the weakening of the U.S.
dollar, most notably against the Canadian dollar, which was partially offset by
a smaller store base and a decline in specialty revenues. 

Segment-wise, U.S. segment revenues increased marginally by 1.1% to $1.93
billion due to a 4% increase in comparable store sales, partially offset by the
closure of 369 underperforming company-operated stores over the last 12 months. 

Net revenues in the International segment grew 19.2% year-over-year to $591
million mainly due to the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar relative primarily to
the Canadian dollar, the effect of consolidating the previous joint venture
operations in France and 4% increase in comparable-store sales. 

Global Consumer Products Group segment reported a net sales decline of 4.4% to
$196.8 million due to lower licensing revenues in the packaged coffee business
and lower foodservice revenues, driven by ongoing softness in the hospitality
industry. 

Freeport McMoRan Outperforms

The world`s largest publicly traded copper company, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp;
Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX), reported fourth-quarter 2009 earnings of $2.15 per share,
ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 per share. Earnings represented a
significant turnaround from a $14 billion loss in the same quarter the previous
year. Revenues more than doubled to $4.61 billion. 

Phoenix-based Freeport-McMoRan has been showing signs of recovery. The company`s
earnings rose in the third quarter for the first time in 2009 on higher sales to
China and other developing countries, as well as lower costs for production and
delivery. Freeport`s performance reflects a successful execution of various
cost-reduction initiatives and higher ore grades at Grasberg. 

The company is responding aggressively to the economic downturn by curtailing
production levels, cutting costs, reducing exploration expenditures and
deferring capital spending. Total cost of sales declined 34% year over year.

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska Jan 22 (Reuters) - Alaska's governor and
a senior Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) executive on Friday struck a
conciliatory tone about settling a long-running legal dispute
over the Point Thomson oil and gas field on the North Slope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Two weeks ago, a judge ruled that Alaska officials
improperly voided leases held by Exxon and its partners in the
field that holds up 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and
hundreds of millions of barrels of gas condensate and oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state has accused that Exxon and its partners of
delaying development and warehousing liquids that should have
already been pumped and shipped down the trans-Alaska oil
pipeline. Some Point Thomson leases date back to the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think we are at a place where we need to resolve the
Point Thomson litigation. I am working at that already," Gov.
Sean Parnell said in a speech at an oil industry conference.
"If I can resolve that litigation in Alaska's interest, I will
do so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, the field operator, and its partners argue that
development is hampered by extreme reservoir pressure,
remoteness and other challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rich Kruger, president of Exxon Mobil Production Co, said
his company and its partners BP (BP.L), Chevron (CVX.N) and
ConocoPhillips (COP.N) have already spent $1 billion at Point
Thomson and also want the legal fight to end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is important that we work to resolve our outstanding
issues with the Alaska Department of Natural Resources," Kruger
told the conference audience. "We stand ready to work together
to do so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under a partial settlement struck a year ago, Exxon and its
partners retained two leases, on condition that they drill two
wells there by the end of this year, the first Point Thomson
wells in nearly two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kruger said one of the wells has already been drilled and
extends two miles horizontally, into the offshore region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kruger and Parnell, a Republican, spoke at the annual
conference held by the Alaska Support Industry Alliance, an
association of oil-service companies.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - A security research firm said it discovered another set of vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, a day after Microsoft Corp patched the Web browser following a high-profile cyber attack on Google in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software maker issued a patch on Thursday to fight malicious software that was used in the attack on Google Inc and dozens of other companies which operate in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research firm Core Security Technologies said on Friday that it discovered another set of vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer that hackers can link together and exploit, to remotely access all of the data on a personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are three or four ways to conduct this type of attack," said Jorge Luis Alvarez Medina, a security consultant with Boston-based Core, who will demonstrate the vulnerability at the Black Hat security conference in Washington, which begins February 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Microsoft said she could not immediately comment on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alvarez Medina said hackers can exploit a string of four or five minor vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, which is used on hundreds of millions of PCs around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although none of the vulnerabilities are serious enough to compromise a machine, a hacker could take control of a PC by exploiting all of them at once, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination would overwhelm the browser, giving a hacker access to all data on the PC after a user clicks on a malicious link, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alvarez Medina added that he was uncertain whether any hackers had already exploited the weaknesses, which Microsoft has yet to patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that Core was working with Microsoft to find a way to mitigate the risk, but added that he believed other vulnerabilities would crop up even after a solution to these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is likely that people will come up with new ones over time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Jan 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) shut down
its Global Equity Opportunities Funds at the end of 2009 after
the portfolio, once among the company's well-performing
in-house hedge funds, suffered heavy redemptions for some
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The fund, which relied on computer models to make trades,
had about $200 million in assets at the end of last year, down
from roughly $7 billion at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bob Jones, who had managed the fund throughout its life, is
no longer managing money at the firm but remains an adviser at
the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokeswoman confirmed that the portfolio has been
closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund made headlines in 2007 when it lost nearly one
quarter of its capital in August of that year during a market
sell-off, and assets fell steadily after that, a person
familiar with the matter said. Goldman invested about $2
billion of its own money to rescue the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Robert Litterman, the chairman of Goldman's
quantitative investment strategy group, plans to retire at the
end of January. Goldman confirmed the plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litterman had been with the firm for 23 years and was not
managing money in his most recent role.

discovered another set of vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer,
a day after Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) patched the Web browser
following a high-profile cyber attack on Google in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software maker issued a patch on Thursday to fight

exploiting all of them at once, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combination would overwhelm the browser, giving a
hacker access to all data on the PC after a user clicks on a
malicious link, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alvarez Medina added that he was uncertain whether any
hackers had already exploited the weaknesses, which Microsoft
has yet to patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said that Core was working with Microsoft to find a way
to mitigate the risk, but added that he believed other
vulnerabilities would crop up even after a solution to these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is likely that people will come up with new ones over
time," he said.

&lt;p&gt;Liaise is One of Seven Companies Selected to Develop New Social Enterprise
Applications for SharePoint in Marathon Week-Long Coding Competition
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Liaise will be one of seven companies working around the clock for one week
starting January 25 to develop enterprise applications that leverage the social
capabilities of Microsoft SharePoint. 

Microsoft chose the companies they deemed to be among the industry`s most
innovative emerging Enterprise 2.0 companies to test SharePoint`s rapid business
application development platform at the first-ever SharePoint 2010 SocialFest.
Held on the Microsoft Silicon Valley campus, the selected companies will build
their applications on top of the SharePoint 2010 platform in the one week
competition. At the conclusion of the week, each company`s applications will be
judged by a panel of top tier venture capitalists, Fortune 500 customers and
Microsoft executives. More information can be found here. 

"Liaise is one of a handful of companies we selected for our first-ever
SocialFest competition because they demonstrate strong potential to extend the
SharePoint 2010 platform in one of the fastest growing areas of enterprise
software - social computing," said Lynda Ting Director of Microsoft`s Emerging
Business Team. 

Liaise offers collaboration software that helps networks of people - both within
and between organizations - manage interactions with customers, colleagues,
partners and suppliers. Winner of the DEMOfall 2009 People`s Choice Award for
Best Enterprise Product, Liaise automatically finds the critical information
woven into messaging systems like email, and transforms it into actionable
reminders and reports, all without changing the way you work. Collaboration
becomes simple and transparent, as any change made to an assignment or task is
automatically shared with every team member - without the need to send an
additional e-mail. 

A video demonstration of Liaise in action can be seen here. 

"Liaise is ideally suited to bring social productivity and real-time data to
SharePoint," said Sidney Minassian, Liaise`s Co-Founder and Chief Liaison. "By
capturing critical information currently locked up in emails and automatically
feeding it into SharePoint, customers will benefit from increased social
productivity and further will be able to use a new source of real-time data to
support workflow and decision applications within SharePoint." 

About Liaise

Liaise`s mission is to turn words into action - wherever words are used.
Recognizing that most people manage their business interactions through
messaging systems such as email, IM, SMS and others, Liaise has created a
solution that automatically finds the critical information woven into these
daily communications, and transforms it into actionable reminders and reports.
Formed in 2008 by entrepreneurs with over a decade of experience in building and
selling work management solutions, the company is backed by Southern Cross
Venture Partners and individual investors. Located in Sunnyvale, California,

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Jan 22 (Reuters) - EU regulators are seeking
market views on whether a Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) plan to use
Yahoo Inc's search technology would help the U.S. software firm
compete against dominant search engine Google Inc (GOOG.O).
 Microsoft struck a 10-year Web search partnership with Yahoo
(YHOO.O) last July, seeking to challenge Google. Combining
forces could also attract more ad dollars from marketers, but
the deal has yet to be approved by antitrust regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Antitrust lawyers have said U.S. regulators are expected to
scrutinise the deal closely but eventually grant approval as it
would create a stronger rival to Google. [ID:nN29273592]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Will the merger make Microsoft a better competitor to
Google?" the European Commission said in a questionnaire sent to
interested parties and obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 38-question document asked potential respondents whether
they believed Google had a competitive advantage compared to
other search engines and what they considered to be the
advantages and disadvantages of the various services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were also asked whether the Microsoft/Yahoo deal would
encourage innovation and lead to better searching. The deadline
for comments is Jan. 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Union executive has given itself until Feb. 19
to clear or prohibit the deal. It could extend the review should
it have competition concerns. Outgoing Competition Commissioner
Neelie Kroes has to date blocked only two proposed mergers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft last month ended a decade-long battle with the
Commission by agreeing to give European consumers better access
to rival Internet browsers in its Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Antitrust infringements in Europe have led to fines against
Microsoft totalling 1.68 billion euros ($2.4 billion).

&lt;p&gt; * Seeks U.S., European, Canadian approvals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer shares little changed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on
Friday it has asked U.S., European and Canadian regulators for
permission to market its already approved medicine Sutent as a
treatment for patients with a rare type of pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it had sought approval to market the pill for
advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, the type of
pancreatic cancer that has afflicted Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief
Executive Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neuroendocrine tumors, also known as pancreatic islet cell
tumors, are a rare form of the disease affecting two to four
people per million worldwide annually, or about 5 percent of
pancreatic cancer cases, according to the National Cancer
Institute. An expanded approval to treat the disease would
likely not add significantly to Sutent revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Sutent, known chemically as sunitinib, is currently
approved to treat advanced kidney cancer and gastrointestinal
stromal tumor, a cancer of the digestive system. With
third-quarter sales of $246 million, Sutent is one of Pfizer's
fastest-growing brands and is being studied in a number of
other types of solid tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Data released last June showed the drug delayed worsening
of the pancreatic cancer by almost six months longer than a
placebo. The favorable results, which prompted the world's
largest drugmaker to halt the trial early, were deemed highly
statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patients in the study had malignant tumors that had
progressed in the last 12 months. All received best supportive
care plus either Sutent or a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neuroendocrine cancer occurs in specialized cells of the
pancreas that secrete a variety of hormones, including insulin
and enzymes involved in digestion. When surgery to remove the
cancer is not possible, or when cancer returns after surgery,
life expectancy is only several years, and patients can
experience difficult symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other types of pancreatic cancer occur in ducts of the
pancreas -- small tubes that transport digestive enzymes
produced in the pancreas to the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most common adverse events seen in patients taking
Sutent were low white blood cells, high blood pressure,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, low blood sugar and swelling of the
hands and feet. These were similar to side effects seen in
previous Sutent studies, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sutent works by blocking a number of proteins involved in
the growth and spread of cancer, including vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth
factor receptor (PDGFR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares were up 2 cents at $19.26 in morning trade on
the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday released a patch to protect users of its Internet Explorer browser from attacks similar to those directed at Google Inc's operations in China last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company, which said hackers targeting Google and at least 20 other companies in China exploited a weakness in its browser, said its new patch was "critical" and people should apply it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other hackers have begun to exploit the flaw, according to researchers with Symantec Corp, the world's biggest security software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symantec has found viruses that take advantage of the weakness in Microsoft's browser on some 100 websites, security researcher John Harrison said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are dangerous because they can infect the PC of any user who visits those sites. Unlike less powerful viruses, it is not necessary for people to download software for their machines to become infected, Harrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCs are safe if they apply the patch, which resolves eight vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, Microsoft said. The most serious could allow hackers to gain control of a computer remotely via Web sites people visit while using the browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're always working, we have fewer vulnerabilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;than our competitors," said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer at an energy conference in Houston, addressing cyber-security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gave no indication that Microsoft would change its business in China after Google threatened to quit the country last week. "We respect the laws of China, it's the only appropriate thing for us to do," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The viruses Symantec has found only successfully attack Internet Explorer 6, though hackers could figure out how to break through the defenses of Internet Explorer 7 and 8, the most recent version of the software, Symantec's Harrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Internet Explorer customers, who have automatic updating enabled on their systems, will not need to take any action on the security patch, Microsoft said. For manual updating, it directed users to its website (here).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, Jim Finkle and Anna Driver; Editing by Richard Chang and Robert MacMillan)&lt;/p&gt;

Sutent Filed for New Indication in U.S., Europe and Canada for Patient
Population with Limited Treatment Options
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. today announced final results from a randomized Phase 3 trial of
Sutent (sunitinib malate) in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumors, a type of cancer which originates in the hormone-producing area of the
pancreas. Sunitinib more than doubled the time patients with pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors lived without disease progression compared with patients
treated with placebo, according to study findings that will be presented
tomorrow at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers
Symposium in Orlando, Florida. 

An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended halting the trial in
February 2009 because sunitinib showed significant benefit and the primary
endpoint was met. 

"This trial advances our understanding of the use of novel targeted therapies in
a patient population with limited treatment options," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg,
senior vice president of clinical development and medical affairs for Pfizer`s
Oncology Business Unit. "We are pleased to be working toward filling an unmet
patient need, as we did with Sutent four years ago in patients with kidney
cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors." 

The Phase 3 study findings served as the basis for the recent filings of
supplemental applications for sunitinib in the treatment of pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors with the regulatory authorities in the US, Europe and
Canada. 

Phase 3 Trial Results 

This international, Phase 3 trial compared sunitinib with placebo in patients
with progressive, well-differentiated, malignant pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumors. Patients were randomized to either the sunitinib (n=86) (37.5 mg/day,
continuous daily dosing) plus best supportive care arm or the placebo plus best
supportive care arm (n=85). 

Results showed that median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.4 months in
patients treated with sunitinib compared with 5.5 months in patients treated in
the placebo arm (Hazard ratio 0.418, p&lt;0.001). Sutent also prolonged overall
survival, a secondary endpoint of the trial (Hazard ratio 0.409, p=0.0204). 

"The magnitude of Sutent`s benefit in the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor
patient population was an encouraging finding," said Dr. Eric Raymond, professor
of medical oncology and head of University Department of Medical Oncology
(Service Inter Hospitalier de Cancerologie) Bichat-Beaujon, Clichy, France, and
lead investigator on this sunitinib Phase 3 study. "These findings offer hope to
a patient population for whom there are limited treatment options." 

Adverse events were similar to those observed in other sunitinib studies. The
most commonly reported grade 3-4 adverse events in the sunitinib arm were
neutropenia (12 percent), hypertension (9.6 percent), hand-foot syndrome (6
percent), leukopenia (6 percent) abdominal pain (4.8 percent), diarrhea (4.8
percent), asthenia (4.8 percent), fatigue (4.8 percent) and hypoglycemia (4.8
percent). Grade 5 cardiac failure was experienced by 1.2 percent of the patients
in the sunitinib arm. 

About Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors 

Tumors of the neuroendocrine system are typically classified into two distinct
categories: carcinoids or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors form in the endocrine (hormone-producing) tissues of the
pancreas and are separate from exocrine tumors, which account for about 95
percent of all pancreatic cancers. 

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are fairly rare, and reported in two to four
people per million annually worldwide. Subtypes include insulinomas,
glucagonomas and gastrinomas. Current treatment options are limited. 

About Sutent() (sunitinib malate) 

Sutent is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced
/ metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the treatment of gastrointestinal
stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib
mesylate. To date, approximately 82,000 patients globally have been treated with
sunitinib in the clinical setting and trials. 

Sutent works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important Sutent targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. Sutent also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Important Sutent() (sunitinib malate) Safety Information 

Women of childbearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on Sutent. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with Sutent. 

The most common adverse reactions in GIST and RCC clinical trials were fatigue,
asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal
pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin discoloration,
altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT Jan 24 (Reuters) - China could overtake Japan as
the world's second-largest economy in 2010, one year before
Goldman Sachs (GS.N) Chief Economist Jim O'Neill had previously
expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "I believe it can happen already earlier (than 2011). Maybe
already in the middle of this year," O'Neill told German Sunday
newspaper Welt am Sonntag, who forecast that China's economy
would triple by 2020 due to 8.3 percent annual growth. "The big
story in the post-crisis global economy is: China imports!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This nevertheless means that the problems in Europe will
grow, the Goldman economist warned. [ID:nL9420511]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Germany will continue to export too much and consume too
little, and will push the ailing eurozone states against the
wall with its competitiveness," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Neill expects the euro weakness to continue, reaching
$1.35 by the end of 2010, despite his prediction that the U.S.
Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates for the next two
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He rejected fears, however, that an increase in Germany's
debt would further harm confidence in the euro-zone, already
damaged due to massive fiscal problems in Greece
[ID:nLDE60I1C2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The European stability pact is no longer timely and it
deserves to be abolished," O'Neill said, referring to
proscribed levels for fiscal debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some economists believe capping budget deficits at 3
percent of GDP and total public debt at 60 percent of GDP acts
more as a straitjacket for the economy rather than as an anchor
for price stability.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group might be the most vulnerable U.S. bank under President Barack Obama's proposals to crack down on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Obama's "Volcker plan" were enacted, Goldman could be forced to explore a range of drastic measures, including spinning off key businesses, returning its bank charter -- or even taking the firm private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, for its part, asserts it will not make any rash decisions as details from Obama's single-page proposal to limit the size and activities of U.S. banks remains sketchy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal was fleshed out a bit on Monday as Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin seemed to open the door to banks without federally insured deposits engaging in proprietary trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has some federally insured deposits, but they are a relatively small portion of its overall funding base. Goldman gets 55 percent of its adjusted operating income from trading, far more than other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its earnings conference call last week, a Goldman executive denied it would consider handing back its bank charter and said drawing any conclusions about Goldman's next move would be premature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that is not deterring many investors from speculating about one possible Goldman exit strategy -- going private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is already in the process of figuring out how to go private," said Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer of the Omnivest Group in Princeton, New Jersey. "Goldman did not need -- or want the TARP money to start with -- and there is no reason for them to keep their bank charter and remain a public company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hedge fund manager Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners, has made Goldman going private among his "20 Surprises for 2010."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kass predicted: "Sick of the unrelenting compensation outcry, government jawboning and associated Populist pressures, Warren Buffett teams up with Goldman Sachs to take the investment firm private."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIFFICULT CHOICES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But going private is not as easy as it sounds. It would make it more difficult for the firm to raise capital and would reduce its access to liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another option would be for Goldman to try to return its bank holding company charter, while continuing to be publicly traded. Regulators would likely resist such a move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Morgan Stanley became bank holding companies in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, giving them access to the Fed's emergency lending facilities. But being a bank meant greater regulatory scrutiny and new capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also accepted $10 billion from U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in October 2008 as part of a larger taxpayer rescue of the financial services program. Goldman repaid that money in less than a year -- in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many analysts have questioned whether Goldman would have survived without the various forms of government backing extended during the crisis, including the ability to issue nearly $30 billion in FDIC-backed debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public anger over Goldman's $16.2 billion in salaries and bonuses after the multibillion-dollar taxpayer rescue of the financial system has not subsided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's profitability, and suspicions that its deep links with governments around the world gave it unfair advantages, made it a symbol of Wall Street greed and excess. Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi described it as "a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman announced record earnings of $13.39 billion for 2009 and an average payout per employee in salary and bonuses of $498,000, which the bank seemed to think indicated restraint on its part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Obama proposed to ban bank holding companies from owning, investing in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds and from engaging in proprietary trading, or trading on their own accounts, as opposed to with their customers' money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPIN-OFFS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to fully assess the impact of the proposals as they are a long way from becoming law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All kinds of discussions I know are going on -- what if, what if, what if," said Marshall Front, the chairman of Front Barnett Associates. "They could restructure their business, they could go private."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts say the most likely possibility is for Goldman to spin-off one or more of its businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad Hintz, an analyst with Sanford C Bernstein, said its private equity business could be the target of such a move. But doing so could harm other parts of the business that use the private equity for clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Private equity and investment banking are really linked at the hip," Hintz said. "I understand why they may be going this way, but it certainly severs some very nice relationships."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder and Jennifer Ablan; editing by Leslie Gevirtz and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PORT ARTHUR, Texas, Jane 25 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) said on Monday its 150,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los
Angeles-area refinery in Torrance, Calif., continued to operate
and was able to meet its customer obligations after an
equipment breakdown that triggered flaring on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon spokeswoman declined to identify which unit or
units were involved in the flaring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In notices filed with California pollution regulators,
Exxon said the refinery may have exceeded its permitted levels

&lt;p&gt;Many small businesses pay too much for Windows, Office, and other Microsoft products. They buy software off retail shelves or online, one-at-a-time, and miss significant discounts that are available to almost every company. If your company uses more than four Microsoft products, such as Project or Visio, there is a discount program available. You just have to know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much can you save? Up to 50 percent in one current promotion, but more commonly 5 to 25 percent, depending on the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft offers three volume licensing programs for small and medium-sized businesses with anywhere from five to 250 PCs.They are: Open License, Open Value, and Open Value Subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also offers a program called Software Assurance that, for an annual payment of 29 percent of your Microsoft apps purchases and 25 percent of server purchases, provides ongoing "free" upgrades and other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software Assurance (SA) is described in detail following the program descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These names appear in various forms in different places--even at Microsoft. I have used the more easily-recognized form of each program name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You would think the Microsoft Small Business site would make it easy to find out about each program, but it doesn't, instead referring customers to resellers for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps to know what to ask about, so here are program specifics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open License&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The easiest and simplest approach for small business is the Open License program," said Paul de Groot, licensing specialist with Directions on Microsoft, a newsletter and consulting firm that advises customers on how to best purchase Microsoft products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The program is very easy to get into--any five licenses gets you an authorization number--and takes somewhere between 5% and 25% off license prices," de Groot said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Open License is transactional, meaning there are no long term commitments, and Software Assurance is optional. An authorization lasts for two years, and once you get it, you can order additional licenses one at a time and still get the discounted price."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open Licenses also allows customers to manage their software licenses online and to install software from copies stored on local servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open Value&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want Software Assurances on every license and slightly better discounts, you can do that with Open Value," de Groot said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Open Value is a program that doesn't count software licenses, but the number of PCs in your organization. If you're looking to do an across-the-board upgrade--say from WinXP and Office 2003 to Win7 Pro and Office 2007, with rights to Win 7 Enterprise and Office 2010 at no additional cost--Open Value might be the better option."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open Value customers commit to purchasing a customized set of Microsoft products for their desktops and are able to simplify license tracking, make upgrades more easily, and improve cost management for their software investment. Open Value requires a three-year commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key feature of the Open Value program is the ability to spread payments out over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open Value Subscription &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is offering potentially large discounts to customers who purchase time-limited software subscriptions, as opposed to the perpetual licenses that come with boxed software and other Microsoft purchasing programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the difference: When the subscription ends, so does your company's license to use the software (although a buy-out option may be available). With a perpetual license, you can use your software theoretically forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open Value Subscription the same offers benefits as Open Value, but in a subscription license. Customers see lower up-front costs with a subscription, and have flexibility to 'true-down' or pay for fewer desktops if they've seen reductions when they reach their anneversary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through June 30, Microsoft is running a promotion called the "Up-to-Date Discount," which allows customers to receive as much as a 50 percent off on their purchases by giving them credit for software they already own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also offering financing to small business customers. Qualifying customers can receive 36-month loans for solutions that include Microsoft software and cost as little as $3,000, Sharpe added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software Assurance &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considered controversial by some business customers, Microsoft's Software Assurance program charges an annual premium of up to 29 percent of the value of the customer's Microsoft software purchases. In return, customers get the right to upgrade their software at no additional charge during the term of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies that want to keep their software current can find Software Assurance a convenient way to upgrade without having to purchase expensive new software all at once. On the other hand, if Microsoft doesn't do a major upgrade every three or four years, the program could turn out to be too costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the benefits of Software Assurance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 Enterprise is only available to Software Assurance customers, and while some of the features are targeted at large organizations, it brings key security features such as BitLocker, BitLocker To Go and AppLocker that offer benefits for organizations of any size. Learn more from Microsoft about Windows 7 Enterprise features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Home Use Program offers copies of Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007 Enterprise for $9.95 to the employees of SA-member companies for their employees to use at home. Other products are also available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Home Use Program supports telecommuting and other flexible work options. Once the benefit is activated, companies provide the program code to eligible employees and they can order directly from the Home Use Program website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E-learning programs are also available through SA, potentially lowering training costs and increasing employee efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Spread Payments, small businesses can spread their total licensing costs (licenses plus SA) into 3 equal annual payments with no additional fees or interest charges, providing a predictable way to license Microsoft software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software Assurance customers also have access to the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack, a collection of IT-oriented tools and technologies available as a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning Is Key&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signing up for Open License is a no-brainer, provided you are willing to purchase five copies of Microsoft software at once to get started. The other programs require a bit of thought and probably a long discussion with a reseller, plus some number crunching, before a purchase decison is made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions such as, "How many machines do we need to upgrade" and "Does our company like to stay current or do we delay software purchases as long as possible?" are the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money also plays a role, with Microsoft offering financing and special offers to get customers into Software Assurance, which may not otherwise be the best choice for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before making a decision, customers should price their needs using all three volume license programs, add in special offers and financing, and choose what's best for their specific circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where To Buy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers interested in Microsoft's volume license programs should contact one of the company's SMB specialist resellers: PC Connection, CDW, PC Mall, Best Buy for Business, Tech Depot, or Staples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discounted Microsoft products are also available through local "small business specialist" organizations, who can also provide other services to customers, such as migration and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Small Business site offers more details and contact information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the vendor chosen, if your company isn't buying Microsoft products through one of the three SMB volume licensing programs, you are paying too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Coursey has been writing about technology products and companies for more than 25 years.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Telefonica Wraps Jajah Acquisition

Spanish Telecom giant Telefonica`s (NYSE: TEF) subsidiary O2 has officially
wrapped up the acquisition of VoIP (Internet phone) services and application
specialist Jajah Inc. following the approval of the Spanish Competition
Authority ("CNC"). Telefonica will keep the Jajah brand. 

Telefonica announced the acquisition of Silicon Valley based Jajah in December
2009 for &#8364;145 million (US$207 million) in an all-cash transaction. The deal is
similar to eBay`s (Nasdaq: EBAY) $3.9 billion acquisition of Skype in 2005 and
Google`s (Nasdaq: GOOG) $50 million takeover of GrandCentral in 2007 which now
operates as Google Voice. Skype competes with Jajah and both offer cheap calling
plans to win customers. 

Leveraging its own virtual network infrastructure, Jajah offers VoIP services
that enable its customers to bypass long-distance fees by connecting their calls
over the Internet. Industry sources reveal that several companies such as Cisco
Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) and Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) were also eyeing Jajah. 

VoIP services, which represent a significant threat to traditional network-based
phone services, is about to see mercurial growth in the next several years,
driven by widespread access to broadband Internet and availability of cheap VoIP
services. The global consumer VoIP market is forecasted to reach roughly $44
billion in 2013.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Parker Hannifin (NYSE: PH) as the Bull of the
Day and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on General Electric Company (NYSE: GE), United
Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTX) and Siemens AG (NYSE: SI). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We are upgrading the recommendation on Parker Hannifin (NYSE: PH) to Outperform
with a $67 target price. We are encouraged that order trends have improved
sequentially for the prior two consecutive quarters, indicating that the worst
is behind the company. 

Reflecting the benefits of restructuring actions and improving market
conditions, it has increased its earnings guidance for fiscal 2010 to the range
of $2.40 to $2.80 per share, representing a 44% increase from the midpoint of
the previous estimate. 

Cash on the balance sheet stands at $234 million with no commercial paper
outstanding. Inventory has been reduced by $336 million since last year and days
sales outstanding have improved over the prior year. 

Bear of the Day: 

We are downgrading our rating on JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) shares to
Underperform. 

Fourth quarter earnings were well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, aided
by better-than-expected results at its Investment Bank segment. However,
persistent high levels of consumer credit costs and increased provisions for
credit losses were among the major negatives. 

While we anticipate continued synergies from the company's diversification and
strong capital position, we believe increasing provisions and a pressured credit
quality will drag down future earnings. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

GE Exceeds Estimates

General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) reported fourth quarter 2009 earnings per
share from continuing operations of 28 cents, exceeding the Zacks Consensus
Estimate of 26 cents. Revenues were $41.4 billion for the quarter and $157
billion for the year. 

Fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations attributable to GE were $3.0
billion, down 22% from $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. EPS from
continuing operations was $0.28, down 22% from the fourth quarter of last year.
Segment profit declined 16% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, as 9%
growth at Energy Infrastructure and 278% growth at Consumer &amp; Industrial were
more than offset by declines of 67% at Capital Finance, 30% at NBC Universal and
16% at Technology Infrastructure. 

GE is a diversified infrastructure, finance and media company taking on the
world`s toughest challenges. From aircraft engines and power generation to
financial services, medical imaging and television programming, GE operates in
more than 100 countries and employs about 300,000 people worldwide. Major
competitors are United Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTX) and Siemens AG
(NYSE: SI).

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Program Celebrates the `Games` That Uplift Fans Everywhere
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola is tapping into the joy and inspiration of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic
Winter Games with the launch of a multi-faceted Olympic Games-themed program in
the U.S. designed to refresh, uplift and inspire fans. The campaign is anchored
by a group of high-profile U.S. Olympians and U.S. Champions, known as the
Coca-Cola "Six Pack" of athletes, limited edition Olympic Games-themed
packaging, media and digital experiences. 

Take Home the Games

Currently hitting supermarkets, convenience stores and mass retailers are
limited edition, Coca-Cola Olympic Games-themed collectible cans and FridgePacks
featuring silhouettes inspired by some of the most popular Olympic Winter Games
sports, such as figure skating, ice hockey, speedskating and snowboarding. An
additional commemorative can featuring a contemporary interpretation of the
Inukshuk, the symbol of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games, will be
released closer to the opening of the Games. This innovative packaging extends
the brand`s commitment to refresh fans with the spirit and excitement of the
Games at home. Additional packaging includes 20-ounce Coca-Cola bottles,
multipacks and 2-liter bottles, with a new silhouette appearing every two to
three weeks. More than 700 million cans will be on store shelves throughout
January and February. 

"The dedication to active living and amazing athletic performances of our
`Six-Pack` of athletes served as inspiration for these Coca-Cola Olympic
Games-themed collectible cans," said Katie Bayne, Chief Marketing Officer,
Coca-Cola North America. "Our special packaging and overall Coca-Cola Olympic
Games program are a great way to celebrate the Games and open a little happiness
while enjoying the exciting competition with your friends and family." 

Coca-Cola "Six-Pack" of Olympic Athletes

Coca-Cola continues to build upon its legacy of supporting active lifestyles
through its relationship with inspirational athletes. The Coca-Cola "Six Pack"
of athletes is featured on in-store materials and serves as Coca-Cola
"Ambassadors of Active Living," helping encourage and inspire people to lead
active, balanced lives. The Coca-Cola "Six Pack" includes five-time Olympic
medalist Apolo Anton Ohno (short track speed skating), Olympic silver medalist
Gretchen Bleiler (snowboard), three-time Olympic medalist Angela Ruggiero (ice
hockey), World Champion Evan Lysacek (figure skating) and two-time U.S. figure
skating champions Keauna McLaughlin and Rockne Brubaker. 

Advertising

The new Coca-Cola global Olympic TV commercial, "Snowball," which debuted during
the season premiere of American Idol, shows how Coke can spark spontaneity and
fun as people from all over the world come together and engage in a high-energy
game. Additionally, a series of four :15 second spots promoting the Coca-Cola
Olympic Games-themed collectible cans and two :30 vignettes featuring the
Coca-Cola "Six-Pack" of athletes and cans will run on NBC during primetime
Olympic Winter Games programming. 

During the Opening Ceremony on February 12, viewers will see a special
commercial that celebrates the 80-year partnership between Coca-Cola and the
Olympic Games. The spot features uplifting, historical footage of Olympic
athletes receiving their medals backed by the voiceover, "If you`ve had a Coke
in the last 80 years, you`ve had a hand in making every Olympic dream come
true." The ad, which originally aired during the Opening Ceremony of the Beijing
2008 Olympic Games, has been refreshed to include Olympians Ohno, Bleiler and
Ruggiero as well as athletes from the Paralympic Games and the Special Olympic
Games. 

Digital Olympic Experience

Coca-Cola is partnering with NBC as an exclusive sponsor of Team USA on
NBCOlympics.com and NBCOlympics mobile. The sponsorship includes a custom
content section that captures all of the celebratory and feel-good moments of
the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games and a mobile application called "NBC Olympic
Cheer presented by Coca-Cola." The application brings fans into the Vancouver
experience by playing energetic, familiar sounds related to the Games like air
horns and cowbells and the sounds associated with drinking a refreshing Coke
(ice clinking, pouring, the first "ahh"). Fans also can support Team USA by
recording and submitting their own custom cheers within the application. 

Rounding out the NBC partnership is the exclusive sponsorship of "Primetime
Challenge," which enhances the Olympic Winter Games viewing experience by
allowing fans to play along with the TV broadcast through a two-screen
application synced up to live action, offering trivia, predictive questions,
polls, fun facts and athlete profiles.

Vancouver 2010 Olympic Torch Relay

In October 2009, Coca-Cola announced the selection of 20 inspiring Americans to
be torchbearers for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Torch Relay. Among the honored
torchbearers are 10 teens, five leaders from national health organizations,
three Coca-Cola North America employees and Olympic gold medalists Shawn Johnson
and Steven Lopez. All torchbearers were selected because of their dedication to
making a positive difference in their communities. 

The torchbearers carried the Olympic Flame through Calgary, Canada, on January
18-19, 2010 as it made its way to Vancouver and the Opening Ceremony for the
2010 Olympic Winter Games on February 12, 2010. The relay, presented by
Coca-Cola, will last for 100 days, cover more than 27,000 miles (45,000
kilometers) and link more than 1,000 communities and places of interest across
Canada.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - For decades, two names have dominated the $4 trillion world of commodity and energy derivatives trading: Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. If Wall Street power woman Blythe Masters has her way, a third will soon be making it a troika: JP Morgan .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former credit derivatives wunderkind who has built JP Morgan's commodities business into a true global powerhouse in just 3 years is on the cusp of buying RBS Sempra Commodities for an estimated $4 billion, bringing an unusual but highly successful hybrid trading operation -- one that carefully mixes customer-flow business with prop-trading risk -- under the well-capitalized JP Morgan umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spoils appear to suit JP Morgan to a T:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* One of the three biggest U.S. gas and power trading desks, a unit that not only survived but thrived through the darkest Enron days to generate about two-thirds of RBS Sempra's profits; it adds a Connecticut-based, fund-like complement to the more customer-oriented Houston gas trading team she inherited with the Bear Stearns acquisition in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The biggest and one of the most successful physical base metals trading and broking shops ever, the London-based enterprise that was once Metallgesellschaft, including the massive worldwide warehousing company Henry Bath, addressing one of the bank's weakest spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* And a global oil team with a decade of experience trading physical crude oil cargoes and diesel barges, markets in which JP Morgan has only begun to dabble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be a career-crowning coup for British-born Masters, at 40 one of the most successful women on Wall Street and famed as one of the original creators of credit default swaps in the 1990s. It would add RBS Sempra's over 1,000 traders, marketers and operators to her 500-person operation, which by last year had already eclipsed Morgan Stanley's commodities division in terms of personnel, industry sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the victory could yet prove a hollow one at a time when U.S. futures regulators are moving to limit big energy positions and U.S. President Barack Obama has moved to ban banks from proprietary trading, last week's broadside against the sector that could yet shade the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting aside the policy risks, Masters must win the loyalty of traders who helped the company notch up 32 consecutive quarters of profits from 1997, earning Sempra Energy nearly $3 billion over 12 years, but who are now increasingly disappointed or disillusioned with working for a bank, multiple sources close to the company and its traders have told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although both operations are built largely around selling or buying directly with customers, a type of trade that would be excluded from Obama's as-yet vague crack down, JP Morgan still wagers more than $30 million a day of its own money on commodity markets, more than Morgan Stanley, and RBS Sempra's Value at Risk has expanded since RBS bought in, data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They could make the mistake of forgetting they've got real rainmakers on the desk, not pay them well, and watch them take off," says industry consultant John D'Agostino, a former NYMEX official and energy hedge fund manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masters will have to woo them without the aid of the four partners who built the RBS Sempra business over nearly three decades, from its early inception at Drexel Burnham Lambert and AIG through its sale to the UK government-owned bank last year, all of whom have departed in the past two years; a number of traders have followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And she'll have to integrate Sempra's disparate units -- power and gas in Stamford, Connecticut; metals in London; oil with a strong base in Geneva -- which have always operated with relative autonomy. While they had a "Wall Street style of trading", as Sempra Energy's Chief Financial Officer Mark Snell said in 2007, it wasn't a Wall Street style of management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having hired people out of Sempra during RBS, what unanimously they say is that what made Sempra special is how things were done -- the process, direct access to management, etc. Within a bank, what you have is a completely different process," said one senior trader at a competing company, who asked not to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've not only lost management, they lost a lot of traders. The question is: did they build a big enough infrastructure that traders are less key?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FROM DREXEL TO AIG TO SEMPRA TO RBS TO...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal pairs the most aggressive up-and-comer in the commodities sphere with a relatively mature franchise, one that made its name with some big bets on China, clever recruiting and an uncanny knack of building on the back of failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masters, a Cambridge-educated derivatives expert and avid amateur horse rider, was drafted into commodities from the Chief Financial Officer role in early 2007 after JP Morgan's first major foray into energy markets went awry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having assembled a team of heavy hitters in the natural gas market around 2005, the bank had been on a risk-taking roller-coaster, with its commodities VaR surging to a one-day peak of $128 million in 2006, more than treble the year's max for its foreign exchange trading, according to SEC filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some key staff changes, she expanded both organically and opportunistically, snapping up UBS's global agricultural markets and Canadian commodities businesses in late 2008, as well as broker MF Global's sugar book, quickly making up for the bank's relatively late start in a booming sector where the likes of Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank had been building up their desks since early this decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sempra, by contrast, has much deeper origins. In early 1990, an aggressive insurer called AIG decided to start an energy trading operation by snatching up 150 of the best traders from the large physical energy business of the once-powerful brokerage holding company Drexel Burnham Lambert, which had filed for bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was there that David Messer and Frank Gallipoli, widely seen as the strategic visionaries of the company, began to plot their rise, together with a band of traders, some of whom had been together since 1982.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two others were instrumental: Steven Prince, a Drexel alum who kept things running smoothly as the main front man and back-office wizard; and Todd Esse, who joined in 1994 as the rainmaker natural gas trader whose earnings were said to have been used as the main metric for valuing the company when Sempra bought it in 1997 for $225 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Enova Corporation and Pacific Enterprises (PE) were joining forces to become a mighty southern California power utility, but executives saw the need to be more than passive price-takers -- to prosper, they would need to better understand the markets for oil and gas, the fuels that fired their plants and global economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also saw an opportunity to juice up profits from an otherwise dull, heavily regulated utility business, and eagerly fostered the development of the disparate group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"David and I used to travel around the country trying to convince people to do business with us. And at that point in time, we were making no money at all, and David Messer would never shine his shoes," Donald Felsinger, Sempra Energy's chief executive, told a conference call last March. "The soles had holes in the bottom of them. And I can remember telling David, you know, we have to look like we're making money, so, fix it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a familiar refrain for a scrappy company that was consistently more agile than most of its peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So eager was it to get its European energy desk off the ground in early 1999 that Sempra's first offices were in a disaster recovery site rented above the famed Club Aquarium in London's Old Street, where business practically came to a halt after 6pm as the bass track drowned out conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002, they picked up the metals division from a failing Enron for just $145 million, including veteran traders who had built the Metallgesellschaft franchise in the 1990s into the biggest London Metals Exchange ring dealer; Enron had bought the UK-listed MG two years earlier for $448 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were good at identifying talent, then good at giving people a free hand. They weren't trying to second-guess you," says Daniel Jaeggi, a former Sempra oil trader who was poached from Phibro in 1998 to set up its first oil desk. He and long-time collaborator Marco Dunand left in 2004 to help found Mercuria, now a top five independent oil trading house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VICTIM OF OWN SUCCESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of their most notable moments revolve around China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2002, the small Geneva-based crude oil trading team nearly cornered the market in benchmark Brent crude in what was seen as a highly successful if controversial trading play; halfway through the month, the mystery of what they would do with the oil was revealed as a flotilla of tankers were chartered to China, where they had agreed on a massive sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not always so fortuitous. In 2005, a rogue trader for China's State Reserves Bureau ran up massive losses on what was said to be an unauthorized short position on copper; Sempra was the biggest broker in the deal, the China Securities Journal reported. That same year Sempra's metals division suffered a nearly three-quarters collapse in its trading margin, according to SEC filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite sometimes mixed results, Sempra's traders logged an all-but unparalleled decade of consecutive quarterly profits. Ultimately, the unit became a victim of its own success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2005, Sempra Commodities contributed more than half the parent company's net income of $920 million; it made over half a billion dollars in 2007. Its trading margin had trebled to over $1.5 billion in just five years, with two-thirds of that in natural gas and power, nearly a fifth in metals and 12 percent in oil, according to SEC filings for the last year it operated solely under Sempra. Three-quarters of its margin was still generated in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only was it consuming ever-increasing amounts of capital as commodity prices exploded, its volatile and increasingly large earnings component was a frustrating sell to shareholders, many of whom still thought they were investing in a conservative, dependable utility company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale to RBS allowed Sempra to keep 49 percent of the earnings while relieving itself of much of the capital burden. JP Morgan is unlikely to want to share the spoils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO'S LEFT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By most accounts, Masters won't have much of a battle for leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd Esse, whose star never shined quite as brightly after his relocation to set up the moribund London gas and power unit in the late 1990s, left to start a Connecticut-based hedge fund in 2008. Steven Prince's retirement had been announced at the time of the RBS acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallipoli left nearly a year later. Messer, a well-known art collector with a predilection for controversial BritArt, was the last to leave, with a note saying, in effect, "gone fishing". Both were said to have been put off by the prospect of curtailed pay packages at a bank-run operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Hutchinson, a Metallgesellschaft veteran and towering figure in the tight-knit London metals market for four decades, also stepped down last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relative newcomers now mind the shop.

&lt;p&gt;The European Union should update its laws to better suit cloud computing, Microsoft's top lawyer urged in Brussels Tuesday.Laws covering data protection and data retention go back to the mid-1990s and need to be revised to take into account the massive and constant flow of data between users' computers and multiple cloud servers that can be located anywhere in the world, Microsoft head legal counsel Brad Smith said in a speech.The existing E.U. laws "are starting to show their age," he told students, E.U. officials and industry executives.The data retention law passed in 2006, when cloud computing was mostly limited to online e-mail accounts, calls on the 27 E.U. member states to each set their own length of time for the retention of data, between six and 24 months. Under the directive authorities can request access to details such as IP address and time of use of every e-mail, phone call and text message sent or received. A request to access the information can be done only with a court order. Smith said countries have chosen widely varying retention times. A subscriber to cloud services in, say, Italy, with a relatively short data retention regime, may see their data stored in Ireland, with one of the longest retention times. The discrepancy makes compliance by telecom and cloud services companies complicated, Smith said.He urged the E.U. to change the law, either by setting a standard length for retention time, such as a year for all E.U. member states, or by applying mutual recognition principles, so that each country applies the retention time of the country where the user's data is being stored.Greater harmonization is needed in the 1995 data protection directive too, Smith said. "At the time it was passed, data moved location occasionally. In the cloud it is constantly moving," he said.While technology and its uses have moved on since 1995, the importance of privacy hasn't changed, Smith said. And in a thinly veiled attack on Microsoft rival Google, he added:  "Some firms based on the West Coast (of the U.S.) don't think privacy is so important. I disagree. The right to privacy is the right to choose who sees your information and it is as important now as it was 15 years ago."Data transfers are global, and while Smith acknowledged that a global data protection treaty is unlikely in the near future, he suggested that trading partners including the U.S. and E.U. should try to forge an agreement similar to the bilateral free trade agreements they both sign up to in other commercial fields.His final piece of advice for E.U. lawmakers concerned broadband access to the Internet &#8211; a prerequisite if cloud computing is to take off in the way many people predict it will in the coming years."Governments need to consider how to enhance broadband, both wired and wireless," Smith said. For wireless connections, he urged the E.U. to free up more radio spectrum for services that run in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An antiquated computer system which crashes and idles thousands of workers is "frankly embarrassing," says U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Director David Kappos, a former International Business Machines executive who estimates it would take several hundred million dollars to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the agency, which Kappos took over in April, has other woes, including a budget shortfall that is making it hard to hire enough examiners now that patent activity is picking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent office takes an average of 34.6 months to approve or reject a patent application -- a maddening length of time for fast-moving technology firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent office is in financial trouble in terms of day-to-day spending, facing a potential $200-million shortfall for the 2010 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies slashed their budgets in the recession by abandoning patents, depriving the office of additional payments to evaluate applications or maintain existing patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the shortfall, Kappos wants Congress to give him authority to impose a 15 percent surcharge on applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kappos says the "antiquated" computer system was his biggest shock after years overseeing IBM's patent portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I never remember (at IBM) having my IT person barge into my office to tell me that nearly 10,000 people suddenly had nothing to do because the computer system shut down," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation frustrates patent examiners, who are required to fulfill quotas and are very aware of the backlog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kappos quoted an email from an examiner who was fed up with the computer crashes and was giving up for the day. "'I've now lost my second search that I was in the middle of doing. I have spent hours on trying to get this search work done and every time I get two-thirds of the way through, my computer crashes on me'." Kappos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUDGET MATTERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kappos predicted it would take several years and "multiple hundreds of millions of dollars" to upgrade a computer system that innovative industries -- everybody from Microsoft to drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline -- depend on to help safeguard their intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration will send its fiscal 2011 budget plan for the patent office and the rest of the federal government to Congress on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under complicated funding rules, the fee-funded patent office budget was set by Congress at $1.887 billion for fiscal 2010, significantly less than last year. That figure reflected estimates the patent office gave to Congress when fee inflows were at their lowest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, Congress sets the patent office budget at the same amount as the agency's expected intake, plus a cushion of $100 million. But Congress cut the cushion for fiscal 2010, which ends on September 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patent applications and fees have since picked up, but because of how the rules work, the patent office must process the additional applications while the collected fees go elsewhere in the federal government's budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patent holders and applicants support Kappos' requested surcharge, said Q. Todd Dickinson, a former patent office director who is now head of the American Intellectual Property Law Association. "But the opportunity to divert those fees has to be closed off," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Kappos and Dickinson hope Congress will soon take up long-stalled patent reform legislation, which would give the office fee-setting authority. Jon Dudas, who headed the patent office during the Bush administration and is now with law firm Foley and Lardner LLP, also favors the reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEWER EXAMINERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One result of the funding shortfall is that the office cannot replace the 30 to 40 patent examiners who quit each month out of an examiner corps of around 7,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The budget shortfall is affecting the patent office's ability to hire new examiners which the patent office needs if they want to eat into the backlog," said Barry Bretschneider of the law firm Morrison Foerster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kappos, meanwhile, has pushed to change how examiners work in hopes of getting quicker decisions. U.S. examiners are urged to use research done by counterparts in other countries to help make faster decisions, and encouraged to telephone patent seekers' attorneys to iron out problems more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kappos warned, however, that there was only so much he could do without more funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The agency is going to shrink in size and there's just no possible way that any efficiencies that I can put together as the leader can overcome ... the agency shrinking like that," he said. "The backlog will grow because the agency is shrinking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a day before Oracle announces its intentions vis-&#224;-vis its newly acquired Sun Microsystems technologies, IBM plans on Tuesday to expand efforts to help migrate Sun users to Big Blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers at IBM have built new software tools to automate many of the manual processes to help accelerate Sun migrations, IBM said. The software identifies Sun assets, provisions the target IBM environment, and streamlines workload transitions. Migrations can be made from Sun Solaris to Linux or IBM AIX. Applications and middleware also can be moved to IBM systems. The methodology employed by the software shortens provisioning times from weeks to days for some clients, according to IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Last year, InfoWorld reported on how Oracle CEO Larry Ellison is upbeat about Sun's bread-and-butter Java technology. ] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle on Wednesday will unveil its strategy for leveraging its Sun-developed technologies. The European Union, which had objected to the merger, gave its blessing last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its launch four years ago, IBM's Migration Factory program has resulted in nearly 2,200 companies switching from to IBM systems and storage from Sun and HP, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "IBM steps up Sun conversion program," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

2010 Bank Failures Tally Reaches 9

The failure of Charter Bank is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund about
$201.9 million, Columbia River Bank is expected to cost about $172.5 million,
Premier American Bank is expected to cost about $85 million, Evergreen Bank is
expected to cost about $64.2 million and Bank of Leeton is estimated to cost
about $8.1 million. 

Tacoma, Washington-based Columbia State Bank will assume the deposits and assets
of Columbia River Bank. The FDIC has agreed to share losses with Columbia State
Bank on $697.4 million of Columbia River Bank`s loans and other assets. Plano,
Texas-based Beal Financial Corp. agreed to buy the deposits and assets of
Charter Bank. FDIC will share losses with Beal Financial on $805.5 million of
the Charter Bank's loans and other assets. Roseburg, Oregon-based Umpqua Bank
will assume the deposits and assets of Evergreen Bank. The FDIC will share
losses with Umpqua Bank on $379.5 million of Evergreen Bank`s loans and other
assets. Sunflower Bank, based in Salina, Kan., will assume the deposits of Bank
of Leeton. 

Bank failures started this year with the failure of Bellingham, Washington-based
Horizon Bank. Washington Federal Inc. (Nasdaq: WFSL) will assume all of the
deposits of Horizon Bank. Increasing loan losses on commercial real estate are
expected to cause hundreds more bank failures in the next few years. The FDIC
anticipates bank failures to cost about $100 billion over the next three years.
The failure of Washington Mutual in 2008 was the largest in U.S. banking
history. It was acquired by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). The other major
acquirers of failed institutions since 2008 include PNC Financial (NYSE: PNC),
BB Corporation (NYSE: BBT) and Regions Financial (NYSE: RF). Though current
signals indicate that the economy may stabilize, we expect loan losses on
commercial real estate portfolio to remain high for banks that hold large
amounts of high-risk loans.

&lt;p&gt;http://www.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Research Equity Strategist, Dirk Van Dijk says that S 500 earnings are
continuing to show red ink. He tracks companies on the Zacks.com web site,
naming names, while forecasting trends for the months ahead. 

Earnings Explode from Low Base

By raw count, firms with rising EPS year over year outnumber decliners by a 3:2
margin. Sequentially, it has not been as profitable a quarter as the third
quarter was, with total net income in the 4th quarter reported so far down 9.65%
from what those same firms reported in the 3rd quarter. Still, the numbers are
coming in better than expected, with a median surprise of 6.38% (about double
normal). 

The surprise ratio is also quite positive, with 69 positive surprises versus
only 18 disappointments, but that 3.83 ratio is well below the stellar results
of the 3rd quarter. Results are still very preliminary, with fewer than one in
five reports in, and not all sectors report at the same rate. 

The sectors with the highest median surprises have only a handful of reports in,
so those medians are likely to change (fall?) significantly by the time all the
reports are in. The Tech sector, however, is looking very strong, and has more
than just a handful of reports in. It has seen 16 positive surprises and only a
single disappointment, with a median surprise of 8.03%. 

In Tech, the sector continues to be led by the microchip stocks, most notably
Intel (Nasdaq: INTC), Linear Technologies (Nasdaq: LLTC) and Micron Technology
(NYSE: MU). Also within the sector and worthy of mentioning is strength in some
of the bigger and more well-known firms in the sector, including Apple (Nasdaq:
AAPL) and Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT).

how to provide US employment opportunities for the services we deliver to GE.
This agreement and, more importantly the strength of our relationship, position
us well to grow with GE for many years."

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is expected to report a strong jump in quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by the successful launch of Windows 7, but it may not be enough to satisfy demanding investors and push its stock higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM, Google Inc and Apple Inc have all beaten average Wall Street estimates this quarter, but saw their stocks fall or gain only slightly afterward as investors looked for more indications of strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, that could mean showing evidence that companies are starting to -- or getting ready to -- buy personal computers after holding off on technology spending in the turbulent economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Microsoft probably did OK, but I want to hear the commentary looking forward on that area," said Kim Caughey, analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which holds Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The so-called "refresh cycle", where Microsoft's major customers get around to buying new hardware and upgrading software, is "at the very beginning," said Caughey. "The second half of this year -- that's when we'll see a meaningful uptick in businesses buying new hardware."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is expecting Microsoft to report profit of 59 cents per share for its fiscal second quarter, up from 41 cents per share a year earlier, and revenue to rise 7 percent to $17.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales will be boosted by the Windows 7 operating system, which was launched last October, and the one-time deferral of some Windows revenue from last quarter related to Microsoft's free upgrade program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from Thomson Reuters StarMine, which places more weight on recent forecasts by top-rated analysts, is almost identical to the Wall Street average, suggesting a surprise is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except for last quarter, when Microsoft smashed the average EPS estimate by 8 cents, analysts have been quite accurate in predicting its results with average forecasts within 2 cents of the reported number for five of the last six quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC SALES REBOUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs of a turnaround in the PC industry are apparent. PC sales rose 15.2 percent in the last quarter of 2009, according to IDC, making up for declines earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers powered the gains, rushing to buy new laptops and netbooks at bargain prices from the likes of Hewlett-Packard Co, Acer Inc and Dell Inc over the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question for Microsoft investors is when commercial PC buyers will follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Business spending will take more time to take hold, as commercial entities wait for tangible signs of sustained economic growth before launching a new refresh cycle," IDC said in its cautious forecast earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is in a good position to capitalize on business spending, when it finally materializes, with a new version of its massively profitable Office suite of applications due out this year, along with new database and server software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopes for that, along with optimism over Windows 7, new technology for the Xbox gaming system, and steady gains by its Bing search engine, have helped push Microsoft's stock up 66 percent in the last 12 months, outstripping the Nasdaq composite index's 48 percent gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question now is how much more upside Microsoft has to deliver. Its stock is now trading around 16 times analysts' estimates for fiscal 2010 profit, compared to the Nasdaq composite index's 16.5 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney has teamed with Common Sense Media to help kids and tweens safely
navigate the internet and other digital platforms and to get parents thinking
about how media and technology fit into their family's life. The initiative
includes a PSA and website which feature the characters from Disney's hit
animated series "Phineas and Ferb" and supports Common Sense Media's "Rules of
the Road" for smart and safe use of digital media. The tips include guarding
privacy and protecting one's identity while online, balancing time spent in
cyberspace and thinking before texting or posting material online. 

Editors please note: To view the PSA please click here; for images please visit
www.disneyxdmedianet.com. Registration Required.

The PSA will premiere WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 27 (8:00 p.m., ET/PT) on Disney Channel
and Disney XD and will air in daily rotation on both channels. The companion
website created by Disney Online, www.disney.com/commonsense, includes the PSA
and a guide for parents to teach responsible online behavior. The website
invites kids to test their parents' familiarity with the Rules of the Road and
leads to additional information on internet and digital platform safety for both
kids and parents. 

This week in Washington, D.C., Common Sense Media will showcase the PSA at the
6th Annual State of the Net Conference, a widely attended event hosted by the
Congressional Internet Caucus Advisory Committee (ICAC), a private sector
organization comprising public interest groups, trade associations, nonprofits
and industry leaders. 

Gary Marsh, president, Entertainment and Chief Creative Officer, Disney Channels
Worldwide, said: "We have a tremendous opportunity to deliver information to
kids about online safety - using their favorite characters as spokespeople.
Simultaneously, the tools we're providing - the PSA and the website - also serve
as useful conversation starters for parents." He continued, "Beyond these
immediate tools, we're committed to encouraging the writers of our series and
movies to include the subject matter in their scripts, and to support the Rules
of the Road messaging through positive role modeling in our programs." 

Anne Zehren, President and Chief Operating Officer of Common Sense Media, said:
"Kids are spending more and more time with media and technology - more than 10
hours a day. Working with Disney gives us the opportunity to speak directly to
kids about how the digital world works so they can harness the positive and
avoid the pitfalls of digital life, and really take advantage of all that
technology has to offer. 

We are thrilled to be partnering with Disney Channel on this PSA, which will not
only provide both parents and kids with great information, easy tips and fun
tools to learn about online safety, but will also encourage families to talk
about these issues together." 

In the U.S., the Emmy Award-nominated "Phineas and Ferb" has ranked as the #1
animated series among Kids 6-14 for two consecutive years. It airs on Disney XD
and Disney Channels in more than 135 countries and in 26 languages around the
world. 

Created and executive-produced by Dan Povenmire and Jeff "Swampy" Marsh, the
series is a production of Disney Television Animation. The voice cast include:
Vincent Martella, Thomas Sangster, Ashley Tisdale, Mitchel Musso, Caroline Rhea,
Richard O'Brien, Dee Bradley Baker and Alyson Stoner.

&lt;p&gt; * Offsets recent retirement plan losses for Fidelity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * GE spokeswoman cites added services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Jan 26 (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) said
on Tuesday it recently hired Fidelity Investments to run a
major retirement savings plan, a contract that offsets two
recent losses in the same market for the mutual fund firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GE spokeswoman Susan Bishop said that effective Dec. 1 the
largest U.S. conglomerate hired Boston-based Fidelity to
administer and do recordkeeping for the company's main 401(k)
plan. It had $15.8 billion of assets under management as of the
end of 2008, the most recent figure available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GE had previously handled most of its 401(k) administration
internally and will continue to manage assets in the plan,
which covers some 245,000 employees and retirees, Bishop said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fidelity is the largest administrator of so-called
"defined-contribution" retirement plans like 401(k)s, a sector
that faces growing competition and regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters reported on Monday that Fidelity recently lost
contracts to run similar defined-contribution retirement plans
for Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for Fidelity previously confirmed a major
contract win but declined to name the client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Fidelity, picking up GE's business marks a contrast
with the other plans shifts. For instance, Ford cited the lower
costs it obtained by dropping Fidelity, a sign of rising cost
pressure in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Bishop, the GE spokeswoman, said its main consideration
in hiring Fidelity was not price but to offer more consulting
services to plan participants.

&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft Corp. announced earlier this month that it would eliminate upgrade versions of Office 2010, the early reaction was: uh oh, the application suite just got a lot more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is more complex, especially in light of the increasing heat put on Microsoft's super-profitable suite by its competition -- that OpenOffice.org, IBM Lotus Symphony, Zoho Office and Google Docs. So the question of who wins and who loses from Microsoft Office 2010's is a bit more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A compilation of winners and losers by Computerworld follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loser: cash-strapped enterprises . Amy Konary, IDC's software pricing whiz says that two words explain Microsoft's decision to eliminate upgrade pricing -- Software Assurance, or SA. Some companies were saving coin by avoiding Microsoft's pricey software maintenance contract and buying lower-level Open or Select licenses for Microsoft Office. Neither Open nor Select icenses require that companies to buy SA, which grants upgrade rights but nearly doubles the cost for volume licensing customers. Eliminating upgrades makes SA a near-requirement for companies that don't want to fall behind on Office releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loser: consumers loyal to Microsoft Office . Many consumers are getting by just using a decade-old version of Office, or using a free alternative such as Google Docs. Microsoft is offering two alternatives to get back those users. The first, Office Starter 2010 replaces Microsoft Works, which had long been a non-starter mostly because of lingering document format issues. The new hosted Office Web Apps offering, meanwhile, is aimed straight at Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But both Office Starter and Office Web Apps could prove a tad feature-lite for users accustomed to Office's buffet menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And home/small business users who still upgrade Office on a (semi-)regular basis are getting no favors from Microsoft. The full Home  Student edition, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote, still costs $149 (2 installs), though users can opt for the new Product Key Card that can be purchased for $119 at electronics retailers like Best Buy. Like the upgrade, it offers rights for one installation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winner: small business . Many small businesses have been defecting from Office. Microsoft "can't let that continue," said Paul DeGroot, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft. "If the small business trend catches on with larger businesses, it would very serious consequences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, Microsoft is cutting the price of the full Home and Business edition -- which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Outlook -- to $279, matching the upgrade price of Office 2007's Small Business edition (which, in addition to those 5 apps above, includes Microsoft Publisher) and nearly hitting the $239 upgrade price for Office Standard 2007. A one-license key card will be $199, or 30% off the upgrade price (upgrades only affect 1 PC, too).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if that's still too much? Well then, you can search Microsoft's various recession-busting resources,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winner: students (and their loved ones) . Kids, stay in school! If only so you can get your friends, guardians and relatives a copy of the new Professional Academic version of Office 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available to K-12 and college students, staff and faculty, the $99 Professional Academic version includes 7 apps -- Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, Publisher and Access -- that can be installed on up to two PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, the cost for students to get all of the same apps by buying Microsoft Office 2007 Professional and OneNote 2007 is $250, which allows installation on only one PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$250 isn't chump change for college students more interested in beer than productivity software. So Microsoft pushed aggressive discounts like this one to students at targeted times (back-to-school, or end-of-school/graduation). Those promotions were also noteworthy in showing how lax Microsoft was about enforcing current student status, i.e. those who'd just attended their 30-year reunion but also had an alumni e-mail address could qualify, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loser: Office power users at smaller firms . Office Professional 2010 includes the same 7 apps as the Professional Academic version. Its full price remains unchanged at $499. Cutting the $329 upgrade "will hurt a bit here," says DeGroot, since the key card costs $349.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeGroot's advice is for small-to-mid-sized businesses to "go with Home and Business as their standard and buy Professional for the few people in their org who need Access and Publisher."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winner: Best Buy . The big-box retailer is one of Microsoft's best partners. Killing the boxed upgrade version of Office could've hurt Best Buy and other electronics retailers, who depend heavily on foot traffic generated by software to fuel other purchases (according to Microsoft, Office 2007 Home and Student is the single most-popular PC title among U.S. retailers in the last two years). While interest in boxed software is on a long-term decline, Microsoft is trying its hardest to prop it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individual license product keys that replace upgrade editions of Office can only be purchased via "major electronic retail outlets." This will keep the Best Buy's Geek Squad as well other brick-and-mortar types like OfficeMax and Target in the game, though the cards will likely be available via Amazon.com and NewEgg.com, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winners: Google Docs, IBM Lotus Symphony, Zoho Office and OpenOffice.org. While Microsoft is certainly taking steps to retain users via free editions such as Office Starter and Office Web Apps, its failure to cut Office's prices across the board could "push some users off Office completely," says Konary. The experimentation with Google Docs and others has already picked up, according to IDC stats, which show the app "widely used" at one in five workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Lai covers Windows and Linux, desktop applications, databases and business intelligence for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Charges of Intimidation as Corporate Executives "Freak Out" at Houston Marathon
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Chevron is facing charges that its aggressive defense of a $27 billion
environmental liability in Ecuador is crossing the line into violating the free
speech rights of its critics in the U.S., according to news reports and publicly
available court filings. 

Legal papers filed earlier this month in federal court in San Francisco accuse
Chevron of trying to create a "chilling effect" by using lawsuits to silence
critics of its misconduct in violation of free speech rights guaranteed by the
Constitution. Chevron is accused of orchestrating the ejection by the City of
Houston of runners from the Houston Marathon Expo Center - where the oil giant
was the main sponsor - because the runners wanted to call attention to human
rights problems in Ecuador that are the subject of the lawsuit. 

"The tactics Chevron is now using have gone beyond what is reasonable in a
litigation context and are clearly meant to intimidate its opponents into
silence, implicating Constitutional rights in the process," said Laura Garr, an
American advisor to the Amazonian communities. 

In Houston, Chevron attracted unwanted headlines earlier this month when members
of a team of runners from the Rainforest Action Network participating in the
Chevron Houston Marathon were forcibly removed from the marathon`s Expo. The
runners had paid for a table to distribute "I`m Running for Human Rights"
stickers and information about Chevron`s refusal to clean up the environmental
disaster in Ecuador, where a lawsuit accuses the company of dumping billions of
gallons of toxic waste into the rainforest to cut costs. 

Steven Karpas, director of the marathon, told the runners from RAN that "higher
ups at Chevron are freaking out" and threatened to arrest them if they didn`t
leave. Police then ejected the runners from the city-owned and operated building
for exercising their right to free speech, giving rise to First Amendment claims
against both the city of Houston and Chevron, according to RAN. 

The ejection received wide coverage in the Houston media. 

"It is a sad day when the Chevron Houston Marathon - which raises awareness and
money for many important causes - would deny the legal rights of participants to
appease a corporate sponsor that is clearly ashamed of its human rights record,"
said Maria Ramos, one of the RAN runners. 

In San Francisco, the separate, legal case accuses Chevron of violating a
California law that prevents corporations from threatening lawsuits to silence
its critics. The case was brought by a lawyer, Cristobal Bonifaz, who has been a
longtime critic of Chevron`s malfeasance in Ecuador and who was once involved in
the underlying environmental litigation in that country. 

The California law, called an anti-SLAPP statute, is intended to prevent SLAPP
(Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) lawsuits brought to censor,
intimidate and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of defending a
frivolous lawsuit until they abandon their criticism. It has been used on over
200 occasions since its inception in 1993. 

Bonifaz, a 75-year old semi-retired attorney who works as a sole practitioner on
his farm in Massachusetts, was responding to a Chevron lawsuit against him for
"malicious prosecution" for bringing an unrelated case against the company on
behalf of seven individuals who claimed that had cancer due to contamination
caused by the company. Bonifaz later withdrew his claims when it turned out
medical records did not support the claims, blaming an Ecuadorian paralegal for
the problem. 

The case against Bonifaz was brought on Chevron`s behalf by Gibson Dunn &amp;
Crutcher, a law firm that prides itself on using scorched-earth litigation
tactics to represent large corporations and is now facing charges that is being
used by Chevron as a sort of "legal goon squad" to intimidate critics of the
company`s Ecuador problem. 

In the underlying environmental case in Ecuador, Chevron is charged with
deliberately dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste when it operated several
large oil fields in Ecuador's Amazon from 1964 to 1990, decimating indigenous
groups and causing a spike in cancer rates and other oil-related diseases. A
court-appointed Special Master in Ecuador, where the trial is being held at
Chevron`s request, found 1,401 excess cancer deaths due to the contamination and
pegged damages at $27.3 billion. 

A final judgment is expected this year. 

Using lawsuits to intimidate its detractors is just one component of Chevron`s
overall strategy. The company also is using six public relations firms and
numerous lobbyists in the U.S. to try to minimize fallout over the Ecuador
problem, but with little success given negative reports on 60 Minutes and
various political setbacks for Chevron in the Congress. 

"It appears to us that Chevron has no clear strategy to extricate itself from a
problem that grows more threatening by the day," said Garr. "As a result, it is
now trying to intimidate its critics into silence. Ultimately, whether these
tactics violate the Constitution will be determined by the courts."

&lt;p&gt;ST. LOUIS--(Business Wire)--
Tripos&#174;, a leading provider of drug discovery informatics products and services,

Morgan Partner to Expand Financial Literacy and Improve Personal Finance, Math, and Economics for US Students</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Volunteers Contribute Time and Talent to Extend the Benefits of
SIFMA Foundation`s The Stock Market Game Program 
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) Foundation
today announced a partnership with J.P. Morgan to help students of all
backgrounds better understand the dynamics of a global economy and improve their
core academic skills. 

J.P. Morgan employees will bring classroom learning to life for SIFMA
Foundation`s Stock Market Game students by visiting public schools in New York,
Illinois, Indiana, and California. They will act as judges for InvestWrite, a
national financial essay competition for students in grades 4 -12. The firm will
also host school visits to its trading floor in New York City and offer the
student visitors a career prep seminar on resume writing, presentation skills
and teamwork. 

Participating schools are those using SIFMA Foundation`s Stock Market Game
program, which enables students to experience the financial markets in the
classroom as they learn math, economics, and social studies. Widely considered
one of the best school supports for financial education, SMG has students team
up to invest and manage a hypothetical $100,000 in stocks, bonds and mutual
funds. Correlating to education standards in all 50 states, SMG reaches 750,000
students each year with lessons about financial, economic and world events,
practice in online research, and an exploration of long-term saving and
investing scenarios in SMG`s national essay competition, InvestWrite. 

According to Melanie Mortimer, executive director, SIFMA Foundation, J.P. Morgan
extends the benefits of the Stock Market Game program by introducing students to
seasoned financial professionals and the inner workings of a company. "SIFMA
Foundation`s partnership with J.P. Morgan delivers invaluable returns for our
students, including learning directly from the experts about the global
marketplace, witnessing first-hand how a company functions, and meeting role
models," she said. "We are grateful for the generosity of J.P. Morgan employee
volunteers who contribute their time and talent to help advance students`
knowledge, skills and positive educational experiences." 

"It has been terrific to see so many employees get involved in helping students
better understand the financial markets," said Blythe Masters, head of Global
Commodities at J.P. Morgan and Chair Emeritus of SIFMA. "The time we are
spending with them is extremely rewarding and we`re proud to be partnering with
SIFMA on such a valuable initiative." 

The events began in December with a trading floor visit and a school visit in
New York City. Events continue in January when a class of eighth grade students
from New York I.S. 131, located in Chinatown, will travel to the J.P. Morgan
midtown Manhattan office for a tour of the trading floor and employee-led
discussions. 

Earlier this year Learning Point Associates, in conjunction with the FINRA
Foundation for Investor Education, announced the results of a nationwide survey
examining the impact of the SIFMA Foundation`s Stock Market Game. They found
that Stock Market Game students scored considerably higher in math and investor
knowledge compared with students who did not participate, and teachers`
financial behavior also changed for the better as a result of teaching The Stock
Market Game. 

The SIFMA Foundation is dedicated to fostering knowledge and understanding of
the financial markets for individuals of all backgrounds. Drawing on the support
and expertise of the financial industry, the SIFMA Foundation provides financial
education programs and tools that strengthen economic opportunities across
communities and increase individuals` access to the benefits of the global
marketplace. Notable Foundation programs include the Stock Market Game, which
has served more than 12 million students since it began in 1977, the InvestWrite
national essay competition, and the Capitol Hill Challenge, as well as
educational websites such as Tomorrow`s Money and Path to Investing. For more
information on the SIFMA Foundation, visit www.sifma.org/education.

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), through an Australian subsidiary, today

capabilities in the region and helps demonstrate the significance of Australia
to Chevron's energy portfolio," said George Kirkland, vice chairman, Chevron. 

Jim Blackwell, president, Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production Co.
added, "This discovery adds to the growth of our natural gas business in
Australia. We plan a robust program of exploration, appraisal and seismic
programs in Australia in 2010."

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Jan 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Information Builders, an independent leader in  business intelligence
(BI)  solutions, today announced WebFOCUS(R) for IBM System z Data
Warehousing, a  specialized edition of the WebFOCUS System z product
line. It is designed  to offer a powerful, flexible, secure, and
cost-effective tool for System z  users interested in implementing
enterprise-scale data  warehousing and BI solutions while leveraging IBM
native z/OS and zIIP  specialty engine capabilities.

    This offering complements IBM's Solution Edition for Data Warehousing to 
deliver a solid foundation for business intelligence workloads.

    With thousands of new devices being connected to the Internet daily, 
enterprises continue to face challenges in on-demand computing, while the 
need for real-time information has become mission critical. WebFOCUS for 
System z Data Warehousing enables large enterprise customers to scale
data  warehousing and reporting solutions to quickly and easily meet the
needs of  an unlimited number of end users with existing System z
infrastructure --  at a fraction of the cost of traditional distribution
systems.

    "In today's business environment, IT organizations want to leverage their 
investments in existing infrastructure when implementing solutions," said 
Gerald Cohen, president and CEO of Information Builders. "WebFOCUS for 
System z Data Warehousing provides large-scale IBM customers, with a 
significant investment in z/OS operating systems, solutions to implement 
data warehousing and business intelligence applications, avoiding the 
complexity and incremental hardware, software, and operational
investments  associated with distributed systems or dual-operating
systems  environments."

    When responding to information-on-demand challenges, data warehousing and 
reporting in any industry needs to scale reliably and be implemented cost 
effectively. WebFOCUS for System z Data Warehousing delivers on both 
accounts, providing users unparalleled reliability and scalability, while 
significantly lowering the total cost of ownership.

    WebFOCUS for System z Data Warehousing is a comprehensive suite of fully 
integrated implementation software products, which enable users of IBM's 
System z Solution Edition for Data Warehousing to design, build, deploy, 
and manage DB2-based enterprise data warehouses and BI applications at a 
fraction of the acquisition and operational costs. Users will also
benefit  from substantially lower total cost of ownership than comparable 
distributed systems or dual-operating environment solutions.

    WebFOCUS for System z Data Warehousing is comprised of two, fully 
integrated software components: Data Loader for DB2 and Data Reporter for 
DB2.

    Data Loader for DB2 is a specialized version of iWay Software's
z/OS-based 

    DataMigrator product, designed for optimal loading and management of  IBM
DB2 database data synchronization processes. Data Loader enables data 
warehouse implementers to load and synchronize DB2-based data warehouses
on  a batch, near real-time, or event-driven basis using more than 200
widely  disparate databases, files, and application sources. Data Loader
also  enables implementers to design, manage, and audit data
synchronization  using graphic tools and, as an option, apply
service-based data quality and  cleaning processes at any point in the
data synchronization process.

    Data Reporter for DB2 is a specialized version of Information Builders' 
z/OS based WebFOCUS(R) BI platform, designed for building Internet-based 
BI applications or as a guided ad hoc query tool for businesses using a
DB2  enterprise data warehouse. A highly graphic developer workbench
enables  developers to quickly and easily design, deploy, and manage
Internet-based  applications or query solutions for large or small user
groups that don't  require end user training or software licensing for
each user.

    WebFOCUS for System z Data Warehousing uses a common server, metadata,
and  data access architecture native to the z/OS environment,
dramatically  reducing the design, implementation, and operational
complexity of data  warehousing and BI solutions. Additionally, it uses
System z zIIP's  exploitive capabilities, dramatically reducing the
operational costs of  data synchronization, operational reporting, and ad
hoc queries, compared  to the same operations using System z generalized
processors.

    "Having more partners like Information Builders helps our mutual clients 
bring more workloads to System z, ultimately enhancing the long-term 
economic value of the platform," said Tom Rosamilia, general manager of 
System z at IBM. "Data warehousing and business intelligence are key
growth  areas for IBM clients as we help glean disparate business data
into  meaningful business opportunities."

    WebFOCUS for IBM System z Data Warehousing is available now. Typical 
software configuration pricing is competitive and varies based upon the 
size of warehouse implementation. Special introductory pricing is also 
available. For more information, contact your local Information Builders
or  IBM sales representative.

&lt;p&gt;Industry-Leading HSMs Enhance Security and Simplify Encryption Key Management on
Windows Server 2008 R2 and Hyper-V Virtual Server Platforms
WESTON, Fla. &amp; CAMBRIDGE, England--(Business Wire)--
Thales, leader in information systems and communications security and Microsoft
Gold Certified Partner, announces that its comprehensive portfolio of hardware
security modules (HSMs) is the industry`s first to be certified for Microsoft
Windows Server 2008 R2. Thales HSMs-including nShield Connect from the nCipher1
product line-offer unmatched performance, scalability and reliability to enhance
security, simplify encryption key management and help meet regulatory compliance
requirements. By adding support for Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2, including
the Hyper-V virtual server platform, Thales HSMs enable customers to upgrade
their Microsoft IT environments while ensuring the continuous security of their
public key infrastructures, databases, Web-based online services and other
critical applications. 

"To achieve Certified for Windows Server 2008 R2 a technology must meet the
highest Microsoft testing quality bar requirements and demonstrate that it is
fully compatible with the Windows Server platform by passing close to 100
prescriptive tests. This gives our joint customers the ability and confidence to
migrate to this new platform seamlessly and to gain the immediate benefit of
Thales`s HSMs` hardware grade protection for the new security features of
Windows Server 2008 R2," says Eric Jewett, Director, Windows Server at
Microsoft. "Enterprises that deploy Thales HSMs on Windows Server 2008 R2
platforms will be integrating a leading-edge security solution that is also
deployed within Microsoft Corporation to help protect our critical
infrastructure." 

HSMs are the industry best practice for protecting cryptographic keys and for
performing encryption and digital signing. HSMs provide a cost-effective way to
increase the security of software-based systems, enforcing access control and
key management policies within a tamper-resistant security environment. All
Thales HSMs are easily deployed to support a wide range of shared security
infrastructure applications such as Microsoft Active Directory Certificate
Services and Rights Management Services, as well as Microsoft SQL Server. 

"Thales is proud to offer the industry`s first HSMs to be certified for
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2, which illustrates our continued commitment to
meeting the needs of our customers, who deploy HSMs on Windows platforms," says
Franck Greverie, Vice President, Managing Director for Thales`s information
systems security activities. "This certification and support for Windows Server
2008 R2 ensures that Thales customers can upgrade to Microsoft`s latest platform
immediately and all of their critical applications will remain protected by the
industry`s leading HSMs."

&lt;p&gt;Agreements Signed for Delivery of LNG From Gorgon and Wheatstone Projects and
the Purchase of an Equity Interest in Wheatstone
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that its Australian subsidiaries
have signed multiple Heads of Agreements (HOAs) with Kyushu Electric Power Co.,
Inc. for the delivery of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Chevron-operated
Gorgon and Wheatstone natural gas projects. 

Under the agreements, Kyushu Electric anticipates receiving 0.3 million tons per
annum (mtpa) of LNG from the Gorgon Project, for 15 years. 

Under the agreement, Kyushu Electric also intends to acquire 1.83 percent of
Chevron`s equity share in the Wheatstone field licenses and a 1.37 percent
interest in the Wheatstone natural gas processing facilities to be developed
onshore near Onslow in northwestern Australia. Additionally, Kyushu Electric
expects to purchase 0.7 mtpa of LNG from the Wheatstone Project for up to 20
years. This sales volume is net of the LNG that Kyushu Electric will lift as an
equity participant in Wheatstone. Including this equity participation, Kyushu
Electric will take delivery of 0.8 mtpa of LNG from the Wheatstone Project. 

"We are pleased to welcome Kyushu Electric as a gas customer for our Gorgon and
Wheatstone projects and equity holder in Wheatstone," said Jim Blackwell,
president, Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production Company. 

John Gass, president, Chevron Global Gas said, "Kyushu Electric is a leading
company in one of the world`s largest LNG markets. We already have a
long-standing relationship with Kyushu Electric through our participation in the
North West Shelf Venture, and we look forward to expanding this relationship
through our two new major Australian LNG projects." 

Construction of the Gorgon Project began in the second half of 2009, with first
gas planned for 2014. The initial project includes a 15 mtpa LNG facility and a
domestic gas plant in northwestern Australia. Chevron is the operator and has an
approximate 47 percent interest in the project. 

The Wheatstone project entered the front end engineering and design phase in
July 2009 and expects to make a final investment decision in 2011. The initial
phase of the project plans to have the capacity to process 8.6 mtpa of LNG and a
domestic gas plant. Chevron is the operator and holds an approximate 75 percent
interest in the project. 

In October 2009, Chevron announced it had signed a binding agreement with Apache
Julimar Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of the Apache Corporation, which will assume a
16.25 percent equity interest in the Wheatstone Project, and KUFPEC Australia
(Julimar) Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of the Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration
Company k.s.c., which will assume an 8.75 percent interest in the project. Under
this agreement, Chevron is responsible for marketing LNG produced from the
Julimar and Brunello fields. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company's success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional committee may probe more closely into the purchase of shares of Goldman Sachs by Stephen Friedman when he was chairman of the New York Federal Reserve bank, the committee's chairman said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friedman resigned abruptly last May from the New York Fed board amid questions about his purchases of shares in Wall Street giant Goldman where he was formerly a top executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought there was a real conflict there," Representative Edolphus Towns, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and a New York Democrat, said in an interview after he chaired a hearing where Friedman testified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the hearing, Friedman said a Fed policy adopted just three months ago addresses the situation he faced, and would have shortened a delay in the processing of waiver requests for him. Friedman remains a Goldman board member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towns, noting that Friedman had purchased additional Goldman shares after becoming a member of the New York Fed's board, told Reuters: "It looked as if that was a conflict. That's something that I'm sure we'll probably look at a little further."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, the Federal Reserve said it will no longer let regional Fed bank directors own shares in financial firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under prior rules, regional Fed directors selected by the central bank's board of governors, such as Friedman, were only barred from owning shares in banks regulated by the U.S. Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman's ownership of Goldman stock came to violate that policy once the firm, gripped by the financial crisis, converted into a bank holding company in order to qualify for direct aid from both the Treasury and the Fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The episode proved embarrassing for the central bank and spurred an internal Fed review of its governance practices aimed at weeding out any potential conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Towns hearing was focused mainly on the Bush administration's bailout of former insurer AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman said he was not involved in the initial bailout decision, nor in decisions to repay AIG's counterparties at par value and not to disclose the counterparties' identities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Home Prices Edge Up

It is silly to expect that individual homeowners should be held to a different
standard than big institutional investors are when they face the same problem.
After all, BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) and Tishman Speyer could have come up with the
money to pay the mortgage on Stuyvesant Town (the big NYC apartment complex that
just went into default) but they chose not to do so because it was far
underwater. Their situation was no different than that of an individual
homeowner who has a house that is now worth $200,000 that has a $300,000
mortgage on the place. 

Of course, if you combine being underwater with being unemployed, then simply
not paying the mortgage and waiting for the sheriff to show up at the door is by
far the smartest move. It might be the only way for the family to survive in
this environment. 

Yes, there are non-economic factors involved, and most people who are only
slightly underwater do not default unless they run into cash flow problems.
Still, if housing prices start to move up, then thousands of people who might be
right at the line of stopping payment might just decide it is worth it to keep
the house. 

It is the flood for delinquencies and ultimately foreclosures that has been at
the heart of the economic crisis. Rising prices greatly improve the situation
for firms throughout the mortgage complex, from Fannie Mae (NYSE: FNM) and
Freddie Mac (NYSE: FRE) to the mortgage insurers like MGIC (NYSE: MTG) to the
big banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM).

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is expected to report a strong jump in quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by the successful launch of Windows 7, but it may not be enough to satisfy demanding investors and push its stock higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM, Google Inc and Apple Inc have all beaten average Wall Street estimates this quarter, but saw their stocks fall or gain only slightly afterward as investors looked for more indications of strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, that could mean showing evidence that companies are starting to -- or getting ready to -- buy personal computers after holding off on technology spending in the turbulent economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Microsoft probably did OK, but I want to hear the commentary looking forward on that area," said Kim Caughey, analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which holds Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The so-called "refresh cycle", where Microsoft's major customers get around to buying new hardware and upgrading software, is "at the very beginning," said Caughey. "The second half of this year -- that's when we'll see a meaningful uptick in businesses buying new hardware."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is expecting Microsoft to report profit of 59 cents per share for its fiscal second quarter, up from 47 cents per share a year earlier, and revenue to rise 7 percent to $17.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales will be boosted by the Windows 7 operating system, which was launched last October, and the one-time deferral of some Windows revenue from last quarter related to Microsoft's free upgrade program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from Thomson Reuters StarMine, which places more weight on recent forecasts by top-rated analysts, is almost identical to the Wall Street average, suggesting a surprise is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except for last quarter, when Microsoft smashed the average EPS estimate by 8 cents, analysts have been quite accurate in predicting its results with average forecasts within 2 cents of the reported number for five of the last six quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC SALES REBOUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs of a turnaround in the PC industry are apparent. PC sales rose 15.2 percent in the last quarter of 2009, according to IDC, making up for declines earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers powered the gains, rushing to buy new laptops and netbooks at bargain prices from the likes of Hewlett-Packard Co, Acer Inc and Dell Inc over the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question for Microsoft investors is when commercial PC buyers will follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Business spending will take more time to take hold, as commercial entities wait for tangible signs of sustained economic growth before launching a new refresh cycle," IDC said in its cautious forecast earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is in a good position to capitalize on business spending, when it finally materializes, with a new version of its massively profitable Office suite of applications due out this year, along with new database and server software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopes for that, along with optimism over Windows 7, new technology for the Xbox gaming system, and steady gains by its Bing search engine, have helped push Microsoft's stock up 66 percent in the last 12 months, outstripping the Nasdaq composite index's 48 percent gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question now is how much more upside Microsoft has to deliver. Its stock is now trading around 16 times analysts' estimates for fiscal 2010 profit, compared to the Nasdaq composite index's 16.5 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

expected to report a strong jump in quarterly profit on
Thursday, helped by the successful launch of Windows 7, but it
may not be enough to satisfy demanding investors and push its
stock higher.

 IBM (IBM.N), Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O)
have all beaten average Wall Street estimates this quarter, but
saw their stocks fall or gain only slightly afterward as
investors looked for more indications of strength.

 For Microsoft, that could mean showing evidence that
companies are starting to -- or getting ready to -- buy
personal computers after holding off on technology spending in
the turbulent economy.

 "I think Microsoft probably did OK, but I want to hear the
commentary looking forward on that area," said Kim Caughey,
analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which holds Microsoft
shares.

 The so-called "refresh cycle", where Microsoft's major
customers get around to buying new hardware and upgrading
software, is "at the very beginning," said Caughey. "The second
half of this year -- that's when we'll see a meaningful uptick
in businesses buying new hardware."

 Wall Street is expecting Microsoft to report profit of 59
cents per share for its fiscal second quarter, up from 47 cents
per share a year earlier, and revenue to rise 7 percent to
$17.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

 Sales will be boosted by the Windows 7 operating system,
which was launched last October, and the one-time deferral of
some Windows revenue from last quarter related to Microsoft's
free upgrade program.

 Data from Thomson Reuters StarMine, which places more
weight on recent forecasts by top-rated analysts, is almost
identical to the Wall Street average, suggesting a surprise is
unlikely.

 Except for last quarter, when Microsoft smashed the average
EPS estimate by 8 cents, analysts have been quite accurate in
predicting its results with average forecasts within 2 cents of
the reported number for five of the last six quarters.

 PC SALES REBOUND

 Signs of a turnaround in the PC industry are apparent. PC
sales rose 15.2 percent in the last quarter of 2009, according
to IDC, making up for declines earlier in the year.

 Consumers powered the gains, rushing to buy new laptops and
netbooks at bargain prices from the likes of Hewlett-Packard Co
(HPQ.N), Acer Inc (2353.TW) and Dell Inc DELL.O over the
holiday season.

 The question for Microsoft investors is when commercial PC
buyers will follow suit.

 "Business spending will take more time to take hold, as
commercial entities wait for tangible signs of sustained
economic growth before launching a new refresh cycle," IDC said
in its cautious forecast earlier this month.

 Microsoft is in a good position to capitalize on business
spending, when it finally materializes, with a new version of
its massively profitable Office suite of applications due out
this year, along with new database and server software.

 Hopes for that, along with optimism over Windows 7, new
technology for the Xbox gaming system, and steady gains by its
Bing search engine, have helped push Microsoft's stock up 66
percent in the last 12 months, outstripping the Nasdaq
composite index's 48 percent gain.

 The question now is how much more upside Microsoft has to
deliver. Its stock is now trading around 16 times analysts'
estimates for fiscal 2010 profit, compared to the Nasdaq
composite index's 16.5 times.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Joins Forces with Facebook to Offer Multiple Ways to Open Happiness
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
What if you could watch a sneak peek of the new Coca-Cola commercials that will
debut during the Super Bowl telecast, give a virtual gift to a friend and help
make a positive difference in the lives of others - all at the same time?
Coca-Cola is inviting people to do just that and Open Happiness together. 

Beginning today, visitors to the Coca-Cola fan page on Facebook at
www.facebook.com/livepositively can share a special Facebook "virtual gift" with
friends and family. Each virtual Coca-Cola gift and commercial sneak peek
triggers three uplifting outcomes:

* Coca-Cola makes a one-dollar donation to Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. 
* Gift recipients receive a special Coca-Cola bottle image, which is displayed
on their Facebook page and newsfeed, reminding them and others they can also
share virtual gifts. 
* Gift-givers receive a 20-second sneak preview of one of two new Coca-Cola ads
that will debut during the Super Bowl broadcast on February 7, 2010. 
* Once game day arrives, gifters will receive both ads in their entirety -
before their television debut later that evening.

"By using our Super Bowl ads to invite people to join us in supporting Boys &amp;
Girls Clubs, we`re going beyond simply airing great commercials on a terrific
live television event," said Katie Bayne, Chief Marketing Officer, Coca-Cola
North America. "We`re reminding people that whenever they enjoy a Coca-Cola,
they play a role in helping us make a difference in the lives of others. By
opening a Coke they create a happiness multiplier." 

The two new commercials are part of the global Coca-Cola Open Happiness
campaign, which reminds people to share a Coke and enjoy life`s little
pleasures. One ad chronicles a young man`s unique quest for the ultimate
refreshment, while the other features familiar animated characters learning to
appreciate the simple moments they experience with friends and family. 

In addition, two animated billboards will air during the Super Bowl broadcast
and alert viewers to visit LivePositively.com where they can learn how to help
Coca-Cola benefit Boys &amp; Girls Clubs and how they can support the ongoing
efforts of the Red Cross in aiding earthquake victims in Haiti. 

"The Super Bowl broadcast brings families and friends together to celebrate and
create memories," continued Bayne. "It`s a perfect time to open a Coke and Open
Happiness, and giving folks a chance to help others through our ads makes the
experience even better." 

The new commercials are just one part of Coca-Cola`s long-term commitment to
supporting local communities. Already In 2010, new print and digital advertising
has asked people to join Coca-Cola in contributing to worthy causes in three
ways - by volunteering their time, donating dollars through LivePostively.com or
donating points to worthwhile organizations through My Coke Rewards. Television
advertising focusing on education, active living and sustainability has aired on
high-profile programming such as American Idol. And the Coca-Cola Live
Positively website now offers expanded functionality that allows more than 14
million MyCokeRewards members, four million Coke fans on Facebook and 1.5
million fans on MySpace to join Coca-Cola in supporting causes that improve
countless lives. 

Visitors to MyCokeRewards.com and LivePostively.com also will be directed to
visit the Coca-Cola fan page on Facebook to share a virtual gift and receive a
sneak peek of the new Coca-Cola ad. After the big game has concluded, people who
give a Coca-Cola virtual gift will receive both new Coca-Cola commercials in
their entirety. The spots also will be available on popular file-sharing sites
such as YouTube and Hulu. 

This is the fourth consecutive year that Coca-Cola commercials will appear in
the Super Bowl telecast. The new "Open Happiness" ads were created by Wieden +
Kennedy in Portland, Ore.

&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer cuts 100 drug-development projects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Pulls Lyrica application as add-on anxiety drug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Aims to sell, outlicense many discontinued assets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on
Wednesday it has cut more than 15 percent of its combined drug
development programs following the recent merger with Wyeth and
will no longer seek U.S. approval to sell pain drug Lyrica as
an add-on treatment for anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lyrica, which had third-quarter sales of $708 million, is
currently approved to treat epileptic seizures, fribromyalgia
and nerve pain. General anxiety disorder could have opened
another revenue stream for the drug, which already has annual
sales of nearly $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Company officials said Pfizer has withdrawn a U.S.
marketing application for the anxiety indication, but the
company is still weighing the drug's potential for the
condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a smaller thing in the bigger picture," Mikael
Dolsten, one of Pfizer's two top research chiefs, said in a
telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After reviewing the combined drug development portfolios of
Pfizer and Wyeth, the company decided to trim 600 existing
projects to about 500, with some 70 percent of those remaining
focused on six key therapeutic areas -- oncology, pain,
inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, psychoses and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We wanted to make sure the key priorities for us will be
dominant in the new portfolio," said Dolsten, who came to
Pfizer from Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has also boosted its vaccines and biotechnology
projects through its acquisition of Wyeth, with six vaccines
and 27 biotech drugs now in development, up from one vaccine
and 16 biologics it had in the pipeline a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the primary reasons for the $67 billion purchase of
Wyeth was to gain access to its promising lineup of vaccines
and biotechnology medicines at a time when Pfizer is facing the
late 2011 loss of patent protection on its $12 billion-a-year
cholesterol fighter Lipitor, the world's biggest-selling
medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After completing the Wyeth acquisition in October, Pfizer
moved quickly to reduce the combined company's number of
research and development sites and to meld operations, with the
prioritizing and culling of its development pipeline the latest
move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has said it was determined not to repeat past
mistakes of previous giant acquisitions, when a lengthy
integration process hampered operations and research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We moved it rapidly with good decisions," Martin Mackay,
Pfizer's other research chief, said of the Wyeth
consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The programs we culled in this first piece, either there
was overlap between the portfolios or we had a piece of
scientific information" that led to discontinuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will continue to prioritize the portfolio," Mackay
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the projects pared from the pipeline come from
drugs in the early, or Phase I, stage of development. The vast
majority of the industry's drugs in Phase I testing never make
it onto the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three drugs undergoing mid-stage, or Phase II, clinical
trials were listed as discontinued -- one for diabetes, one for
pain and one for thrombosis, or blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mackay said the company could seek to sell or outlicense
some of the discontinued assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will certainly aim to derive as much value as possible,
and we are in discussions with a number of potential partners,"
he said.

&lt;p&gt;Prioritized Pipeline Marks Important Milestone for Company`s New Global R
Organization

Company Meets Key Late-Stage Development Commitments Made to Investors
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. today provided an update to its pipeline for the first time since
the close of the acquisition of Wyeth in October, 2009. The new development
pipeline, composed of assets from both legacy companies, includes 133 programs
from phase 1 through registration, and shows growth and increased diversity in
each of the areas where the company invests in research and development. 

"This pipeline of investigational medicines represents the strong future of
Pfizer," said Martin Mackay, president, PharmaTherapeutics Research and
Development. "Since the closing of the Wyeth transaction late last year, we have
made strategic decisions about our R resources, global footprint and
high-priority projects. Our focus now turns to delivery of these health
solutions for patients around the world." 

Pfizer has identified six "Invest to Win" areas of research where there exist
significant opportunities for innovation and market leadership: oncology; pain;
inflammation; Alzheimer`s disease; psychoses; and diabetes. The new pipeline
demonstrates focused investment in these areas of significant unmet medical need
as well as growth in the critical technologies of vaccines and biologics. 

Following the acquisition of Wyeth, the combined company pipeline had 600
projects ranging from discovery through registration. The new prioritized
portfolio contains about 500 projects across a broad range of diseases, with a
focus on the "Invest to Win" areas, as well as vaccines and biologics.
Approximately 70% of Pfizer`s research projects and 75% of the late-stage
portfolio are focused on these areas. 

The growth in vaccines and biologics is reflective of Pfizer`s goal of becoming
a top-tier biotherapeutics company by 2015. The company`s pipeline now includes
a total of 6 vaccines and 27 biologics in development, up from 1 vaccine and 16
biologics at the last pipeline update in March 2009. 

"Through the acquisition of Wyeth, Pfizer has become a leading biotherapeutics
company, and we are well positioned to pioneer the next generation of
high-potential medicines," said Mikael Dolsten, president, BioTherapeutics
Research and Development. 

Pfizer`s portfolio now includes:

* 30 compounds in development for various oncology indications, including
PF-02341066, a c-MET-ALK inhibitor in Phase 3 for the treatment of non-small
cell lung cancer, and axitinib, a VEGF inhibitor in Phase 2 for lung,
gastrointestinal, thyroid, and breast cancer and Phase 3 studies for renal cell
carcinoma (RCC). Pfizer has two pan-HER/erbB targeted agents in Phase 3 studies,
including PF-00299804 for non-small cell lung cancer and Neratinib for
metastatic breast cancer. In addition, Pfizer has therapeutic targets in
hematology with compounds in Phase 3 development, such as bosutinib, for the
treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), in addition to compounds in
earlier development, such as inotuzumab ozogamicin for the treatment of
Non-Hodgkin`s Lymphoma. Last month, a supplemental new drug application (sNDA)
seeking FDA approval for Sutent for the treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumors was filed. Sutent is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the
treatment of advanced / metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the treatment
of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or
intolerance to imatinib mesylate. 
* 10 compounds in development for Alzheimer`s disease, representing a range of
mechanisms Pfizer is evaluating for the treatment of this illness. These include
Latrepirdine (Dimebon), being developed by Pfizer and Medivation, and
bapineuzumab, being developed by Pfizer and Janssen, both in Phase 3 development
for the treatment of Alzheimer`s disease. 
* 8 compounds in development for pain, including tanezumab, a novel injectable
biotherapeutic compound which targets nerve growth factor. The Phase 3 program
studying tanezumab in osteoarthritis initiated in November, 2008, with more than
5,000 patients planned to be treated with this potential new medicine. 
* 11 compounds in development for inflammation, including tasocitinib
(CP-690,550), Pfizer's JAK-3 inhibitor in development for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Pfizer initiated a global Phase 3 clinical program in
RA for tasocitinib (CP-690,550) in February 2009, with five Phase 3 studies
ongoing. 
* 6 vaccines and 27 biologics in the development pipeline, including Prevnar 13,
a vaccine designed to prevent pneumococcal disease in infants and young
children. Prevnar 13 has been approved for infants and young children in 34
countries, including in the EU and Canada, and is under regulatory review in
many other countries, including the U.S. Prevenar 13 is also being studied in
global Phase 3 clinical trials in adults, with regulatory submissions expected
in 2010.

By the end of 2009, Pfizer as a stand-alone company met three late-stage
development commitments made to investors in March 2008. It met a commitment to
initiate 10-12 Phase 3 starts between March, 2008 and March, 2009, and it met
commitments to initiate 15 Phase 3 starts in the 2008-2009 period and to have
24-28 new molecular entities and new indications in the Phase 3 pipeline by the
end of 2009. The new combined company pipeline has 34 new molecular entities and
new indications in Phase 3. 

Pfizer also announced that it has withdrawn its supplemental New Drug
Application (sNDA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Lyrica
for the adjunctive treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). 

In November, 2009, Pfizer announced that it would reduce its global R square
footage by 35 percent. Consequently, R activities will be conducted at five
main sites and nine specialized units around the world as compared with 20 R
sites upon closing the acquisition of Wyeth on October 15, 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Prioritized Pipeline Marks Important Milestone for Company`s New Global R
Organization


Company Meets Key Late-Stage Development Commitments Made to Investors

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. today provided an update to its pipeline for the first time since
the close of the acquisition of Wyeth in October, 2009. The new development
pipeline, composed of assets from both legacy companies, includes 133 programs
from phase 1 through registration, and shows growth and increased diversity in
each of the areas where the company invests in research and development. 

"This pipeline of investigational medicines represents the strong future of
Pfizer," said Martin Mackay, president, PharmaTherapeutics Research and
Development. "Since the closing of the Wyeth transaction late last year, we have
made strategic decisions about our R resources, global footprint and
high-priority projects. Our focus now turns to delivery of these health
solutions for patients around the world." 

Pfizer has identified six "Invest to Win" areas of research where there exist
significant opportunities for innovation and market leadership: oncology; pain;
inflammation; Alzheimer`s disease; psychoses; and diabetes. The new pipeline
demonstrates focused investment in these areas of significant unmet medical need
as well as growth in the critical technologies of vaccines and biologics. 

Following the acquisition of Wyeth, the combined company pipeline had 600
projects ranging from discovery through registration. The new prioritized
portfolio contains about 500 projects across a broad range of diseases, with a
focus on the "Invest to Win" areas, as well as vaccines and biologics.
Approximately 70% of Pfizer`s research projects and 75% of the late-stage
portfolio are focused on these areas. 

The growth in vaccines and biologics is reflective of Pfizer`s goal of becoming
a top-tier biotherapeutics company by 2015. The company`s pipeline now includes
a total of 6 vaccines and 27 biologics in development, up from 1 vaccine and 16
biologics at the last pipeline update in March 2009. 

"Through the acquisition of Wyeth, Pfizer has become a leading biotherapeutics
company, and we are well positioned to pioneer the next generation of
high-potential medicines," said Mikael Dolsten, president, BioTherapeutics
Research and Development. 

Pfizer`s portfolio now includes:

* 30 compounds in development for various oncology indications, including
PF-02341066, a c-MET-ALK inhibitor in Phase 3 for the treatment of non-small
cell lung cancer, and axitinib, a VEGF inhibitor in Phase 2 for lung,
gastrointestinal, thyroid, and breast cancer and Phase 3 studies for renal cell
carcinoma (RCC). Pfizer has two pan-HER/erbB targeted agents in Phase 3 studies,
including PF-00299804 for non-small cell lung cancer and Neratinib for
metastatic breast cancer. In addition, Pfizer has therapeutic targets in
hematology with compounds in Phase 3 development, such as bosutinib, for the
treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), in addition to compounds in
earlier development, such as inotuzumab ozogamicin for the treatment of
Non-Hodgkin`s Lymphoma. Last month, a supplemental new drug application (sNDA)
seeking FDA approval for Sutent for the treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumors was filed. Sutent is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the
treatment of advanced / metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the treatment
of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or
intolerance to imatinib mesylate. 
* 10 compounds in development for Alzheimer`s disease, representing a range of
mechanisms Pfizer is evaluating for the treatment of this illness. These include
Latrepirdine (Dimebon), being developed by Pfizer and Medivation, and
bapineuzumab, being developed by Pfizer and Janssen, both in Phase 3 development
for the treatment of Alzheimer`s disease. 
* 8 compounds in development for pain, including tanezumab, a novel injectable
biotherapeutic compound which targets nerve growth factor. The Phase 3 program
studying tanezumab in osteoarthritis initiated in November, 2008, with more than
5,000 patients planned to be treated with this potential new medicine. 
* 11 compounds in development for inflammation, including tasocitinib
(CP-690,550), Pfizer's JAK-3 inhibitor in development for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Pfizer initiated a global Phase 3 clinical program in
RA for tasocitinib (CP-690,550) in February 2009, with five Phase 3 studies
ongoing. 
* 6 vaccines and 27 biologics in the development pipeline, including Prevnar 13,
a vaccine designed to prevent pneumococcal disease in infants and young
children. Prevnar 13 has been approved for infants and young children in 34
countries, including in the EU and Canada, and is under regulatory review in
many other countries, including the U.S. Prevenar 13 is also being studied in
global Phase 3 clinical trials in adults, with regulatory submissions expected
in 2010.

By the end of 2009, Pfizer as a stand-alone company met three late-stage
development commitments made to investors in March 2008. It met a commitment to
initiate 10-12 Phase 3 starts between March, 2008 and March, 2009, and it met
commitments to initiate 15 Phase 3 starts in the 2008-2009 period and to have
24-28 new molecular entities and new indications in the Phase 3 pipeline by the
end of 2009. The new combined company pipeline has 34 new molecular entities and
new indications in Phase 3. 

Pfizer also announced that it has withdrawn its supplemental New Drug
Application (sNDA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Lyrica
for the adjunctive treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). 

In November, 2009, Pfizer announced that it would reduce its global R square
footage by 35 percent. Consequently, R activities will be conducted at five
main sites and nine specialized units around the world as compared with 20 R
sites upon closing the acquisition of Wyeth on October 15, 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Thousands set to participate in the Certiport-sponsored contest for desktop
computing proficiency
SALT LAKE CITY--(Business Wire)--
Certiport (www.certiport.com) announced the launch of the 2010 Certiport
Worldwide Competition on Microsoft Office, a competition that provides a
platform for students to showcase their expert skills using Microsoft Office
tools. 

Having demonstrated proficiency in the newest standard of the world`s foremost
desktop computing applications, Microsoft Word or Excel, certified students have
the tools to achieve more, distinguish themselves and advance in today`s
competitive academic and professional environments. 

Details about the Certiport Worldwide Competition on Microsoft Office:
www.officecompetition.com

The competition boasts more than 80,000 students who will vie for the title of
"World Champion." Over 53 countries from around the world will host local
competitions to determine country and regional representatives based on exam
scores and completion times. Selected students will then compete in this year`s
World Championships held in Park City, Utah, in August 2010. 

Certiport created the Microsoft Office Specialist certification to meet the
growing demand for individuals to use the full features and functionality of
Microsoft Office Systems. Entering its ninth year, the Certiport Worldwide
Competition on Microsoft Office is the premier event for students to prove they
have met the performance requirements that companies look for in potential
employees. 

"Industry certification programs validate that students have the expertise
needed to compete in the global workforce," said Quinn Sutton, Certiport`s
Senior Vice President of Marketing. "Our worldwide competition is designed to be
a catalyst, creating a competitive environment to encourage more students to
seek certification. These students, in turn, will become competent employees
able to fulfill workforce opportunities." 

According to the recent Certification Magazine Salary Survey that included more
than 40,000 responses from IT professionals in over 150 countries around the
world, more than 85 percents of respondents agree that since they`ve become
certified, there is a greater demand for their skills. More than 86 percent also
report that achieving certification has increased their productivity on the job,
and 96 percent from the top five countries with the highest salaries said they
were certified. 

The Worldwide Competition on Microsoft Office has grown steadily since its
inauguration in 2002 as a regional event in Asia. All told, more than 250,000
students from all over the world have competed for the coveted title of "World
Champ" in its nine-year history. Participants who outperform their peers to make
the final round of the Competition generally have perfect or near-perfect exam
scores and completion times well below the allotted examination time. 

Current students who pass a qualifying exam and are enrolled in an approved,
degree-seeking academic institution are eligible to compete. The World Champions
of Word and Excel will receive a grand-prize package of $6,500 USD in
scholarships and prizes.

&lt;p&gt;Deepwater Project is Chevron`s Largest Investment in Brazil to Date
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) announced today that its Brazilian subsidiary
will proceed with the development of the Papa Terra project as the company`s
second deepwater development offshore Brazil. 

"This decision confirms our commitment to developing new opportunities in an
important basin and adds to our strong queue of major capital projects," said
George Kirkland, Chevron's vice chairman. 

Situated 70 miles (110 kilometers) offshore in water depths of approximately
3,900 feet (1,190 meters), Papa Terra is a heavy oil subsea development located
within Block BC-20 of the southern Campos basin. The project will feature the
first tension leg well platform in Brazil which will be connected to a floating
production, storage, and offloading vessel. The completed facility will be
capable of producing up to 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day. 

First production from the Papa Terra project is expected in 2013. 

"When completed, the Papa Terra project will represent Chevron`s largest
investment in Brazil to date and is expected to grow the company`s production
capacity in the country which was established with the 2009 start-up of the
Frade project," said Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa and Latin America
Exploration and Production Company. 

Chevron holds a 37.5 per cent interest in the Petrobras-operated Papa Terra
project, which they estimate will cost $5.2 billion. The project is estimated to
recover 380 million barrels of oil. 

In addition to the Papa Terra and Frade projects in the Campos Basin, Chevron
also holds a 30 percent non-operated interest in the Maromba field where work
continues to select an optimal development plan. In the Santos Basin, Chevron
holds a 20 percent non-operated interest in Block BS-4 where the company
continues to evaluate development plans to commercialize the Atlanta and Oliva
fields. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil, in partnership with Ashoka`s Changemakers and the International
Center for Research on Women (ICRW), today launched Women | Tools | Technology:
Building Opportunities &amp; Economic Power, an innovative challenge that will
identify transformative solutions for promoting women`s economic advancement
through technology. 

Through the Women | Tools | Technology Challenge, the partners are looking for
creative ideas and sustainable approaches that enable more women from developing
countries to be active contributors to and leaders in our rapidly changing
economy. 

"We hope that the ideas and solutions generated through Women | Tools |
Technology will spark a profound transformation in the way women in developing
countries live and work," said Lorie Jackson, director of ExxonMobil`s Women`s
Economic Opportunity Initiative. 

"Technology has the potential to initiate a chain reaction that results in
women`s economic advancement and, in turn, raises their standard of living,
contributes to significant global progress, and strengthens their families and
communities." 

The ideas and solutions generated through Women | Tools | Technology can be new
or improve upon existing technologies to enable them to benefit more women.
Innovators with concepts for catalyzing women`s economic advancement through
technology will be able to submit their ideas through a crowd-sourcing, online
format that allows for discussion and collaboration among other innovators and
select experts. Submissions will be accepted from January 27th through April
14th at http://www.changemakers.com/en-us/technologywomen. 

Entries will be judged by a panel of experts, including Pam Darwin, ExxonMobil`s
vice president of Geoscience, Geeta Rao Gupta, president of ICRW, Andr&#233;s Carlos
Randazzo, Ashoka Fellow and founder of SANUT, Bisi Adeleye-Fayemi, co-founder
and executive director of the African Women's Development Fund and Christine
Grumm, president and chief executive officer of the Women`s Funding Network.
Finalists will be announced in mid-June. 

"Women`s economic advancement is often directly related to their ability to
access and use technology," said Charlie Brown, executive director of Ashoka`s
Changemakers. "We`re excited to work with some of the most creative innovators
from around the world to develop ground-breaking solutions to leverage
technology to live up to its promise of changing the world - the whole world -
for the better." 

Additional direction and focus for the challenge is provided by a new research
study entitled, "Bridging the Gender Divide in Technology," which was conducted
by ICRW and funded by the ExxonMobil Foundation. The white paper, which explores
the link between technology and women's economic empowerment, is being released
to coincide with the challenge launch and showcases existing technologies that
help women increase their productivity, create new entrepreneurial ventures, and
launch income-generating pursuits. The paper highlights what needs to be done to
improve the way technologies are developed and deployed so they benefit women,
enabling them to be more successful economic actors, stronger leaders, and
greater contributors to their families, communities and domestic economies. 

"When you consider the untapped potential of half the world`s workforce, the
combination of women, tools and technology can trigger truly transformative
change," said Anju Malhotra, vice president for Research, Innovation and Impact
at ICRW. "Our research offers social innovators practical recommendations on how
to develop, introduce, and disseminate technologies that strengthen women`s
ability to compete in the global economy." 

The Women | Tools | Technology Challenge is part of ExxonMobil`s Women`s
Economic Opportunity Initiative, and was announced at the Clinton Global
Initiative`s annual meeting in New York in September 2009. At the meeting,
ExxonMobil co-sponsored the first-ever Clinton Global Initiative special
programming focused on investing in girls and women. 

The Women`s Economic Opportunity Initiative (previously Educating Women and
Girls Initiative) was launched in 2005 and has invested more than $30 million in
programs that have directly benefited thousands of women from 64 developing
countries.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs denied a media report it had been mooting the sale of equity in National Bank of Greece to Chinese banks as debt-ridden Greece struggles to fix its public finances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times on Wednesday reported Goldman Sachs had been mooting the sale of equity in NBG, Greece's largest lender to Bank of China or to the China Investment Corp, the country's sovereign wealth fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GS said it was not involved in any such deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FT also said GS had been promoting a Greek bond sale to China and to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which manages China's foreign exchange reserves, as Greece hoped to sell 25 billion euros ($35.15 billion) of bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source close to the bank said that while it was keen to do further business with Greece, there was no project underway to place debt specifically with Chinese investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment on whether it was specifically targeting Chinese investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If China was about to buy (even) 5 billion euros of Greek debt, its spread would be trading nearer at 100 basis points not 300 basis points," one senior sovereign banker said, asking not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greece in a statement denied there was a deal to sell Greek bonds to China, and said that the Finance Ministry had not mandated Goldman Sachs to negotiate a deal with China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs this week was one of the joint-lead managers on Greece's sale of an 8 billion euro government bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.7112 Euro)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Douwe Miedema and Alex Chambers; editing by Patrick Graham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Indonesian unit of U.S. oil
major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) expects peak crude oil production of
165,000 barrels per day (bpd) from its Cepu block to be delayed
until the end of 2013, a company official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; An Exxon Mobil Indonesia official had previously said the
company hoped for peak production at Cepu in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cepu, in Central Java, ranks among the U.S. major's top 10
projects worldwide. For a factbox see [ID:nJAK406120].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is being jointly developed by Exxon Mobil and Indonesian
state oil firm Pertamina, and began initial production with a
volume of around 800 bpd in December 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our target for 165,000 bpd output is by the end of 2013,"
Maman Budiman, a senior vice president at Exxon Mobil
Indonesia, told a parliamentary commission hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Budiman said Cepu currently produces around 18,000 bpd,
supplying a small refinery in Central Java and also Pertamina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia, which has turned into a net importer of crude
oil in recent years, is counting on Cepu to help make up for
flagging output from its ageing fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a story on Exxon and Indonesian investment hurdles,

&lt;p&gt;Semantic search capabilities were hailed by a Microsoft official Tuesday as a better way to get users to the information they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During an interview and a preceding presentation, Scott Prevost, principal development manager for Bing search technology at Microsoft, touted developments in search as well as possibilities. He appeared at the Web 3.0 conference in Santa Clara, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ InfoWorld's Killer Apps blog pointed out that Google is taking a page from Microsoft's Bing search engine. ] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With semantic technologies, which also are being to referred to as Web 3.0, computers have a greater understanding of relationships between different information, rather than just forwarding links based on keyword searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end game for semantic search is "better, faster, cheaper, essentially," said Prevost, who came over to Microsoft in the company's 2008 acquisition of search engine vendor Powerset. Prevost is still general manager of Powerset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semantic capabilities get users more relevant information and help them accomplish tasks and make decisions, said Prevost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Traditionally in the past 10 years, search has been about query and a page. It'll become more interactive, [with] more tools for helping people refine their queries. It's really going to be more about people making real-world decisions rather than just finding some links," Prevost said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts are under way to extend semantic search to include social networking posts. "I think there's all kinds of things you want to surface," Prevost said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the revolution is happening in Iran and people are using Twitter as the only form of communication, ideally, the search engine should understand what that is, understand from the social network what are the important communications and help to organize that," Prevost said. Search technology has not yet reached this stage, he said. "But we're getting there," said Prevost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information about anti-government protests in Iran last year was disseminated through Twitter messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, freshness of Web page remains critical, said Provost. "This has been sort of a driving aspect of search engine development for the past 10 years -- the drive to improve relevance," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing features semantic capabilities like presenting more readable captions based on linguistic and semantic analysis of content, said Prevost. &#160;The concept of entity extraction is leveraged in Bing, providing knowledge on phrases and what they uniquely refer to, Prevost said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft talks up semantic search ambitions," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

launching a worldwide business aimed at selling loans and
commercial banking services to multinational corporations, the
Financial Times reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new business, which will sell products ranging from

&lt;p&gt;And Amazon.com Inc blew past Wall Street profit estimates in its closely watched holiday quarter and forecast stronger-than-expected revenue for early 2010, sending its shares higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICROSOFT CORP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANDY MIEDLER, ANALYST, EDWARD JONES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Make no mistake, these are very good results out of Microsoft.

I'm surprised the stock is only up 20 cents. It should be up a couple bucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was probably that the Windows 7 units were underestimated. Maybe the average selling prices were underestimated. It also looked like the server business was better than most people thought. MSN Online also beat by a little bit, so maybe we are getting a little bit of a Bing effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Last year the stock was a big outperformer. A lot of people think the stock has already had its run. But I think with PCs doing this well and a new Office coming in June, that the stock can still outperform.

They beat by $800 million, which is good because that's a high margin business. They reiterated op-ex guidance for the year, which is also good. I think there could be some upside on the margins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRENDAN BARNICLE, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are outstanding numbers. 74 cents was comparable to the 59 cents people were expecting, so it was a big beat. The upside was in the Windows business and service and tools and office business. The online business came in line and the only business shy of expectations was Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The operating expenses were guided in line with previous guidance. The quarter is consistent with the strength in PCs and the early appeal of Windows 7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRIP CHOWDHRY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, GLOBAL EQUITIES RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They beat on top and bottom line, reflecting a strong product cycle for Windows 7 and server offerings. It also reflects the fact that people haven't updated their systems in the past several years, and have a compelling reason to buy new hardware and software and that's reflected in earnings and revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The calendar year 2010 will continue to be strong for Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SID PARAKH, ANALYST, MCADAMS WRIGHT RAGEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are just good numbers -- better than expected across the board, largely driven by PC sales. Relative to our estimates, most businesses had better revenues, except for the online services group. Otherwise, everything was far better than we thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Revenues in the Windows 7 business were $650 million, more than 10 percent above our estimates, which is a pretty big number. We did see a PC refresh cycle kick in and there was a lot of selling at the retail level. That's because Windows 7 is a good product. Most reviews so far have implied that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOAN TRAN, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft had an OK quarter. If you take out their revenue deferral, it came in a little bit softer than I expected. Microsoft is not really rebounding as much as the other companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's hard to say" how Microsoft did in comparison with Wall Street expectations. "Some analysts might have the deferral in there, others don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just looking at it straight year-over-year, they came in at about $17.3 billion (revenue) without the deferral. That's only about $700 million better than last year. And last year was much more difficult economically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say it was pretty lackluster (revenue growth), given how much bleaker things looked on the economic front last year. Other companies have rebounded much more than Microsoft has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're seeing PC units do well, Windows 7 is selling much better than Vista did. I think the concern is a lot of the new units might be coming from netbooks. Just smaller revenue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAXMI PORURI, SENIOR SOFTWARE-INTERNET ANALYST, PRIMARY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLOBAL RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They beat substantially on revenue, but I think the whisper number was a little higher on EPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the best product cycle in years. Everybody knows that. In the first half of this year, we will see if businesses will carry forward with their Windows plans, or delay it and stick with the versions they have of windows XP. That has been a pattern in '09. we'll see if businesses get out of that pattern."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMAZON.COM INC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCOTT TILGHMAN, ANALYST, HUDSON SQUARE RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would argue that probably the single biggest reason is gross margin... There's a sentiment around that metric that tends to move that stock sometimes more than the absolute performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The (consensus) expectations, as of this morning, was for that line item to be up 30 basis points... It was flat year-over-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bottom line was obviously much stronger than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Too often the investment community focuses on the gross margin line alone in evaluating Amazon, rather than looking at overall cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While they gave up a little bit in gross margin, they made it up elsewhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHARLES LIEBERMAN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, ADVISORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I guess you can't please all of the people all of the time, even when you come in higher than expected, but then Amazon is priced for perfection. It's a very expensive stock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMED KHORSAND, ANALYST, BWS FINANCIAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems like the operating margin is starting to improve. That in itself was a surprise. Their gross margin was lighter than I expected, but was offset by managing their operating expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The topline number was very good, much stronger than I was expecting. The bottom line was ahead and it seems like the company's operating margin is starting to improve and that in itself was a surprise. It seems that it's more oriented toward the operating structure of the company, since their costs were up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their gross margin was lighter in the quarter than I was expecting but they offset that by just managing their operating expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are trying to digest the numbers. There was some panic selling on the numbers. I think people saw the gross margin number and that's probably what caused the stock to react negatively initially, at the time of the release. I think it's people trying to understand if these are real operating numbers going forward from an operating structure standpoint, and if that's true, the company could, going forward, have an operating margin above 5 percent, which is exactly what the market's been looking for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAN GEIMAN, ANALYST, MCADAMS WRIGHT RAGEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know if it's buying the mystery selling the history... It seems to be the downdraft in the (stock) market that might be hitting them a little bit" at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers looked really strong, clearly beat expectations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the top end of the first-quarter EPS guidance worked out to about 60 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The guidance looks pretty strong to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Expectations were pretty high ... The thought was that they would have a pretty good quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FREDERICK W. MORAN, INTERNET ANALYST, BENCHMARK CO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bottom line is the fundamental story for Amazon of meaningful growth is not only intact and confirmed by the earnings report, they continue to surprise with nice upside beyond any reasonable expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So far I see no chinks in the armor of Amazon's earnings report. We'd be buyers of the stock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic and Jim Finkle in San Francisco, Martinne Geller and Caroline Valetkevitch in New York and Sue Zeidler and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

WellPoint Beats Zacks Estimate

WellPoint, Inc. (NYSE: WLP) reported fourth quarter as well as full-year results
for fiscal 2009. 

The company earned $1.16 per share in the fourth quarter as opposed to $1.34 in
the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter was $1.02.
For the full-year 2009, Well Point earned $6.09 which was above the year-ago
earnings of $5.48 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.91. 

Total operating revenues for the quarter came in at approximately $15.1 billion
as opposed to $15.4 billion in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily
attributable to lower fully insured enrollment in 2009, partially offset by the
rise in premium rate. Total operating revenues for 2009 came in at approximately
$60.83 billion as opposed to $61.58 billion in 2008. 

Operating gains for the Commercial Business segment decreased 56.5% to $316.8
million in the reported quarter. The decline was due to restructuring costs
incurred by WellPoint in addition to a reduction in fully insured enrollment and
an increase in the benefit expense ratio for the Local Group business. Operating
gains for the Consumer Business segment fell 32.6% to $158.9 million in the
quarter. The Other segment reported a 15.7% year-over-year increase in operating
gains. 

The health insurer completed the sale of NextRx subsidiaries to Express Scripts,
Inc (Nasdaq: ESRX) on Dec 1, 2009 and received consideration of $4.7 billion
from the transaction and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale totaling $3.8
billion in the reported quarter. 

UTX Beats by a Penny

United Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTX) reported fourth quarter 2009
earnings per share of $1.15, down 7% over the year-ago quarter. Results for the
current quarter include an $0.08 per share charge for restructuring costs net of
one-time items. This is ahead of Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share. 

Consolidated revenues for the quarter of $14.1 billion were 5% below the prior
year, including 6 points of organic decline and 1 point of net divestitures,
offset by 3 points of favorable foreign currency translation. Segment operating
margin at 13.7% was 110 basis points higher than in the prior year. 

Restructuring and other charges for the quarter were $135 million, bringing the
full year to $830 million. For the year, restructuring and other charges were
$0.46 of earnings per share, net of one-time gains. 

Share repurchase in the quarter was $320 million and totaled $1.1 billion for
the year. Acquisition spending was $703 million for the year with $146 million
in the fourth quarter. 

Cash and equivalents were $4.4 billion with long-term debt at $8.2 billion and
shareowners` equity at $20 billion. 

The company expects order rates will keep pressure on its top line, particularly
in the first half of 2010, and anticipates that benefits from structural cost
actions will allow it to deliver earnings growth of 7% to 13% with 2010 earnings
per share of $4.40 to $4.65. 

United Technologies Corp., based in Hartford, Connecticut, is a diversified
company providing high technology products and services to the building and
aerospace industries. Major competitors include General Electric Company (NYSE:
GE) and Honeywell International Inc (NYSE: HON).

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks featured in this
week`s analysis include Bank of Hawaii (NYSE: BOH), Bancorp South (NYSE: BXS),
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), Fifth Third (Nasdaq: FITB) and Regions Financial
(NYSE: RF). 

Zacks Industry Rank Analysis is written by Dirk Van Dijk, CFA, Chief Equity
Strategist, Zacks.com. 

Bad Banks

Many of the smaller regional banks have lots of exposure to commercial real
estate, and those loans are going sour at an alarming rate. The FDIC was very
busy last year taking over failed smaller banks, and it looks like their work is
not over. The list of troubled banks is almost 600 names long (not all of them
publically traded) and is growing each week. 

This is an area that I would be extremely cautious about investing in. This is
particularly true since the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) knuckled
under to Congressional Pressure last year and suspended the mark-to-market
accounting rules. This makes the financial statements of the banks even more
opaque than they used to be. It raises the question for many whether the book
values of these banks should be filed under fiction or non-fiction. 

Most of the banks that have the dreaded Zacks #5 Rank are small, with some of
the larger ones being Bank of Hawaii (NYSE: BOH) and Bancorp South (NYSE: BXS).
However, some of the biggest and most important banks hold Zacks #4 Ranks,
including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), Fifth Third (Nasdaq: FITB) and Regions
Financial (NYSE: RF).

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

QLogic Boosted by Enterprise Side

QLogic Inc. (Nasdaq: QLGC) reported third quarter earnings that beat the Zacks
Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. Revenue beat the consensus by 5.0%. 

Revenue

Revenue of $149.1 million was up 13.4% sequentially and down 8.9% year over
year. This was slightly better than the preliminary revenue of $147-149 million
announced on Jan 12, and significantly better than the original guidance of
$134-140 million. 

The company benefited from stronger enterprise spending and should continue to
do well in 2010, driven by improved IT spending, the ongoing server refresh
cycle, the transition to Intel Corp`s (Nasdaq: INTC) Nehalem products, adoption
of solutions from VMWare Inc. (NYSE: VMW) and the transition to Microsoft Corp`s
(Nasdaq: MSFT) Windows Server 2008 R2. 

Revenue by Segment

Host products generated 74% of revenue, increasing 17.5% sequentially and
declining 1.5% from the year-ago quarter. This was the most important driver of
business in the last quarter, as both the revenue share and the sequential
increase was the most significant in the last quarter. 

Network products, which generated 18% of revenue, grew 11.9% sequentially and
20.3% year over year. 

Silicon products (6% of total revenue) declined 9.7% sequentially and 47.5% from
the year-ago quarter. 

Royalty &amp; Service revenue comprised the remaining 2%, declining 22.3%
sequentially and growing 17.3% from the year-ago quarter. 

SAP Matches Estimates

SAP AG (NYSE: SAP) reported fourth quarter 2009 earnings per share from
continuing operations of 93 cents, matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate. 

For the quarter, U.S. GAAP software and software-related service revenues were
euro 2.57 billion, a decrease of 4%. U.S. GAAP total revenues were euro 3.19
billion ($4.71 billion), a decrease of 9% over the corresponding prior year
quarter. U.S. GAAP software revenues were euro 1.12 billion, a decrease of 15%. 

In the fourth quarter of 2009, SAP closed major contracts in several key regions
including Achmea and Rabobank Nederland, Aeroflot Russian Airlines, AOK, Credit
Agricole S.A., Deutsche Bank AG, Hilti AG, NMBS-SNCB Group, and Talanx AG in
EMEA; 3M Company, Baker &amp; McKenzie, Dairy Farmers of America, Inc., Pfizer Inc.,
Servicios Nacional de Chocolates S.A., Sybase Inc., Verizon Services
Corporation, and W.W. Grainger, Inc. in the Americas. 

U.S. GAAP operating margin was 33.1% (2008: 36.6%), a decrease of 3.5 percentage
points. U.S. GAAP income from continuing operations was euro 0.75 billion (2008:
euro 0.86 billion), a decrease of 13%.

&lt;p&gt; * Black steps down as investment bank executive chairman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Will focus on advising clients, working with regulators
 (Adds comments from Black)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Elinor Comlay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
named Steve Black vice chairman on Thursday and said he would
step down from day-to-day involvement in investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A long-time JPMorgan executive, Black, 57, had said in
September, after Dimon appointed Jes Staley CEO of the unit,
that he would eventually step back from the investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staley replaced Black and William Winters, previously
co-heads of the investment bank. Winters left JPMorgan, while
Black said he would stay on as executive chairman of the
business for a transition period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The transition to Jes Staley as CEO of the investment bank
has gone smoothly and quickly, and Steve has said that he would
like to focus more of his time on advising our clients," Chief
Executive and Chairman Jamie Dimon said in a statement. Dimon
and Black have known each other since they worked at Smith
Barney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The transition period had been slated to end later this
year, but Black said in an interview with Reuters that Staley
had got up to speed with the business quickly and it was better
for Black to cede the day-to-day business to him sooner rather
than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Now it's set up the way it's supposed to be run," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Black said he and Staley had also wanted to get through the
end of 2009 -- compensation season for banks -- before ending
the transition period. JPMorgan put aside a record $9.3 billion
to pay its investment bank employees for 2009 but its
compensation expense was just 33 percent of revenue, less than
the 45 to 50 percent industry standard of previous years.
[ID:nN15114920]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TRAVEL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Black said he is looking forward to spending time with
clients again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I've really been tied to my desk the last three years," he
said. "Now's a chance to get out and meet clients and I plan on
doing it all over the world," he added, noting that he just
returned from a one-day client meeting in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Black has agreed to stay with the bank for at least three
years, Dimon wrote in an internal memo that was obtained by
Reuters and confirmed by a spokeswoman. Black will report to
Dimon and continue to serve on the bank's operating committee.
In the new role, Black will also meet with global regulators,
the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, behind
Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), said this month that
fourth-quarter profit soared to $3.3 billion, helped in large
part by strong investment banking results. [ID:nN15183524]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unit topped rankings for equity capital markets in
2009, helped in part by its March 2008 acquisition of Bear
Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Black and Winters helped to steer JPMorgan's investment
bank through the financial crisis, when complex debt securities
linked to subprime mortgages caused huge losses for rivals. The
pair were also deeply involved in the Bear Stearns deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winters has yet to resurface at another firm.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Microsoft (MSFT.O) rose about 2 percent after the bell on Thursday as the company reported results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares were up at $29.75 after closing at $29.16 on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Updates options trading volume, prices, adds implied
volatility)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 28 (Reuters) - Options activity suggests
investors expect shares of Microsoft Inc (MSFT.O) to gain once
it reports quarterly results after the bell on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Activity leaned to the positive, although the market's
sharp decline Wednesday dented that optimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With less than half an hour of trading left, Microsoft
option volume was three times greater than it average daily
turnover with about 252,000 calls and 118,000 puts traded,
according to option analytics firm Trade Alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The average put-to-call ratio over the last 30 days has
been 0.57, said Interactive Brokers Group market analyst Andrew
Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's cautious optimism. There aren't as many puts being
traded as normally against the calls now, but not by much,"
Wilkinson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street expects Microsoft to post $17.9 billion in
revenue for the second quarter, up about 7 percent from a year
ago. The consensus estimate is 59 cents per share, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some speculative call buyers were betting on a rally, based
on positive earnings by tech majors Google (GOOG.O) and Apple
(AAPL.O) last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares were down 0.7 percent at $29.45 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most active February call strikes were the
out-of-the-money $31 and $30 strike prices, said Jon Najarian,
co-founder of optionMonster, a Web information site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joe Kunkle, a founder of Web site OptionsHawk.com, noted a
slight bullish bias on the at-the-money options along with some
buyers of the Feb $30/$31 call spreads, which would suggest
expectations for a small pop in shares after earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft February implied volatility stood at 38 percent
compared to March implied volatility of 31 percent and a
historic reading of 21 percent on the stock, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Implied volatility, a key component of an options price,
measures the expected magnitude of share price movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Market participants were concerned that the steep decline
in stocks would weigh on the software giant despite solid
results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street was down more than 1 percent, with the Nasdaq
falling more than 2 percent, weighed by outlooks from
technology companies and concerns about Greece's heavy debt
load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Angela Moon; Additional reporting by Doris

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Options activity suggests investors expect shares of Microsoft Inc to gain once it reports quarterly results after the bell on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity leaned to the positive, although the market's sharp decline Wednesday dented that optimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With one hour of trading left, Microsoft option volume is double the recent average daily turnover with about 203,000 calls and 93,000 puts traded, a put-to-call ratio of 0.46, according to option analytics firm Trade Alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average put-to-call ratio over the last 30 days has been 0.57, said Interactive Brokers Group market analyst Andrew Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's cautious optimism. There aren't as many puts being traded as normally against the calls now, but not by much," Wilkinson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street expects Microsoft to post $17.9 billion in revenue for the second quarter, up about 7 percent from a year ago.

&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp.'s media event yesterday may have lacked the gadget-y pizzazz of Apple Inc.'s iPad launch , but it had CEO Larry Ellison, who was his usual merry, brazen self and had attendees guffawing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle held the Webcast to outline its plans for Sun Microsoftsystems Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone tweeted afterward : "One hour of Larry Ellison QA more entertaining than the Jay Leno show."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than attack Microsoft Corp., Ellison aimed his verbal arrows at IBM, particularly its flagship database offering, DB2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of Ellison't statements on IBM follow, each with a response from IBM's director of product strategy, Bernie Spang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison: "Take IBM's DB2 database for Unix, what they used to call UDB. For OLTP applications, how many can they group together? Um, one. So when you're attacking a really big job, that's all they can do, one server. It can't scale out, it can't do cloud, it can't do clusters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spang: "We announced DB2 PureScale last fall and delivered it in December. Our lab tests show that even over 64 nodes [servers], we maintain 90% efficiency. We can go beyond 100 servers, while keeping 80% efficiency. That's important because if you are growing a cluster to handle bigger workloads, you want your hardware to be doing productive work, not handling system overhead. Oracle RAC [Real Application Clusters] has a 100 node limit. And to my knowledge, Oracle has yet to publish any efficiency numbers. I'd assert that's because they are afraid to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison: "You would've thought IBM, because they do hardware and software, would've come out with a database machine many years ago, it's so obvious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spang: "He's conveniently forgotten that we've had the InfoSphere Balanced Warehouse that's tuned for data warehouse workloads since 2008. And our original IMS systems have been integrated and tuned on our System Z platform for decades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison: "IBM is so far behind, they don't have any chance at all. In databases, they are a decade or so behind us. I'm serious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spang: "Methinks he doth protest too much. DB2 and DB2 on Power systems have been besting Oracle databases on Sun systems. We won over 100 new clients on DB2 who swapped out Oracle for their SAP systems and got better performance and lower costs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison: "They are not competitive in the database business except on the mainframe. I will grant you that the two best databases in the world are IBM on mainframes and Oracle. It's just that Oracle runs on modern computing hardware."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spang: "Well, he's half right. The System Zs and Power hardware are among the most advanced server hardware on the planet. No systems can match the System z for performance, throughput and scalability. Anyone who knows anything about those systems would get a chuckle out of Larry's comments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Lai covers Windows and Linux, desktop applications, databases and business intelligence for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Zeacom Gateway is the Doorway to Essential Functionality for SMEs;

Presence, Click-to-Dial, Remote Presence, and Desktop Sharing
IRVINE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Zeacom, the leading global provider of Unified Communications and contact center
software for small-to-medium-sized enterprises, today introduced the Zeacom
Gateway for Microsoft Office Communications Server (OCS). Microsoft OCS empowers
an enterprise to communicate seamlessly across and outside the business from one
desktop application, and from any Microsoft Office application. 

Zeacom President, Ernie Wallerstein, advised that "Zeacom and Microsoft -
through the Zeacom Gateway for Microsoft OCS - form the perfect marriage of
cost-effectiveness and communications for today`s small business." 

"Zeacom software empowers enterprises to maximize the investment value in their
current telephony infrastructure and equipment, and provides them with the
essential communications tools that are presently missing in their
communications framework. By leveraging Zeacom Gateway for Microsoft OCS,
employees instantly gain access to the most advanced Unified Communications
solutions available. We provide users with the simple access to OCS; with
Zeacom, users have the seamless, integrated access to manage their desktop phone
via OCS." 

Microsoft OCS gives end-users many different ways to communicate directly from
the context of their task by integrating into other Microsoft applications. For
example, customer service representatives could save tremendous amounts of time
by using "click-to-dial" directly from MS Outlook. Also of note, is that
Microsoft OCS integrates with most databases, CRM and workforce management
applications with off-the-shelf, easy to integrate modules. 

Industry analysts, such as Infonetics Research, predict a rise in SMB spending
on Unified Communications software across almost all vertical markets over the
next few years. What is important to note, is that Zeacom Communications Center
software has not only fueled a significant rise in demand for its own
award-winning products and services, but has also facilitated a higher
understanding of how Unified Communications provide cost-conscious
small-to-medium sized businesses with a significant competitive advantage.

More than 179,000 daily users within 2,800 small and medium-sized organizations

&lt;p&gt;Bloomingdale`s to Feature Special In-Store Exhibit &amp; Window Displays
GLENDALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney today announced a stunning collection of apparel and accessories inspired
by its upcoming feature Alice In Wonderland, Tim Burton`s highly anticipated
film, featuring favorite characters from the classic Lewis Carroll tales,
releasing on the big screen on March 5, 2010 (U.S. theaters). Disney Consumer
Products (DCP) collaborated with renowned jewelry designer, Tom Binns, leading
fashion designer Sue Wong and Swarovski, the world`s largest producer of cut
crystals, to create an interpretive line that brings the allure and mystery of
the film and characters to life. 

As part of the Alice fashion experience, DCP and Bloomingdale`s have joined
forces to create one-of-a-kind window displays at Bloomingdale's flagship 59th
Street store in New York City. The windows will feature props from the film and
highlight a selection of items from the designer line including Sue Wong for
Walt Disney Signature dresses and Tom Binns for Walt Disney Signature jewelry.
The windows at 59th street will be complemented by a special exhibit in the
contemporary sportswear department on the second floor, which will feature
select costumes and props detailed with information from the film. 

In addition, seven Bloomingdale`s stores across the U.S. including the NY
flagship store will enhance their Alice In Wonderland merchandise displays with
special signage and video screens that will play behind-the-scenes footage and
select bonus material. The stores include Beverly Center, CA, Century City, CA,
San Francisco, CA, South Coast Plaza, CA, Aventura, FL and Short Hills, NJ. The
Bloomingdale`s Alice In Wonderland-inspired windows and in-store displays are
planned to set in early March. 

"The arresting settings and characters in Tim Burton`s interpretation of Alice
In Wonderland provided great inspiration and have made it possible for us to
work with this renowned group of designers to create a truly unique collection
of lifestyle products that will continue to position Disney at the forefront of
fashion trends," said Pam Lifford, executive vice president, global fashion and
home, DCP. "Our collaboration with Bloomingdale`s brings it all together in a
way that is fun and interesting for consumers and Disney fans alike." 

Launching at retail from February, the collections include:

TOM BINNS

Council of Fashion Designers of America winner Tom Binns has worked his unique
flair on two jewelry collections in association with Disney, which will each
feature designs influenced by the story`s principal characters including Alice,
the Mad Hatter, the Red Queen, the White Queen and the White Rabbit. The first
collection, the Tom Binns for Walt Disney Signature line will offer a limited
edition collection of six high-end jewelry pieces designed in Binns` coveted
runway style; it will be available at luxury retailers and fine boutiques with a
price range from $600 - $1000. The second collection Tom Binns for Disney
Couture will be for Disney`s popular jewelry line and will offer 35 pieces,
again all featuring Binns` unique design style. This line will also include
pieces inspired by the Cheshire Cat, the tea party, the talking flower garden,
and will incorporate elements such as photo inlay, lace accents and Swarovski
crystals. This collection will be available at department stores and specialty
boutiques with a retail price range from $50 - $250. Assorted items will also be
available at select Disney Store retail locations. 

SUE WONG

Sue Wong for Walt Disney Signature will feature pieces influenced by key story
characters and locations, including Alice, the Red Queen, the White Queen, the
White Rabbit and the talking flower garden. The Alice In Wonderland-inspired
collection will showcase unique details inspired by the film, such as Victorian
antique lace and vibrant details, while offering Sue Wong`s signature style:
romance, femininity and exquisite hand-craftsmanship. Ranging from $329 to $609,
the Sue Wong for Walt Disney Signature collection will be available in fine
department stores such as Bloomingdale`s, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue,
Nordstrom`s, Lord and Taylor and Macy`s, as well as on www.SueWong.com. 

SWAROVSKI

Swarovski is launching an all new collection of jewelry pieces that will take
consumers inside the world of "Underland" to commune with the unexpectedly mad
and caring characters. Capturing the spirit of each character in the film, the
line features a host of vintage and gothic details inspired by the outlandish
personalities found down the rabbit hole, and demonstrates the attention to
detail in products that are the result of the long collaboration between Disney
and Swarovski. The line features 17 pieces including pendants, necklaces, rings
and earrings inspired by the Red Queen, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the
White Rabbit as well as by the film`s beautiful settings including the talking
flower garden and by other Alice icons such as teapots, cupcakes and keys.
Ranging from $80 - $350, the line will be available at select department stores,
at Swarovski retail stores and online at www.Swarovski.com, with select pieces
at www.DisneyStore.com. 

DCP also collaborated with leading cosmetics brands Urban Decay and OPI to round
out the Alice In Wonderland lifestyle product assortment: 

URBAN DECAY

Urban Decay has designed a limited-edition Alice In Wonderland-inspired Book of
Shadows. The book of 16 gorgeous eye shadow shades was inspired by Alice`s
whimsical and colorful adventure - a "curiouser and curiouser" hike through
twisted vines and skyscraping toadstools. The palette opens to a playful pop-up
scene of Alice and her journey through the mushroom forest. Having just ingested
the contents of the fabled "drink me" bottle, Alice has shrunk down to a tiny
size and is staring upward toward gigantic mushrooms and one very peculiar
caterpillar. The mirror rests in the background, transporting you into the film
itself. The book-like cover is adorned with a lush black pattern and copper foil
deco with teacup details. The Alice Book of Shadows offers 16 best-selling eye
shadows, as well as two travel sizes of 24/7 Eye Pencils and one Eyeshadow
Primer Potion. DCP and Urban Decay worked together to develop names for the eye
shadows reflective of the many topsy-turvy people and things in Underland:
Underland, Alice, Oraculum, Queen, Chessur, White Rabbit, Wonderland, Curiouser,
Muchness, Mushroom, Midnight Tea Party, Vorpal, Absolem, Drink Me, Eat Me, Mad
Hatter, Jabberwocky. It`s available for $52 at Sephora, ULTA and Macy`s or
online at sephora.com, ulta.com, macys.com, and urbandecay.com. 

OPI

OPI will debut four limited-edition Nail Lacquer shades inspired by Alice In
Wonderland. The fantastical shades include: "Absolutely Alice" - an absolutely
amazing blue glitter; "Thanks So Muchness!" - a "much-have" red shimmer; "Off
with Her Red!" - a glowering, empowering hot red; and "Mad as a Hatter" - a
madly marvelous black-multi glitter. The spectacular colors are featured in a
beautiful movie-themed display. The Alice In Wonderland-inspired Nail Lacquers
by OPI are available at professional salons, including Beauty Brands, Beauty
First, Chatters, Dillard`s, JCPenney, Pure Beauty, Regis, Trade Secret, and Ulta
for $8.50 suggested retail per Nail Lacquer.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Jan 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Hive Awards, which honors the unsung heroes of the internet, and SXSW
Interactive Festival have joined forces to celebrate the 2009 Award
winners at the first annual Hive Awards presentation in Austin, Texas.
The ceremony, which includes Microsoft Bing among its sponsors, is
presented by International Awards Group and will take place at 8pm on
Friday, March 12th at Austin's Red7.

    "We are thrilled to be a part of 2010 SXSW Interactive. It's like a dream
come true," said Hive Awards Director Alan Wolk. "Someone asked me if
there was any overlap between our audience and SXSW's audience. I told
them that if you expressed that relationship as a Venn diagram, it would
just be one circle sitting on top of another -- SXSW is our exact
demographic."

    SXSW Interactive Festival is known as an incubator for emerging
technologies, assembling the world's most innovative designers, bloggers,
programmers, web developers, content producers, widget inventors and new
media entrepreneurs for five days of total technological immersion. This
environment allows the Hive Awards the opportunity to salute its winners
amongst their peers and honor them for their innovation and creativity
within the internet industry.

    Among the Hive Awards' 2010 award presentation sponsors is Microsoft Bing,
the internet's new decision engine. "I really like Bing -- and I'm not
just saying that because they're a sponsor," said Wolk. "First off, I
think it's important that there be some competition in the search market
-- in any market, for that matter, but certainly one as important as
search. And I like what they've done -- the mapping function is really
nicely put together."

    The Hive Awards, whose name comes from the "hive mentality" inherent in
building a website, is a tribute to those with a myriad of different roles
who must work together. Launched by noted blogger and digital strategist
Wolk, the Hive Awards rewards coders, programmers, content developers,
user experience designers and planners for their innovative work within
their industry.

    The Hive Awards Advisory Board is comprised of industry professionals
representing the most influential minds in the web community. 2009 Hive
Awards Advisory board Members are listed on the Hive Awards website at
http://www.hiveawards.com/content/advisory-board

    Due to popular demand, the 2009 Hive Awards entry deadline has been
extended until February 15th, 2010. To submit an entry please go to:
http://hiveawards.com/content/entries

    All winning entries of the 2009 Hive Awards will be featured in the

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer defended the company's presence in China in a message on Wednesday, after Chinese media seized on a statement by Bill Gates about Chinese Web censorship being "very limited."&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"We have done business in China for more than 20 years and we intend to stay engaged, which means our business must respect the laws of China,"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer wrote on a Microsoft blog. "Microsoft is opposed to restrictions on peaceful political expression, and we have conversations with governments to make our views known." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message came after Chinese state-run newspapers this week prominently quoted Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates playing down China's Internet censorship. "Bill Gates bats for China," read a top headline in the English version of the state-run Global Times. The official China Daily also ran the comments by Gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The articles were part of a Chinese media blitz defending the country's Internet regulation after Google recently threatened to leave China over censorship and hacking attempts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately the Chinese efforts to censor the Internet have been very limited," Gates said this week in an interview on ABC's Good Morning America. "It's easy to go around" the government controls, he said. China blocks Web sites like YouTube and Facebook, but savvy Internet users there can still access them via proxy servers or other tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Different countries have different rules about censorship," Gates said. "So you've got to decide, do you want to obey the laws of the countries you're in or not?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has said it plans to stop following China's requirement to censor search results on its China-based search engine, even if that means being forced out of the country altogether. Ballmer reacted earlier this month by saying Microsoft would stay in China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Jan 28 (Reuters) - Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
(8316.T) said Goldman Sachs  Co (GS.N) had converted its 100
billion yen ($1.11 billion) of preferred shares in the Japanese
lender, effectively ending a capital tie-up that has lasted more
than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sumitomo Mitsui said in a statement that Goldman had
converted the 33,400 preferred shares to 36,343,200 common
shares. The acquisition price was 2,757 yen per share, Sumitomo
Mitsui said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move was widely anticipated, as Sumitomo Mitsui said in
January it expected Goldman to convert the shares. Preferred
shares do not count toward the "high quality" capital that will
be emphasised under stricter international banking regulations
now being finalised by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the common stock acquired by Goldman will be used to
close out a hedge position and will not be sold on the market,
Sumitomo Mitsui said.

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY/ANCHORAGE (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO) and partner Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) boosted their cost estimates for a planned line to carry Alaska gas to southern markets by up to 58 percent on Friday, as the two ready plans to sign up shippers for the massive project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies said the cost of the 1,700 mile pipeline carrying at least 4.5 billion cubic feet of gas daily from Alaska's North Slope to Alberta will range between $32 billion and $41 billion, up from a previous $26 billion forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line, mulled for more than a generation, would be among the largest and most expensive civil engineering projects ever undertaken in North America, requiring years of planning and construction and massive financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No matter how you measure it, the Alaska Pipeline Project would be an exceptional world leading project and one of the largest private investments in the history of North America," Paul Pike, Exxon Mobil's senior project manager for the line, said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Alaska, which depends on oil for nearly all its state operating revenues, a natural gas pipeline is seen as economically crucial. North Slope oil production has dwindled to a third of the 2 million-barrel-a-day peak reached in 1988, and continues to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some political leaders hailed Friday's announcement as a big step toward reaching the gas pipeline goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bringing Alaska's gas to market presents a tremendous economic opportunity for the state," Alaska Governor Sean Parnell said in a statement. "Alaskans have waited 30 years to advance this project, and today's news marks a significant milestone in achieving this opportunity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A smaller line, running from the gas fields of the North Slope to a separately built liquefied natural gas facility near Valdez, Alaska, would cost between $20 billion and $26 billion and could be built instead of the larger project if shippers chose the option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backers said their cost estimate rose over initial projections because of an extension of the line to the Point Thomson field on Alaska's North Slope, an expanded gas-processing plant and more detailed engineering than first available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEN SEASON PLANNED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new estimate for the lines, which could be in service by 2020, came as the partners filed plans with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to hold an open season to attract potential shippers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This open season will test potential customers' interest in utilizing the Alaska Pipeline Project to transport their natural gas to market," said Tony Palmer, TransCanada's vice-president of Alaska development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calgary-based TransCanada is the state of Alaska's preferred pipeline sponsor and holder of a state license under the Alaska Gasoline Inducement Act (AGIA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added U.S. energy major Exxon Mobil, one of the three major North Slope natural gas producers, as a partner to its proposal last year. The other two producers, BP Plc (BP.L) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) are backing a rival pipeline plan of their own and Exxon itself has yet to commit its gas to the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the two partners expect that they've squeezed the cost for shippers down, making their proposal attractive. They plan to a 20 percent capital risk in the project, reducing the costs needed to be covered by customers by between $6 billion and $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well, they've cut their planned return on equity to 12 percent instead of the 14 percent return TransCanada had forecast in its AGIA filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including those cuts and other smaller factors, the partners expect shippers who commit during the open season will pay $500 million less per year on tolls than forecast in the AGIA application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Assuming that FERC approves our plan as filed, and ... the customers commit their gas in that initial open season, they will see lower tariffs," Palmer said. "They will see lower tolls to their account on the order of $500 million per year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the rival Denali project, backed by BP and Conoco, is going ahead as planned, with its own open season scheduled to launch in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am confident that we will have an attractive commercial offer for our potential customers," said Bud Fackrell, Denali's president. "Today's announcement by TransCanada and Exxon doesn't change anything for us. We're on track."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TransCanada has offered BP and Conoco an equity stake in its project, saying the support of all three producers, as well as the state, is needed before its project proceeds. However negotiations with the rival producers have yet to take place .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TransCanada and Exxon filed plans for the open season with FERC, which has 90 days to approve the proposal. A separate open season will be staged for the Canadian portion of the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TransCanada shares fell 11 Canadian cents to C$34.17 on the Toronto Stock Exchange while Exxon dropped 53 cents to $64.43 in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jeffrey Hodgson and Rob Wilson)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds details on estimate hike. In U.S. dollars unless noted)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Scott Haggett and Yereth Rosen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CALGARY/ANCHORAGE, Jan 29 (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp
(TRP.TO) and partner Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) boosted their
cost estimates for a planned line to carry Alaska gas to

from Alaska's North Slope to Alberta will range between $32
billion and $41 billion, up from a previous $26 billion
forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The line, mulled for more than a generation, would be among
the largest and most expensive civil engineering projects ever
undertaken in North America, requiring years of planning and
construction and massive financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No matter how you measure it, the Alaska Pipeline Project
would be an exceptional world leading project and one of the
largest private investments in the history of North America,"
Paul Pike, Exxon Mobil's senior project manager for the line,
said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Alaska, which depends on oil for nearly all its state
operating revenues, a natural gas pipeline is seen as
economically crucial. North Slope oil production has dwindled

Valdez, Alaska, would cost between $20 billion and $26 billion
and could be built instead of the larger project if shippers
chose the option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The backers said their cost estimate rose over initial
projections because of an extension of the line to the Point
Thomson field on Alaska's North Slope, an expanded
gas-processing plant and more detailed engineering than first
available.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OPEN SEASON PLANNED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new estimate for the lines, which could be in service
by 2020, came as the partners filed plans with the U.S. Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to hold an open season to
attract potential shippers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This open season will test potential customers' interest
in utilizing the Alaska Pipeline Project to transport their
natural gas to market," said Tony Palmer, TransCanada's
vice-president of Alaska development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Calgary-based TransCanada is the state of Alaska's
preferred pipeline sponsor and holder of a state license under
the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act (AGIA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It added U.S. energy major Exxon Mobil, one of the three
major North Slope natural gas producers, as a partner to its
proposal last year. The other two producers, BP Plc (BP.L) and
ConocoPhillips (COP.N) are backing a rival pipeline plan of

plan to a 20 percent capital risk in the project, reducing the
costs needed to be covered by customers by between $6 billion
and $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As well, they've cut their planned return on equity to 12
percent instead of the 14 percent return TransCanada had
forecast in its AGIA filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Including those cuts and other smaller factors, the
partners expect shippers who commit during the open season will
pay $500 million less per year on tolls than forecast in the
AGIA application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Assuming that FERC approves our plan as filed, and ...
the customers commit their gas in that initial open season,
they will see lower tariffs," Palmer said. "They will see lower
tolls to their account on the order of $500 million per year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the rival Denali project, backed by BP and Conoco,

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will discuss a new version of its Windows Mobile operating system next month at the Windows Mobile Congress in Barcelona, company representatives said during its earnings call on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're working very hard on the next version of Windows Mobile," said Peter Klein, Microsoft's chief financial officer.  "We'll be talking more about that in Barcelona in a few weeks." &#160; Earlier in the call, General Manager of Investor Relations for Microsoft Bill Koefoed also made a reference to Windows Mobile. "We also continue to make progress in the mobile space, and you will hear more about that at Mobile World Congress in February," Koefoed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which Windows Mobile Version?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statements by Klein and Koefoed reiterate statements made by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer that the company would make a Windows Mobile announcement in Barcelona.  But it's not clear yet what Microsoft will unveil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many expect Microsoft to discuss Windows Mobile 7 -- the next major upgrade for Microsoft's mobile OS.  But Microsoft has cast some doubt on that assertion in recent weeks.  Earlier this month, Beta News posted an interview with Windows Phone Senior Marketing Manager Greg Sullivan discussing what Beta News believed to be a preview of WM7.  However, Beta News later reported that Microsoft contacted the blog and said Sullivan's comments were not specifically about WM7.  This led Beta News to believe Microsoft will not be discussing WM7 next month in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that's the case, then Microsoft may be announcing a rumored Windows Mobile 6.6, which is said to be an incremental upgrade from Windows Mobile 6.5.  Another popular prediction says Microsoft will announce its oft-rumored Zune Phone in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Mobile 7: Rumors, Delays&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WM7 is drawing a lot of speculation and interest because it should be the next major release from Microsoft in the face of the increasing popularity of competing Android and Apple iPhone handsets.  Current rumors suggest there may be two versions of WM7 -- a business and a media edition -- and the new OS may include some kind of integration with Xbox LIVE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Mobile 7 was expected to launch this year, but some rumors suggest the Mobile OS may be delayed until 2011.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Option activity in Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) picked up on Friday as investors brace for potential share price movement after the oil company reports quarterly results on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil shares briefly touched lows not hit since March 2009 after earnings from Chevron Corp (CVX.N) which missed Wall Street expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the options market, about 90,000 calls changed hands in Exxon, double their average daily volume and more than three times the number of put options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are seeing signs from the options market that risk expectations for Exxon Mobil are relatively high ahead of next week's earnings report," said Ryan Renicker, equity derivatives strategist at Ticonderoga Securities, an institutional broker-dealer in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Option implied volatility, a key component of an options price, measures the expected magnitude of share price movement and often moves up ahead of an event such as earnings that could potentially jolt the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stock's average implied volatility is up two percent to 25 percent as investors look for potential volatility around the earnings release," said WhatsTrading.com option strategist Frederic Ruffy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's at-the-money option implied volatility stood at 21 percent compared to historical volatility of 13.4 percent on the stock over the past 22 trading days, Renicker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a research note on Friday, Renicker recommended that investors should consider a covered call strategy to cushion their existing positions heading into the earnings report after Chevron reported a decline in quarterly profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, on Friday posted a 37 percent drop in quarterly profit as refining margins have suffered with pricier oil lifting costs even as the weak economy has shrunk fuel demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe these same factors could weigh on Exxon when the company reports next week," Renicker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts expect Exxon Mobil to report a profit of $1.19 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon shares fell 53 cents to $64.43 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Traders looking at technical levels would consider Exxon shares to be vulnerable if they break key support at $64.46 a level established on July 13, 2009," Renicker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renicker suggests that investors hedge their long exposure to Exxon by selling near-term February $65 call strikes for a premium of about $1.08 in a so-called overwrite, a strategy that combines stock ownership and options trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These calls are trading relatively rich when compared to Exxon's shares recent historical volatility," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy would allow investors a partial hedge against a downside move in Exxon shares while at the same time giving them upside exposure up to $66.08 -- the break-even point of the call trade as of February 20 expiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There has been quite bit of sellers of the Feb $65 calls today," said TD Ameritrade chief derivatives strategist Joe Kinahan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons for it, he said.

&lt;p&gt; *Exxon shares briefly notch 10-month lows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *Exxon breaks key support at $64.46 a share&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Doris Frankel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHICAGO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Option activity in Exxon Mobil
Corp  (XOM.N)  picked up on Friday as investors brace for
potential share price movement after the oil company reports
quarterly results on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil shares briefly touched lows not hit since March
2009 after earnings from Chevron Corp (CVX.N) which missed Wall
Street expectations. For details, please see [nN29120138].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the options market, about 90,000 calls changed hands in
Exxon, double their average daily volume and more than three
times the number of put options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are seeing signs from the options market that risk
expectations for Exxon Mobil are relatively high ahead of next
week's earnings report," said Ryan Renicker, equity derivatives
strategist at Ticonderoga Securities, an institutional
broker-dealer in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Option implied volatility, a key component of an options
price, measures the expected magnitude of share price movement
and often moves up ahead of an event such as earnings that
could potentially jolt the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The stock's average implied volatility is up two percent
to 25 percent as investors look for potential volatility around
the earnings release," said WhatsTrading.com option strategist

percent compared to historical volatility of 13.4 percent on
the stock over the past 22 trading days, Renicker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a research note on Friday, Renicker recommended that
investors should consider a covered call strategy to cushion
their existing positions heading into the earnings report after
Chevron reported a decline in quarterly profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, on Friday
posted a 37 percent drop in quarterly profit as refining
margins have suffered with pricier oil lifting costs even as
the weak economy has shrunk fuel demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I believe these same factors could weigh on Exxon when the
company reports next week," Renicker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street analysts expect Exxon Mobil to report a profit
of $1.19 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon shares fell 53 cents to $64.43 on the New York Stock
Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Traders looking at technical levels would consider Exxon
shares to be vulnerable if they break key support at $64.46 a
level established on July 13, 2009," Renicker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Renicker suggests that investors hedge their long exposure
to Exxon by selling near-term February $65 call strikes for a
premium of about $1.08 in a so-called overwrite, a strategy
that combines stock ownership and options trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These calls are trading relatively rich when compared to
Exxon's shares recent historical volatility," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strategy would allow investors a partial hedge against
a downside move in Exxon shares while at the same time giving
them upside exposure up to $66.08 -- the break-even point of
the call trade as of Feb. 20 expiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There has been quite bit of sellers of the Feb $65 calls
today," said TD Ameritrade chief derivatives strategist Joe

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

iPad Strengthens Apple`s Potential

Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) introduced the much-anticipated Apple tablet computer
called the iPad, which will drive the fortunes of the company. Apple is widely
recognized as a leading innovator in the consumer electronics market. While the
iPhone and the iPod have been tremendously successful, driving growth at Apple,
we believe the iPad has the potential to help the company sustain its recent
growth momentum. 

Apple appears to be riding an impressive wave of successes in its product
portfolio. The overall buzz about the company, whether in the mainstream media
or on Wall Street, remains very positive. This is evident in trends in the
company`s earnings estimates, which have been up following the company's recent
quarterly report. While the iPad is not expected to have an impact on near-term
earnings, it nevertheless is a boost to the company`s long-term earnings power. 

Estimate Revisions Going Up

One wrinkle in the company`s fiscal first-quarter outperformance was the role of
new accounting principles in those impressive numbers. But the company`s results
were stellar either way. Nevertheless, those accounting changes did figure into
the improved guidance for the fiscal second quarter. The company now expects to
earn in the range of $2.06 to $2.18 per share in the fiscal second quarter, up
from $1.79 in the year-ago quarter. 

We should, however, keep the company`s history of guidance conservatism while
looking at their current guidance. And this is evident from recent estimate
revisions. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for $2.31 per share in
earnings, much above the company`s own expectation. Estimates appear to be up
significantly, with 19 of the 40 analysts covering the stock raising second
quarter estimates in the last 30 days. 

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter of $2.31 is up from
$1.76 in the last 7 days alone. If fiscal second-quarter earnings come inline
with expectations, they would be up almost 74% from the year-earlier level. 

Apple`s fiscal first-quarter results were a record for the company, fueled by
strong Mac and iPhone sales. This enabled it to produce a positive earnings
surprise of more than 76%. The company has been producing positive earnings
surprises in the preceding quarters as well, the with the four-quarter average
exceeding 35%. 

Overall, Apple`s earnings performance has been way above expectations, and we
expect the company to report stronger results in fiscal 2010. On average, 25 out
40 analysts raised their full-year numbers in the last 7 days. With the
introduction of the Apple tablet, we believe the company`s long-term growth
story becomes more visible. 

Taking on Amazon`s Kindle

While the iPad has a lot more functionality than just book reading, it is
nevertheless a direct competitor Amazon`s (Nasdaq: AMZN) pioneering ebook
reader, the Kindle. In fact, Apple CEO Steve Jobs even acknowledged Amazon`s
role in pioneering and developing the ebook market. It will be interesting to
watch these two major players duke it out in this fledgling market. The
company`s aggressive pricing of the product, much below the rumored price
levels, points to its seriousness in capturing market share. 

While it is way too early to definitely say anything about the evolving
landscape of the ebook industry, Apple`s product does offer a lot more
functionality, not to mention the company`s iconic flair for design, than
Amazon`s Kindle. The iPad can be used for web browsing, reading and sending
email, viewing photos, watching videos, listening to music, playing games and
reading e-books. It has a touch screen and comes with 16, 32 or 64 gigabytes of
flash memory storage and built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. It includes
features such as the high-resolution multi-touch display and is much thinner and
lighter than any laptop or netbook available in the market. 

iPad includes 12 new apps designed especially for the iPad, and will run almost
all of the over 140,000 apps in the Apple App Store, including apps purchased
for iPhone or iPod touch. iPad syncs with iTunes, just like an iPhone or iPod
Touch. It can also sync with Apple's Macintosh and Microsoft's (Nasdaq: MSFT)
Windows computers. 

iPad comes in two versions, one with Wi-Fi and the other with both Wi-Fi and 3G.
It also has a battery based on ARM Holdings` (Nasdaq: ARMH) technology that
lasts 10 hours and can be used for a month on standby without needing to charge.


Aggressive Pricing to Capture Market Share

Apple`s enormous fan base had hyped this product for weeks, if not months,
before its launch yesterday. The prices mentioned in those discussions were
significantly above where the company announced them. The iPad is available
starting at just $499 for the 16GB model, going up to $599 for the 32GB model. 

While the price is below analysts` expectations of $1000, we still feel it is
expensive. This is because the 64GB model will come for $699 and users will be
required to buy the higher GB version to get the benefits of higher
functionality. The aggressive pricing, with the start-up model at $499, appears
to be aimed at Amazon Kindle, whose high-end reader, the Kindle DX, is priced at
$489. 

The Wi-Fi only version will begin shipping in late March and the 3G version will
be available in April via AT (NYSE: T). Two data plans from AT in the U.S.
were also announced with $14.99 per month for 250 megabytes of data and $29.99
for unlimited data usage.

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Durable Goods Orders Rise a Bit

Perhaps the most important of the "deep in the seeds" numbers in this report is
non-defense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft, also known as core capital
goods orders. That is a very good measure of how much companies are investing in
equipment and software, which are two of the direct inputs into GDP. These rose
by 1.3% following a 3.1% rise in November. 

In another optimistic sign, orders for motor vehicles rose by 3.6% -- the third
increase in a row -- and a big acceleration from the 0.7% rise in November.
Unfortunately, the report does not break out how much of that is coming from
automakers like Ford (NYSE: F) and how much is coming from heavy trucks makers
like Paccar (Nasdaq: PCAR). 

Year-Over-Year Numbers

The December report also provides the full-year differences in new orders for
all of 2009 relative to 2008, and reminds us of just how nasty this downturn has
been (and remember that 2008 was not exactly a banner year). Total new orders
were down 20.2%, excluding transportation orders were down 17.7%, and excluding
Defense orders were down 21.4%. 

The non-defense aircraft industry saw a stunning 51.6% full-year decline. That
area not only includes jumbo jets from Boeing (NYSE: BA), but also light
aircraft from places like Textron`s (NYSE: TXT) Cessna division. 

Many businesses have decided the impression that buying a new corporate jet
gives is not that great when so many people are hurting. Total non-defense
capital goods orders were down 24.6% for the year, and even with aircraft
excluded they are down 18.4%. 

P Reports Strong 2nd Quarter

The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) reported results for the second quarter
of fiscal 2010 with earnings of $1.10 per share, below the Zacks Consensus
Estimate of $1.37 but up 22% year-over-year. 

Net sales for the quarter increased 6.4% year-over-year to $21.0 billion, driven
by a 5% growth in unit volume, 1% benefit from pricing and positive currency
translations of 2% contributing to the top line, partially offset by a 2%
negative impact from geographic mix. Successful product launches, supported by
marketing initiatives, also contributed to the top line. Organic sales grew 5%
during the quarter, driven by volume and pricing.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp posted a drop in quarterly profit on Friday, and its new boss said the second-largest U.S. oil company had plenty of work to do on its own project line-up without making any big acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive John Watson also said there would be no refinery closures in the near term, despite a bad performance in the fourth quarter that weighed heavily on its bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) planned purchase of U.S. natural gas producer XTO Energy XTO.N cast the industry's attention on how Exxon's smaller rivals might respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's anticipated 2010 production growth will not come anywhere close to the 9 percent fourth-quarter increase, but Watson, who just took over the top job at the start of January, said the company's long-term pipeline was very full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can see growth out through the rest of this decade, and so we haven't been particularly needy, if you will, to do a large transaction," he told analysts on a conference call. "We haven't felt that the opportunities that are out there compete with other things that we have in our portfolio."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, the company will be spending heavily off the coast of Western Australia this year, with $3.5 billion of its $21.6 billion capital spending budget going toward construction of its massive natural gas operations there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, fourth-quarter profit fell 37 percent, as refining margins have suffered with pricier oil lifting costs even as the weak economy has shrunk fuel demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That weakness overshadowed a steep 9 percent rise in oil and gas output in the quarter from new and expanded projects, which lifted proved reserves by 1.1 billion barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's like trying to run at 40 miles per hour in a boat while dragging an anchor," said James Halloran, energy advisor at Financial America Securities in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter profit fell to $3.07 billion, or $1.53 per share, from $4.9 billion, or $2.44 per share, a year before, with Chevron being hit by negative currency moves and a lack of derivative gains and a $600 million asset swap a year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earnings figure was far short of the $1.70 per share analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, hit by a steeper-than-expected $613 million refining, marketing and transportation loss, versus a year-ago profit of $2.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts were still encouraged by Chevron's reserve replacement of about 112 percent in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson, on his first call with analysts since becoming CEO, said it was "quite premature" to talk of closing refineries, but he would seek cost cuts and aim for a 10 percent-plus downstream return through the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron will merge its chemicals arm with the rest of the downstream business, and retain a spending bias that will shift its focus over time to exploration and production, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have favored upstream investment for more than the last decade. That has been a pattern I think you will see going forward," Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is looking for modest production growth of about 1 percent this year, at 2.73 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, with output from new projects more than offsetting a base business decline of about 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Production at Chevron was 2.78 million boe per day in the fourth quarter, including 135,000 bpd associated with the ramp-up at Agbami in Nigeria, which commenced operations in the third quarter of 2008, and expansion at Tengiz in Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock fell 1.02 percent to $72.19 on Friday, in line with the Standard  Poor's Energy index .GSPE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, ConocoPhillips (COP.N) posted better-than-expected earnings as the firmer oil prices offset its weak refinery performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon reports fourth-quarter results on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Daily in New York and Braden Reddall in San Francisco; Editing by Dave Zimmerman, Gunna Dickson and Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology Leaders Team Up to Provide Retailers New Ways to Use Social Media to
Drive Engagement
AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Demand Media, provider of the industry-leading Pluck social media tools to
retailers and brands, today announced that its platform is integrated with
WebSphere Commerce 7 to offer social commerce capabilities to IBM`s customer
base. With this seamless implementation, retailers can leverage social media and
online social networks to bring brand and product discussions back to the
retailer's site and to help convert them into transactions. 

As retailers take a broader perspective on the potential power of their online
destination, many are looking to social media as part of a proven formula to
grow unique visitors to their sites, increase engagement and conversion rates,
and lower operational costs. Dubbed "social commerce," this is the term that
describes how retailers integrate social media elements - user generated content
platforms and social networking features - directly into their commerce
environments. 

"By building and maintaining vibrant communities that tap into the passion
inherent in the retailer`s core audience, and then spreading that passion to the
larger Social Web, retailers will scale their businesses and engender more loyal
and engaged customers," said Steve Semelsberger, senior vice president and
general manager of Enterprise for Demand Media. "This is the real definition of
social commerce: A more efficient retail environment where customer opinions,
relevant content, and product information are freely distributed, to the benefit
of both customers and retailers." 

Using the Pluck social media features within WebSphere Commerce 7, customers
have complete control over where these social elements appear and how they look
and behave. This is the result of Pluck`s flexible architecture and API-based
approach as well as its integration with WebSphere sMash, IBM`s development and
execution platform for quickly building agile, web-based applications shipped
with WebSphere Commerce 7. Developers can easily drop Pluck-powered forums,
ratings and reviews, blogs, photo and video galleries, user profiles and other
social features into their e-commerce applications. 

"Retailers were among the first to truly understand the social aspects of the
web, developing powerful word-of-mouth capabilities, and today we believe they
have the biggest opportunity to leverage social media for the benefit of their
customers," said Don Boulia, Director, Product Management, WebSphere Software at
IBM. "Pluck has tightly integrated the social experience with online shopping
and extended it to capitalize on popular social communities such as Facebook,
MySpace and blogs. WebSphere Commerce's open approach to social networking
integration allows partners such as Pluck to easily create an online social
experience encompassing the entire customer lifecycle that lets retailers make
dramatic improvements in site traffic, engagement, and conversion rates." 

The Pluck social media platform offers comprehensive social media capabilities
and is broadly deployed on more than 440 leading digital destinations. Pluck
capabilities are seamlessly integrated via easy-to-install widgets and a robust
set of platform-level APIs that allow site owners to tailor social media
experiences to the needs of their distinct audiences. 

About Demand Media

As the leader in distributed social media, Demand Media makes possible more than
3 billion conversations every month. Demand Media`s Pluck enterprise group
delivers world-class platform technology and services for integrated social
media and currently powers community for leading digital destinations including
BF Goodrich, GlaxoSmithKline, Kraft, Lowe`s Home Improvement, New Balance,

&lt;p&gt; (In U.S. dollars)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta Jan 29 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) and partner TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO) have boosted
their cost estimates for a planned line to carry Alaska gas to
Alberta to between $32 billion and $41 billion, up from a
previous $26 billion forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A smaller line, running from the gas fields of Alaska's
North Slope to a liquefied natural gas facility near Valdez,
Alaska, would cost between $20 billion and $26 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new estimate for the lines, which could be in service
by 2020, came as the partners filed plans to hold an open
season to attract potential shippers with the U.S. Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Jan 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Technology firms were clear winners in 2009, regaining over $1.1 trillion
in market value, or about 72% of the value they lost in 2008. This is a
higher gain compared to the media sector, which recovered 63%, and a
significant gain compared to communications firms, which recovered
only15% of the value they lost. This recovery pattern is highlighted in
Oliver Wyman's 2010 Communications, Media, and Technology State of the
Industry Report, which analyzes the top 450 publicly quoted companies
worldwide in the CMT industries.

    The technology sector includes the computer services, communications
hardware, consumer electronics, hardware, semiconductors, and software
sub-sectors. Of these technology sub-sectors, computer services achieved
the highest growth at 127% in 2009.

    Interestingly, more than half of the computer services market growth was
driven by only two companies: IBM and Tata Consultancy Services. The
computer hardware sub-sector grew 86%, due to a strong recovery in North
America and new growth in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. A number of
technology companies were able to navigate the rough economic waters and
post outstanding performance in Oliver Wyman's Shareholder Performance
Index (SPI). Top performers include Apple (U.S.), Autonomy (U.K.), SXC
Health Solutions (U.S.), VTech Holdings (Hong Kong), ANSYS (U.S.), and Byd
(China).

    The calculation of the SPI, which is based on a five-year moving "window"
of data, enables consistent comparison of shareholder returns by adjusting
for the volatility of returns, differences in local interest rates, and
mergers and acquisitions.

    "Technology companies make up the majority of firms (13) in the CMT SPI
top 20 -- compared to four media companies and three communications
firms. Of the 14 new companies in the top 20 ranking, 12 are technology
firms," said Robert C. Fox, a Partner in Oliver Wyman's Communications,
Media, and Technology practice. "The emergence of so many new firms is a
testament to the opportunity for new growth that any economic downturn
provides."

Former U.S. Astronaut Bernard Harris gave students and teachers in San Diego a
first-hand experience with the wonders of science, technology, engineering and
mathematics when "The Dream Tour, presented by ExxonMobil" made its first stop
of 2010 on January 29 at Abraham Lincoln High School speaking to 650 students
from Millennial Tech Middle School, Innovation Middle School and Memorial
Preparatory School. 

The tour is designed to encourage today`s middle school students to realize
their potential and strive to acquire strong math and science skills. The
program included an interactive and inspirational program by Harris, a
demonstration on space and engaging dialogue about achieving goals. 

"It is critical that American students are prepared with the problem-solving
skills and tools to tackle challenges they may face in the future. Providing
them with a strong foundation in math and science education is imperative, and
with The Dream Tour, I hope to inspire students to pursue studies and careers in
these fields," said Dr. Harris. 

From humble beginnings in San Antonio to making history as the first African
American to walk in space, Dr. Harris is a living example of achieving high
aspirations. His story provides a powerful backdrop to bring his message to
students in cities across America. Since 2008, Dr. Harris has encouraged almost
35,000 middle school students in more than 20 cities nationwide. This year, The
Dream Tour will visit Anchorage, Baton Rouge, Billings, Cleveland, Denver,
Nashville, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego and San Francisco as Dr. Harris
continues to motivate and inspire students to pursue math and science. 

"ExxonMobil is focused on the need to attract more of America`s students to
higher level math and science courses in secondary school. The classes they
choose today can make or break their options for the future, and `The Dream
Tour, presented by ExxonMobil,` is one way to expose them to the possibilities,"
said Gerald McElvy, President, ExxonMobil Foundation.

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today reported earnings of $3.07 billion ($1.53
per share - diluted) for the fourth quarter 2009, compared with $4.90 billion
($2.44 per share - diluted) in the fourth quarter 2008. Earnings in the 2008
quarter included a gain of approximately $600 million on an upstream
asset-exchange transaction. Foreign-currency effects reduced earnings in the
2009 quarter by $67 million, compared with a benefit to income of $478 million a
year earlier. 

Full-year 2009 earnings were $10.48 billion ($5.24 per share - diluted), down 56
percent from $23.93 billion ($11.67 per share - diluted) in 2008. 

Sales and other operating revenues in the fourth quarter 2009 were $48 billion,
compared with $43 billion in the year-ago quarter. For the full-year 2009, sales
and other operating revenues were $167 billion, versus $265 billion in 2008. The
decrease in the twelve-month period was primarily due to lower prices for crude
oil, natural gas and refined products.

"Earnings decreased in 2009 as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas
prices and a decline in refined product sales margins, driven by a weak global
economy," said Chevron`s Chairman and CEO, John Watson. "In this challenging
environment, Chevron`s successes in operational reliability and cost management
made valuable contributions to our bottom line. Our financial strength enabled
continued investment in our excellent portfolio of capital and exploratory
projects and an increase in the annual dividend on our common shares for the
22nd consecutive year. 

"In fourth quarter 2009, earnings in our upstream business benefited from higher
crude oil prices than in the same quarter in 2008. Net oil-equivalent production
for the quarter was over 9 percent higher than in the 2008 quarter, driven by
new production from several of our major capital projects. 

"In our downstream business, our operated refineries continued to run reliably
during the fourth quarter. However, this operational success did not offset the
effects of low margins on the sale of gasoline and other refined products due to
weak demand and excess supply worldwide," continued Watson. 

Watson said on-going, aggressive cost-management efforts companywide resulted in
about a 15 percent decrease in operating, selling, general and administrative
expenses in 2009 compared with the previous year. 

Watson also said that recent developments related to the company`s projects in
Australia have demonstrated continued progress in building a high-impact
natural-gas business. Developments related to Australia projects in recent
months include:

* Gorgon - Agreements were signed for delivery of liquefied natural gas (LNG)
from the Gorgon Project. These include long-term, binding agreements for the
delivery of about 4.4 million metric tons per year and non-binding Heads of
Agreement (HOAs) for delivery of an additional 2.1 million metric tons per year
of LNG from Gorgon. Together, these agreements underpin the final investment
decision on the 47.3 percent-owned and operated project and represent about 90
percent of Chevron`s share in the 15 million metric-tons-per-year capacity of
the LNG facilities. 
* Wheatstone - Non-binding HOAs were signed with two buyers to take delivery of
4.9 million metric tons per year of LNG from the Wheatstone Project and acquire
an equity share in the field licenses and LNG facilities. An agreement was also
signed to bring in two other equity partners to the Wheatstone LNG facilities.
The project, currently undergoing front-end engineering and design, has a
planned capacity of 8.6 million metric tons per year. 
* Exploration - Additional discoveries of natural gas were made in the Carnarvon
Basin off the northwest coast in the Chevron-operated and 50 percent-owned
Blocks WA-374-P and WA-268-P.

Another recently-announced achievement was the final investment decision to
develop the 37.5 percent-owned, partner-operated Papa-Terra Field offshore
Brazil. First production is expected in 2013. Project facilities are designed
with a capacity to handle up to 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day. 

Watson commented that the company added approximately 1.10 billion barrels of
net oil-equivalent proved reserves in 2009. These additions, which are subject
to final reviews, equate to 112 percent of net oil-equivalent production for the
year. Included in the additions were proved reserves related to the Gorgon
Project in Australia. Also included were additions for the Athabasca Oil Sands
Project in Canada as a result of a change in financial reporting rules. The
increase in proved reserves was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of
higher crude oil prices on certain production-sharing and variable-royalty
contracts. The company will provide additional details relating to 2009 reserve
activity in its Annual Report on Form 10-K scheduled for filing with the SEC on
February 25. 

UPSTREAM - EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

Worldwide net oil-equivalent production was 2.78 million barrels per day in the
fourth quarter 2009, up 238,000 from 2.54 million barrels per day in the 2008
fourth quarter. Production for the full year 2009 averaged 2.70 million barrels
per day, an increase of 7 percent compared with 2.53 million barrels per day in
2008. The increases for both periods were primarily driven by new projects in
the United States and Nigeria, and expansion of capacity at Tengiz in
Kazakhstan.

U.S. upstream earnings of $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 were down
$105 million from a year earlier. Higher crude-oil production and realizations
in the fourth quarter of 2009 were more than offset by the absence of a $600
million gain on an asset-exchange transaction in the corresponding 2008 period.
Operating expenses were lower between periods, while depreciation expense was
higher. 

The company`s average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas
liquids was approximately $67 in the 2009 quarter, compared with $49 a year ago.
The average sales price of natural gas was $4.23 per thousand cubic feet, down
from $5.23 in the 2008 fourth quarter. 

Net oil-equivalent production of 751,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter
2009 was up 132,000 barrels per day, or about 21 percent, from a year earlier.
The increase in production was primarily associated with ramp-ups of the Blind
Faith and Tahiti fields (which started producing in late 2008 and second quarter
2009, respectively), along with the restoration of volumes that were offline in
the fourth quarter of 2008 due to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. The net
liquids component of production was up 30 percent to 518,000 barrels per day in
the 2009 fourth quarter and net natural-gas production of 1.40 billion cubic
feet per day increased 6 percent between periods.

International upstream earnings of $2.96 billion increased $956 million from the
fourth quarter 2008 due mainly to the impact of higher prices and sales volumes
for crude oil. Foreign-currency effects reduced earnings by $47 million in the
2009 quarter, compared with an increase of $644 million a year earlier. Gains
from asset sales and lower exploration expense also benefited earnings in the
fourth quarter of 2009. 

The average sales price for crude oil and natural gas liquids in the 2009
quarter was $68 per barrel, compared with $47 a year earlier. The average price
of natural gas was $4.15 per thousand cubic feet, down from $5.10 in last year`s
fourth quarter. 

Net oil-equivalent production of 2.03 million barrels per day in the fourth
quarter 2009 was up 6 percent, or 106,000 barrels per day, from a year ago. The
increase included approximately 135,000 barrels per day associated with the
ramp-up of two projects - Agbami in Nigeria, which commenced operations in the
third quarter of 2008, and expansion at Tengiz in Kazakhstan. The impact of
higher prices on cost-recovery volumes and other contractual provisions
decreased net production from fourth quarter 2008. The net liquids component of
production increased about 6 percent from a year ago to 1.42 million barrels per
day and net natural-gas production was up about 5 percent to 3.65 billion cubic
feet per day.

U.S. downstream operations lost $345 million in the fourth quarter 2009,
compared with earnings of $1.03 billion a year earlier. The decline was mainly
the result of weaker margins on the sale of gasoline and other refined products.


Refinery crude-input of 856,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2009
decreased 74,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period, primarily due to the
effects of a planned shutdown in this year`s fourth quarter at the refinery in
El Segundo, California. 

Refined-product sales of 1.35 million barrels per day were down 60,000 barrels
per day from the fourth quarter of 2008, mainly due to weaker demand for jet
fuel and gas oils. Branded gasoline sales decreased 2 percent to 595,000 barrels
per day, also due to weaker demand.

International downstream operations incurred losses of $268 million in the
fourth quarter 2009, compared with earnings of $1.05 billion a year earlier. The
decline was associated mainly with narrower margins on the sale of gasoline and
refined products and the absence of gains from commodity derivative instruments
in the fourth quarter of 2008. Partially offsetting were the benefits of lower
operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009. 

Refinery crude-input of 975,000 barrels per day was essentially unchanged from
the fourth quarter of 2008. Total refined-product sales of 1.8 million barrels
per day in the 2009 fourth quarter were 7 percent lower than a year earlier, due
mainly to asset sales since the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding the
impact of 2009 asset sales, sales volumes were up 1 percent between periods.

with $28 million in the year-ago period. Earnings of the 50 percent-owned
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) and Chevron`s Oronite subsidiary
were both higher between periods. For CPChem, the benefits from lower utility
and manufacturing costs, as well as the absence of an impairment in last year`s
fourth quarter, were partially offset by lower margins on the sale of commodity
chemicals. For Oronite, margins on the sales of lubricant and fuel additives
were higher between periods.

Net charges in the fourth quarter 2009 were $418 million, compared with $365
million in the year-ago period. Foreign-currency effects reduced net charges by
$5 million in the 2009 quarter, compared with a $126 million increase in net
charges last year. Other net charges were higher between periods primarily due
to an unfavorable change in corporate tax items. 

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

Capital and exploratory expenditures in 2009 were $22.2 billion, compared with
$22.8 billion in 2008. The amounts included approximately $1.6 billion in 2009
and $2.3 billion in 2008 for the company`s share of expenditures by affiliates,
which did not require cash outlays by the company. Expenditures for upstream
projects represented 77 percent of the companywide total in 2009.

Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "targets,"
"projects," "believes," "seeks," "schedules," "estimates," "budgets" and similar
expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These
statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain
risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the company`s

differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking
statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. Unless
legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any

liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product
substitutes; technological developments; the results of operations and financial
condition of equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company`s
joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development
activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from
existing and future crude-oil and natural-gas development projects; potential
delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the
potential disruption or interruption of the company`s net production or
manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation networks due to war,
accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather or crude-oil
production quotas that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments
under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant
investment or product changes under existing or future environmental statutes,
regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other pending
or future litigation; the company`s future acquisition or disposition of assets
and gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government-mandated

fourth-quarter gross domestic product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government's first estimate on fourth-quarter GDP is

the fastest pace in nearly four years as businesses cut back
less aggressively on inventories. The data is due at 8:30 a.m.

in-line, since that would show that we're in a steady
recovery," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital

in the futures but then lose that as it could bring back
concerns about interest rates and the government removing
stimulus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago PMI data and
the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers final
consumer sentiment reading, both for January, are also on tap
for later in the day. The Chicago PMI, while still showing an
expansionary reading above 50, is expected to dip to 57.4 from
58.7 in December. The Reuters/University of Michigan consumer
survey is expected to tick up slightly to 73.0 from a reading
of 72.5 in late December, according to a poll of economists by
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology stocks will be in focus one day after Microsoft

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp posted a bigger-than-expected 60 percent jump in quarterly profit, helped by strong sales of Windows 7, and said it expected business technology spending to recover this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest software maker said on Thursday that net profit came to $6.7 billion, or 74 cents per share, for its fiscal second quarter, versus $4.2 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts were expecting 59 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's stock rose 1 percent in after-hours trading, a relatively muted reaction that analysts attributed in part to a run-up in the stock following the launch of the Windows 7 operating system in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Make no mistake, these were very good results out of Microsoft. Expectations were heightened ever the last few weeks, given Q4 PC shipments and good numbers from Intel," said Andy Miedler, analyst at Edward Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others also pointed to confusion over the earnings numbers because Microsoft included the effects of deferred revenue from pre-sales of Windows 7 to PC makers and retailers, and its free upgrade program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding that revenue, profit was 60 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a pretty clean, blowout beat," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen. "All the Street models should have reflected that deferred revenue because it's not a surprise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft stopped making specific profit or revenue forecasts in January 2009, citing market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We didn't see enterprise spending growth in our fiscal second quarter just ended," Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, our general view is a recovery will occur starting this calendar year and gradually over the next several years," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 has proved to be Microsoft's strongest-selling operating system to date after the disappointing Vista. PC sales grew 15.2 percent last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's revenue rose 14 percent to $19.02 billion, including $1.71 billion of deferred revenue from the Windows 7 launch in October. Excluding that, sales were $17.31 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose to $29.42 in after-hours trading from their Nasdaq close of $29.16. At the close, The stock has risen 62 percent over the past 12 months, outstripping a 40 percent gain in the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Last year the stock was a big outperformer. A lot of people think the stock has already had its run," said Jane Snorek, technology analyst at First American Funds. "But I think with PCs doing this well and a new Office coming in June, that the stock can still outperform. I think Office can be a big hit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivals International Business Machines Corp, Google Inc and Apple Inc have all beaten average Wall Street estimates this quarter, but saw their stocks fall or gain only slightly afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Additional reporting by Jim Finkle, Sue Zeidler and Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Richard Chang and Tiffany Wu)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks largely to the Windows 7 launch, Microsoft on Thursday reported a strong increase in net income and revenue for its second quarter of fiscal 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company rang up US$6.66 billion in net income, an increase of 60 percent from the same period a year earlier. Revenue totalled $19.02 billion for the quarter ending Dec. 31, a 14 percent increase from the prior year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the boost came from deferred revenue earned earlier this year, from pre-sales of Windows 7 to PC makers and retailers. This revenue amounted to $1.71 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without the deferred revenue, the results were in line with analyst expectations, with second-quarter revenue totaling $17.31 billion, and earnings of $0.60 per share. In a poll of analysts, Thomson Reuters showed an expected revenue of $17.9 billion and earnings per share of $0.59.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This quarter saw the release of Windows 7, of which more than 60 million licenses were sold, the most Windows licenses ever sold in a single quarter, explained Bill Koefoed, Microsoft general manager of investor relations. The company also released Windows Server 2008 R2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows-related sales brought in the largest chunk of revenue, at $6.9 billion, up 72.5 percent from $4 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Server and tools enjoyed a more modest increase, with $3.8 billion in revenue, up from $3.75 billion in the prior year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all of Microsoft's businesses sidestepped the recessionary doldrums, however. Online services revenue slumped in the quarter, to $581 million, down from $609 million the year before. The business division and the entertainment and services division also had lackluster revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the last quarter overseen by Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell, who left Microsoft Dec. 31. Peter Klein has taken the CFO role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results were driven in large part by strong consumer demand for PCs," Klein said during a conference call to discuss the results. Business spending, he explained, has not picked up from the recessionary lull of the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft estimated that the consumer PC market grew by more than 20 percent year over year, while business PC sales were flat, Koefoed said. Netbooks represented about 11 percent of the PC market, about the same as last quarter and last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, enterprise sales will pick up as businesses resume their hardware refresh cycles. "Although the timing is uncertain, we'll be well-positioned to capitalize on the business pending recovery when it returns," Klein said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klein pointed to the June release of Microsoft Office 2010 as a major income driver, and looking ahead, new offerings such as Microsoft's cloud platform Azure and the introduction of the next-generation Xbox control system, now code-named Natal.&lt;/p&gt;

wants the non-U.S. operations of RBS Sempra, Royal Bank of
Scotland's (RBS.L) commodities unit, having previously entered
talks to buy the whole business, energy news service
SparkSpread reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The change comes after the U.S. government  earlier this
month proposed tough new rules for the banking sector which
would prevent lenders from running their own trading
operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan and RBS are now discussing a deal under which RBS
would sell its 51 percent stake in RBS Sempra's U.S. operation
back to Sempra Energy, its partner in the joint venture,
SparkSpread said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would leave JP Morgan clear to buy the unit's European
operations, the publication added, citing unnamed industry
sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  An RBS spokesman said "constructive discussions" regarding
the sale of RBS Sempra were still under way, but declined to
comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RBS Sempra is among the assets that RBS, 84 percent
state-owned after a series of taxpayer-funded bailouts, was
ordered to sell to comply with European Union state aid rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan entered exclusive talks to buy the business,
expected to fetch about $4 billion, around Jan. 20.

Kaushik Amin resigned on Friday, and had been replaced by
