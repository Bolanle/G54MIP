&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, April 1 (Reuters) - Oil liquids from ExxonMobil's
 gas export project in Papua New Guinea will be blended
into the country's only crude blend, almost doubling crude
exports by the middle of the year, the company said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil's $19 billion PNG LNG Project is due to begin
exports of 6.9 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per
year around mid-2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with LNG, the project will produce about 25,000
barrels per day (bpd) of condensate, a low-density mixture of
hydrocarbon liquids that will be blended into Papua New Guinea's
existing export stream, the Kutubu Blend, a spokeswoman for the
project said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additional volumes will result in an almost doubling in
production of the Kutubu Blend, Papua New Guinea's only export
grade made up of the Kutubu, Gobe, Moran and SE Mananda crude
streams, which currently stands at around 30,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kutubu is normally sold in cargoes of 650,000 barrels with
1-2 cargoes per month exported to regional refiners. Exports
will rise to 2-3 monthly cargoes by the middle of the year. The
first cargo of the new blended Kutubu crude will be marketed by
project partner Oil Search Ltd, the spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of condensate in the mix, the new Kutubu Blend
will become lighter with an API of around 49 compared to 44-45
now, an industry source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher crude exports from impoverished Papua New Guinea
come amid stagnating crude production in a region that is
increasingly dependent on crude imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian refiners import more than twice the volume of crude
produced regionally, and Asia is estimated to need an additional
300,000 bpd of low-sulphur or sweet crudes in 2014 compared with
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 200 million barrels of associated liquids are
expected to be produced over the LNG project's 30 year life, Oil
Search Ltd said on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other shareholders in the PNG LNG Project include
Australia's Santos Ltd. and Japan's JX Nippon Oil &amp;
Energy Corp.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds JPMorgan comment, background on size of bank)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Thomas Grove and Megan Davies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, April 1 (Reuters) - Russia accused U.S. bank
JPMorgan on Tuesday of "illegally" blocking a payment
from one of its embassies to an insurance agency "under the
pretext of anti-Russian sanctions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on its website, the Russian Foreign Ministry
suggested the action, which it called "unacceptable, illegal and
absurd," would have consequences for the U.S. embassy and
consulate in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the highest profile confrontations yet over U.S.
sanctions, the move may increase tensions between Washington and
Moscow and add to U.S. companies' nervousness over doing
business in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Washington should understand any hostile action against a
Russian diplomatic mission not only constitutes a flagrant
violation of international law but is rife with consequences
that will inevitably effect the work of the embassy and general
consulate of the United States in Russia," Russia's statement
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said later in its own statement that it is subject
to government regulations and that it "will continue to seek
guidance from the U.S. government on implementing their recent
sanctions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The payment came from Russia's embassy in Kazakhstan to

institutions are unclear about how to apply the new rules in
some situations, such as when dealing with subsidiaries of
companies which have either been sanctioned or which have
shareholders that have been punished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of confusion ... as to what might be the
full scope of the sanctions and what we are hearing is while the
sanctions are specific, a lot of U.S. companies are adopting a
much more risk-averse or cautious approach," said Chris Weafer,
partner at Macro Advisory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is almost self-sanctioning going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and Mastercard briefly cut off services

		&lt;h1&gt;Energy Systems Group Acquires Chevron Energy Solutions' Federal Operations, Awarded $45 Million Waste-to-Energy Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;EVANSVILLE, IN--(Marketwired - Apr 1, 2014) -  Energy Systems Group (ESG), a leading energy services provider and subsidiary of Vectren Corporation (NYSE: VVC), announced today two major business developments. ESG has acquired the federal sector energy services unit of Chevron Energy Solutions (CES), which is owned by Chevron U.S.A., Inc.; the business unit employs 48 experienced professionals, performs under several long-term operations and maintenance contracts, and has a robust construction project sales funnel.&#160;Separately, ESG was awarded a $45 million contract with the Frederick-Winchester Service Authority (FWSA) for the design and construction of energy efficiency and infrastructure improvements at the Opequon Water Reclamation Facility in Winchester, Virginia. These developments signify ESG's strategic focus on strengthening its position as a leader in both the federal and sustainable infrastructure sectors.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ESG already enjoys an industry-leading position in developing and implementing federal government projects with 12 utility partners under Utility Energy Services Contracts and through public / private partnerships such as Enhanced Use Leases," said Greg Collins, president of Energy Systems Group.&#160;"The capabilities we gain with this acquisition enable ESG to access the full spectrum of federal contracting opportunities in this rapidly growing sector."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included in the CES transaction are several Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity contracts with federal government entities, including Energy Savings Performance Contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.&#160;Also included are long-term operation, maintenance and repair contracts with multiple Department of Defense installations.&#160;Collins added, "We are gratified that all of the unit's employees have accepted offers to join ESG.&#160;This talented team has a well-documented history of delivering innovative, high-quality projects.&#160;We believe the cultures of the two organizations will mesh very well."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESG has also built a strong resume in the distributed generation, waste-to-energy, and renewable energy sectors, and was recently selected by the Army Corps of Engineers as a qualified biomass technology contractor that will be eligible to bid on potentially $7 billion of future biomass renewable energy power purchase agreements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The centerpiece of the FWSA project is the construction of a Green Energy Facility, which will process municipal sludge and high-strength organic waste, from food processors in the Shenandoah Valley, to produce methane gas, a renewable fuel, through the process of anaerobic co-digestion.&#160;This methane gas will be utilized to generate up to 825 kilowatts of electricity that, at start-up, will meet more than 50 percent of the treatment plant's electrical needs. This facility also includes a new sludge dewatering process that reduces the use of chemicals and decreases the amount of waste hauled to the county landfill. The Green Energy Facility will harvest phosphorus from the wastewater stream, a rare element that is an essential ingredient for fertilizer and crop production.&#160;The project also includes construction of a new food waste receiving station, and other facility improvements such as emergency electrical generation, turbo blowers and fine bubble diffusers for process treatment aeration, and lighting and mechanical system improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This project is a great example of government striving for operational efficiency and advancing sustainable infrastructure solutions to achieve positive economic development and benefits to taxpayers," said Collins.&#160;"We look forward to working with the FWSA in constructing potentially one of the nation's largest energy performance contracts at a single wastewater treatment facility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design and construction of the FWSA project will commence in April, and the facility is expected to come online in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About ESG
				Energy Systems Group (ESG), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vectren Corporation (NYSE: VVC), is a leading energy services provider that specializes in energy efficiency, sustainability, and infrastructure improvement solutions in the government, education, healthcare, commercial, and industrial sectors. ESG also offers a full range of sustainable infrastructure solutions including waste-to-energy, distributed generation, and renewable energy.&#160;ESG has steadily expanded its geographic footprint and service offerings for 20 years.&#160;The company employs 250 people and is licensed to operate in 46 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.&#160;To learn more about ESG, visit www.energysystemsgroup.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday U.S. bank JP Morgan had "illegally" blocked a payment from its embassy in Kazakhstan to insurance agency Sogaz "under the pretext of anti-Russian sanctions imposed by the United States".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement on its website, the Russian Foreign Ministry suggested the action, which it called "unacceptable, illegal and absurd", would have consequences for the U.S. embassy and consulate in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan gave no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Washington should understand any hostile action against a Russian diplomatic mission not only constitutes a flagrant violation of international law but is rife with consequences that will inevitably effect the work of the embassy and general consulate of the United States in Russia," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sogaz is partly owned by Abros, according to the Sogaz website. Abros is a subsidiary of Bank Rossiya, according to Russian media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank Rossiya was sanctioned by the White House last month in part of a widening effort at punishing Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Thomas Grove and Megan Davies; editing by Andrew Roche)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Rosneft building LNG plant with ExxonMobil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Rosneft to launch plant by 2018-19, sees gas output up

 (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Denis Pinchuk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, April 1 (Reuters) - Russia's Rosneft, said
on Tuesday it was on track to start production at its first
liquefied natural (LNG) gas plant in the country's far east in
2018-2019, despite East-West tension over Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest listed oil company by output signalled
its partnership with U.S. ExxonMobil for building the
plant, which will have an initial annual capacity of 5 million
tonnes, would not be affected by the standoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The project is fully targeting Asia-Pacific markets. At the
moment, the project's implementation is going according to the
plans that were announced," Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, a
long-standing ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said in
written replies to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The launch is planned for 2018-2019," said the
state-controlled company, almost 20 percent owned by British oil
major BP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft said current LNG prices in Asia, at over $15 per
million British thermal units (MMBtu), would enable it to
successfully carry out its LNG project, in which the final
investment decision is expected next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia is entering the global LNG game at a time when Qatar,
Australia and others are boosting their presence on the market,
and prices are being driven by growing demand in the
Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has only one LNG plant, which is controlled by
state-run top natural gas producer, Gazprom, and is on
the Pacific island of Sakhalin. It has an annual capacity of
around 10 million tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EAST-WEST STANDOFF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions over Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine,
following a referendum the West says was a sham, have pushed
East-West to their lowest level since the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States and the European Union have imposed
sanctions, mainly on Russian individuals, and Moscow has
responded in kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft is one of two Russian companies that have won the
right to ship LNG out of Russia since the Kremlin decided to end
Gazprom's monopoly. The other is Novatek, which is
currently Russia's number two gas producer and is co-owned by
another Putin ally, Gennady Timchenko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timchenko is one of the Russian individuals targeted by
Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis but Sechin has not
been targeted, nor has Gazprom's chief executive, Alexei Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tensions have spurred U.S. officials to press Washington
to speed up exports of U.S. natural gas to Europe to help reduce
the continent's reliance on Russian gas, which accounts for a
third of the EU's total consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft said it did not expect all LNG plants announced by
Washington to come on stream, saying exports could hit domestic
gas prices and curb economic growth in the United States and 
competition would come from Canada, with its own LNG plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That said, a scenario when the bulk of the projects
announced are actually launched seems unlikely," Rosneft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia largely underestimated the shale gas revolution in
the United States which turned the country into the world's
leading gas producer, enabling it to overtake Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States is now set to become the world's largest
oil producer, thanks to increase in shale oil output, and Russia
is now testing its own unconventional oil prospects in western
Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Rosneft's gas production reached 42 billion cubic
metres (bcm), thanks to acquisitions. The company plans to
increase gas output to 100 bcm by 2020 in a move to become
Russia's second biggest gas producer after Gazprom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, it said its gas output was expected to rise to
around 55 bcm this year and over 63 bcm next year. Gazprom
produced 479 bcm last year, or 73 percent of the Russian total.

its head of global foreign exchange trading Guy Saidanberg to
the role of co-head of commodities trading, making way for the
appointment of former JP Morgan banker Kayhan Mirza to the FX
role.&lt;/p&gt;

Goldman as a partner, reported in some media at the start of

a year in charge of the currency area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in London confirmed the contents
of the memos were accurate and declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks have been struggling to fill gaps at the top of their
currency trading operations left by a spat of resignations,
suspensions and dismissals since allegations of manipulation of
market benchmarks emerged last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 30 traders from some of the world's biggest banks
have now been suspended or laid off, although the reasons for
each case remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recruitment firms and sources at some of the banks at the
centre of the probe have said there is huge reluctance to hire
experienced spot traders externally because replacements could
be tainted by the allegations of rate-rigging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo said Mirza was previously the global head of FX
options trading and head of EMEA FX trading at JP Morgan.

			FIS Fosters US EMV Adoption with Visa Agreement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Key facts
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        FIS can now provide access to Visa EMV technology for its NYCE 
        Payments Network participants
      
			
        The agreement furthers the U.S. payments industrywide goal of adopting 
        EMV while supporting key business flexibilities for NYCE Network 
        participants
      
			
        The agreement will help reach the promise of significant card-based 
        fraud reduction via the advanced security inherent in EMV functionality
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Tweet this: @FISGlobal and @Visa agree on #EMV debit solution, 
      move adoption forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FIS&#8482; 
      (NYSE:FIS), the world&#8217;s largest provider of banking and payments 
      technology, and its NYCE&#174; 
      Payments Network today announced a licensing agreement to make the 
      Visa&#174; EMV &#174; debit solution available to all NYCE 
      participants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This agreement furthers the U.S. payments industry goal of EMV adoption 
      and is NYCE&#8217;s first formal EMV license, which can be used by NYCE 
      Network participants with respect to Visa card products. Fundamental to 
      the agreement is the support of key NYCE participant business 
      flexibilities, including portability between debit networks for issuers, 
      routing choice for merchants at the point of sale and issuers at NYCE 
      ATMs. At the same time, it ensures that NYCE will have access to Visa 
      EMV technology in perpetuity to support NYCE clients and NYCE will be 
      able to support transactions using all authentication types.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;EMV deployment is at a critical point in its business adoption in the 
      U.S. and carries the promise of significantly reducing card-based fraud. 
      Our challenge has been deploying EMV solutions in the U.S. without 
      disrupting the business goals of any industry participant,&#8221; said Bob 
      Woodbury, SVP and general manager, FIS Payments Networks. &#8220;This 
      agreement will now enable us to offer this Visa-NYCE solution to all 
      NYCE participants and will complement FIS&#8217; substantial EMV card 
      production and EFT processing capabilities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;NYCE&#8217;s participation in Visa&#8217;s common debit solution marks an important 
      milestone in the industry&#8217;s efforts to adopt chip technology in the 
      U.S.,&#8221; said Bill Sheedy, executive vice president of Corporate Strategy 
      and Government Relations, Visa Inc. &#8220;With the uncertainty of how to 
      enable debit routing on EMV chip effectively resolved, issuers, 
      acquirers and merchants can move forward in their implementations with 
      confidence.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FIS has vast experience issuing EMV cards worldwide, and its work in 
      migrating financial institutions and payments systems to EMV compliance 
      make it a leading partner for bringing smart cards to the United States. 
      FIS was a founding member of the Debit Network Alliance (DNA), already 
      supports EMV card production and processing, and is launching EMV-based 
      payment mechanisms that support overseas travel and personalization of 
      debit and credit cards. FIS also teaches financial institutions 
      nationwide how to develop cost-effective strategies for smart card 
      migration. In addition, NYCE is a member of the steering committee for 
      the EMV Migration Forum of the SmartCard Alliance and chairs the DNA.

			J.P. Morgan and IPPR Announce New Skills at Work in Europe
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Innovative research and programmes part of three-year initiative 
      focused on unemployment, jobs, skills, and economic growth in UK and 
      Europe
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan today announced the launch of New Skills at Work in 
      Europe alongside the Institute 
      for Public Policy Research (IPPR) as lead research partner. The 
      initiative is an initial $30 million, three-year programme focused on 
      addressing unemployment through macro strategies and specific 
      innovations to boost job creation, expand labour market participation 
      and develop the skilled workforce for the future in the UK and Europe. 
      The programme is the European component of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s New 
      Skills at Work initiative announced in Washington, DC in 
      December, and is the largest-ever private-sector effort aimed at 
      addressing the "skills gap" that exists across many industries globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Skills at Work in Europe will initially focus its efforts on 
      the UK, France, Germany, and Spain. In addition to IPPR, other UK 
      partners include Catch22, 
      Participle, 
      Social 
      Mobility Foundation, The 
      Sutton Trust and TimeWise 
      Foundation.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At J.P. Morgan, we are committed to playing our part in contributing to 
      growth in Europe by supporting solutions that help address the acute 
      unemployment issue across the region and develop the skilled workforce 
      needed to power economic recovery and growth,&#8221; said Emilio Saracho, 
      Deputy CEO for EMEA at J.P. Morgan. &#8220;New Skills at Work in Europe 
      will work with partners in the UK, Germany, France and Spain to share 
      insights and take practical steps toward equipping people with the 
      skills they need to obtain employment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Skills at Work&#8217;s partners in Europe aim to address skills and 
      employment issues, and to create greater economic opportunities in local 
      communities. For example, TimeWise 
      Foundation has great track record in providing career advice and support 
      for women looking for flexible employment, particularly from low-income 
      backgrounds through their Women 
      Like Us programme. Catch22 is a social business focused on providing 
      services that help people from disadvantaged backgrounds to turn their 
      lives around. The organization worked directly with over 34,000 people 
      in 2013, supporting a further 60,000 young people through national 
      partnership programmes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At Catch22, we work with a range of people including excluded young 
      people and those at risk of becoming homeless. Our Office 
      Apprenticeships Service, supported by J.P. Morgan, has helped us to 
      put these individuals in the way of work experience and job 
      opportunities,&#8221; said Chris Wright, Chief Executive at Catch22. 
      &#8220;Understanding the needs of the people you&#8217;re trying to serve on an 
      individual and a family level is so important if you want to achieve 
      success.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The partnership and new research produced by IPPR were unveiled at the 
      first-ever European Jobs and Skills Summit, a gathering of leading 
      academics, business leaders, politicians, policymakers, and civil 
      society organisations to address issues around unemployment and economic 
      growth. The Summit was hosted jointly by J.P. Morgan and IPPR at The 
      Royal Institute in London.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With New Skills at Work, we as a firm are addressing the growing 
      problem of unemployment across the globe &#8211; by investing in a demand- and 
      data-driven system to ensure people are equipped for the jobs that are 
      available today,&#8221; said Peter Scher, Global Head of Corporate 
      Responsibility at JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;We&#8217;re working with great partners to 
      build a stronger workforce and create opportunities that will boost 
      economic growth in Europe and abroad.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While in much of Europe the economy is recovering, unemployment remains 
      a major problem across the continent. As part of the launch, IPPR has 
      published a new report entitled European Jobs and Skills: A 
      Comprehensive Review 2014. Key findings of the research show that:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The polarisation of the European workforce, in which an 18 per cent 
        increase in the number of high-skilled jobs and a 12 per cent increase 
        in low-skilled jobs contrasts with a 3 per cent fall in 
        mid-skilled jobs over the last decade
      
			
        One-third of Europe&#8217;s unemployment is cyclical while two-thirds (i.e. 
        about 7% of the workforce) is structural. Unemployment across Europe 
        is predicted to still be more than one in ten next year, and is well 
        above its pre-crisis level in most countries;
      
			
        Since 2008, an extra 3 million more people across Europe now say that 
        they would like to work longer hours, with a big increase in 
        underemployment right across Europe. One in 10 European workers are 
        now underemployed, with the most dramatic rises taking place in 
        Portugal and Ireland.
      
			
        Employment rates among older workers (aged 50-63) have increased, up 
        1.5%. Conversely, the employment rate for younger workers (under age 
        25) has declined 5.9%. Additionally, young people, particularly those 
        leaving education early, may not be fully equipped with the skills and 
        training required to gain entry into the workforce.
      
			
        The decline in the proportion of the UK&#8217;s working age population in 
        education or training during the long downturn (2007-2012) was four 
        times greater than in any other European country. Of 24 European 
        countries studied in the report, 15 have seen an increase in education 
        and training participation.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Europe&#8217;s economy is recovering but we need to ensure the fruits of that 
      recovery are shared more widely. We are seeing that while more high 
      skilled and low skilled jobs are being created, jobs in the middle are 
      disappearing,&#8221; said Nick Pearce, Director at IPPR. &#8220;Employment of older 
      people during the recession has held up, but it is becoming more 
      difficult for younger people to find work. Underemployment &#8211; in which 
      people are not able to work the hours they want at pay levels they need 
      &#8211; is a growing problem. More high quality research is needed to 
      understand and tackle such issues, which is why the New Skills at 
      Work in Europe programme is so important.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As announced in December, JPMorgan Chase Chairman  CEO Jamie Dimon will 
      chair the JPMorgan Chase Global Workforce Advisory Council, which will 
      bring together a group of private sector, non-profit, education and 
      workforce development thought leaders to ensure the effectiveness of the 
      effort. The Advisory Council will advise on the development, 
      implementation and evaluation of New Skills at Work. Melody 
      Barnes, former Director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, will 
      co-chair the Council.

&lt;p&gt;April 3 (Reuters) - China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp
(Sinopec) , Asia's biggest oil refiner, has
picked Goldman Sachs Group Inc to help sell a stake in
its retail assets, Bloomberg reported, citing people with
knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing-based Sinopec could raise about $30 billion from
what would be the biggest asset sale by a Chinese state-owned
company, Bloomberg said. (link.reuters.com/rus28v)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinopec did not immediately return calls seeking comment.
Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinopec on Feb. 20 said it would sell up to 30 percent of
its marketing arm, which owns more than 30,000 petrol stations,
in a multi-billion dollar asset restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That announcement of major restructuring was China's first
since President Xi Jinping unveiled sweeping reforms of the
socialist economy at a Communist Party conclave in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xi promised to encourage private participation in
state-owned enterprises, which include some of the world's
largest companies.

&lt;p&gt;The shipment was intercepted on Monday evening on a 30-foot boat that was 12.5 miles off the resort town of Dorado on Puerto Rico's north coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have seized more than three tons of cocaine over the last month," Angel Melendez, head of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations office in San Juan, said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great majority of cocaine destined for the U.S. market is smuggled via Mexico, but U.S. officials have said that joint U.S.-Mexican counter-drug efforts have begun to push some of the traffic back into the Caribbean, an historically popular corridor during the heyday of Colombia's Medellin cartel in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 14 percent of U.S.-bound cocaine shipments, roughly 42 tons, was trafficked through the Caribbean in the first six months of 2013, and Puerto Rico and the neighboring Dominican Republic have emerged as hubs of the burgeoning trade, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was double the share of U.S.-bound cocaine that was shipped through the region during the first half of 2012, Vito Guarino, special agent in charge of the DEA's Caribbean division, said last October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has seen a 30 percent overall drop in the amount of cocaine smuggled into the United States over the same time period, partly due to increased drug interdiction efforts along the U.S.-Mexico border, Guarino said at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melendez told a news conference on Wednesday that a drug bust netted 1.1 tons of cocaine on the south coast of Puerto Rico in March. Drug traffickers use the Caribbean corridor as one of the preferred routes to send drugs to the United States, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last December a 33-foot long boat was seized off Puerto Rico containing 54 bales of cocaine weighing about 1,500 kilos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two suspected smugglers arrested on Monday were identified as Reny Alexander L&#243;pez Meneces and Andri Rivas Rojas Irving, both Venezuelan nationals. If convicted, they face from 10 years to life in prison and are being held at the federal detention center in San Juan on drug trafficking charges, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICE spokesman Ivan L. Ortiz-Delgado said the go-fast boat is believed to have traveled directly from Venezuela to Puerto Rico. He said smugglers use either this direct approach, or "island hop" through small eastern Caribbean nations or attempt to smuggle into the United States through the Dominican Republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bust was made by the Caribbean Corridor Strike Force (CCSF), an initiative of the U.S. Attorney's Office created to combat major drug trafficking organizations operating in the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by a Reuters correspondent in San Juan; Editing by David Adams)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is to give away its Windows operating system to makers of smartphones and small tablets for consumers as it seeks to make more of an impact on those fast-growing markets and counter the massive success of Google Inc's free Android platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's move, announced at its annual developers conference in San Francisco, is an attempt to broaden the small user base of mobile versions of Windows, in the hope that more customers will end up using Microsoft's money-making, cloud-based services such as Skype and Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to now, Microsoft has charged phone and tablet makers between $5 and $15 per device to use its Windows system, as it has done successfully at higher prices for many years with Windows on personal computers. Hardware makers factor the cost of that into the sale price of each device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That model has been obliterated in the past few years by the fast adoption of Google's Android system for phones and tablets, which hardware makers quickly embraced and now accounts for more than 75 percent of all smartphones sold last year. Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad account for most of the rest of the mobile computing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Windows-powered phones held only 3 percent of the global smartphone market last year. Windows tablets have only about 2 percent of the tablet market, according to tech research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FREE MONEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's move to make Windows free for some consumer devices bucks a central tenet of Bill Gates' original philosophy, that software should be paid for, which led to Microsoft's massive financial success over the last four decades. But analysts said it is a realistic reaction to the runaway success of free Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is facing challenges on the mobile and tablet fronts and need to change their strategy to move the growth needle, this is a good and logical first step," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows will be free for companies making phones and tablets with screen sizes under nine inches for the consumer market. A license fee will still apply for business devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes a week after new Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella unveiled new versions of Word, PowerPoint and Excel applications for Apple Inc's iPad. A year's free subscription to Microsoft's cloud-based Office 365 service will be offered on the new devices running the free Windows, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both moves show that Microsoft is now more interested in gaining market share for its cloud-based services such as Office on any platform or device, rather than its traditional approach of putting Windows at the center of everything it does and extending its influence from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new era of mobile computing, Nadella acknowledged Microsoft's underdog status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are going to innovate with a challenger mindset," said Nadella in a question and answer session at the developer conference. "We are not coming at this as some incumbent trying to do the next version of Windows, we are going to come at this by innovating in every dimension."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella did not have a snappy answer to the question of what Microsoft's overarching mission now was, after it had achieved its original goal of putting a computer on every desk and in every home. Instead he elaborated on remarks he made last week about the importance of mobile devices as everything we do becomes digitized and connected to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our vision, simply put, is to thrive in this world of mobile first, cloud first," said Nadella. "Our goal is to really build platforms, create the best end-user experiences, the best developer opportunities and IT infrastructure for this ubiquitous computing world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIRI RIVAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also at the gathering, Microsoft formally announced it has developed a voice activated phone assistant feature called Cortana, a direct rival to Apple's Siri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature has been rumored for some months and a test version was demonstrated at the event by Joe Belfiore, a Windows Phone executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cortana service, which can take verbal instructions to search the Web, set alarms, make calls and a host of other actions, is still in beta testing but will soon be a standard feature on Windows phones, said Belfiore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He announced that the latest version of Microsoft's smartphone software, called Windows Phone 8.1, will be rolled out to consumers as a downloadable upgrade in the next few months, and new phones running the software will be in stores by late April or early May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by David Gregorio and Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julien Grout, the former trader, is accused of participating in a conspiracy to hide losses within JPMorgan's Chief Investment Office in London by marking positions in a credit derivatives portfolio at inflated prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and another one-time trader at the bank, Javier Martin-Artajo, are considered fugitives by the U.S. government for not coming to the United States to face trial over charges stemming from the so-called London Whale scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at a hearing in federal court in New York, Marc Weinstein, a lawyer for Grout, told U.S. District Judge George Daniels that talks were under way with prosecutors about a bail package that would enable Grout, a French citizen, to come to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We certainly have been making efforts on Mr. Grout's behalf to get him here to face these charges," Weinstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of the bail negotiations came during a hearing in a parallel civil lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against Grout and Martin-Artajo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court papers, Grout's lawyers say he would come to the United States to face charges if he received a bail package that would allow him to return to France while awaiting trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a bail package is negotiated, Grout would be the first of the two defendants to submit to U.S. jurisdiction. Martin-Artajo who lives in Spain, has been fighting extradition. Both men deny wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, JPMorgan agreed to pay more than $1 billion to settle U.S. and British regulatory probes into the London Whale losses and admitted wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grout, who ceased working for JPMorgan in London in December 2012, has been out of work since then, his lawyers said in court papers. He moved into his parents' country home in France in July 2013, the lawyers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and Martin-Artajo were indicted in September on charges including securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward Little, another lawyer for Grout, said after Wednesday's hearing that the U.S. government was not open to allowing his client to return to France during trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little also said he might follow a suggestion Daniels made at the hearing to ask the judge overseeing the criminal case, U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield, to weigh in on the bail dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, are U.S. v.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds CEO quote, details on Windows pricing, Cortana launch)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, April 2 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
is to give away its Windows operating system to makers of
smartphones and small tablets for consumers as it seeks to make
more of an impact on those fast-growing markets and counter the
massive success of Google Inc's free Android platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's move, announced at its annual developers
conference in San Francisco, is an attempt to broaden the small
user base of mobile versions of Windows, in the hope that more
customers will end up using Microsoft's money-making,
cloud-based services such as Skype and Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to now, Microsoft has charged phone and tablet makers
between $5 and $15 per device to use its Windows system, as it
has done successfully at higher prices for many years with
Windows on personal computers. Hardware makers factor the cost
of that into the sale price of each device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That model has been obliterated in the past few years by the
fast adoption of Google's Android system for phones and tablets,
which hardware makers quickly embraced and now accounts for more
than 75 percent of all smartphones sold last year. Apple Inc's
 iPhone and iPad account for most of the rest of the
mobile computing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Windows-powered phones held only 3 percent of
the global smartphone market last year. Windows tablets have
only about 2 percent of the tablet market, according to tech
research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FREE MONEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's move to make Windows free for some consumer
devices bucks a central tenet of Bill Gates' original
philosophy, that software should be paid for, which led to
Microsoft's massive financial success over the last four
decades. But analysts said it is a realistic reaction to the
runaway success of free Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is facing challenges on the mobile and tablet
fronts and need to change their strategy to move the growth
needle, this is a good and logical first step," said Daniel
Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows will be free for companies making phones and tablets
with screen sizes under nine inches (23 cm) for the consumer
market. A license fee will still apply for business devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes a week after new Microsoft Chief Executive Satya
Nadella unveiled new versions of Word, PowerPoint and Excel
applications for Apple Inc's iPad. A year's free
subscription to Microsoft's cloud-based Office 365 service will
be offered on the new devices running the free Windows,
Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both moves show that Microsoft is now more interested in
gaining market share for its cloud-based services such as Office
on any platform or device, rather than its traditional approach
of putting Windows at the center of everything it does and
extending its influence from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new era of mobile computing, Nadella acknowledged
Microsoft's underdog status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are going to innovate with a challenger mindset," said
Nadella in a question and answer session at the developer
conference. "We are not coming at this as some incumbent trying 
to do the next version of Windows, we are going to come at this
by innovating in every dimension."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella did not have a snappy answer to the question of what
Microsoft's overarching mission now was, after it had achieved
its original goal of putting a computer on every desk and in
every home. Instead he elaborated on remarks he made last week
about the importance of mobile devices as everything we do
becomes digitized and connected to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our vision, simply put, is to thrive in this world of
mobile first, cloud first," said Nadella. "Our goal is to really
build platforms, create the best end-user experiences, the best
developer opportunities and IT infrastructure for this
ubiquitous computing world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIRI RIVAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also at the gathering, Microsoft formally announced it has
developed a voice activated phone assistant feature called
Cortana, a direct rival to Apple's Siri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature has been rumored for some months and a test
version was demonstrated at the event by Joe Belfiore, a Windows
Phone executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cortana service, which can take verbal instructions to
search the Web, set alarms, make calls and a host of other
actions, is still in beta testing but will soon be a standard
feature on Windows phones, said Belfiore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He announced that the latest version of Microsoft's
smartphone software, called Windows Phone 8.1, will be rolled
out to consumers as a downloadable upgrade in the next few
months, and new phones running the software will be in stores by
late April or early May.

      Management
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			David Winters rebuts Coca-Cola&#8217;s defense of its plan for up to $13 
      billion in additional equity awards, calling the proposal &#8216;potentially 
      highly dilutive&#8217; and &#8216;grossly outsized&#8217;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      David Winters, CEO of Wintergreen Advisers, said the response by The 
      Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) to Wintergreen&#8217;s criticism of its proposed 
      2014 equity compensation plan was &#8220;disappointing, defensive and 
      inadequate.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Winters made the comments during a webcast for fiduciaries, analysts 
      and the media in which he provided details of Wintergreen&#8217;s analysis of 
      the Coca-Cola 2014 Equity Plan. The call followed Wintergreen&#8217;s March 
      21, 2014 letter to the board of directors in which it characterized the 
      proposed plan as an &#8220;excessive transfer of wealth&#8221; from Coca-Cola 
      shareholders to the top five percent of the company&#8217;s management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In reviewing his firm&#8217;s analysis and Coca-Cola&#8217;s response, Winters said 
      his firm would vote against the 2014 Equity Plan because it believes the 
      plan is:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Potentially highly dilutive to shareholders
      
			
        Unsupported by any strategic rationale
      
			
        Unnecessary, since adequate capacity exists under Coca-Cola&#8217;s current 
        plans
      
			
        Inadequately disclosed in the proxy materials
      
			
        Grossly outsized for a company with earnings growth in the single

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blythe Masters, one of Wall Street's most powerful women, is leaving JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM.N) after a 27-year career that began as an intern in London and concludes with the sale of the multibillion-dollar commodities business she built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masters, who turned 45 in late March, will leave the bank in a few months after assisting with the sale of its physical energy and metals business to Swiss merchant Mercuria. Many observers had not expected her to remain with the business after its sale, although her future with JPMorgan was less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She will take "time off" and "consider future opportunities," according to a memo bank executives sent to employees on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a rising star within JPMorgan and credited with having helped create credit derivatives in the early 1990s, Masters' career took a much rockier turn in recent years as she got caught up in a regulatory inquiry and struggled to extract profits from the commodities operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She began her career at JPMorgan as an intern in London before entering Cambridge University, where she studied economics. She joined the commodities desk in 1991 after graduating, and later moved to the bank's derivatives desk, where she was considered a derivatives wunderkind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is known for having been part of the team that pioneered structured finance instruments which others on Wall Street took to excesses that fueled the U.S. housing bubble and set up the financial crisis of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After serving for several years as chief financial officer of the investment bank, Masters took the reins of the commodities desk in 2006 as interim head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the bank had been a sizeable player in commodities in the 1990s, with a global oil trading division led at the time by Masters' ex-husband, Danny Masters, it hadn't delved as deeply into the sector as investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), and had scaled back after facing regulatory scrutiny in metals markets toward the turn of the century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That changed with the acquisition of Bear Stearns in March 2008, which gave the bank a large physical power and gas business for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Masters at the helm, JPMorgan would go on to buy parts of UBS's (UBSN.VX) commodity business after the Swiss bank decided to get out of the sector at the height of the financial crisis. That was followed by the jewel in the JPMorgan commodities crown, the purchase of physically-focused RBS Sempra in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By August 2010, Masters was telling employees that Goldman and Morgan Stanley should be "scared" of JPMorgan's newly-expanded commodity operation, Bloomberg reported at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SECTOR TURNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more recently regulatory problems began to pile up. In 2013, the bank paid $410 million to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to settle allegations of power market manipulation in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Masters was not cited for any wrongdoing, her name is referenced in the regulator's order a number of times. The bank neither admitted nor denied any violations in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile regulators were turning a sharper eye on all of Wall Street's involvement in the raw materials supply chain, with the Federal Reserve questioning whether commercial banks like JPMorgan should be allowed to trade physical commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commodities trading, once considered a blockbuster billion-dollar business, was shrinking. Total commodity trading revenues on Wall Street have fallen by about two-thirds in the last five years, with the top 10 banks notching just $4.5 billion last year, according to a report by Coalition, a UK financial analytics firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is down from more than $14 billion at its peak in 2008, when the bumper returns earned by sector stalwarts Goldman and Morgan Stanley encouraged many other banks to expand into energy and metals trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Sheppard in London; Editing by James Dalgleish)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Buyout firm Advent International Corp's insurance payments auditing company Connolly LLC has agreed to merge with Goldman Sachs Group Inc's medical claims company iHealth Technologies Inc, an Advent representative said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is the latest example of private equity's interest in the U.S. insurance claims services sector, which has seen robust deal activity in the last few years as the industry's outlook improves amid a modest economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Advent spokesman said the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2014 but declined to comment on its value. Reuters reported last month that Goldman Sachs' private equity arm and Oak Investment Partners were in talks with other private equity firms to sell iHealth for more than $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact price agreed with Connolly could not be learned. Sources familiar with the auction for iHealth said Advent managed to substantially outbid other buyout firms thanks to synergies it identified with Connolly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs did not respond to a request for comment while Oak Investment Partners declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2001, Atlanta, Georgia-based iHealth provides analytics and services to contain medical and administration costs for more than 75 healthcare organizations, including insurance plans, according to its website. It was taken over by Goldman Sachs in 2006 for an undisclosed sum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1979, Wilton, Connecticut-based Connolly describes itself as the world's largest privately held recovery auditing services firm. It reviews more than a trillion transactions each year, recovering $2 billion in overpayments in the healthcare and retail sectors, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advent took over Connolly in 2012, financing the deal with $370 million of debt and $363 million of additional equity, according to Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The merger of Connolly and iHealth follows several other private equity deals in the sector in recent months. In February, for example, Starr Investment Holdings LLC, led by former AIG boss Maurice "Hank" Greenberg', struck a $4.4 billion deal to buy health insurance claims processor MultiPlan Inc from private equity firms BC Partners Ltd and Silver Lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This followed KKR &amp; Co LP's $2.4 billion takeover of Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc and $1.1 billion acquisition of Mitchell International Inc, and Apax Partners LLP's roughly $3 billion acquisition of One Call Care Management Inc and Align Networks Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Upgrades 5 Classes of JPMCC 2004-C1
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has upgraded five classes and affirmed five classes of 
      J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. 2004-C1 (JPMCC 
      2004-C1) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A detailed list 
      of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The upgrades are the result of increased credit enhancement from loan 
      payoffs and a significant amount of defeasance remaining in the pool. 
      The affirmations are due to the increasing concentration risk and 
      adverse selection of the remaining pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There are 19 loans remaining in the pool, three of which are defeased 
      (37.5%). Fitch has designated six loans (22.3%) as Fitch Loans of 
      Concern, which includes four specially serviced assets (17.4%). Fitch 
      modeled losses of 8.6% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the 
      original pool balance total 1.5%, including $9.6 million (0.9% of the 
      original pool balance) in realized losses to date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the March 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 92.8% to $74.9 million from $1.04 billion at 
      issuance. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting class NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is a 40,563 square foot (sf) 
      office complex located in Bloomfield Hills, MI (5.2% of the pool). The 
      loan transferred to special servicing in November 2013 due to maturity 
      default. As per the special servicer, the property was foreclosed upon 
      in March 2014 and a receiver has been appointed during the six month 
      right of redemption period. As per the property's year-end 2013 rent 
      roll, occupancy was 96.1%. Although, the largest tenant (50.7% of the 
      net rentable area) has not renewed their lease which expires in July 
      2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to Fitch expected losses is a 
      specially-serviced loan (3.9%), which was originally secured by 10,908 
      sf single tenant retail property located in Audubon, NJ. The loan 
      transferred to special servicing upon maturity in January 2014. Eckerd, 
      the single credit tenant, vacated the property around 2007 after it was 
      acquired by Rite Aid. Rite Aid assumed the lease and remains obligated 
      to pay rent until November 2023. The special servicer reports that the 
      loan remains current under its lockbox payment. Additionally, the 
      special servicer states the borrower has been unresponsive regarding 
      payoff.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is a 15,760 sf office 
      building located in Lawrenceville, GA, a distant suburb of Atlanta. The 
      loan transferred to special servicing in January 2013 for imminent 
      default after the largest tenant vacated. Foreclosure occurred in August 
      2013 and the special servicer is trying to lease-up the property and 
      reports the March 2014 occupancy is at 75%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating Outlooks on classes E through K are Stable due to increasing 
      credit enhancement, continued paydown and expected payoff from 
      defeasance. Upgrades to the lower rated classes are possible if losses 
      are lower than expected.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch upgrades the following classes and assigns or revises Rating 
      Outlooks as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11.5 million class E to 'AAAsf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11.7 million class F to 'AAAsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$9.1 million class G to 'AAAsf' from 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$10.4 million class H to 'Asf' from 'BBsf'; Outlook to Stable from 
      Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$6.5 million class J to 'BBsf' from 'Bsf'; Outlook to Stable from 
      Negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes, revises Rating Outlooks and assigns 
      REs as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5.2 million class K at 'Bsf'; Outlook to Stable from Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$3.9 million class L at 'CCCsf'; RE 100%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5.2 million class M at 'CCCsf'; RE 100%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.6 million class N at 'CCsf'; RE 100%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.6 million class P at 'Csf'; RE 100%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The class A-1, A-2, A-3, A-1A, B, C, D and X-2 certificates have paid in 
      full. Fitch does not rate the class NR certificates. Fitch previously 
      withdrew the rating on the interest-only class X-1 certificates.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 2 (IFR) - Leveraged finance veteran Ian Gilday
is departing Goldman Sachs to take up a role at rival bank
Morgan Stanley, according to multiple market sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilday was Goldman Sachs' former head of EMEA syndicate and
leveraged capital markets, but assumed a new role at the bank
last year as head of origination for collateralised loan
obligations in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources did not know what role Gilday will assume at
Morgan Stanley, but several said that it could be filling the
hole left by Mark Walsh's departure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Walsh left his role as co-head of European leveraged
finance and acquisition finance at Morgan Stanley in August 2013
to take up a new position at Credit Suisse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his departure Matt Naber, who was co-head of
leveraged finance and acquisition finance along with Walsh,
became sole head of Morgan Stanley's European leveraged finance
and acquisition finance team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilday joined Goldman in 2005. Prior to that he headed up
the European leveraged capital markets team at Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilday, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were not
immediately available for comment.

&lt;p&gt;* Cartel ran for almost ten years from 1999&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Shares in Prysmian rise on lower than expected fine

 (Adds Goldman Sachs, Prysmian, EU antitrust chief comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, April 2 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Goldman
Sachs, the world's top cablemaker Prysmian,
Nexans and eight other cable firms were fined a total
of 302 million euros ($416 million) by European regulators for
running a cartel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power cable cartel, made up of six European companies,
three Japanese and two Korean firms, ran for almost 10 years
from 1999, with the companies sharing markets and allocating
customers between themselves, the European Union's antitrust
authority said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prysmian received the biggest penalty from the EU at 104.6
million euros, which included a joint fine of 37.3 million euros
with Goldman Sachs. The bank acquired the Italian company via
one of its private equity funds in 2005 but has since sold its
holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prysmian said it would appeal against the European
Commission's decision, as did Danish company NKT Holding
 which received a much smaller fine. Goldman Sachs said
it may challenge the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Italian company said it "believes that the decision is
based on a superficial and erroneous analysis of the relevant
facts and, therefore, considers the decision unlawful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its shares rose more than 3 percent because the fine was less
than the 199 million euros the firm had set aside to pay it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said
Goldman Sachs played an active management role at Prysmian
during the cartel years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had evidence during our investigation of the direct
involvement of Goldman Sachs in the management decisions of the
company Prysmian," he told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said: "It is important to recognize that the
Commission has chosen to hold GS jointly and severally liable
with Prysmian solely under its parental liability doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Notably, there is no suggestion that Goldman Sachs or its
people had any knowledge or involvement in the purported
collusive behaviour."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. PROBE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities in Japan, South Korea and Australia have already
levied million-dollar fines against cable companies for
anti-competitive practices, and the United States Department of
Justice is also investigating the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU watchdog handed a 70.7 million euro fine to French
cable manufacturer Nexans, which said it would consider an
appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denmark's NKT Holding was fined 3.9 million euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not believe that there is evidence in the
Commission's allegations. We have not in any way been involved
in any form of cartels. Therefore, we disagree with the decision
and we will appeal," Chief Executive Michael Lyng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France's Safran, fined 8.6 million euros, said this
would not have a significant impact on its results as it had set
aside a provision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other cartel members include Japan's Exsym Corporation and
J-Power Systems Corporation and Korean peer LS Cable &amp; System
. None of the Asian companies were immediately
available to comment outside normal business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiss engineering firm ABB alerted the Commission
to the cartel and, as a result, escaped a fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a full list of the companies fined by the European
Commission, click here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7249 Euros)

			Skillsoft and IBM Reveal New Capabilities for Big Data in Enterprise 
      Learning
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Begin testing new engagement algorithm and recommendation engine 
      against Skillsoft&#8217;s 60,000 learning assets and millions of learner 
      interactions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Skillsoft 
      today revealed new capabilities as part of its multi-phase joint 
      development effort with IBM (NYSE: IBM) that leverage the power of big 
      data in enterprise learning. The current phase of the program has 
      produced algorithms to predict optimal engagement times, a content 
      recommendation engine and a visualization framework to provide the 
      foundation of a next-generation adaptive learning solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Skillsoft is a pioneer in the field of technology-delivered learning 
      with a long history of innovation and delivering solutions for its 
      customers worldwide, ranging from global enterprises, government, and 
      education to mid-sized and small businesses. Skillsoft has an unrivaled 
      environment of 19 million users across 60,000 learning assets. Skillsoft 
      partnered with IBM, a leader in big data technology, to mine its rich 
      customer base&#8217;s usage data and co-invent new customer experience 
      analytics which are expected to make their way into the Skillsoft 
      offerings. The initial results of this work will be presented to 
      attendees next week at the 2014 
      Global Skillsoft Perspectives learning industry event.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited by the early capabilities we are developing with IBM,&#8221; 
      said John Ambrose, Senior Vice President, Strategy, Corporate 
      Development and Emerging Business, Skillsoft. &#8220;We&#8217;re building a powerful 
      new big data engine that will enable us to optimize learning experiences 
      and uncover new learning patterns that can be applied immediately so 
      that the system is continually improving. This is the perfect 
      application of big data &#8211; harness it and apply it to improve individual 
      and organizational performance.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key components of the joint Skillsoft/IBM effort unveiled today 
      include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Engagement engine &#8211; mine usage patterns to understand users&#8217; evolving 
        interaction preferences in order to identify optimal times and 
        channels to engage with users
      
			
        Recommendations engine &#8211; create personalized learning recommendations 
        leveraging user-content interactions, content ontologies and temporal 
        consumption patterns
      
			
        Visualization techniques &#8211; to provide visual context for the 
        recommendations to explain to the user why certain personalized 
        content recommendations are being made along three different 
        dimensions: people similar to the user liked this content, content 
        similar to content the user liked, and popular content
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      With these assets in place, companies will be enabled to increase 
      training utilization and completion rates through targeted learning and 
      improved engagement, proving the investment value in a learning program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This big data-driven solution will facilitate higher engagement and 
      better outcomes for individual learners through a customized, seamless 
      program that melds their preferences with the successful experiences of 
      users with similar learning objectives. Enterprises will benefit by 
      providing employees with an adaptive learning system that grows smarter 
      and more powerful with each interaction, allowing them to develop and 
      manage talent more effectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to Anshul Sheopuri, Manager of Consumer Modeling, IBM 
      Research, &#8220;The objective of this collaboration with Skillsoft is to 
      significantly improve user engagement by creating personalized learning 
      recommendations that are delivered at times preferred by the user, and 
      delivered visually to communicate the rationale behind the 
      recommendations. We plan to pilot these big data technologies with 
      select Skillsoft customers and measure usage outcomes, prior to 
      deployment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This collaboration between Skillsoft and IBM capitalizes on the 
      explosive growth of big data and the efforts of organizations to find 
      new ways to maximize performance using big data technology and analysis. 
      In 2013, Gartner reported that 64 
      percent of organizations invested or planned to invest in big data 
      technology, a continual increase from previous years. The corporate 
      learning market provides an ideal application area for big data 
      analytics. As organizations continue to offer more online learning to 
      their employees, they need to analyze which learning experiences are the 
      most productive and apply that knowledge to continually improve business 
      outcomes. This combination of business need, data and technology 
      presents an industry landscape that is ripe for capitalizing on the full 
      value of what big data and analytics can bring.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Skillsoft and IBM are now nearing the completion of the initial 
      technology co-development and demonstration phase of this effort and 
      will be soon moving into pilot phase where the algorithms will be 
      applied in real-world environments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A video highlighting the collaboration is scheduled to premiere at 2014 
      Global Skillsoft Perspectives, and be subsequently released to the 
      Skillsoft YouTube channel and corporate website.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs, the world's top cablemaker Prysmian, Nexans and eight cable firms were fined a total of 302 million euros ($416 million) by EU antitrust regulators on Wednesday for running a cartel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power cable cartel ran for almost 10 years from 1999, with the companies sharing markets and allocating customers between themselves, the EU antitrust authority said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prysmian received the biggest penalty at 104.6 million euros, which included a joint fine of 37.3 million euros with Goldman Sachs. The bank acquired the Italian company via one of its private equity funds in 2005 but has since sold its holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, shares in Prymian rose more than 3 percent because the firm had set aside 199 million euros to pay the fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said other cartel members included Japanese cable firms Exsym Corporation, J-Power Systems Corporation and Viscas Corporation, Korean peer LS Cable &amp; System and General Cable Corp via its subsidiary Silec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Part of this plan was to allocate important high voltage power cable projects in the European Economic Area (EEA), including large infrastructure and renewable energy projects such as offshore wind farms," the Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danish company NKT Holding, which had a 3.9 million euro fine, said it would challenge the decision in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not believe that there is evidence in the Commission's allegations. We have not in any way been involved in any form of cartels. Therefore, we disagree with the decision and we will appeal," NKT Chief Executive Michael Lyng told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other penalized companies were South Korean firm Taihan Electric Wire, Mitsubishi Cable Industries, Sumitomo Electric Industries and Hitachi Metals Ltd. Sumitomo and Hitachi were J-Power Systems' previous owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities in Japan, South Korea and Australia have already levied million-dollar fines against cable companies for anti-competitive practices, and the United States Department of Justice is also investigating the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ole Mikkelsen in Copenhagen and Francesca Landini and Massimo Gaia in Milan; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds no comment from Goldman Sachs, KKR and TPG Capital)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 2 (Reuters) - A plan being discussed to reorganize
power company Energy Future Holdings Corp will all but wipe out
the investments of owners KKR &amp; Co, TPG Capital 
and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Bloomberg reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The private equity firms may accept as little as 1 percent
of the equity in debt-laden Energy Future Holdings after it
completes a Chapter 11 restructuring, Bloomberg reported, citing
three people with direct knowledge of the negotiations. (r.reuters.com/dum28v)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy Future was formed after KKR, TPG and the unit of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc led a record $45 billion
leveraged buyout of former TXU Corp in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy Future was expected to report that its auditor had
determined it could not survive as a going concern, a finding
that would have triggered a default on its loans and a likely
bankruptcy filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the company said on Monday it has extended a
deadline to file its annual report, giving it more time to
negotiate with creditors as it seeks an agreement to reduce its
crushing debt of more than $40 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources close to the debt restructuring talks have told
Reuters that the company is likely to be broken up in
bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal, which may still fall through, would also give
full legal releases to KKR, TPG and Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy Future was not immediately available for comment
outside regular U.S. business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, KKR and TPG declined to comment on the
report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy Future owns 14 power plants, including five
coal-fired plants. Its generation business, Luminant, and
regulated distribution unit, Oncor, both rank among the largest
in the United States.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is in the process of selling its "designated market-maker" unit, people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-based investment bank is in talks with Dutch firm IMC Financial Markets to sell the trading business, according to a Wall Street Journal report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NYSE and Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the story. IMC Financial Markets could not be reached outside of normal business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formerly known as "specialists," designated market-makers operate both manually and electronically to facilitate price discovery during market openings, closings and during periods of substantial trading imbalances or instability for thousands of NYSE-listed stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person close to the matter told the FT that Goldman will retain a brokerage role and continue to provide liquidity electronically for NYSE stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman acquired the designated market-maker unit as part of its $6.5 billion purchase in 2000 of Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg, which ranked as the largest U.S. stock and options clearing firm by volume at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Spear, Leeds assets have helped Goldman build lucrative electronic stock trading platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Aashika Jain in Bangalore; Editing by Tom Brown, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, April 2 (Reuters) - The European Union antitrust
regulator fined investment bank Goldman Sachs, the
world's top cablemaker Prysmian, Nexans and
eight cable firms a total of 302 million euros ($416 million) on
Wednesday for running a power cable cartel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prysmian received the biggest penalty at 104.6 million
euros, which included a joint fine of 37.3 million euros with
Goldman Sachs. The bank acquired the Italian company via one of
its private equity funds in 2005 but has since sold its holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said other cartel members included
Japanese cable firms Exsym Corporation, J-Power Systems
Corporation and Viscas Corporation, Korean peer LS Cable &amp;
System and General Cable Corp via its
subsidiary Silec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters had reported on March 21 that the Commission would
penalise the companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7249 Euros)

      Microsoft and Xamarin Collaborate to Establish .NET Foundation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Enterprise Leaders Provide Support to Foster the Evolution and 
      Innovation of Open Source .NET Technologies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			MICROSOFT BUILD CONFERENCE -- Xamarin 
      today announced that the company is joining forces with Microsoft to 
      support the newly established, independent .NET 
      Foundation. The .NET Foundation will foster development and 
      collaboration efforts for the growing collection of open source .NET 
      technologies. Over six million C# developers, including Xamarin's 
      growing community of over 570,000 mobile developers, will benefit from 
      the increased visibility, community participation and rapid innovation 
      that the Foundation will foster. As part of the launch, Xamarin&#8217;s 
      cofounder and CTO Miguel de Icaza will join the .NET Foundation as a 
      founding board member, and Xamarin will contribute six projects to the 
      Foundation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Xamarin&#8217;s participation in the formation of an independent .NET 
      Foundation will help us collectively support the collaborative and 
      inventive spirit we see from developers,&#8221; said S. Somasegar, Corporate 
      Vice President of Microsoft Corp. Developer Division. &#8220;Working together 
      to support open source technologies will help our joint .NET developer 
      communities innovate faster.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of its founding the .NET Foundation will have 25 .NET open source 
      projects under its stewardship, including Microsoft&#8217;s newly announced 
      .NET Compiler Platform (&#8220;Roslyn&#8221;) and the ASP.NET 
      family of open source projects. Xamarin is contributing six 
      projects to the foundation, including MimeKit and MailKit &#8212; robust 
      cross-platform email libraries optimized for mobile. Additionally, 
      Xamarin announced that Roslyn functionality will be incorporated into 
      their mobile developer platform, enabling Xamarin developers to leverage 
      Roslyn APIs to programmatically access C#.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In Xamarin&#8217;s work to help .NET developers go mobile, we've experienced 
      first hand the .NET developer community's passion for open source, 
      through their contributions, as well as the significant number of open 
      source libraries available in the Xamarin Component Store,&#8221; said Nat 
      Friedman, co-founder and CEO, Xamarin. &#8220;Working with Microsoft as part 
      of the .NET Foundation will help foster innovation faster for our joint 
      developer communities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the rise of enterprise mobility, BYOD and the consumerization of 
      IT, enterprises are focused on building apps for connected devices and 
      services, and a primary goal of the Foundation is to support developers 
      in this new world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The .NET Foundation will help accelerate the adoption of .NET across 
      every platform and computing form factor&#8212;servers, mobile devices and 
      desktops,&#8221; said Miguel de Icaza, co-founder and CTO of Xamarin, and 
      founding member of the .NET Foundation board. &#8220;We look forward to 
      working with Microsoft and the entire .NET developer community to 
      increase the rate of innovation.&#8221;

and thus part of the pension funds' investment could be in
danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Corporate transparency in this arena is truly necessary for
assessing risk and ensuring that all stakeholders have the
information they need to make informed decisions," Scott
Stringer, the city's comptroller, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year a similar shareholder proposal received support
from roughly 30 percent of shares cast at Exxon's annual
meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon spokesman was not immediately available to comment
on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The environmental group As You Sow, along with several
religious orders, had joined the comptroller's office in filing
the initial shareholder resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month Exxon agreed to report on how it views the risks
climate change could post to the value of its assets.

      that it has entered into an agreement with Pfizer Inc. that 
      provides Pfizer access to evaluate the company&#8217;s proprietary molecular 
      signature for hepatocellular carcinoma. The 56-gene molecular signature 
      covered by the agreement is intended to predict the clinical prognosis 
      of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and subcategorize patients 
      into six separate classifications based on the molecular characteristics 
      of their liver tumors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to have our molecular signature evaluated by one of the 
      world&#8217;s leading pharmaceutical companies,&#8221; said Dr. Bernard Courtieu, 
      IntegraGen&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;The use of our molecular 
      signature may help to identify specific patient populations who would 
      benefit from Pfizer&#8217;s experimental compounds, if approved by regulatory 
      authorities. We are also extremely appreciative of the research 
      conducted by Professor Jessica Zucman-Rossi which led to the development 
      of this molecular signature with the continued support of the French

      The French League Against Cancer is an non-profit, non-governmental 
      organization that is an independent voluntary funder of research against 
      cancer. With nearly 700,000 members and 13,000 volunteers, the League is 
      a grassroots movement organized into a federation of 103 local 
      committees. Together, they fight in three complementary directions: 
      search for cure, prevent to protect, support for help. Today, the League 
      is making the fight against cancer a societal issue bringing together 
      the largest possible number of health actors but also economic, social 
      or political actors in all territories. Breaking taboos and fears, the 
      League contributes to change the image of cancer and those who are 
      affected. The French League Against Cancer finances and manages a 
      national program of cancer genomics, called CIT &#8220;Cartes d&#8217;Identit&#233; des 
      Tumeurs&#174;&#8221; (Tumors Identity Cards). This program (http://cit.ligue-cancer.net)

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. officials invited British chef Nigella Lawson on Thursday to reapply for a visa to enter the United States after the television celebrity was barred for boarding a flight last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Daily Mail newspaper, Lawson, dubbed the "Domestic Goddess" after the title of one of her cookery books, was prevented from flying to the United States because she had confessed to taking drugs during a recent court battle with her former assistants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman from the U.S. Embassy in London confirmed Lawson had been refused entry but declined to provide an explanation, adding the chef was welcome to reapply for travel documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have invited her to come and apply for a visa," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson made headlines globally when she told a London court she had taken cocaine several times and smoked cannabis at the end of her 10-year marriage to art dealer Charles Saatchi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British police decided not take any action against the 54-year-old following her admission which was made during the trial of her two former assistants who were later cleared of charges of defrauding the couple of 685,000 pounds ($1.12 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Lawson went to London's Heathrow airport on Sunday to catch a flight to Los Angeles, she was told she would not be allowed on the flight and returned home, according to the Daily Mail newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Lawson declined to comment on the story, whether Lawson was turned away or on how this could affect her career in the United States, where she is judge on the talent show "The Taste".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson could not herself immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial of the two assistants, sisters Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, fascinated Britain with lurid tales of drug use, lavish spending and marital bullying. The Italian sisters alleged that Lawson used cocaine, cannabis and prescription pills daily for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial followed Lawson and Saatchi's divorce last July. Their marriage fell apart after Saatchi was photographed clasping his wife's throat at a restaurant in London's Mayfair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson is currently starring in TV cookery contest show "The Taste" broadcast in both Britain on Channel 4 and in the United States on Walt Disney Co's ABC network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Belinda Goldsmith; Editing by Angus MacSwan)&lt;/p&gt;

documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have invited her to come and apply for a visa," she
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson made headlines globally when she told a London court
she had taken cocaine several times and smoked cannabis at the
end of her 10-year marriage to art dealer Charles Saatchi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British police decided not take any action against the
54-year-old following her admission which was made during the
trial of her two former assistants who were later cleared of
charges of defrauding the couple of 685,000 pounds ($1.12
million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Lawson went to London's Heathrow airport on Sunday
to catch a flight to Los Angeles, she was told she would not be
allowed on the flight and returned home, according to the Daily
Mail newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Lawson declined to comment on the story,
whether Lawson was turned away or on how this could affect her
career in the United States, where she is judge on the talent
show "The Taste".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson could not herself immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial of the two assistants, sisters Francesca and
Elisabetta Grillo, fascinated Britain with lurid tales of drug
use, lavish spending and marital bullying. The Italian sisters
alleged that Lawson used cocaine, cannabis and prescription
pills daily for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial followed Lawson and Saatchi's divorce last July.
Their marriage fell apart after Saatchi was photographed
clasping his wife's throat at a restaurant in London's Mayfair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson is currently starring in TV cookery contest show "The
Taste" broadcast in both Britain on Channel 4 and in the United
States on Walt Disney Co's ABC network.

      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 4441Z Trust
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4441Z 'AA/F1'; Stable Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --DRIVERs, Series 4441Z 'AA'; Stable Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA' ratings with a Stable Outlook assigned to the series 
      4441Z PUTTERs and 4441Z DRIVERs are based on the ratings that Fitch has 
      assigned to the El Paso County Hospital District Combination Tax and 
      Revenue Certificates of Obligation, Series 2013 (rated 'AA'; Stable 
      Outlook) that have been deposited in the series 4441Z trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4441Z PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (rated 
      'A+/F1'; Stable Outlook by Fitch). The 'F1' rating assigned to the 
      PUTTERs will expire on April 2, 2015, the expiration date of the 
      liquidity facility, unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

      Research and Markets: Global Smart Classroom Market 2014-2018 with 
      Apple, IBM, Microsoft, and SMART Technologies Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/tb9mwc/global_smart) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Smart Classroom Market 2014-2018 with Apple, IBM, Microsoft, and SMART 
      Technologies Dominating" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Smart Classroom market to grow at a CAGR of 31% to 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The growing importance of 3D educational tools is a trend being 
      witnessed in the market. 3D learning places students in a virtual 
      environment which provides information in an effective manner. In 
      addition, advancements in animation technology provide better 3D 
      learning solutions to K-12 classrooms. 3D learning technology helps in 
      understanding concepts through visuals. Moreover, it will have an impact 
      on the overall performance of the students as it increases student 
      motivation, attention span, and engagement. In addition, it shows 
      behavioral and communication changes among students leading to improved 
      interaction in the classroom.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in the market is an 
      increasing scope for interactive display instruments. Interactive 
      display instruments help in attracting students towards the class in 
      progress thus improving the overall performance of the students. Since 
      institutions are concerned about providing the best service to students 
      in order to also improve the performance of the institutions, these 
      products are in high demand. Therefore, vendors are also trying to 
      customize the software and hardware to provide better outcomes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is the high cost of implementation of smart classroom devices and 
      related applications. Although they offer several benefits, this 
      capital-intensive technology is a major barrier for adoption among 
      institutions. In addition to capital costs, maintenance of such systems 
      can also be expensive, thereby limiting the growth of the market.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major U.S. companies including Ford, Apple and Pfizer have formed a lobbying group aimed at pushing back at some changes to the patent system members of Congress have proposed, saying these measures would hinder protection of valuable inventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group is concerned about pending legislation aimed at fighting so-called patent assertion entities (PAEs), companies which produce nothing but instead buy up patents and then attempt to extract licensing fees or sue for infringement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called the Partnership for American Innovation, the group warned that steps to stop the PAEs could also hurt truly innovative companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies signing on to the effort so far are Apple Inc., DuPont, Ford Motor Co., General Electric, IBM Corp, Microsoft Corp and Pfizer Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a feeling that the negative rhetoric is leading to a very anti-patent environment," said David Kappos, director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office from 2009 to 2013, who advises the group. He is with the law firm Cravath, Swaine and Moore, LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the group would oppose efforts to make software or biotechnology unpatentable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, Cisco and other supporters of efforts to curb frivolous patent litigation from PAEs, often termed "patent trolls," supported a bill that easily passed the U.S. House of Representatives in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That bill encourages judges hearing patent cases to require the losing party to cover the winners' legal bills, a concept known as "loser pays." It also requires companies filing infringement lawsuits to detail which patent is infringed - something that does not regularly happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate Senate patent bill is scheduled to be marked up soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diane Bartz, editing by Ros Krasny and David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BELLEVUE, Wash., April 3, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adaptiva, a leading provider of add-ins for Microsoft's System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), today announced the availability of its Content Push Policy to simplify enterprise migrations to SCCM 2012. As part of Adaptiva's OneSite solution, Content Push Policy streamlines the client migration from SCCM 2007 by eliminating the need for server infrastructure while transferring the SCCM 2012 client only once over the WAN to each operating location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	When Microsoft ends support of SCCM 2007 on July 8, 2014, many businesses depending on it will urgently plan a move to SCCM 2012, if they have not already. With OneSite's Content Push Policy, organizations running SCCM 2007 are able to deploy SCCM 2012 in a fraction of the time while cutting significant infrastructure costs. Additionally, OneSite installs the SCCM 2012 client and all of its prerequisites without using distribution points (DPs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"With the end of life for SCCM 2007 nearing, it's imperative for companies to make the move to SCCM 2012," said Deepak Kumar, founder and CTO of Adaptiva. "System migration involves a lot of data. Content Push Policy simplifies and speeds migration, in most cases by orders of magnitude. It also substantially accelerates new SCCM 2012 installations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Content Push Policy features and benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;
			
		Efficiency: Content Push Policy flips all SCCM clients to the new environment within minutes.
			
		Execution: Allows software to be downloaded, unpacked, distributed and executed all outside of SCCM.
			
		Office Push: Post-migration, Office Push automatically selects a specified number of the most suitable machines, becoming pivotal in content delivery. For example, Content Push Policy will select the five best machines in each location for pre-staging.
		&lt;p&gt;
	Using OneSite, administrators looking to migrate to SCCM 2012 benefit from predictive bandwidth harvesting (PBH) for WAN optimization. PBH looks at when the WAN will be congested, in milliseconds, and sends data only when it will not interfere with other business-critical traffic. Content already cached at operating locations in the 2007 environment will remain in the 2012 environment, avoiding massive "re-downloading" WAN traffic. Users also benefit from an intelligent virtual SAN at each location, without requiring new disk capacity or taking up disk space from end users. Further, OneSite eliminates the need for PXE servers with peer-to-peer PXE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Technical information about OneSite is available at www.adaptiva.com/onesite-deep-dive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About Adaptiva&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Founded in 2004 by the lead architect of Microsoft SMS 2003, Adaptiva has grown into a leading global provider of IT systems management solutions for Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM). Adaptiva extends SCCM to run with no infrastructure and provide faster worldwide content delivery&#8212;without impacting WAN traffic or end-user systems. Adaptiva's suite of SCCM add-ins automatically diagnoses and repairs problems with clients and servers, and intelligently reduces IT power consumption. Adaptiva software is deployed on millions of devices in over 60 countries, and is sold directly and through a network of partners and channel resellers.

			Research and Markets: Global SaaS-based Expense Management Market 
      2014-2018 with Ariba, Concur Technologies, IBM  Oracle Dominating
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/3jfgnq/global_saasbased) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      SaaS-based Expense Management Market 2014-2018 with Ariba, Concur 
      Technologies, IBM  Oracle Dominating" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      End-to-end expense management solutions automate all components of 
      expense management processes such as travel booking, expense reporting, 
      employee reimbursement, and expense analysis. Thus, these automated 
      end-to-end processes cover the whole span of the expense-related 
      process; from travel booking plans to reporting and payments. End-to-end 
      expense management solutions allow the expense manager to have greater 
      control and reduce reporting errors. In addition, this speeds up the 
      process and improves the operational efficiency of the company. With an 
      end-to-end expense management solution in place, companies can 
      significantly lower their expense processing cost compared to companies 
      that do not use any such solution. In addition, end-to-end solutions 
      accelerate the process of reporting expenses, thus providing cost 
      benefits. Hence, to cater to the increasing demand, many vendors are now 
      offering end-to-end expense management solutions that not only have the 
      capability to track expenses, but can also perform historical spend 
      analysis, predictive analysis, and other similar functions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in the market is the 
      need to reduce expenses and operational costs. Enterprises are looking 
      for ways to reduce overall business expenses, a large portion of which 
      is usually incurred in employees' travel. This has forced them to 
      automate the process of expense management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is the concern over data security. In a SaaS-based model, there 
      is always a risk of information leakage, which could result in the 
      misuse or manipulation of organizational expense data. Concerns about 
      data security can be a significant barrier for deploying SaaS-based 
      expense management solutions. Also, placing a company's asset 
      information on a digital platform is a major concern unless security 
      mechanisms can be implemented and trusted by the enterprises.

      Praxair works with Coca-Cola globally, supplying the company with carbon 
      dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen. The company has supplied CO2 
      to Coca-Cola bottling plants in China since the late 1990&#8217;s, including 
      Beijing and Tianjin in northern China and the Anhui, Jiangsu and 
      Zhejiang provinces, as well as Shanghai in eastern China. In China, 
      Coca-Cola uses the CO2 for the production of non-alcoholic 
      sparkling beverages.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Praxair Beijing achieved the highest score among all suppliers on a 
      rigorous on-site assessment review. The assessment included reviews of 
      the company&#8217;s raw materials, quality-control systems, customer service 
      and its finished products. Coca-Cola also took into consideration the 
      consistency of Praxair&#8217;s CO2 products and the overall 
      reliability of its supply to the company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It is an honor to be recognized for our quality and reliability by 
      Coca-Cola China, a business known for its world-class quality 
      standards,&#8221; said Dr. Minda Ho, president of Praxair China. &#8220;I&#8217;m proud of 
      everyone on our team who has worked so closely with Coca-Cola and was 
      instrumental in Praxair receiving this award. It&#8217;s our great teamwork 
      across operations, sales, customer service, logistics and distribution 
      that enables us to make such a difference for our customers.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, April 3 (Reuters) - Major U.S. companies
including Ford, Apple and Pfizer have formed a lobbying group
aimed at pushing back at some changes to the patent system
members of Congress have proposed, saying these measures would
hinder protection of valuable inventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group is concerned about pending legislation aimed at
fighting so-called patent assertion entities (PAEs), companies
which produce nothing but instead buy up patents and then
attempt to extract licensing fees or sue for infringement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called the Partnership for American Innovation, the group
warned that steps to stop the PAEs could also hurt truly
innovative companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies signing on to the effort so far are Apple Inc.
, DuPont, Ford Motor Co., General Electric
, IBM Corp, Microsoft Corp and Pfizer Inc
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a feeling that the negative rhetoric is leading to
a very anti-patent environment," said David Kappos, director of
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office from 2009 to 2013, who
advises the group. He is with the law firm Cravath, Swaine and
Moore, LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the group would oppose efforts to make
software or biotechnology unpatentable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, Cisco and other supporters of
efforts to curb frivolous patent litigation from PAEs, often
termed "patent trolls," supported a bill that easily passed the
U.S. House of Representatives in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That bill encourages judges hearing patent cases to require
the losing party to cover the winners' legal bills, a concept
known as "loser pays." It also requires companies filing
infringement lawsuits to detail which patent is infringed -
something that does not regularly happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate Senate patent bill is scheduled to be marked up
soon.

			&lt;p&gt;CloudReady Insight Solution Calculates the ROI of Migrating to Office 365&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;WALTHAM, MA--(Marketwired - Apr 3, 2014) - Exoprise, a provider of software-as-a-service (SaaS) based monitoring and enablement solutions for cloud applications, today announced a new program to help existing Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 users evaluate the potential ROI of migrating to the Office 365 Exchange Online service. Sponsored by Microsoft's U.S. Marketing  Operations group, the enablement effort, being offered free of charge, provides all Microsoft field sales, partners and end-customer IT professionals in the U.S. with a cost-assessment and readiness solution from Exoprise to help users evaluate the ROI benefits and user readiness for migrating to Microsoft's cloud-based Office applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assessment solution typically costs $1,000 to access, but is free of charge for customers currently running Exchange Server 2003, which reaches end of support on April 8th. The program runs through May 31, 2014. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exoprise CloudReady Insight is an automated solution that enables users to define optimal migration plans based on their organization's specific requirements and usage patterns. It runs in the customer's environment, analyzing existing Outlook and Exchange Server usage and document collaboration needs. This provides IT teams with detailed user readiness and migration planning guidance, as well as a comparison of the total cost of ownership of their current on premise Microsoft Exchange deployment vs. the Office 365 Exchange Online service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For many businesses, the end of support for Windows XP and Exchange Server 2003 is an opportunity to update their email and communications deployments to leverage the cloud," said Patrick Carey, vice president of product management and marketing for Exoprise. "The Exoprise CloudReady Insight solution is very timely for those customers evaluating their next steps. It helps IT teams make this transition with confidence by giving them real, objective data for their environment, showing them cost benefits and user readiness for Office 365. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information on the program for end-users is available at http://www.exoprise.com/solutions/insight/office365/. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets: Global Messaging Platform Market 2014-2018 with 
      IBM Corp., Microsoft Corp., and Oracle Corp. Dominating
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/xcvb68/global_messaging) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Messaging Platform Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers in the market is the high demand for internal 
      collaboration. The rapid globalization and expansion of businesses has 
      resulted in the need for better communication capability within the 
      business environment. Communication can be facilitated by messages, 
      emails, calls, conferences, face-to-face meetings, and online messaging. 
      Messaging platforms enable the exchange of data and information through 
      instant messaging, audio and video conferencing, and email.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increasing adoption of enterprise social tools is a major trend 
      witnessed in the market in recent years. Over the last decade, many 
      organizations have increased the amount of data being generated in their 
      data warehouses. Social media applications can be seen as a new trend 
      that could best describe the large amount of unstructured data generated 
      in enterprise data warehouses. Various business units across 
      organizations are subscribing to social applications and platforms 
      without any company-wide approach. In order to solve this, organizations 
      have started to explore policies and solutions that enable the 
      consistent usage of social tools across the organization. Although the 
      majority of organizations are currently using enterprise social tools 
      for internal purposes such as training, recruiting, and internal 
      collaboration, future adoption plans will be more focused towards the 
      usage of social tools for communicating with and gaining feedback from 
      customers and consumers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that despite the presence of several drivers, 
      the growth of the Global Messaging Platform market is curtailed by some 
      serious challenges. One such challenge is the lack of integration with 
      other legacy systems. Most organizations are faced with many issues 
      during the integration of messaging platforms with their existing legacy 
      systems. The majority of organizations prefer the integration of 
      messaging platforms with other communications systems and business 
      software such as productivity suites, analytics, CRM, and ERP.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Advertisers Leveraged the Year&#8217;s Largest TV Events to Deliver 
      Creative that Moved Americans
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ace Metrix&#174;, the new standard in television and video advertising 
      analytics, today announced the most effective ads to debut during the 
      first quarter of 2014&#8212;a season that included four of the largest TV 
      audiences advertisers will have access to all year. Both of Budweiser&#8217;s 
      heartstring-pulling Super Bowl ads top the list of category standouts 
      followed by Google&#8217;s Oscar inspired ads. Two more Super Bowl ads were 
      the highest scoring ads for the quarter: Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;Empowering&#8221; (Ace 
      Score 710) and Hyundai&#8217;s &#8220;Dad&#8217;s Sixth Sense&#8221; (Ace Score 706), which are 
      also two of only three ads to ever break 700 of more than 32,000 ads in 
      the Ace Metrix database.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Many advertisers used the epic stages of the first quarter to 
      demonstrate their storytelling prowess&#8212;delivering ads that inspired and 
      introduced us to the brand in a new way,&#8221; said Peter Daboll, Ace Metrix 
      CEO. &#8220;Google and Budweiser have demonstrated exceptional skill at 
      delivering broadly appreciated, highly emotive ads, but we also saw 
      compelling stories from Microsoft, Hyundai and Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The top ads across both lists earned Emotional Sentiment Index (ESI) 
      scores well above the 12-month average of 48, indicating that each of 
      these ads generated positive emotional engagement from consumers.

			Category StandoutsThis quarter&#8217;s category standouts 
      outperformed their competitive set with stories of friendship, 
      inspiration, and pride. Budweiser&#8217;s iconic Clydesdales have a reputation 
      for earning high praise and high scores and debut almost exclusively 
      during the Super Bowl. This year Budweiser introduced two tearjerker 
      spots&#8212;one featuring the friendship between a puppy and the majestic 
      horses, while the other focused on a hero&#8217;s return. &#8220;Puppy Love&#8221; drew 
      the highest score on the Emotional Sentiment Index that the brand has 
      ever produced (83). &#8220;Puppy Love&#8221; and &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Welcome&#8221; earned the second 
      and fifth ranked positions respectively, in terms of Super Bowl XLVIII 
      ads and claimed the number one and two spots on the top ads of the 
      quarter list, outperforming the beer category average by more than 37%. 
      Budweiser was ranked third among Beer brands according to the recently 
      published Ace Metrix BLACKBOOK&#8212;up from eighth place in the 2013 edition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Google&#8217;s Oscar inspired ads ranked third and fourth with an ode to 
      creativity. &#8220;Tonight&#8221; (Ace Score 627) was a tribute to the movies and 
      their makers (featuring Google Play) and &#8220;We&#8217;re All Storytellers&#8221; (Ace 
      Score 625) was a tribute to the potential movie-maker in all of us 
      (featuring Google search). Both outperformed the Websites category 
      average by approximately 36%. Google recently earned the 2013 Brand of 
      the Year both overall and was the number one ranked brand within the 
      Software  Websites BLACKBOOK category.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rounding out the top five list was Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods &#8220;Sports Matter 
      - Combo&#8221; (Ace Score 637), a particularly notable accomplishment given 
      that nearly 20% of the 1,800 ads to debut last quarter were from a 
      retailer, and this ad outperformed the Retail average by 33%. The ad 
      delivered another emotive story on why sports matter in our daily lives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Every ad in the category standouts list was at least :60 long and is 
      consistent with the data that Ace Metrix has published about how 
      consumers process longer ads, how ads have lengthened in the Super Bowl, 
      and how length contributes to emotion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Highest Scoring Ads Break BarriersMicrosoft&#8217;s &#8220;Empowering&#8221; 
      earned an Ace Score of 710, the highest scoring ad of the quarter, the 
      highest scoring ad of the Super Bowl, and the second highest Ace Score 
      in our entire database. The ad effectively reached across ages and 
      demographics, imparting information about several Microsoft product 
      brands (Surface, Skype, Windows 8, Microsoft Hardware, and Kinect) 
      through stories of how technology can help humankind overcome any number 
      of physical obstacles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hyundai&#8217;s &#8220;Dad&#8217;s Sixth Sense&#8221; earned an Ace Score of 706&#8224;, 
      the second highest scoring ad of the quarter and third highest scoring 
      ad of all time. The general population score (681) earned &#8220;Dad&#8217;s Sixth 
      Sense&#8221; third place overall and first in terms of automotive ads on the 
      Super Bowl ranked list. Captivated consumers received an entertaining 
      product demonstration during this artfully crafted story of parental 
      protection.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TGI Friday&#8217;s claimed third place with the introduction of its &#8220;New 
      Burgers,&#8221; which elicited Desire scores 14% above the norm for 
      Restaurants ads. Ore-Ida&#8217;s &#8220;Fresh Take On Ore-Ida&#8221; combined humor and 
      information with adorable kids to earn fourth place. The sole 
      Olympic-themed ad to make either list, &#8220;Mom&#8217;s Work&#8221; earned Procter  
      Gamble the final place on the top scorer&#8217;s list. Building off of the 
      exceptional &#8220;Thank You, Mom&#8221; campaign introduced for the Summer 
      Olympics, this ad was among the first to debut in January ahead of the 
      Winter Olympics.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While not as prevalent as the category standout list, longer form 
      content again made an impact on the overall list with two ads clocking 
      in at :60 or longer (Microsoft  PG). All told 70% of the winners 
      across both categories employed longer-form story-telling approaches&#8212;a 
      trend worth watching as the year progresses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			&#8224;Luxury Automotive Ace Scores are reflective of an

      events with general population audiences such as the Super Bowl and

      consumer market and are used in weekly, quarterly, and yearly top ads

			Award Qualification and MethodologyThe Ad of the Quarter 
      honor is awarded to the ads with the highest percentage gap to the 
      twelve-month category norm that debuted nationally between January 1, 
      2014 and March 31, 2014. A Top Ads list is also provided for the ads 
      earning the highest Ace Scores among the same set. The Ace Score is the 
      measure of ad creative effectiveness based on viewer reaction to 
      national TV ads, providing the advertising industry an unbiased resource 
      to measure creative impact. Ace Metrix scores every national television 
      ad across 96 categories creating a complete comparative database, Ace 
      Metrix LIVE&#174;. A unique panel of at least 500 consumers, representative 
      of the U.S. TV viewing audience, scores each ad in the exact same 
      manner. The results are presented on a scale of 1&#8211;950, which represents 
      scoring on creative attributes such as Persuasion, Likeability, 
      Information, Attention, Change, Relevance, Desire, and Watchability. Ace 
      Metrix applies a natural language processing algorithm to the hundreds 
      of verbatim responses collected for each ad, deriving a score which 
      indicates positive, negative, or neutral emotional impact and represents 
      the ad&#8217;s position on an Emotional Sentiment Index ranging from 1 to 100. 
      Ace Metrix collected more than 1,800 ads in the first quarter. All ads 
      within categories that had at least 20 unique pieces of creative over 
      the past twelve months, and at least five in the quarter, were 
      considered for the award.

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co is processing a payment from Russia's embassy in Kazakhstan to insurance agency Sogaz, easing tension after Moscow accused the U.S. bank of illegally blocking the transaction under the pretext of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday the "unacceptable, illegal and absurd" act of blocking the payment would have consequences for the U.S. Embassy in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The confrontation threatened to further strain ties between Washington and Moscow, locked in the worst standoff since the Cold War over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Following consultation with our regulators, we are processing this transaction," JPMorgan said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Washington imposed sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes, against several Russians close to President Vladimir Putin and against Rossiya Bank, which it said was the "personal bank" for the leader's inner circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The destination for the embassy payment was insurance agency Sogaz, which is 48.5 percent owned by Abros, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank Rossiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry consultants in Moscow say financial institutions are unclear about how to apply the new rules in some situations, such as when dealing with subsidiaries of companies which have either been sanctioned or which have shareholders that have been punished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Western investors and their banks are facing quandaries over individual situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guidelines on the U.S. Treasury department's website from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control says that property which is more than 50 percent owned by a person on the sanctions blacklist is affected and advises acting "with caution" when ownership interests are less than 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is up to private companies and lawyers to figure out who is subject to sanctions," said one Moscow-based lawyer. "Of course (a U.S. bank) is more scared of the American (authorities than the Russian ones)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COSTLY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling foul of U.S. authorities can be extremely costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas, France's biggest listed bank, in February set aside $1.1 billion for a possible fine for breaching U.S. sanctions on countries including Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sogaz said in a statement last month that Abros had decreased its shareholding to 48.5 percent, but did not specify the shareholding level prior to the decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sogaz doesn't have any shareholders holding more than 50 percent of the company shares directly or indirectly, so we see no reason for Sogaz to be included in the U.S. sanctions," a Sogaz representative said in emailed comment late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The confusion around sanctions caused Visa and Mastercard to briefly cut off services for clients at Russia's SMP bank, whose main shareholders were affected by U.S. sanctions, before resuming them shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's accusation could damage relations the bank has with the Russian authorities. JPMorgan generated $55.6 million in investment banking fees in Russia last year, with a 7 percent market share, according to Thomson Reuters data.

&lt;p&gt;* Russia had accused JPMorgan of illegally blocking payment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Payment was destined for Sogaz, part-owned by sanctioned
Bank Rossiya&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Rules on entites part-owned by sanctioned entities can be
confusing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* JP Morgan says now processing payment

 (Adds background about JPMorgan's operations in Russia, Sogaz
comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Megan Davies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, April 3 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co is
processing a payment from Russia's embassy in Kazakhstan to
insurance agency Sogaz, easing tension after Moscow accused the
U.S. bank of illegally blocking the transaction under the
pretext of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday the "unacceptable,
illegal and absurd" act of blocking the payment would have
consequences for the U.S. Embassy in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The confrontation threatened to further strain ties between
Washington and Moscow, locked in the worst standoff since the
Cold War over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Following consultation with our regulators, we are
processing this transaction," JPMorgan said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Washington imposed sanctions, including visa
bans and asset freezes, against several Russians close to
President Vladimir Putin and against Rossiya Bank, which it said
was the "personal bank" for the leader's inner circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The destination for the embassy payment was insurance agency
Sogaz, which is 48.5 percent owned by Abros, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Bank Rossiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry consultants in Moscow say financial institutions
are unclear about how to apply the new rules in some situations,
such as when dealing with subsidiaries of companies which have
either been sanctioned or which have shareholders that have been
punished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Western investors and their banks are facing
quandaries over individual situations. [ID nL5N0MU46P]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guidelines on the U.S. Treasury department's website from
the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control says that property
which is more than 50 percent owned by a person on the sanctions
blacklist is affected and advises acting "with caution" when
ownership interests are less than 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is up to private companies and lawyers to figure out who
is subject to sanctions," said one Moscow-based lawyer. "Of
course (a U.S. bank) is more scared of the American (authorities
than the Russian ones)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COSTLY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling foul of U.S. authorities can be extremely costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas, France's biggest listed bank, in
Feburay set aside $1.1 billion for a possible fine for breaching
U.S. sanctions on countries including Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sogaz said in a statement last month that Abros had
decreased its shareholding to 48.5 percent, but did not specify
the shareholding level prior to the decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sogaz doesn't have any shareholders holding more then 50
percent of the company shares directly or indirectly, so we see
no reason for Sogaz to be included in the U.S. sanctions," a
Sogaz representative said in emailed comment late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The confusion around sanctions caused Visa and
Mastercard to briefly cut off services for clients at
Russia's SMP bank, whose main shareholders were affected by U.S.
sanctions, before resuming them shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's accusation could damage relations the bank has with
the Russian authorities. JPMorgan generated $55.6 million in
investment banking fees in Russia last year, with a 7 percent
market share, according to Thomson Reuters data. Worldwide,
JPMorgan recorded $6.4 billion in investment banking fees last
year, according to the company's annual report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets and for its
size it does relatively little lending in Russia. At year-end,
its loans and trading positions at risk to Russia totalled $5.4
billion compared with the company's total assets of $2.4
trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is one of a number of Western banks operating in
Russia. Others which have a presence here include Goldman Sachs
, Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan
Stanley.

			IntegraGen (Paris:ALINT), a leading player in the development and 
      marketing of molecular diagnostic testing in oncology and autism, 
      announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Pfizer Inc. 
      that provides Pfizer access to evaluate the company&#8217;s proprietary 
      molecular signature for hepatocellular carcinoma. The 56-gene molecular 
      signature covered by the agreement is intended to predict the clinical 
      prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and subcategorize 
      patients into six separate classifications based on the molecular 
      characteristics of their liver tumors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to have our molecular signature evaluated by one of 
      the world&#8217;s leading pharmaceutical companies,&#8221; said Dr. Bernard 
      Courtieu, IntegraGen&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;The use of our 
      molecular signature may help to identify specific patient populations 
      who would benefit from Pfizer&#8217;s experimental compounds, if approved by 
      regulatory authorities. We are also extremely appreciative of the 
      research conducted by Professor Jessica Zucman-Rossi, which led to the 
      development of this molecular signature with the continued support of 
      the French League Against Cancer Program &#8216;Cartes d&#8217;Identit&#233; des 
      Tumeurs&#174;&#8217; (CIT).&#8221;

			ABOUT THE FRENCH LEAGUE AGAINST CANCER
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The French League Against Cancer is an non-profit, non-governmental 
      organization that is an independent voluntary funder of research against 
      cancer. With nearly 700,000 members and 13,000 volunteers, the League is 
      a grassroots movement organized into a federation of 103 local 
      committees. Together, they fight in three complementary directions: 
      search for cure, prevent to protect, support for help. Today, the League 
      is making the fight against cancer a societal issue bringing together 
      the largest possible number of health actors but also economic, social 
      or political actors in all territories. Breaking taboos and fears, the 
      League contributes to change the image of cancer and those who are 
      affected. The French League Against Cancer finances and manages a 
      national program of cancer genomics, called CIT &#8220;Cartes d&#8217;Identit&#233; des 
      Tumeurs&#174;&#8221; (Tumors Identity Cards). This program (http://cit.ligue-cancer.net) 
      aims at characterizing multiple tumor types on a pangenomic scale to 
      progress toward personalized medicine.

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, April 3 (Reuters) - U.S. bank JP Morgan said
on Thursday it would process a payment from Russia's embassy in
Kazakhstan to Russian insurance agency Sogaz after blocking it
earlier this week over Ukraine-related U.S. sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Following consultation with our regulators, we are

"illegally" blocking a payment from one of its embassies to an
insurance agency "under the pretext of anti-Russian sanctions".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It suggested the action, which it called "unacceptable,
illegal and absurd," would have consequences for the U.S.
embassy and consulate in Russia.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's board lifted a key performance target that the bank must reach for Chairman and Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein to redeem a new long-term incentive stock award, according to a proxy filing on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to his $23 million compensation package for 2013, the board offered Blankfein the potential to receive restricted stock worth $6 million at the time of the award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to get the full award, Goldman must generate an average return on equity of at least 12 percent over a span of either three or five years, at the board's discretion.

      Fitch Affirms 55 Classes in JP Morgan Resecuritization Trust, Series 
      2009-12
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 55 classes in JP Morgan Resecuritization 
      Trust, Series 2009-12. A detailed list of rating actions is available at 
      'www.fitchratings.com' 
      by performing a title search for 'JP Morgan Resecuritization Trust, 
      Series 2009-12 Rating Actions for April 4, 2014', or by using the link 
      provided.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The RMBS underlying the Re-REMICs reviewed are generally collateralized 
      with Prime mortgage loans, which have generally seen an improvement in 
      delinquency reflecting the strengthening housing market. Over the past 
      year, home prices have increased over 10% nationally.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All of the classes have a rating of 'AAsf' or above and are expected to 
      pay off within two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch analyzes each bond in a number of different scenarios to determine 
      the likelihood of full principal recovery and timely interest. The 
      scenario analysis incorporates various combinations of the following 
      stressed assumptions: mortgage loss, loss timing, interest rates, 
      prepayments, servicer advancing and loan modifications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysis includes rating stress scenarios from 'CCCsf' to 'AAAsf'. 
      The 'CCCsf' scenario is intended to be the most-likely base-case 
      scenario. Rating scenarios above 'CCCsf' are increasingly more stressful 
      and are less-likely outcomes. Although many variables are adjusted in 
      the stress scenarios, the primary driver of the loss scenarios is the 
      home price forecast assumption. In the 'Bsf' scenario, Fitch assumes 
      home prices decline 10% below their long-term sustainable level. The 
      home price decline assumption is increased by 5% at each higher rating 
      category up to a 35% decline in the 'AAAsf' scenario.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Classes with a rating below 'CCCsf' are likely to default at some point 
      in the future. As default becomes more imminent, those classes are 
      expected to migrate towards 'Csf' and eventually 'Dsf'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings of bonds currently rated 'Bsf' or higher will be sensitive 
      to future mortgage borrower behavior, which historically has been 
      strongly correlated with home price movements. Despite recent positive 
      trends, Fitch currently expects home prices to decline in some areas 
      before reaching a sustainable level. While Fitch's ratings reflect this 
      home price view, the ratings of outstanding classes may be subject to 
      revision to the extent actual home price and mortgage performance trends 
      differ from those currently projected by Fitch.

			&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric Is Seeking $13.4 Billion in Damages and Pre-Paid Royalties for Infringement of Its United States Issued Patent&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Apr 4, 2014) -  SmartMetric, Inc. (OTCQB: SMME), the developer of fingerprint activated biometric cards, says that in SmartMetric's ongoing patent infringement case brought by SmartMetric against both Visa Inc. and MasterCard International the company has filed its closing brief in the case and that it is now before the United States Federal Circuit Court.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is awaiting word from the Court on scheduling of a hearing of this matter that is now expected to take place around the first week of June 2014.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric is eagerly awaiting the hearing of this case before the United States Federal Circuit Court and is highly confident of a successful outcome for the company based on the strength of its arguments presented to the Court.&#160;The company has faith in the legal system in protecting the rights of the inventor and believes that the Court will find in its favor. "Battling two giant companies has not been an easy task but that is why we have patent laws in order to protect the small inventor against the market dominance of those who would otherwise dismiss any rightful claim of inventors," said SmartMetric's President  CEO, Chaya Hendrick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To view the 8K filing of the SmartMetric closing brief please follow this link:

      Fitch Affirms JPMCM 2005-CIBC13
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 20 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp. commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, 
      series 2005-CIBC13. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end 
      of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 16.8% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 15%, including $122.2 million (4.5% of 
      the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has 
      designated 69 loans (40.4%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 18 
      specially serviced assets (17.4%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the March 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 34.2% to $1.79 billion, from $2.72 billion 
      at issuance. Per the servicer reporting, five loans (1% of the pool) are 
      defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes C through 
      NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses remains the DRA-CRT Portfolio 
      I (7.5% of the pool), which is currently real estate owned (REO). Of the 
      original 16 properties securing the loan, only two remain, both of which 
      are located in Rockville, MD. The other 14 properties were sold in the 
      fourth quarter of 2012 (4Q'12). As of February 2014, the two remaining 
      properties are 94% and 53% occupied. Per the special servicer, leasing 
      agents continue to market the properties for lease and several tours 
      have been conducted, but there are no on-going lease negotiations. 
      Recent valuations of the properties were significantly below the 
      remaining loan balance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to expected losses is the Investcorp 
      Portfolio (2.4%), which is currently REO. Of the original five 
      properties securing the loan, three have been sold; the remaining two 
      properties are located in Pennsylvania. Of the remaining properties, one 
      is well occupied at 92%, while the other property is underperforming the 
      market with an occupancy of only 37%. The special servicer remains 
      focused on leasing up and stabilizing the properties before marketing 
      the assets for sale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is the Swan Lake Mobile 
      Home Park loan (2.2%), which is secured by a mobile home community 
      consisting of 717 units located in Mira Loma, CA. The property's poor 
      performance is a result of declining occupancy and below market rents. 
      As of December 2013, the property was 93% occupied with average rents of 
      $719 per unit. Per Reis, the San Bernardino/Riverside Riverside 
      County/Corona submarket (2Q'13) exhibited average asking and effective 
      rents of $1,195 and $1,160 per unit, respectively. The average vacancy 
      rate is 2.8%. Average rents at the subject are currently $320 per unit 
      below the market average. Per the most recent site inspection, the 
      property was rated to be in fair condition with some deferred 
      maintenance items.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating Outlooks on classes A-1A and A-3A1 through A-SB, remain Stable 
      due to increasing credit enhancement and continued paydown.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes and assigns or revises Rating 
      Outlooks and REs as indicated:

      Research and Markets: Global Coal Bed Methane (CBM) Market 2014-2018 
      with Arrow Energy, BG Group, BP, Chevron, Dart Energy, ExxonMobil  
      Royal Dutch Shell Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/7dkt8m/global_coal_bed) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Coal Bed Methane (CBM) Market 2014-2018 with Arrow Energy, BG Group, BP, 
      Chevron, Dart Energy, ExxonMobil  Royal Dutch Shell Dominating" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers in this market is the shifting focus from 
      conventional gas sources due to the depletion of fossil fuels. 
      Governments across the globe are being forced to shift their focus to 
      alternative sources of gas supply including CBM, which is propelling the 
      growth of the Global CBM market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the years, there has been a tremendous increase in technological 
      advancements in the Global CBM market, which has resulted in the higher 
      extraction of CBM from major reservoirs across the world. These 
      technological advancements include the CBM production mechanism, the 
      development of techniques for accurate isothermic testing and 
      determination of gas levels, the development of well log interpretation, 
      and well simulation models. Also, huge investments are being made in RD 
      to improve the efficient recovery of CBM through horizontal drilling 
      while reducing the lead time and cost. The overall volume of production 
      as well as the cost and risk have significantly declined due to these 
      rapid technological advancements in the industry. Therefore, it is 
      expected that technological advancements will be one of the key trends 
      propelling the growth of the Global CBM market during the forecast 
      period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges confronting 
      the market is the long dewatering period for CBM. The dewatering of a 
      CBM well takes a lot of time and increases the overall cost of 
      development of CBM wells.

      in RD by the leading market vendors. Some of the leading vendors such 
      as Ramtron, Texas Instruments, and Fujitsu have increased their 
      investment in the RD of F-RAM hardware and software. These vendors have 
      identified the huge growth potential of this market, which is motivating 
      them to invest more in RD, especially for a proper set of technology 
      standards. Moreover, the increase in RD spending has also improved the 
      performance and efficiency of F-RAMs, thereby increasing the application 
      areas for these data storage media over a period of time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is the 
      low power consumption feature of F-RAMs. Due to their high power 
      efficiency, F-RAMs are used in many applications including wireless 
      devices and battery-powered wireless sensors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is the reduced time to market the products. In comparison with 
      other flash memories, F-RAM is a relatively new technology; therefore, 
      vendors are required to put in more effort for the development and 
      marketing of these products. This in turn may lead to a delay in 
      launching the products in the market.

      Research and Markets: Global Big Data Market in the Retail Sector 
      2014-2018 with IBM, HP, Oracle  Teradata Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/ljc3sb/global_big_data) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Big Data Market in the Retail Sector 2014-2018 with IBM, HP, Oracle  
      Teradata Dominating" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the last few years, social media has been a major data source for 
      retail organizations. This is because organizations can obtain instant 
      feedback about their products and services through blogs and social 
      networking sites. With the rapid increase in the number of social media 
      sites, there is high demand to track user interactions on these sites. 
      Organizations have realized the need to augment their data warehouses 
      with external data sources. Additionally, the increased importance of 
      sentiment analysis and advancements in text analytics are encouraging 
      organizations to include social media in their business process. Social 
      media increases the amount of data in enterprises; therefore, this is a 
      positive trend in the market and it is expected to drive the growth of 
      the Global Big Data market in the Retail sector in the coming years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Due to the presence of a large amount of data, organizations in the 
      Retail sector need big data solutions to automatically track the 
      performance and behavior of the information stored in their IT systems. 
      In addition, they require data analytics to develop innovative business 
      strategies and improve overall operational efficiency. Big data 
      solutions help in identifying the risks and opportunities in 
      organizations, enabling them to plan and perform accordingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is the lack 
      of skilled workforce to manage big data. The requisite technical skills 
      for handling big data vary from one project to another with respect to 
      data storage and data retrieval. As a result, there is a high 
      possibility of failure in the implementation of big data solutions. 
      Additionally, in spite of a large number of big data projects, companies 
      are not ready to invest in professionals with the required analytical 
      skills for managing big data.

			Research and Markets: Global Business Intelligence (BI) Market in 
      Retail Industry 2014-2018 with IBM, Oracle, SAP  SAS Institute 
      Dominating
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/8pm3kp/global_business) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Business Intelligence (BI) Market in Retail Industry 2014-2018 with IBM, 
      Oracle, SAP  SAS Institute Dominating" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers in the market is the increasing volume of 
      information generated in the Retail industry. BI tools comprise a series 
      of applications that enable organizations to make better decisions by 
      providing accurate, dependable, consistent, and understandable data and 
      reports in a useful format. Basically, BI means getting the right 
      information to the right people at the right time to support better 
      decision-making and gain competitive advantage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There is ongoing migration from traditional analytic tools to predictive 
      analytics (analysis, forecasting, and optimization). The global economic 
      crisis has also increased the requirement for more accurate forecasts 
      and optimized business processes. Most of the vendors have started 
      introducing applications to make statistics, predictive analytics 
      models, and forecasting algorithms in reports, dashboards, and analytic 
      applications. Predictive analytics tools allow organizations in the 
      Retail industry to identify potential opportunities and threats. For 
      example, an organization can predict which customers are more likely to 
      respond to a marketing campaign based on demographic data and on 
      purchase statistics that include data on frequency of purchase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is the high 
      cost of implementation. After purchasing the software license, 
      organizations also need to hire resources for the proper implementation 
      of the software. In addition, post implementation, BI tools need to be 
      upgraded according to current market trends, which is one of the major 
      challenges in terms of cost for SMEs.

      &#8220;ExxonMobil has been an exemplary official partner, especially when

      &#8220;After working with ExxonMobil lubricant engineers for three seasons,

      economy&#8212;whether it&#8217;s for me on the track or for consumers driving to and 
      from the track,&#8221; said Stewart. &#8220;Since Stewart-Haas Racing and Mobil 1 
      began our relationship, the entire SHR team has seen improved fuel 
      mileage, resulting in our drivers being able to go longer between pit 
      stops.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;* Chevron, 11 employees the subject of reopened case&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Oil agency approves Chevron restart of offshore wells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jeb Blount&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO, April 4 (Reuters) - Brazilian judges ordered
a criminal prosecution of Chevron Corp. and 11 employees
over an oil spill in Nov. 2011, in a process reinstated more
than a year after being thrown out following a settlement with
the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An appeals panel made the 2-to-1 decision in October, but
kept it quiet as judges reviewed Chevron's challenges to their
ruling, Brazil's public prosecutor's office, which oppposed the
dismissal, said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron confirmed the ruling late on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is likely to revive concern over the speed and
security of Brazilian legal rulings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same prosecutor's office that drew up a settlement to
help get the charges dropped is now working to re-open the
criminal part of the case. Similar, and even larger, spills by
other companies in Brazil have not led to criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The prosecutors are trying to show that the defendants'
arguments that there is no proof of an environmental crime are
wrong," the prosecutors said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say their evidence shows the defendants are
responsible for environmental pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pollution routes include the spilling of residues,
unauthorized extraction of mineral resources, irregular
operations with the potential to pollute, damage to public
assets and other crimes, prosecutors said in their statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron "continues to believe that the complaint is without
merit," the San Ramon, California-based company said in an
e-mail, adding that it intended to fight the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prosecutors are not trying to reinstate charges against
employees of Chevron's drilling contractor Transocean Ltd
, who were named in the original indictment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the beginning Chevron has said it took full
responsibility for the accident. The defendants face up to three
decades in jail if convicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case now returns to the 10th Federal Criminal Court in
Rio de Janeiro. That court threw out the case in January 2013
shortly after Chevron agreed to about $150 million in remedial
actions and signed an adjustment-of-conduct accord with
prosecutors and Brazil's environment agency over the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spill in the Frade field northeast of Rio de Janeiro
leaked an estimated 4,600 barrels of oil into the ocean, less
than 1 percent of the giant and deadly Deepwater Horizon spill
in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spill that Brazil's petroleum regulator said had caused
no discernible environmental damage, injuries or deaths was also
the subject of a controversial civil lawsuit seeking nearly $20
billion in damages. Prosecutors dropped that case in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron and its partners in Frade had to stop producing for
about a year and a half. Brazilian petroleum regulator ANP fined
Chevron for failing to follow drilling plans, but absolved it of
negligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are confident that once all the facts are fully
examined, they will demonstrate that the company responded
appropriately and responsibly to the incident and that there is
no damage to the environment or risk to human health associated
with the incident," Chevron said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ANP agreed on March 31 to let Chevron restart all its
production wells at Frade, Chevron said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, the ANP authorized Chevron to start four wells,
from which its daily production in February stood at 17,279
barrels of oil and natural gas, about a quarter of 2011 peak
output before the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron officials were not immediately available to say how
many production wells the company has at Frade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is still barred from operating water-injection wells
at Frade, which are used to boost reservoir production. The ANP
fears such wells may cause oil leaks through seabed fissures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron owns 52 percent of Frade. Brazil's state-run
Petroleo Brasileiro SA owns 30 percent and Frade
Japao, a joint venture between Japanese trading houses Inpex
Corp  and Sojitz Corp, owns 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Clarence Fernandez)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Recasts story to include Disney track record with Marvel
films)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ronald Grover  and Chris Michaud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - "Captain America:
The Winter Soldier," the sequel to Marvel's 2011 film about the
red, white and blue superhero, smashed its way to $96.2 million
in weekend ticket sales, setting a new record for an April
release and speeding past last week's winner, "Noah."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the process, it also validated the strategy of the film's
distributor, Walt Disney Co, to ramp up its pipeline of
films featuring super heroes made famous by bashing bad guys in
Marvel Comics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Captain America," which stars Chris Evans as a scrawny
World War Two reject given super powers from an experimental
serum, easily exceeded the April take for the racing movie "Fast
Five," which collected $86.2 million in ticket sales in April
2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Disney bought Marvel for $4 billion in 2009, Marvel
characters have starred in some of Hollywood's biggest hits. 
"Iron Man 3" was last year's second-highest grossing film with
domestic ticket sales of $409 million, according to the site Box
Office Mojo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, "Marvel's The Avengers" was the third-biggest film

series for Netflix that will begin streaming next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you put the name Marvel on a movie, we think that it
gives us essentially a head start with the audience," Disney
Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts during a conference call
in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Noah," starring Russell Crowe as the biblical figure, was
second with $17 million in ticket sales from Friday to Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dystopian action film "Divergent" was third with $13
million, for a total of $114 million since its March 21 release
in U.S. and Canadian theaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Captain America: The Winter Soldier" also scored the

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's experimental breast cancer drug in a clinical trial nearly doubled the amount of time patients lived without their disease getting worse, but overall survival was not yet shown to be statistically significant, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phase 2 study, which involved women with the most common form of breast cancer, found that those treated with hormone drug letrozole plus Pfizer's palbociclib lived for an average of 20.2 months before their cancer progressed, compared with 10.2 months for patients given letrozole alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted "breakthrough" status for palbociclib.

      Scheduled for Today at 1:30 PDT
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. today announced detailed results from the PALOMA-1 study, a 
      randomized Phase 2 study of palbociclib (PD-0332991) in combination with 
      letrozole. PALOMA-1 achieved its primary endpoint by significantly 
      prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) compared with letrozole alone 
      in post-menopausal women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human 
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) locally advanced or 
      metastatic breast cancer. For women treated with the combination of 
      palbociclib plus letrozole, the median PFS was 20.2 months, a 
      statistically significant improvement compared to the 10.2 months of PFS 
      in women who received letrozole alone (HR=0.488 [95% CI: 0.319, 0.748]; 
      p=0.0004). These data will be presented today by Dr. Richard S. Finn, 
      associate professor of medicine at University of California, Los Angeles 
      (UCLA) at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual 
      Meeting 2014 in San Diego (Abstract #CT101).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "These data demonstrate the potential of palbociclib to be a major 
      advance in the treatment of women with this type of advanced breast 
      cancer," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of Clinical 
      Development and Medical Affairs and chief medical officer for Pfizer 
      Oncology. "We are proud to be at the forefront of research and 
      development with respect to this promising new class of investigational 
      anticancer agents and have initiated a broad clinical development 
      program for palbociclib that includes breast and non-breast cancers."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Final results for the secondary efficacy endpoints of duration of 
      treatment and clinical benefit rate demonstrated superiority in the 
      palbociclib plus letrozole arm compared to the letrozole-only arm. Per 
      the PALOMA-1 trial protocol, an initial assessment of overall survival 
      (OS), a secondary endpoint, was also performed. Based on the events at 
      the time of the assessment, a median OS of 37.5 months was observed in 
      the combination arm versus 33.3 months for those who received letrozole 
      alone, a difference of 4.2 months (HR = 0.813, 95% CI: 0.492, 1.345). 
      This OS observation at the time of final PFS analysis was not 
      statistically significant. A follow-up OS analysis will be conducted 
      following the accrual of additional events.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The combination of palbociclib and letrozole was generally 
      well-tolerated and the safety profile of the combination was consistent 
      with previously reported data. The most common adverse events in the 
      palbociclib plus letrozole arm were neutropenia (a decrease of the 
      neutrophil count), leukopenia (a decrease in the total white blood cell 
      count), fatigue and anemia. The neutropenia observed with the 
      combination in this study was non-cumulative and clinically manageable. 
      No cases of febrile neutropenia were reported in either arm of the 
      study. Neutropenia is an on-target, anti-proliferative side effect of 
      palbociclib and signifies inhibition of CDK4 and its effect on bone 
      marrow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Palbociclib received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the United 
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2013, for the initial 
      treatment of women with advanced or metastatic ER+, HER2- breast cancer. 
      This designation was based on interim data from the PALOMA-1 trial. 
      Pfizer continues to work with the FDA and other regulatory authorities 
      to define the appropriate regulatory path forward for palbociclib.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About PALOMA-1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PALOMA-1 (also known as Study 1003 and TRIO-18) is a Phase 2 trial 
      designed to assess PFS in post-menopausal women with ER+, HER2- advanced 
      breast cancer receiving palbociclib (125 mg once daily for three out of 
      four weeks in repeated cycles) in combination with letrozole versus 
      letrozole alone (2.5 mg once daily on a continuous regimen). This trial 
      consisted of two parts. Part 1 enrolled 66 patients with ER+, HER2- 
      advanced breast cancer. Part 2 enrolled 99 additional patients whose 
      tumors were selected for presence of biomarkers: cyclin D1 amplification 
      and/or p16 loss. Final results from PALOMA-1 showed that statistically 
      significant improvement in PFS was achieved for the study arm 
      (palbociclib + letrozole) in both Parts 1 and 2. PFS is comprised of 
      time from randomization to time of disease progression or death from any 
      cause.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PALOMA-1 is conducted in collaboration with the Jonsson Cancer Center&#8217;s 
      Revlon/UCLA Women&#8217;s Cancer Research Program, led by Dr. Dennis Slamon. 
      PALOMA-1 is a multi-center trial with 101 global sites participating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Palbociclib Development Program in ER+, HER2- Breast Cancer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has worked closely with investigators and international breast 
      cancer experts to establish a robust development program for palbociclib 
      in ER+, HER2- breast cancer across stages and treatment settings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has initiated two Phase 3 studies of palbociclib in 
      advanced/metastatic breast cancer. PALOMA-2 (also known as Study 1008) 
      is a randomized (2:1), multi-center, double blind Phase 3 study that 
      evaluates palbociclib in combination with letrozole versus letrozole 
      plus placebo as a first-line treatment for post-menopausal patients with 
      ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. PALOMA-3 (also known as Study 1023) 
      is a randomized (2:1), multi-center, double blind Phase 3 study that 
      evaluates palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant 
      plus placebo in women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2- 
      metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed after prior 
      endocrine therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional, investigator-led studies of palbociclib in 
      advanced/metastatic breast cancer and in early breast cancer are open 
      and enrolling patients, including the PEARL and PENELOPE-B studies. 
      PEARL, sponsored by Grupo Espa&#241;ol de Investigaci&#243;n en C&#225;ncer de Mama 
      (GEICAM, Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group), with participation from 
      the Central European Cooperative Oncology Group (CECOG), is a randomized 
      (1:1), multi-center, open-label Phase 3 study evaluating palbociclib in 
      combination with exemestane versus capecitabine in post-menopausal women 
      with ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer whose disease was refractory to 
      previous non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (letrozole or anastrozole). 
      PENELOPE-B is a randomized (1:1), double blind, placebo-controlled Phase 
      3 study comparing palbociclib plus standard endocrine therapy to placebo 
      plus standard endocrine therapy in patients with HR+, HER2-normal (also 
      known as HER2-) early-stage breast cancer with certain features that 
      suggest an increased risk for recurrence after completing pre-operative 
      chemotherapy followed by surgery. This international study is sponsored 
      by the German Breast Group (GBG).

			About Palbociclib
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Palbociclib is an investigational oral targeted agent that selectively 
      inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 to regain cell cycle 
      control and block tumor cell proliferation.1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Loss of cell cycle control is a hallmark of cancer and CDK 4/6 are 
      overactivated in numerous cancers, leading to loss of proliferative 
      control.2,3 CDK 4/6 are key regulators of the cell cycle that 
      trigger cellular progression from growth phase (G1) into phases 
      associated with DNA replication (S).4,5 CDK 4/6, whose 
      increased activity is frequent in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) 
      breast cancer (BC), are key downstream targets of ER signaling in ER+ BC.6,7 
      Preclinical data suggest that dual inhibition of CDK 4/6 and ER 
      signaling is synergistic and has been shown to stop growth of ER+ BC 
      cell lines in the G1 phase.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Palbociclib is not approved for any indication in any markets.

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO (Reuters) - New York-based investment bank Greenhill &amp; Co Inc on Monday said it hired former Goldman Sachs Group Inc dealmaker Rafael Pereira, expanding its mergers and acquisitions unit in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pereira, who for eight years worked at Goldman, joins Greenhill's S&#227;o Paulo-based office as a vice president. Prior to Goldman, where he covered the insurance, financial services, healthcare and technology sectors, Pereira was a banker at Credit Suisse Group AG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pereira's hiring comes about two months after Greenhill brought in seasoned dealmaker Rodrigo Mello, who is currently a managing director at the shop. Pereira, who started on Monday at Greenhill, will report to Daniel Wainstein, Greenhill's country head, with whom he worked for years at Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is a great addition to our team and a highly experienced M banker," Wainstein said in a phone interview. "The fact that we are moving forward with the hiring plans as expected reflects the level of positive response we are getting from our clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wainstein, who left Goldman last year, is building a team to advise global and local clients on mergers and acquisitions in Latin America's largest economy. In 2013, companies announced $74.43 billion worth of deals in Brazil, up about 5.7 percent from $70.40 billion a year earlier, according to a Thomson Reuters report on M activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, 611 deals were announced last year, down from 823 in 2012, according to the Thomson Reuters data.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has priced
its accelerated bookbuild of shares in Sports Direct
International at 850 pence each, a source familiar with
the matter said on Monday, valuing the placement at 212.5
million pounds ($352.75 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs earlier said that it was planning to sell up
to 25 million shares to institutional investors, which the
source said would be sold at a price range of 850-870 pence
each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is sole bookrunner on the placement. The
shares were acquired from MASH Holdings Limited, owned by Sports
Direct founder Mike Ashley.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), widely tipped to form the next government, pledged on Monday to revise the country's nuclear doctrine, whose central principle is that New Delhi would not be first to use atomic weapons in a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unveiling its election manifesto, the party gave no details,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;but sources involved in drafting the document said the "no-first-use" policy introduced after India conducted a series of nuclear tests in 1998 would be reconsidered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arch-rival Pakistan, which responded within weeks that year by conducting tests of its own, does not profess "no first use".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP, which was in power at the time of India's underground blasts, appears to be on the cusp of returning to government under the leadership of Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist many expect would adopt a muscular foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP made no mention of reviewing nuclear policy in its manifesto for the previous elections in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls have consistently shown that the BJP will emerge as the biggest party in the five-week election that began on Monday. They suggest that, while the party is likely to fall short of the parliamentary majority needed to rule on its own, it would have the best chance to form a coalition government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two aides to Modi told Reuters in the run-up to the vote that if he becomes prime minister, India would get tougher in territorial disputes with China and more robust with Pakistan over attacks by Islamist militants based there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its manifesto, the party said it would seek friendly relations with neighbors, but - without naming any country - vowed to "deal with cross-border terrorism with a firm hand" and take a "strong stand and steps" when required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India adopted a no-first-use policy at a time when it was under pressure from punitive embargoes by Western nations for its nuclear tests, but since then it has been unofficially accepted as a nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States struck a deal with New Delhi in 2008 to give it access to civilian nuclear technology as well as finance even while it carried on with its weapon program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department said it had no comment "on domestic Indian political issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Richard Boucher, who was the U.S. assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia when the United States negotiated the Indian civil nuclear deal, said scrapping the no first strike policy would "not (be) a smart move" by the BJP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What does it do for India? Nothing really, although it would introduce a small, probably destabilizing, element in the calculations of nuclear adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In fact, the threats to India - terrorist groups and conventional border disputes - can't be dealt with by nuclear threats. India's nuclear strategy ain't broke, so don't fix it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashley Tellis, a senior associate of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington and a former official of the U.S. National Security Council, said it was still unclear what revision of the doctrine would entail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The new government should review the doctrine for all sorts of reasons, including the fact that much has happened regionally since it was promulgated. But I cannot convince myself that India actually comes out ahead by giving up its "no first use" policy - if that's what revision entails."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan Twining, a former State Department official and now a senior official of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said India had stood out among big powers with its no first use policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twining said former BJP Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had explained in 1998 that India first tested nuclear weapons in response to a growing threat from China, which had since grown further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So a new BJP government ... would be in keeping with party tradition - and arguably with India's national interest - to review nuclear policy by considering one that would leave all options open for India to defend itself," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The no-first-use policy was based on a premise that India would retaliate so massively against a nuclear strike that an enemy would not contemplate such a move in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a source who advises the BJP said there has been significant debate in recent years about being bound to the policy given the advances of Pakistan's nuclear capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Pakistan's nuclear inventory may have already overtaken that of its neighbor, and it has claimed progress in miniaturization of weapons for use on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do we need tactical weapons? This issue was never raised and discussed because at the time it was not a concern." said another source involved in drawing up the manifesto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"MAD" DOCTRINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murli Manohar Joshi, head of a committee that framed the BJP's nuclear policy, declined to spell out whether no-first-use could be discarded. "Read the manifesto," he told Reuters. "It has to be in sync with geostrategic conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no immediate reaction from the Pakistan government or its military, which controls foreign and defense policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former Pakistani national security adviser, retired Major-General Mahmud Ali Durrani, said he would not be concerned if India revised the central tenet of its nuclear doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think it will be of great consequence," he said. "The nuclear doctrine here is MAD (mutually assured destruction). If one side does it, the other side has enough to cause unacceptable damage in response."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Durrani said there was more concern in Pakistan about the "overall attitude" of Modi, who was chief minister of the western Indian state of Gujarat in 2002 when more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were slaughtered in mob violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi has always vehemently denied that he allowed, or even encouraged, the bloodshed, driven by a Hindu nationalist agenda, and a Supreme Court inquiry found no evidence to prosecute him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP manifesto set out its Hindu nationalist leanings, with a vow to explore building a temple at the site of a mosque in northern India that was torn down by zealots 22 years ago, potentially putting a deeply controversial issue back into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a religious right in the BJP so they want to acknowledge that without making it the centerpiece of the manifesto," said Ashok Malik, a political columnist. "I don't think the BJP is going to take it forward as a political movement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The party also made a commitment to withdrawing a special autonomous status accorded to Jammu and Kashmir state, India's only Muslim-majority region, which many believe prolongs ambiguity over the status of a territory claimed by Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that it would aim for the return of Hindus who left Kashmir when the region was roiled by an Islamist insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Frank Jack Daniel in NEW DELHI, Katharine Houreld in ISLAMABAD and David Brunnstrom in WASHINGTON; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pioneering American TV journalist Barbara Walters, who was the first woman to co-anchor an evening news program, will make her final television appearance on the morning talk show "The View" next month, the network ABC said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walters' last day as a co-host on the all-women talk show she created in 1997 will be on May 16. The network, a unit of Walt Disney Co., will also air a two-hour evening special focusing on her career and her life on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this business there are legends, there are icons, and then there is Barbara Walters," Bob Iger, chairman and chief executive of The Walt Disney Company, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She broke barriers, defied convention, made history and set the standard for journalistic excellence for more than 50 years. It's hard to imagine television without her," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In honor of her many years on television, the ABC News headquarters in New York will be named for her in a dedication ceremony this spring and "The View" will host a week-long celebration of her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Her influence on television, and American culture, will resonate for decades to come," Anne Sweeney, the president of Disney/ABC Television Group, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters, 84, announced her plans to retire from television nearly a year ago in a tearful appearance on "The View," saying she was healthy and it was her decision to step down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is what I want to do," she said. "I've had an amazing career."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters has suffered from health problems recently, including a concussion after she fainted and hit her head last year and a bout of chickenpox. In 2010, she had open heart surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since announcing her retirement, she hosted "20 Years of the 10 Most Fascinating People," the final show of her yearly special program about intriguing personalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her long career, Walters was known for her interviews on U.S. television with world leaders including Cuba's Fidel Castro, Britain's Margaret Thatcher, Saddam Hussein of Iraq and every U.S. president since Richard Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also interviewed celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor, Angelina Jolie and Tom Cruise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters began her career in television journalism in 1961 as a writer for NBC's "Today" morning news show and later became the first woman to co-host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She broke more ground in 1976 when she joined ABC and became the first woman to co-anchor an evening news broadcast on any U.S. network.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 7 (Reuters) - Daniel Pinto, who two weeks
ago became sole head of corporate and investment banking at
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, on Monday announced a new lineup
for his executive team which raises the profiles of several
individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlos Hernandez, 52, who formerly headed services for
institutional investors, will become co-head of global banking
alongside Jeff Urwin, Pinto said in a memo to employees. The two
will manage corporate banking, treasury services and investment
banking worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Bosland, who had been a marketing chief and former
public finance head, will become head of treasury services and
will report to Hernandez and Urwin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Horner will succeed Hernandez as head of investor
services. Horner has been over the financing business within the
markets and investor Services unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves follow a March 25 announcement that Mike Cavanagh,
who was co-CEO with Pinto of corporate and investment banking,
was leaving the company to join private equity firm Carlyle
Group LP. Also, late last year Don McCree, who
headed treasury services and corporate banking, decided to leave
JPMorgan after 30 years at the bank. McCree, 52, will shift his
duties to Hernandez and Urwin over the next few months, the memo
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinto also said that Joyce Chang will become global head of
research, succeeding Tom Schmidt, who decided earlier this year
that he wanted a new job. Chang previously led both global fixed
income and merging markets research teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Pinto realigned fixed-income executives in
the markets business. James Kenny and Troy Rohrbaugh will be
co-heads of global rates, commodities and emerging markets. That
move follows the announcement last week that commodities chief 
Blythe Masters would leave the company following its sale of its
physical commodities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guy America and Matt Cherwin will be co-heads of global
credit, which includes emerging markets credit, securitized
products and public finance, the memo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo was reported earlier on Monday by the New York
Times.

 (Updates to midday)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Monday,
putting the S 500 on track for its biggest three-day drop in
two months, as investors rotated into defensive names to protect
against further declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Momentum shares - stocks in fast-growing industries which
had seen their stock prices rocket higher in recent weeks -
managed to stabilize after their decline helped fuel a sell-off
on Friday. But selling pressure migrated to other sectors, with
only defensives such as utilities and consumer staples
 in positive territory among the 10 major S sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are definitely seeing a little more downside, a
continuation from the nasty reversal on Friday," said Ryan
Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment
Research in Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big concern is the overall underlying weakness in so
many different stocks. The picture isn't nearly as pretty when
you look under the hood and you see various sectors have clearly
broken down and now it's starting to pull down on the whole
entire stock market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc, which was down 3 percent to $31.17,
added pressure to the Dow and S 500. The company's
experimental breast cancer drug in a clinical trial nearly
doubled the amount of time patients lived without their disease
getting worse, but overall survival was not yet shown to be
statistically significant, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average was down 126.35
points, or 0.77 percent, at 16,286.36. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index was down 14.26 points, or 0.76 percent, at
1,850.83. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 39.89
points, or 0.97 percent, at 4,087.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings season gets under way this week, with results due
from financials JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Wells Fargo &amp; Co
, as well as retailer Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S 500 companies' first-quarter earnings are projected to
have increased just 1.2 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters
data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the
year, when growth was estimated at 6.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lackluster first-quarter earnings season hurt by a harsh
winter could spark a pullback, some analysts said, with
investors more optimistic for the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialty pharmaceuticals company Mallinckrodt Plc 
agreed to buy drugmaker Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc 
for about $5.6 billion to gain access to its multiple sclerosis
drug, Acthar Gel. Questcor shares climbed 13.5 percent to $77.05
while Mallinckrodt dropped 9.4 percent to $56.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energen Corp said it would sell its natural gas
utility Alabama Gas Corp (Alagasco) to Laclede Group Inc 
for $1.28 billion in cash to focus on oil and gas exploration
and production. Energen shed 0.5 percent to $81.13 and Laclede
lost 1.2 percent to $45.66.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MannKind Corp slumped 10 percent to $6.18. The
company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration extended the
review date of its inhaled insulin treatment by three months.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/96chjf/data_center) 
      has announced the addition of the "Brazil 
      Data Center Market 2014-2018 with Avaya, Cisco, Dell, EMC, HP, IBM, NEC, 
      Rittal  Schneider Electric Dominating" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Data Center market in Brazil to grow at a CAGR of 14% to 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers is the increasing government support being 
      provided for IT initiatives in the country. There has been a 
      considerable amount of initiatives that have been taken to increase IT 
      investments and infrastructure development in the country. The number of 
      end-users of internet services is also increasing at a rapid rate, 
      creating a demand for data center services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cloud computing and cloud-based services are witnessing an increasing 
      adoption among enterprises across the globe. To cater to the computing 
      and storage requirements of enterprises, the cloud computing service 
      providers are establishing data center facilities equipped with 
      high-performance computing equipment. Brazil is emerging as a preferred 
      destination for the enterprises across the globe to outsource their IT 
      services and data center facilities. Many large enterprises are 
      establishing their own data center facilities in Brazil, driving the 
      Data Center market in Brazil. With the increasing demand of end-users on 
      the type of services being procured, there is an increasing complexity 
      of the data center facility, which is further leading to increasing 
      demand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is the need 
      for data center management expertise. Enterprises are finding it 
      difficult to hire an expertise which can efficiently monitor and manage 
      the performance of their network. With the increasing complexity of the 
      enterprise business, there is a considerable increase in the complexity 
      of the network.

			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/ppm2nq/it_market_in_new) 
      has announced the addition of the "New 
      Zealand IT Market 2014-2018 with Datacom Ltd., Gen-i Ltd., Hewlett 
      Packard Co., and IBM Corp Dominating" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the high potential of the IT market in New Zealand, angel and 
      venture investors are showing high interest and are investing heavily in 
      this market. In 2012, 42 percent of all their investment deals were made 
      for the IT Software and IT Service sectors. Also, 28 percent of their 
      total investment was in the overall IT sector. This high investment can 
      also be attributed to the consistently good performance of the companies 
      in the IT sector, which are generating high profit margins and high 
      return on equity. ICE Angel Investments, New Zealand Venture Investment 
      Fund, and Angel Links are some of the prominent investors in New 
      Zealand. Some of the prominent investments made by ICE Angels were in 
      LiveLinkConnect Ltd., Mi5 Security Ltd., and Nextspace Ltd. In addition, 
      in 2013, Valar Ventures and Matrix Partners invested US$150 million in 
      Xero Ltd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the growth of the IT market in New Zealand is 
      driven by several factors, one of which is the increasing need to 
      improve efficiency of business processes. In order to increase 
      operational efficiency and service levels, companies are increasingly 
      adopting IT solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in the 
      market is the shortage of skilled workforce. Despite the IT industry 
      offering high wage rates when compared to other sectors, the number of 
      IT students graduating from universities is not matching the requirement 
      of the IT market in New Zealand.

 (Updates to open, adds quote)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little
changed on Monday, as recent weakness in so-called momentum
names appeared to abate while a decline in shares of Pfizer
 weighed on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declines in momentum shares - fast-growing companies which
have outperformed the market recently - have left investors
anxious about how much further they may fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That weakness continued early on Monday, with names such as
TripAdvisor Inc down 1.6 percent to $84.30. However,
other names such as Facebook Inc, up 1 percent to $57.33
and Gilead Sciences Inc, up 0.8 percent at $72.76, were
able to reverse initial declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a difference between that sense you get when it is
picking up speed and becoming a one-way juggernaut either way,
to the downside or the upside, and we are not seeing that," said
Gordon Charlop, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in
New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll stick it out and see where they finally decide to
step in but there is nobody here who is sensing there isn't
going to be a point where that happens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings season gets under way this week, with results from
financials JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Wells Fargo &amp; Co
, as well as retailer Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc, down 2.5 percent to $31.37, also added
pressure to the Dow and S 500. The company's experimental
breast cancer drug in a clinical trial nearly doubled the amount
of time patients lived without their disease getting worse, but
overall survival was not yet shown to be statistically
significant, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S 500 companies' first-quarter earnings are projected to
have increased just 1.2 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters
data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the
year, when growth was estimated at 6.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lackluster first-quarter earnings season impacted by harsh
winter weather could spark a pullback, according to some
analysts, with investors looking for optimism for the second
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average was down 27.36
points, or 0.17 percent, at 16,385.35. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index was down 1.53 points, or 0.08 percent, at 1,863.56.
The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 3.72 points, or 0.09
percent, at 4,131.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialty pharmaceuticals company Mallinckrodt Plc 
agreed to buy drugmaker Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc 
for about $5.6 billion to gain access to its multiple sclerosis
drug, Acthar Gel. Questcor shares surged 20.9 percent to $82.04
while Mallinckrodt shed 1.2 percent to $61.77.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energen Corp said it would sell its natural gas
utility Alabama Gas Corp (Alagasco) to Laclede Group Inc 
for $1.28 billion in cash to focus on oil and gas exploration
and production. Energen gained 1.9 percent to $83.08 and Laclede
lost 2.3 percent to $45.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MannKind Corp slumped 8.9 percent to $6.26. The
company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration extended the
review date of its inhaled insulin treatment by three months.

      Research and Markets: Cloud Computing Market in South Korea 2014-2018 
      with Amazon, KT Corp, Microsoft  SK Telecom Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/zx6s6s/cloud_computing) 
      has announced the addition of the "Cloud 
      Computing Market in Korea 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The South Korea Cloud Computing market to grow at a CAGR of 22% to 2018
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There is a huge demand for private cloud computing among government 
      agencies and large enterprises in Korea. Government agencies in Korea 
      are concerned about data security and are therefore looking to adopt 
      more of private cloud rather than public. Private cloud infrastructure 
      is dedicated to a single organization and assures a high level of 
      security as it cannot be accessed by other companies in the same data 
      center. Large enterprises in Korea are adopting a private cloud to have 
      a greater control of their data. In case of the public cloud, 
      third-party providers are in charge of the data systems. However, in a 
      private cloud, organizations can themselves maintain and monitor the 
      data systems, which allow them a complete oversight of their data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, although there are many factors driving the 
      growth of the Cloud Computing market in Korea, one of the main drivers 
      is the increase in government initiatives to create cloud computing 
      infrastructure in the country. This is mainly to improve performance and 
      reduce the cost of IT of Korean businesses. The government plans to 
      continue investing over the next few years and aims to contribute 10 
      percent of the Global Cloud Computing market by 2014. The government is 
      not only making the environment favorable for multinational cloud 
      vendors but is also trying to attract local players into the market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the most common barriers to the 
      growth of the market is the increasing concerns regarding data security. 
      Organizations are anxious about the security of data when storing 
      information on cloud networks or on any other technology platform. There 
      are various forms of storing crucial information but there is always a 
      risk of loss of data. Failure to retrieve the data will lead to a 
      considerable loss.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/w599nn/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Application Server Market 2014-2018 with Adobe Systems, IBM, Microsoft  
      RedHat Dominating" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Application Server market to grow at a CAGR of 21% to 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers in the market is the increased adoption of the 
      internet of things among enterprises and end-users. The increased 
      adoption of smartphones, tablets, and other handheld devices is leading 
      to the integration of applications and cross connectivity. Applications 
      are developed to integrate the data and applications being used over the 
      handheld devices into a central repository. There are many applications 
      that aim at implementing a centralized access system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Smartphones, tablets, and other handheld devices are witnessing 
      increased adoption by the enterprises and end-users. Many enterprises 
      are adopting the BYOD policy as a part of their business, which is 
      increasing the number of applications being developed to meet the 
      specific computing requirements of the enterprises and end-users. All 
      the applications deployed on the end-user devices are programmed using 
      programming models which require supporting files for execution that are 
      loaded on the application server. Application servers manage resource 
      allocation, execution, resource sharing, storage allocation, storage 
      space management, and virtualization of the platform, which provide 
      execution support to the applications on the devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is the 
      increasing demand for customized applications from end-users. As a 
      result of the increased digital content and the increased complexity of 
      enterprise business, enterprises need customized applications and 
      services.

			JPMorgan Chase Joins UK Government&#8217;s DFID and CDC to Announce $20 
      Million Combined Investment in Novastar Ventures
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Capital Commitment to support Early-Stage Businesses in East African 
      Communities
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase and the UK Department for International Development will 
      kick start promising businesses in East Africa through a new joint 
      investment in Novastar Ventures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new $5 million investment by JPMorgan Chase will be matched by an 
      additional $15 million from DFID as part of its first ever Impact 
      Investment Fund. Launched in 2013, the fund is managed by the CDC, the 
      UK&#8217;s own Development Finance Institution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The investment will develop and grow early-stage businesses that bring 
      the most basic human needs to some of the poorest communities in East 
      Africa, such as healthcare, energy, housing, education and sanitation. 
      The announcement follows Novastar&#8217;s recent investment in Bridge 
      International Academies, which provides affordable, primary education to 
      low-income populations. Since 2009, Bridge has built more than 250 
      schools in Kenya and has hired over 3,000 employees from some of Kenya's 
      poorest communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are delighted to have Novastar join our latest investment round,&#8221; 
      said Jay Kimmelman, Cofounder and CEO of Bridge International Academies. 
      &#8220;Novastar's founding partners have supported Bridge since our very early 
      days. Their values are closely tied with ours &#8211; seeking innovative 
      business-based solutions to sustainably solve some of the world&#8217;s 
      greatest problems. Their investment and their experience will be 
      invaluable as we enter our next phase of expansion.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Novastar&#8217;s investment portfolio is diverse and includes rapidly growing 
      businesses supplying fuel-efficient cookstoves in Kenya and Ethiopia, 
      and franchise sanitation facilities in Nairobi&#8217;s urban slums. Novastar 
      seeks to develop fully commercial businesses that adapt and deploy 
      innovative business models to profitably serve proven demand for basic 
      goods and services, improving access, affordability and quality. 
      Novastar&#8217;s investments are expected to benefit more than 2 million 
      low-income households in East Africa over the next decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re looking for the next generation of exceptional entrepreneurs who 
      are designing and executing innovative business models to profitably 
      serve low-income consumer markets in East Africa,&#8221; said Steve Beck, 
      Managing Director of Novastar. &#8220;By supporting these entrepreneurs and 
      the growth of their ventures, we aim to generate long-term capital 
      appreciation for our investors and significant, scalable benefits to 
      these consumers and producers. In so doing, we hope to attract more 
      entrepreneurship and private capital into the emerging economies of East 
      Africa.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The investment follows DFID&#8217;s appointment of Novastar as the first 
      beneficiary of its Impact Investment Fund in January 2014. The UK&#8217;s &#163;75 
      million Impact Fund is expected to benefit five million people over the 
      next thirteen years, by providing capital to fund innovative enterprises 
      that serve the poor as employees, producers and consumers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our joint investment will ensure promising businesses get the support 
      they need to create jobs and deliver much needed services like health 
      and education,&#8221; said Justine Greening, Secretary of State for 
      International Development. &#8220;Sharing our joint knowledge and expertise on 
      development and sound investment choices will improve the lives of many 
      of the poorest people across East Africa.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Impact investments have the potential to transform the lives of 
      millions of the poorest people in Africa and South Asia,&#8221; said Diana 
      Noble, CDC&#8217;s Chief Executive. &#8220;Novastar will now be able to provide 
      early-stage funding to businesses in East Africa that provide vital 
      jobs, goods and services. When CDC commits its capital to impact 
      investment, we&#8217;re looking for teams, like Novastar, who are able to 
      raise money from other commercial investors.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are very proud to partner with the UK Government in providing 
      investment to Novastar and the critically important businesses they 
      support in East Africa,&#8221; said Peter L. Scher, Executive Vice President 
      and head of Corporate Responsibility at JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;Our firm has 
      made a substantial commitment to supporting market-driven solutions to 
      some of the world&#8217;s most pressing social, economic and environmental 
      challenges.&#160;Novastar&#8217;s management team has an accomplished record of 
      financing start-ups that seek to improve the basic quality of life for 
      people in East African communities. We&#8217;re thrilled that our investment 
      can help expand their efforts.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The investment in Novastar is further demonstration of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 
      dedication to building and delivering innovative solutions to address 
      social and environmental challenges in partnership with governmental and 
      philanthropic organizations. Late last year JPMorgan Chase and the Bill 
       Melinda Gates Foundation announced a new $108 million investment fund 
      to advance late-stage global health technologies, like vaccines, in 
      low-income countries. Since its launch in 2007, JPMorgan Chase has 
      committed more than $50 million in capital to a number of funds making 
      investments in Africa and other parts of the world including the African 
      Agricultural Capital Fund, LeapFrog Financial Inclusion Funds I and II, 
      and MicroVest II.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 7 (IFR) - JP Morgan and Bank of
America Merrill Lynch are to join Morgan Stanley 
on the syndicate for Emaar Properties' upcoming IPO of
its retail and malls business, bankers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Dubai's biggest property firm hired Morgan
Stanley to manage an 8-9 billion dirham (US$2.18-2.45 billion)
listing of its shopping mall and retail unit, a deal that
promises to be the largest ECM transaction in the region since
2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emaar has now appointed JP Morgan to the topline along with
Morgan Stanley, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch will be one
step below as joint bookrunner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The listing, which was first contemplated before Dubai's
real estate and stock market collapsed in 2009, underscores the
extent of the emirate's recovery over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residential property prices increased by more than 20
percent last year and Dubai's main equity index - the
best performing bourse in the world in 2013 - is up 18.8 percent
so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emaar is 31 percent-owned by the Dubai government, which is
set to earn a dividend of about US$750 million from the listing.

      Scheduled for Today at 1:30 PDT
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. today announced detailed results from the PALOMA-1 study, a 
      randomized Phase 2 study of palbociclib (PD-0332991) in combination with 
      letrozole. PALOMA-1 achieved its primary endpoint by significantly 
      prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) compared with letrozole alone 
      in post-menopausal women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human 
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) locally advanced or 
      metastatic breast cancer. For women treated with the combination of 
      palbociclib plus letrozole, the median PFS was 20.2 months, a 
      statistically significant improvement compared to the 10.2 months of PFS 
      in women who received letrozole alone (HR=0.488 [95% CI: 0.319, 0.748]; 
      p=0.0004). These data will be presented today by Dr. Richard S. Finn, 
      associate professor of medicine at University of California, Los Angeles 
      (UCLA) at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual 
      Meeting 2014 in San Diego (Abstract #CT101).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "These data demonstrate the potential of palbociclib to be a major 
      advance in the treatment of women with this type of advanced breast 
      cancer," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of Clinical 
      Development and Medical Affairs and chief medical officer for Pfizer 
      Oncology. "We are proud to be at the forefront of research and 
      development with respect to this promising new class of investigational 
      anticancer agents and have initiated a broad clinical development 
      program for palbociclib that includes breast and non-breast cancers."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Final results for the secondary efficacy endpoints of duration of 
      treatment and clinical benefit rate demonstrated superiority in the 
      palbociclib plus letrozole arm compared to the letrozole-only arm. Per 
      the PALOMA-1 trial protocol, an initial assessment of overall survival 
      (OS), a secondary endpoint, was also performed. Based on the events at 
      the time of the assessment, a median OS of 37.5 months was observed in 
      the combination arm versus 33.3 months for those who received letrozole 
      alone, a difference of 4.2 months (HR = 0.813, 95% CI: 0.492, 1.345). 
      This OS observation at the time of final PFS analysis was not 
      statistically significant. A follow-up OS analysis will be conducted 
      following the accrual of additional events.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The combination of palbociclib and letrozole was generally 
      well-tolerated and the safety profile of the combination was consistent 
      with previously reported data. The most common adverse events in the 
      palbociclib plus letrozole arm were neutropenia (a decrease of the 
      neutrophil count), leukopenia (a decrease in the total white blood cell 
      count), fatigue and anemia. The neutropenia observed with the 
      combination in this study was non-cumulative and clinically manageable. 
      No cases of febrile neutropenia were reported in either arm of the 
      study. Neutropenia is an on-target, anti-proliferative side effect of 
      palbociclib and signifies inhibition of CDK4 and its effect on bone 
      marrow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Palbociclib received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the United 
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2013, for the initial 
      treatment of women with advanced or metastatic ER+, HER2- breast cancer. 
      This designation was based on interim data from the PALOMA-1 trial. 
      Pfizer continues to work with the FDA and other regulatory authorities 
      to define the appropriate regulatory path forward for palbociclib.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About PALOMA-1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PALOMA-1 (also known as Study 1003 and TRIO-18) is a Phase 2 trial 
      designed to assess PFS in post-menopausal women with ER+, HER2- advanced 
      breast cancer receiving palbociclib (125 mg once daily for three out of 
      four weeks in repeated cycles) in combination with letrozole versus 
      letrozole alone (2.5 mg once daily on a continuous regimen). This trial 
      consisted of two parts. Part 1 enrolled 66 patients with ER+, HER2- 
      advanced breast cancer. Part 2 enrolled 99 additional patients whose 
      tumors were selected for presence of biomarkers: cyclin D1 amplification 
      and/or p16 loss. Final results from PALOMA-1 showed that statistically 
      significant improvement in PFS was achieved for the study arm 
      (palbociclib + letrozole) in both Parts 1 and 2. PFS is comprised of 
      time from randomization to time of disease progression or death from any 
      cause.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PALOMA-1 is conducted in collaboration with the Jonsson Cancer Center&#8217;s 
      Revlon/UCLA Women&#8217;s Cancer Research Program, led by Dr. Dennis Slamon. 
      PALOMA-1 is a multi-center trial with 101 global sites participating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Palbociclib Development Program in ER+, HER2- Breast Cancer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has worked closely with investigators and international breast 
      cancer experts to establish a robust development program for palbociclib 
      in ER+, HER2- breast cancer across stages and treatment settings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has initiated two Phase 3 studies of palbociclib in 
      advanced/metastatic breast cancer. PALOMA-2 (also known as Study 1008) 
      is a randomized (2:1), multi-center, double blind Phase 3 study that 
      evaluates palbociclib in combination with letrozole versus letrozole 
      plus placebo as a first-line treatment for post-menopausal patients with 
      ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. PALOMA-3 (also known as Study 1023) 
      is a randomized (2:1), multi-center, double blind Phase 3 study that 
      evaluates palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant 
      plus placebo in women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2- 
      metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed after prior 
      endocrine therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional, investigator-led studies of palbociclib in 
      advanced/metastatic breast cancer and in early breast cancer are open 
      and enrolling patients, including the PEARL and PENELOPE-B studies. 
      PEARL, sponsored by Grupo Espa&#241;ol de Investigaci&#243;n en C&#225;ncer de Mama 
      (GEICAM, Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group), with participation from 
      the Central European Cooperative Oncology Group (CECOG), is a randomized 
      (1:1), multi-center, open-label Phase 3 study evaluating palbociclib in 
      combination with exemestane versus capecitabine in post-menopausal women 
      with ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer whose disease was refractory to 
      previous non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (letrozole or anastrozole). 
      PENELOPE-B is a randomized (1:1), double blind, placebo-controlled Phase 
      3 study comparing palbociclib plus standard endocrine therapy to placebo 
      plus standard endocrine therapy in patients with HR+, HER2-normal (also 
      known as HER2-) early-stage breast cancer with certain features that 
      suggest an increased risk for recurrence after completing pre-operative 
      chemotherapy followed by surgery. This international study is sponsored 
      by the German Breast Group (GBG).

			About Palbociclib
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Palbociclib is an investigational oral targeted agent that selectively 
      inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 to regain cell cycle 
      control and block tumor cell proliferation.1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Loss of cell cycle control is a hallmark of cancer and CDK 4/6 are 
      overactivated in numerous cancers, leading to loss of proliferative 
      control.2,3 CDK 4/6 are key regulators of the cell cycle that 
      trigger cellular progression from growth phase (G1) into phases 
      associated with DNA replication (S).4,5 CDK 4/6, whose

&lt;p&gt;* Former banker joined Kinnevik's board last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Chairwoman says Grabau will help support digital growth

 (Adds quotes, details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Mia Shanley and Simon Johnson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STOCKHOLM, April 7 (Reuters) - Swedish investment firm
Kinnevik said on Monday it had picked board member
and former Goldman Sachs banker Lorenzo Grabau as chief
executive, as the company deepens its push into technology and
e-commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1936, Kinnevik is one of the largest listed
investment companies in Europe, having transformed itself from
an industrial concern into a telecoms and media group and in
recent years expanded into online services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lorenzo is the perfect choice to take on the CEO role ...
as we strengthen our position as a best-in-class, value-added
investor that can drive industry consolidation in mature
businesses and support new founder-led digital growth
companies," Chairwoman Cristina Stenbeck said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grabau became a board member of MTG, a media group
controlled by Kinnevik, in 2011. He joined Kinnevik's board in
2013 and is also on the boards of other Kinnevik companies
including emerging markets telecom firm Millicom and
Europe's biggest online fashion firm, Zalando.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kinnevik has been looking for a new CEO since Mia Brunell
Livfors announced in January she was stepping down to seek a new
challenge after nearly a decade as head of the company, which
has a stock market value of 73.9 billion Swedish crowns ($11.4
billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She stays on as a director of four companies in which the
group invests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kinnevik has a 37 percent stake in Zalando. It also has
major stakes in telecoms groups Tele2 and Rocket
Internet in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kinnevik today has three strong pillars: the established
listed core holdings, the investment in Rocket Internet and a
number of direct investments in promising online businesses,"
said Stenbeck, a member of the controlling family of that name.

to trade in line with current market

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp released its final security updates for Windows XP and Office 2003 on Tuesday as security experts warned users that they could soon be prime targets for cyber attacks if they do not abandon the products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security experts advise consumers and businesses to either replace computers running Windows XP or upgrade to modern versions of Microsoft's software within the next month because they will no longer be protected from newly discovered threats after the middle of May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft automatically rolls out new security updates on the second Tuesday of each month, which is known as "Patch Tuesday," a day when they also publish technical details on the security bugs they are fixing. The next Patch Tuesday is May 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security experts say they believe hackers will study that data and "reverse engineer" the May Patch Tuesday software updates to identify ways to attack computers running Windows XP, along with Office 2003, which will no longer receive patches from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Attackers will use this as an accelerator. It's an easier way to get at machines," said Wolfgang Kandek, chief technology officer with cybersecurity firm Qualys Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft wants users to move to more modern versions of the operating system partly because it has incorporated new security features into the software over the past decade that make it far more effective in thwarting cyber attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker first warned that it was planning to end support for Windows XP in 2007, but security firms estimate that 15 to 25 percent of the world's PCs still run on the version of the operating system that was released in October 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about a third of the world's 2.2 million ATMs which use the system have been upgraded to newer operating systems, according to NCR, one of the biggest ATM makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Tom Brown)&lt;/p&gt;

			Allied Nevada Gold Corp.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman Scarlato Karon  Penny, P.C. (the &#8220;Firm&#8221;) has begun an 
      investigation into Allied Nevada Gold Corp. (NYSE MKT: ANV) to determine 
      whether Allied Nevada violated federal securities laws by 
      misrepresenting the state of its operations and improperly concealing 
      that certain equipment crucial to the its mining efforts suffered from 
      serious, ongoing defects and deficiencies between January 18, 2013 and 
      August 5, 2013, inclusive.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On April 30, 2013, Allied Nevada announced disappointing results for the 
      first quarter of 2013, attributing the miss to inclement weather and 
      rising input costs. It also revealed that previously announced plans to 
      expand operations at its sole operating property, the Hycroft Mine in 
      Nevada, would be revised to take effect in phases. In addition, it 
      announced that it would sell 14 million shares of common stock to 
      investors through a secondary public offering to fund capital 
      expenditures at the Hycroft Mine and for other corporate purposes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Then, on August 6, 2013, Allied Nevada announced that it would defer 
      construction at the Hycroft Mine expansion project due to operating 
      defects in the infrastructure, which would require costly remedies. 
      Allied Nevada attributed the decision to halt the project to the 
      discovery in May and June 2013 of poor operational decisions made in 
      late 2012 and early 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Allied Nevada&#8217;s stock price fell sharply in connection with each of 
      these revelations, causing shareholders to incur significant losses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades Four Classes of JPMorgan 2006-FL2; Revises Outlooks
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded four classes of J.P. Morgan Chase 
      Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2006-FL2 and revised the 
      Rating Outlooks on seven classes to Negative from Stable. A detailed 
      list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key Rating Drivers
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades are primarily due to the lack of progress made on 
      refinancing the remaining two loans in the pool. Since Fitch's last 
      rating action, the loans transferred back to the special servicer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Marina Village loan (55% of pool) was unable to pay off on its 
      maturity date of Nov. 9, 2013; however, the borrower continues to remit 
      payments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Marina Village loan is collateralized by 31 office buildings 
      totaling 1.16 million square feet (sf) on 73 acres, located in a 
      205-acre master-planned development in Alameda, CA, within the San 
      Francisco Bay Area. The property consists of low-rise and mid-rise 
      office buildings (collateral), a shopping center, a hotel, 178-unit 
      residential town-home community, and open space along the waterfront 
      (with a 990-berth marina). The loan was modified in June 2011 with a 
      final maturity date of November 2013. The loan was transferred back to 
      special servicing in October 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of December 2013, the portfolio occupancy was 63%, compared to 61% at 
      YE2012, and 79.6% at issuance. The average rental rate at the property 
      was approximately $19.71 per square foot (psf), compared to $24.22 psf 
      at issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 1111 Marcus Avenue loan (45% of pool), which has been operating 
      under a forbearance agreement, has a term expiration on April 9, 2014. 
      There has been no indication that the borrower intends to pay off the 
      loan prior to its maturity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 1111 Marcus Avenue loan is secured by a condominium interest in an 
      office complex (the complex consists of two separate condo interests) 
      consisting of five office buildings in New Hyde Park, NY. The collateral 
      consists of 920,059 sf (Condo Unit 1). The original loan maturity date 
      was 10/9/09 with two one-year extensions. In November 2011, borrower 
      signed a forbearance agreement which expired in October 2013. The loan 
      was transferred back to special servicing in September 2013 due to 
      imminent default. The forbearance was subsequently extended to April 9, 
      2014
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of YE2013, the property was 73% occupied, compared to 64.6% at 
      YE2012, and 79% at issuance. The increase in occupancy was due to the 
      new leases that were signed in 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating Sensitivity
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch analyzed each loan individually and ran multiple scenarios that 
      assumed one loan would pay off and one loan would be the sole remaining 
      loan in the pool. The outcomes of these scenarios and the impact to the 
      trust were then considered in Fitch's rating recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Marina Village loan is serviced by TriMont Real Estate Advisors; the 
      1111 Marcus Avenue loan is serviced by CT Investment Management Co. Both 
      special servicers are working to determine the workout strategies. The 
      possibility of a full recovery on the Marina Village loan is relatively 
      high. However, if the Marina Village loan does not pay off, future 
      downgrades on the outstanding bonds are possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has downgraded the following ratings and revised Outlooks as 
      indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11.2 million class E to 'BBB-sf' from 'Asf'; Outlook to Negative from 
      Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      --$12.5 million class H to 'CCCsf' from 'Bsf; RE 45%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings and revised Outlooks as 
      indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$54.9 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook to Negative from Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$10 million class D at 'AA-sf'; Outlook to Negative from Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      --$13 million class K at 'CCCsf', RE 0%';

			Goldman Scarlato Karon  Penny, P.C. Announces Investigation of 
      Genworth
			Financial
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman Scarlato Karon  Penny, P.C. is investigating potential claims 
      on behalf of investors who purchased Genworth Financial (&#8220;Genworth&#8221; or 
      the "Company") (NYSE: GNW) stock between February 3, 2012 and April 17, 
      2012 inclusive (the &#8220;Class Period&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The investigation concerns whether Genworth and certain of its officers 
      and/or directors violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities 
      Exchange Act of 1934, in connection with statements regarding the 
      Company&#8217;s ability to follow through with an initial public offering 
      (IPO) of its Australian business unit in the second quarter of 2012, and 
      related statements regarding the supposed stability and prospects of the 
      Company&#8217;s Australian mortgage insurance business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On April 17, 2012, Genworth announced that it would delay the IPO. 
      Earlier today, almost two years after stating that the Company had 
      postponed its IPO, the Company announced new plans to follow through 
      with it. Upon news of the 2012 postponement of the IPO, Genworth&#8217;s stock 
      price dropped almost 24 percent, erasing $900 million from the Company&#8217;s 
      market value.

      Mobile Devices
		&lt;/p&gt;

      Ixia to assess and validate customer quality and reliability of the 
      Microsoft Lync unified&#160;communication&#160;platform on smartphones and tablets
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Ixia 
      (Nasdaq: XXIA) announced that it has been selected by Microsoft as the 
      official provider to qualify mobile devices for use with Microsoft&#8217;s 
      Lync application. The expanding use of mission-critical applications 
      encompassing voice, video and messaging is placing increased strain on 
      mobile devices, while at the same time, customer expectations for 
      quality are rising. Ixia&#8217;s Wi-Fi 
      device qualification includes rigorous testing in real-world 
      scenarios to ensure that smartphones, tablets and laptops perform as 
      expected when running Microsoft Lync.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			News highlights
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a unified communications (UC) platform that provides a single client 
      experience for instant messaging, voice and video chat, Microsoft Lync 
      helps foster collaboration across global enterprise workforces. However, 
      with the explosion of the &#8220;bring your own device&#8221; (BYOD) trend, 
      applications such as Lync are increasingly being used on mobile devices 
      instead of on desktops. This, coupled with high quality expectations 
      from enterprise users, means manufacturers must be sure that new mobile 
      devices perform as needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft and Ixia are collaborating to test and qualify mobile devices 
      for Microsoft Lync applications using the Ixia Wi-Fi 
      mobile device test solution. As the official testing house for the 
      complete Microsoft Lync Wi-Fi ecosystem, Ixia works directly with 
      Microsoft partners to test and qualify technology used with the UC 
      system following a proven process:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Over a one-week timeframe, Ixia uses its VeriWave 
        solution to create real-world conditions by emulating a full range 
        of scalable, media-rich application traffic and measuring performance, 
        roaming capabilities, interoperability, and more.
      
			
        Once testing is complete, Ixia delivers a qualification report to 
        Microsoft and the technology partner with performance, security and 
        reliability findings. Based on this report, Microsoft determines 
        whether the technology is qualified for use with the Lync platform.
      
			
        As a result, Microsoft now has confidence that Lync users will receive 
        high-quality UC services, which equates to an increase in adoption of 
        the powerful and essential collaboration tool.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the past year, Ixia has worked as the official test house to 
      qualify Microsoft&#8217;s Lync application against Wi-Fi networking devices, 
      such as Wi-Fi access points, and has worked directly with Microsoft 
      partners to test and qualify the technology used with the system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Industry commentary
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Enterprise collaboration tools have become a critical part of today&#8217;s 
      working culture, and with the rise of BYOD, a good experience on mobile 
      devices is essential,&#8221; said Todd Haugen, Group Manager of Skype Wi-Fi at 
      Microsoft. &#8220;Microsoft is driven to ensure our customers have the quality 
      Lync experience they expect, and working with Ixia to qualify the Lync 
      ecosystem &#8211; starting with Wi-Fi network devices and now with the 
      associated mobile devices - accomplishes this goal.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Mobile usage is growing exponentially with more and more users 
      depending on mobile devices to connect to and use mission-critical tools 
      such as Microsoft&#8217;s Lync collaboration suite,&#8221; said Joseph Zeto, 
      Director of Product Marketing for Ixia. &#8220;Quality of Experience is no 
      longer a &#8216;nice to have,&#8217; as enterprises and individual users rely on 
      mobile devices to work anywhere and anytime. Working with Microsoft and 
      mobile device manufacturers, Ixia is helping to prepare today&#8217;s devices 
      for tomorrow&#8217;s applications.&#8221;

			Microsoft Selects ClearDB as a Database-as-a-Service Provider for the 
      Office 365 Blog
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ClearDB Helps Microsoft Get 600-Percent Performance Increase for Its 
      High-Traffic Blog
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ClearDB, an innovative database-as-a-service (DBaaS) for MySQL-powered 
      applications, has been selected by Microsoft as a database-as-a-service 
      (DBaaS) solution for its Office 365 blog. The use of the ClearDB DBaaS 
      resulted in a 600-percent performance increase for the high-traffic blog 
      coupled with significant cost savings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With WordPress as the blogging platform/CMS (Content Management System) 
      and Microsoft Azure as the cloud host, the Microsoft team looked for a 
      highly scalable, secure and reliable database solution to host its 
      Office blog, which was previously hosted by an external vendor who was 
      not only expensive, but did not keep the infrastructure up to date and 
      charged for upgrades.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Managing the infrastructure for databases is a huge pain,&#8221; said Mark 
      Brown, senior product marketing manager, Azure. &#8220;These days, to be 
      competitive, you have to spend your time on what you are good at, and 
      unless you are a MySQL expert, you won&#8217;t be that good at managing it.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While looking for DBaaS providers, they knew they had to find a solution 
      that would integrate seamlessly with Azure. The clear winner was 
      ClearDB, a member of the Microsoft Partner Network. ClearDB 
      brings highly stable, zero-administration MySQL database services to 
      Azure, helping organizations maximize revenue without maximizing their 
      IT budgets. ClearDB is a highly available MySQL DBaaS that runs in 
      multiple cloud computing and hybrid cloud/datacenter environments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After shifting to ClearDB, the Office blog saw a performance boost of 
      nearly 600 percent. &#8220;The site was so much more responsive,&#8221; said Brian 
      Costea, a content publishing manager at Microsoft. &#8220;Now, we make sure 
      all of our big Office announcements point back to the blog, because 
      we&#8217;re confident it can handle the traffic.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Technical support was a big plus as well. &#8220;The support we receive from 
      ClearDB is amazing,&#8221; Costea said. &#8220;This dedicated solution isn&#8217;t just 
      dedicated technology, but a dedicated team. The few times when I&#8217;ve had 
      to open a support ticket, I got a call back within five minutes. Even if 
      it&#8217;s not a ClearDB issue, they still do their best to fix it.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, April 8 (Reuters) - Private equity firm CVC is in
advanced talks to sell its printing-ink maker Flint Group to
Koch Industries and Goldman Sachs, two people
familiar with the transaction said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deal valuing the group at more than its 2013 sales of 2.2
billion euros ($3 billion) could be struck as early as this
week, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVC and Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while no one at
Koch, one of the largest privately held companies in the United
States, was immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010 CVC tried unsuccessfully to list Flint, having built
up the company with follow-on acquisitions after merging ink
businesses bought from BASF and Akzo Nobel 
in 2004.

&lt;p&gt;MUZAFFARNAGAR, India (Reuters) - India's main opposition party, tipped to form the next government, appears to be returning to its Hindu nationalist roots at the start of a five-week general election, raking up divisive issues and using strong language in an area hit by religious riots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criss-crossing the country for months before the first phase of voting began on Monday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its candidate for prime minister, Narendra Modi, had mainly campaigned on a ticket of better governance, economic development and job creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just hours after voting started, the election commission demanded an explanation from Modi's chief aide Amit Shah, accusing him of incendiary speeches in towns where dozens of people, mostly Muslims, were killed in Hindu-Muslim riots last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not anyone's hobby to riot. When justice is not done to all the parties and the action is one-sided action, then the public is forced to come out in the streets," Shah said in the town of Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh state last week, according to a transcript provided by the commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a series of speeches in the area, Shah also said voters should reject parties that put up Muslim candidates. He said Muslims in the area had raped, killed and humiliated Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah did not respond to requests for comment, but the BJP has said he was within his rights to ask people to express their anger through the ballot box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's 1.2 billion people include 150 million Muslims, who form a sizeable minority in Uttar Pradesh, the country's most populous state and a key electoral battleground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The riots in Muzaffarnagar last year started with a minor scuffle, which were exacerbated by inflammatory speeches by several local politicians, news reports have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although sectarian rioting is on the decline in India, it is still hit by spasms of Hindu-Muslim violence. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed when colonial India was divided in 1947 into Hindu-majority India and Pakistan, an Islamic state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elections in India are also times of heightened tensions because political parties often pitch for votes on the basis of religious identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the BJP released its election manifesto, promising to build a temple on the site of a mosque torn down by Hindu zealots more than two decades ago, reopening one of the most divisive issues in the country. The party also said it remained committed to withdrawing the special autonomous status for Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DARKER SIDE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls have said Modi is favorite to form the next government after results are announced on May 16, thanks to a strong campaign highlighting his economic competence in running the western state of Gujarat for 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But critics say he has a darker side and accuse him of failing to stop the killing of Muslims in riots in Gujarat in 2002. Modi has denied the accusations and the Supreme Court has said there is not enough evidence to prosecute him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey released by respected pollsters CSDS last week showed the BJP and its allies winning the largest number of seats but falling short of a majority. The decision to play on religious sentiments may be a last-minute attempt to woo some blocs of Hindu voters, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP maintains it is campaigning on economic issues and a vow to end what it says is deep-rooted corruption in the government headed by the ruling Congress party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah is a controversial figure, who was charged in 2010 with the extra-judicial killing of Muslims accused of terrorism when he was the interior minister in Gujarat. He denies the charges and is free on bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP has said the charges are trumped up at the behest of the Congress party and he is expected to hold a senior government position if Modi becomes prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the sugarcane fields and streets around Muzaffarnagar, the scene of the riots last year, Hindu students, laborers and workers said they would vote for Modi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are treated like second-grade citizens in our own homeland because most political parties and their leaders are running after the Muslim vote. That is why I wish to support Modi this time, we have a lot of hope for him," said Virender Malik, a laborer in a sugarcane field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 50,000 people, mainly Muslims, were driven from their homes in the rioting in Muzaffarnagar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some are still living in squalid relief camps, where support is strong for the state government run by the Samajwadi Party, which is backed by Muslims because of its staunch opposition to the BJP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are all for the Samajwadi Party which is our only hope against the BJP because of whom we got driven like mules away from our homes," said Naseemuddin, a 55-year old Muslim farm laborer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MANIFESTO SUPPORTS NEW TEMPLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP, until then on the periphery of national politics, burst into prominence in the late 1980s as it helped mobilize a movement leading to the destruction of a 16th-century mosque in the Uttar Pradesh town of Ayodhya that Hindus claimed was built on the birthplace of the god-king Ram. About 2,000 people were killed in riots across India in 1992 after the disputed mosque was torn down by Hindu mobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the party's core supporters want to build a temple at the site, a move supported in the manifesto unveiled on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once we have a Modi government in place, I am sure the grand Ram temple in Ayodhya will become a reality. We have been waiting long enough for that," said Sharad Sharma, an activist with a right-wing nationalist group in Ayodhya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in the manifesto were promises to protect and promote cows, which many Hindus consider sacred. The issue is close to the heart of supporters of Hindutva, a brand of Hindu nationalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to put provisions such as the construction of the Ram temple in the manifesto was taken mainly to satisfy hardliners in the party, one person involved in drafting the document told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to put it in there, so you do," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E. Sridharan, a political scientist at the Pennsylvania Center for Advanced Study of India, said the polarized atmosphere and such pledges could help shore up support in Uttar Pradesh, which elects 80 of the 543 lawmakers sent to the lower house of parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP has said it aims to win up to 50 seats in the state, from just 10 at the last election in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think maybe on the ground in some states, Uttar Pradesh in particular, they need to add a flavor of this to their campaign to mobilize Hindutva votes," said Sridharan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sruthi Gottipati; Writing by Frank Jack Daniel; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan and Dean Yates)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States may soon deny a visa to Iran's proposed U.N. ambassador, two U.S. officials said on Wednesday, a rare and potentially precedent-setting step that would test U.S. influence over the world body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government objects to Hamid Abutalebi entering the United States because of his suspected participation in a Muslim student group that held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days starting in 1979, when the group seized control of the U.S. embassy in the Iranian capital Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran on Wednesday rejected U.S. reservations about the veteran diplomat as "unacceptable." Abutalebi has played down his role in the embassy takeover, saying that he was only a translator for some of the militants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.N. officials, diplomats and academics could not recall past cases of the United States denying a U.N. ambassador's visa. Some expressed concern over the precedent it could set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There would be a strong feeling internationally, or at least among diplomats, that that is not within the purview of the host country," said Jeffrey Laurenti, a veteran U.N. analyst and former fellow at the Century Foundation, a New York public policy research group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two U.S. officials familiar with the matter said the ban could be announced soon and was being debated by top Obama administration policymakers. The officials asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to comment publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third U.S. official said Iran may have chosen Abutalebi as an "intentional provocation" given sensitivities over the hostage crisis, a defining moment in U.S.-Iranian relations that led the United States to cut diplomatic relations with Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crisis also became a morale-sapping drag on Jimmy Carter's presidency, and is widely viewed as a significant factor in his loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the Obama administration told Tehran that Abutalebi's nomination was "not viable." That drew a strong rebuke from Iran on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The attitude of the U.S. government towards Iran's (choice) for U.N. envoy is not acceptable. Iran has officially conveyed its views," IRNA, Iran's state news agency, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesperson as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abutalebi was among Iran's best and most experienced diplomats, the spokesperson said, noting that he had "ambassadorship experience" in Italy, Belgium and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far at least, the controversy does not appear to have influenced sensitive negotiations between major powers and Iran over curbing Iran's nuclear program in exchange for easing of economic sanctions, diplomats say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A DIFFICULT LEGAL QUESTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the host nation for the U.N. headquarters, the United States generally is required to provide foreign diplomats access to the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the State Department said last week that U.S. law allows it to deny diplomats visas for reasons of "security, terrorism, and foreign policy" - categories that a department spokeswoman acknowledged could be interpreted liberally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right to deny entry to Abutalebi poses a knotty legal question that pits the U.S. government's authority to police its own borders against the agreement the United States has with the United Nations, in which it pledges to allow envoys transit from the nation's border to the headquarters building in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further muddying the waters is a 1947 Joint Resolution of Congress, which said nothing should be seen as "diminishing, abridging, or weakening the right of the United States to safeguard its own security and completely control the entrance of aliens" into any part of the United States aside from the U.N. headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The State Department has relied on this reservation to deny visas to individuals deemed to pose a security risk to the United States," said John Bellinger, the top legal adviser to the State Department from 2005 to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Bellinger said the issue remains in dispute because some countries question whether the United States has such rights regarding diplomats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir was unable to travel to New York for the U.N. General Assembly in September after his visa application was left pending, according to Sudanese officials. Bashir has been indicted for war crimes in Sudan's Darfur region by the International Criminal Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, the United States denied visas to about 20 Iranian government officials hoping to attend the General Assembly, including two ministers, Iran's Fars news agency reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it chose, Iran could complain directly to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon about Abutalebi's case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1947 host country agreement also says disputes over the agreement should be referred to a tribunal of three arbitrators: one each chosen by the United Nations and United States and the third agreed to by both or appointed by the president of the International Court of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additonal reporting by Mehrdad Balali in Dubai, Michelle Nichols at the United Nations, Lou Charbonneau in Vienna and Lawrence Hurley, Arshad Mohammed and Patricia Zengerle in Washington.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, said that settling the big bank's wide-ranging legal cases with multiple government agencies last year was "the most painful, difficult and nerve-wracking experience that I have ever dealt with professionally."&lt;/p&gt;

"There is much to say and a lot to be learned in analyzing what happened, but I am not going to do so in this letter &#8212; more distance and perspective are required."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon also provided more details on the $2 billion of additional annual spending by the company to comply with new rules and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will have added 13,000 employees through the end of 2014 since the beginning to 2012 for regulatory compliance and risk control, Dimon said. The company employed about 251,000 people at the end of December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 8,000 employees are now dedicated solely to combating money laundering, Dimon said. The company was sanctioned last year by regulators for its weak system to thwart money laundering. Dimon acknowledged in the letter that JPMorgan executives previously had been too self-assured when they had seen competitors get in trouble with regulators over their systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our response generally was, 'We know what we're doing.' Well, we should have done more self-examination. We need to be better listeners and do a better job at examining critiques of others so we can learn from other people's mistakes, too," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has spent more than $600 million on technology for the compliance and control push. It has built what Dimon called a "state-of-the-art control room in our corporate headquarters to provide streamlined data analysis and reporting capabilities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond JPMorgan's regulatory troubles, Dimon took up a wide range of topics, including interest rate risk, cyber attacks and stock performance. He also warned of three looming threats to the company beyond its usual competitors: large, global Chinese banks, technological obsolescence and non-bank financial companies that operate largely outside of current bank regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four Chinese banks are following rapidly growing Chinese companies overseas, he said. As examples of non-bank competitors, he cited the PayPal business of eBay Inc, money market funds, real estate investment trusts and middle-market loan funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said he looks forward to interest rates rising from their currently low levels, which he expects will boost JPMorgan profits. But he cautioned, "When rates do normalize, we know one thing for certain - it will happen differently from what people expect. And my guess is that when it happens, it will be faster than people expect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is increasingly worried about cyber attacks, which he said are becoming more complex and dangerous. By the end of this year, JPMorgan's annual spending on cyber security will increase to more than $250 million, from $200 million in 2012, and staffing will rise to 1,000 people from 600 people.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest oil company in the United States, said on Wednesday it expected first-quarter income to slip because of high currency conversion costs and environmental charges in its mining unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output from the company's oil and natural wells fell because of bitterly cold weather throughout the United States, Canada and Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which operates in about 180 countries, expects foreign currency exchange charges of $100 million for the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron plans to list impairment charges of $400 million to $500 million, most of which would be related to its mining operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company operates an underground molybdenum mine in New Mexico, though now-closed parts of the facility have been deemed a superfund environmental cleanup area by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding the charges, Chevron said results should be "comparable" with the fourth quarter, when it reported net income of $4.93 billion, or $2.57 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect first-quarter earnings of $2.77 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's average U.S. oil and natural gas production fell to 637,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) in January and February from an average 650,000 for the entire fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, the company's output rose slightly, with the company producing 1.94 million boed, up from 1.93 million boed in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has previously forecast plans to produce 2.6 million boed this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the increase will come in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale oil and gas formation, which Chevron is developing alongside state-controlled YPF (YPFD.BA).

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - An internal affairs officer with the Miami-Dade Police Department has been charged with helping drug smugglers and orchestrating a murder-for-hire plot to have assassins dressed as cops kill their rivals, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ralph Mata, 45, appeared in a federal court in Miami on Wednesday, a day after he was arrested in connection with a scheme to smuggle cocaine from the Dominican Republic to New Jersey and elsewhere, according to federal prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mata, a 22-year law-enforcement veteran known as "The Milk Man," discussed a plot with the drug dealers to arrange for two people to wear police uniforms and badges and to kill two of their rivals, according to a criminal complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mata said he would pay the assassins $150,000 per target, the complaint said. In meetings with the would-be assassins, Mata gave them a down payment of $5,000 and a box of cigars for their "willingness" to participate in the plot, according to the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug dealers ultimately decided not to move forward with the plot, but Mata was paid for setting up the meetings, the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mata also allegedly offered to provide security to the drug leaders and purchased several firearms and transported them in a carry-on suitcase on flights to the Dominican Republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also helped to transport the drug dealers' money and was paid thousands of dollars for his help and a Rolex watch valued at $10,000, the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruce Fleisher, an attorney representing Mata, said his client "wants to clear his name."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I look forward to finding out what the evidence is so we can vigorously defend this case," Fleisher said. "They are serious allegations, but all serious allegations need due diligence and investigating and that's what we'll do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mata did not make any comments during his court appearance. He is scheduled to be arraigned on April 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also faces other charges, including aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The narcotics charges each carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Zachary Fagenson in Miami; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;LSI Syncro solutions enables increased data protection with 
      enterprise-class high availability and flexibility never before offered 
      in a DAS-based cluster-in-a-box system like the new Echostreams 
      DuraStreams solutions,&#8221; said Jas Tremblay, vice president of marketing, 
      Datacenter Solutions Group, LSI. &#8220;As companies continue to deal with 
      massive data growth, Echostreams DuraStreams solutions are an effective 
      way for SMBs to deliver cost-effective high-availability storage that is 
      easy to configure and manage.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Traditional approach for high availability requires multiple clustered 
      servers plus a redundant storage subsystem,&#8221; said Gene Lee, President 
      and CEO of Echostreams Innovative Solutions. &#8220;However, we believe an 
      all-in-one cluster-in-a-box high-availability server equipped with LSI&#8217;s 
      dual active hardware RAID controller, Syncro CS solutions offers 
      tremendous values to typically resource-constrained small and medium 
      businesses. Every business should be able to afford a robust IT 
      infrastructure to sustain its continuous operation and growth, and our 
      DuraStreams product line is designed exactly for that purpose.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;BRASILIA (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is committed to maintaining its investment-banking operations in Brazil as part of its global footprint, Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the unit will reflect business opportunities, Cohn said, adding that Goldman Sachs has not missed any major transactions in the country over the past year. More than 20 bankers left Goldman's investment-banking and wealth management divisions in Brazil since June as the lender slowed down plans to expand in the country more aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are always adjusting our people to where we think the opportunities are," he said after meeting with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff in Brasilia. "We do this in Brazil as we do in every one of our offices, including our main offices in New York, London and Asia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years of soft economic growth in Latin America's largest economy led the pace of mergers and acquisitions, bond and stock deals to slow. Goldman saw its roster of investment bankers in Brazil shrink to about 20 from 45 a year ago, sources told Reuters, as competition mounted and business faltered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the departures, Goldman Sachs had pledged to grow fast in Brazil, where demand for debt and hedging instruments swelled in recent years. Companies and investors are stepping up demand for corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and private equity fund-related vehicles that post higher returns than equities and government debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman increased the capital of its Brazilian unit to $400 million. In a visit in April last year, Cohn also said Goldman would increase the number of companies it serves to 300 from about 100 at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anthony Boadle and Maria Carolina Marcello; Writing by Guillermo Parra-Bernal; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Eric Walsh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp, the second-largest
oil company in the United States, said on Wednesday it expected
first-quarter income to slip from the prior quarter because of
high currency conversion costs and one-time charges in its
mining unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding the charges, Chevron said results should be
"comparable" with the fourth quarter, when it reported net
income of $4.93 billion, or $2.57 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron operates a molybdenum mine in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its shares fell slightly to $118.91 in after-hours trading.

			Chevron Issues Interim Update for First Quarter 2014
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today reported in its interim update that 
      earnings for the first quarter 2014 are expected to be lower than fourth 
      quarter 2013, principally as a result of adverse foreign exchange 
      effects, and selected asset impairments and related charges. Absent 
      these impacts, first quarter 2014 earnings are expected to be comparable 
      with the prior quarter&#8217;s results. The interim update contains industry 
      and company operating data for the first two months of the first 
      quarter. Readers are advised that the commentary below compares results 
      for the first two months of the first 
      quarter 2014 to full fourth quarter 2013 
      results, unless indicated otherwise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			UPSTREAM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Current year production has been affected by downtime, in part due to 
      adverse weather across multiple regions including Kazakhstan, Canada, 
      and the U.S. However, higher demand in Thailand and increased production 
      at the LNG facility in Angola have served as an offset.

      U.S. refinery crude-input volumes were down slightly compared to the 
      fourth quarter. International refinery crude-input volumes declined, 
      primarily reflecting increased maintenance activities at multiple

      PURPOSE OF "SAFE HARBOR'' PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES 
      LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This interim update of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking 
      statements relating to Chevron&#8217;s operations that are based on 
      management&#8217;s current expectations, estimates and projections about the 
      petroleum, chemicals and other energy-related industries. Words such as 
      &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;forecasts,&#8221; 
      &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;seeks,&#8221; &#8220;schedules,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;budgets,&#8221; 
      &#8220;outlook&#8221; and similar expressions are intended to identify such 
      forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of 
      future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and 
      other factors, many of which are beyond the company&#8217;s control and are 
      difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ 
      materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking 
      statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these 
      forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this 
      interim update. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no 
      obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as 
      a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing 
      crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and 
      chemical margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of 
      exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness 
      of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological 
      developments; the results of operations and financial condition of 
      equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company&#8217;s 
      joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development 
      activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production 
      from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; 
      potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned 
      projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company&#8217;s 
      production or manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation 
      networks due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe 
      weather or crude oil production quotas that might be imposed by the 
      Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability 
      for remedial actions or assessments required by existing or future 
      environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or 
      product changes required by existing or future environmental statutes, 
      regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other 
      pending or future litigation; the company&#8217;s future acquisition or 
      disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or 
      impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, 
      industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on 
      scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with 
      the U.S. dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally 
      accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and 
      the factors set forth under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; on pages 27 
      through 29 of the company&#8217;s 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In 
      addition, such results could be affected by general domestic and 
      international economic and political conditions. Other unpredictable or 
      unknown factors not discussed in this interim update could also have 
      material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/zdd2gd/global_synthetic) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Synthetic Rubber Market Report: 2014 Edition" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report Global Synthetic Rubber Market provides an in-depth analysis 
      of the production, consumption and capacity of global synthetic rubber 
      market with focus on its segments including: Polybutadiene rubber and 
      Styrene Butadiene Rubber. The major trends, growth drivers as well as 
      issues being faced by the industry are being presented in this report. 
      The four major players in the industry, Lanxess, Good Year, Kumho 
      Petrochemical Co. and Exxon Mobil Corp are being profiled.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Synthetic rubber is chemically manufactured elastomer which is produced 
      by the polymerization of two or more petroleum-derived monomers. 
      Synthetic rubber plants were built after 1945 and since then it has 
      maintained the lead over natural rubber. Polybutadiene rubber (BR) and 
      Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR) are the two most important types of 
      synthetic rubber and Butadiene is the primary feedstock for its 
      production. Industrial players of synthetic rubber operate in the 
      marketplace on the basis of low manufacturing cost, quality, technology 
      and most importantly price to stay ahead.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The synthetic rubber industry produces a variety of products that are 
      used by the fabrication industries. Most of the output of synthetic 
      rubber industry is taken up by tire industries thus categorizing this 
      industry as one of the predominant users of synthetic rubber. Apart from 
      tires, synthetic rubber has applications in various segments like shoes 
      soles, high-speed railway, aviation etc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key factors driving the growth of the synthetic rubber industry 
      include accelerating automotive industry, technological advancement and 
      slump in raw material prices. Some of the noteworthy trends and 
      developments in this industry are increasing demand for high performance 
      material, declining prices, rigorous competition and improved supply. 
      However, the expansion of global synthetic rubber industry is hindered 
      by rising environmental concerns and depletion of fossil fuels.

				Mars, Incorporated agrees to acquire IAMS&#174;, 
        EUKANUBA&#174;, and NATURA&#174; 
        brands for US$2.9 Billion in cash.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Mars, Incorporated and The Procter  Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) today
			announce that Mars has agreed to buy the IAMS&#174;, EUKANUBA&#174;, 
      and NATURA&#174; brands in major markets for US$2.9 Billion in 
      cash. This is a significant strategic move for Mars Petcare to 
      complement its large and growing global Petcare business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The companies expect to complete the transaction in the second-half of 
      2014, subject to regulatory approvals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mars Petcare is one of the world&#8217;s leading pet food and veterinary care 
      providers and employs more than 35,000 Associates across 50 countries. 
      Upon completion of the transaction, IAMS&#174;, EUKANUBA&#174;, 
      and NATURA&#174; brands will join Mars Petcare&#8217;s billion dollar 
      stable mates PEDIGREE&#174;, WHISKAS&#174;, BANFIELD&#174;, and ROYAL CANIN&#174;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mars Petcare Global President, Todd Lachman, said: &#8220;We view the addition 
      of the IAMS&#174;, EUKANUBA&#174;, and NATURA&#174; 
      brands as exceptionally strategic. This acquisition is a perfect fit 
      with our Mars Petcare vision of making A BETTER WORLD FOR PETS&#8482;. The 
      deal reinforces our leadership in pet nutrition and veterinary science, 
      attracts world class talent and grows our world leading portfolio.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Paul Iams, an animal nutritionist, founded the Iams Company in 1946. 
      His philosophies created very strong foundations for these remarkable 
      brands which will now complement our existing Mars Petcare portfolio.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG&#8217;s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, A.G. Lafley, 
      said: &#8220;Exiting Pet Care is an important step in our strategy to focus 
      PG&#8217;s portfolio on the core businesses where we can create the most 
      value for consumers and shareowners. The transaction creates value for 
      PG shareowners, and we are confident that the business will thrive at 
      Mars, a leading company in pet care.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The geographic regions included in the acquisition, which account for 
      approximately 80% of PG Pet Care&#8217;s global sales, include North America, 
      Latin America and other selected countries. The agreement includes an 
      option for Mars to acquire the business in several additional countries. 
      Markets not included in the transaction are primarily European Union 
      countries. PG said it is developing alternate plans to sell its Pet 
      Care business in these markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			PG Financial Impacts:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG said that it will begin reporting results of the global Pet Care 
      business as discontinued operations as of the April-June 2014 quarter. 
      As a result, PG expects to restate earnings of approximately $0.03 and 
      $0.04 per share from core earnings to discontinued operations for fiscal 
      years 2013 and 2014, respectively, leaving its fiscal year 2014 core 
      earnings per share growth rate guidance unchanged. The company added 
      that the one-time earnings impact from the divestiture and ongoing 
      earnings per share dilution are not expected to have a material impact 
      on fiscal year 2015 results. PG said that net cash proceeds from the 
      transaction would be used for general corporate purposes.

&lt;p&gt;PERTH, April 9 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp is on
track to start exporting liquefied natural gas from Papua New
Guinea by mid-year, ahead of schedule and below its $19 billion
budget, the manager of the PNG LNG project said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project has started commissioning a gas conditioning
plant in PNG's highlands, where the gas is drilled, a 292 kms
(180 miles) onshore pipeline has been completed and the first of
two units at the LNG plant is ready, project manager Decie Autin
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First cargoes are expected mid-year, she said, declining to
confirm reports that exports would start in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was going to be October. Now we think we've been able to
move it up to the middle of the year," Autin told reporters on
the sidelines of the Australian Petroleum Production and
Exploration Association conference in Perth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By the end of the year I'm comfortable we'll be fully
ramped up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project, under construction over the past five years,
ran into record wet weather, steep terrain and community issues
that slowed work and resulted in costs blowing out by about 25
percent from its original budget of $15 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The toughest part of the project I would tell you was the
onshore pipeline," Autin said. "We had to go from 9,000 feet, up
and down a tortuous path down to the shore."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pipeline was built above ground then had to be covered
with 1 metre (3 feet) of dirt to bury it for safety and
security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is high pressure gas pipe. You don't want anyone
messing with it, because it would be dangerous," Autin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first shipment is likely to be a spot cargo, rather than
going to one of PNG LNG's Japanese, Chinese or Taiwanese
customers, who have contracted to take 95 percent of the LNG
plant's 6.9 million tonnes a year of gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil and its partners, Oil Search Ltd, Santos
Ltd, Japan's Nippon Oil Corp, the PNG government and
local landowners, are looking to expand the plant, but have yet
to decide where to source the additional gas supply from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally they want gas from PNG's biggest undeveloped fields,
Elk and Antelope, controlled by another PNG company, InterOil
Corp and France's Total SA, which recently
bought into the fields in a deal contested by Oil Search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been in discussions with them (InterOil) directly,"
Autin said, declining to comment on whether ExxonMobil still
wants a direct stake in the Elk and Antelope fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Michael Perry)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Echo Entertainment outperforms on stronger revenue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* S/ASX 200 set to eke out 0.2 pct weekly gain

 (Adds analysis, quotes, stocks on the move)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, April 11 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell almost 1
percent on Friday, retreating from a near six-year high after a
selloff on Wall Street hit market sentiment, while Coca-Cola
Amatil Ltd sank to a 4-1/2-year low after the beverage
firm issued a profit warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the U.S. Nasdaq suffered its biggest drop in
2-1/2 years, raising fears of a broader market pullback. 
That hit investor confidence in Sydney and triggered broad-based
selling in shares including banks and miners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S/ASX 200 index was down 0.9 percent or 48.6
points at 5,432.2 as of 0247 GMT. On Thursday, the benchmark had
risen 0.3 percent and touched a session high of 5,503.5, its
highest since June 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its current level, the index is poised to gain 0.2
percent on the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commonwealth Bank of Australia lost 0.8 percent and
Westpac Banking Corp fell 0.7 percent. Index
heavyweight miners BHP Billiton Ltd and Rio Tinto Ltd
 lost 0.6 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think our clients are really shorting mining stocks at
the moment, that seems to be how they seem to be playing the
market," said Daniel Wypler, senior market maker at City Index
in Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wypler added that investors were taking a wait-and-see
stance towards banks, eyeing macro data and the Reserve Bank of
Australia's policy setting meetings over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil dived 14.4 percent to A$9.76, its lowest
since October 2009. The bottler said it expects its earnings to
fall around 15 percent in the first half of 2014 because of weak
spending in Australia and rising costs in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some stocks bucked the downdraft on upbeat cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echo Entertainment Group soared 11.8 percent to a
one-month high of A$2.70 after the casino operator said stronger
gaming revenue had boosted third-quarter earnings, and named a
new chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Padbury Mining Ltd rocketed 75 percent to a
three-year peak of A$0.04 after saying it had secured almost
$6.5 billion in funding to build a new port and associated
railway at Oakajee in Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, trading in shares of Bank of Queensland Ltd
 was suspended after it said it would buy Investec Bank
(Australia) Ltd's business finance and asset leasing
unit for A$440 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index slipped 0.3
percent to 5,099.5.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO, Calif., April 10, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - Breast imaging enhancements spearhead latest release&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Visage Imaging Inc. ("Visage"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Pro Medicus Ltd. (ASX: PME), announced today that they have released version 7.1.5 of the Visage&#174; 7 Enterprise Imaging Platform, including optimized navigation and tools, and significant speed enhancements to Visage 7's already industry-leading performance with massive digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) studies. These new features further strengthen Visage 7's impressive breast imaging capabilities, providing a formidable single platform for enterprise imaging. Visage 7 enables enterprise imaging with amazingly fast, thin-client, server-side processing technology, as well as simple mobile access to imaging results via Visage Ease(SM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Visage 7 continues to set the standard for enterprise imaging, enabling even the largest imaging organizations and health systems to dramatically transform the interpretation and delivery of medical images. Using a single powerful viewer, Visage 7 enables the multi-modality display of a full complement of radiology, cardiology and non-DICOM images, including comprehensive support for breast imaging workflow. For example, two DBT studies--a current plus prior --represents 12 Gigabytes of data when loaded via video card for the real-time display of full-fidelity data. Due to Visage 7's ultrafast server-side processing, the entire set of studies can be displayed in seconds even using cable-broadband network connections. In contrast, legacy PACS requires the 12 GB of DBT data to be transferred in advance to the reading workstation for radiologist interpretation. Best case transfer speeds of 12 GB of data over a 100 Mbps link is more than 16 minutes, and over a 1 Gbps link, more than 1.5 minutes. This legacy network transfer has to be performed predictively, off hours, and saturates at-risk networks. Instead, Visage 7 provides nearly immediate display. Visage enables imaging enterprises to stay ahead, providing radiologists and referring physicians nearly immediate access to DBT studies as they are needed, without artificial limitations to workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Visage 7.1.5 includes the following enhancements:&lt;/p&gt;
			
		Improved multi-modality breast imaging workflow, with multiple concurrent magnifiers, quadrant navigation, optimized mammography text overlays, DBT navigation and targeting tools, as well as improvements in lossless compression optimization resulting in even faster image display.
			
		New balloon tool provides level-set segmentation from any thin-client.
			
		Enhanced, yet simplified, sophisticated linking of multi-dimensional volumes.
			
		64-bit support for Mac OS X.
			
		Visage 7 Backend Server support for Windows Server 2012 R2.
			
		Optimized enterprise-wide supportability and monitoring tools.
		&lt;p&gt;
	"Visage 7's server-side technology represents an imaging revolution, delivering on many of the attributes you'd expect and more, but perhaps unexpectedly, Visage provides freedom," said Dr. Sam Hupert, Chief Executive Officer, Visage Imaging and Pro Medicus. "With 7.1.5, Visage allows imaging organizations the freedom to take back control of women's imaging, enabling the interpretation of multi-modality breast imaging studies, and all other diagnostic modalities, with a single viewer. Visage 7 offers organizations a step-change of speed and accessibility that really has no compare due to Visage's server-side architectural advantages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In support of the Visage 7.1.5 rollout, Visage is pleased to announce the "Visage 7.1.5 Private Screening", a tailored series of customer-focused web conferences. Each Visage 7 customer will be offered an exclusive, one-on-one introduction and demonstration of Visage 7.1.5. Customers are encouraged to contact Visage at support(at)visageimaging(dot)com, noting "Visage 7.1.5 Private Screening", with their preferred date and time for their personalized web conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, Visage Imaging will be exhibiting at the upcoming Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) 2014 meeting, May 15-17, Long Beach, CA (Visage Imaging Booths 331/333). To schedule a priority demonstration and/or meeting, please click here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds details on Argentina policy changes, Chevron's Latin
America performance)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ernest Scheyder and Hugh Bronstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BUENOS AIRES, April 10 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp
 and state-controlled YPF SA plan to spend an
additional $1.6 billion to develop Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale
formation further, boosting plans for new wells this year and
announcing fresh exploration projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project, announced on Thursday, will help Chevron boost
its oil and natural gas production, which has been stubbornly
flat the past few years despite annual global capital spending
of around $40 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should also help ease concerns about foreign investment
in Argentina, which was widely castigated after President
Cristina Fernandez expropriated Repsol SA's majority
stake in YPF two years ago, and should give the country fresh
capital to develop one of the largest energy reserves in the
Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the year, Argentina has made policy
changes that have caught the eye of international investors
while sparking a rally in local stocks and bonds. The shifts
have included heating gas subsidy cuts of 20 percent, an 18 
percent currency devaluation and a deal to pay Repsol $5 billion
for the YPF nationalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron and YPF began drilling in the region last year, with
Chevron agreeing to spend $1.24 billion for YPF to drill 161
wells as the project's operator, a deal that was widely seen as
a test phase by Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron and YPF said on Thursday they would jointly spend an
additional $1.6 billion to drill 170 wells this year, up from
previous estimates for 140 wells this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Chevron will spend $140 million to explore the
Narambuena region of the Vaca Muerta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron sought to characterize the announcement as a vote of
confidence in the first phase of the project and its high
expectations for future production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"YPF is a reliable partner and operator that is advancing
the project in the right direction," Ali Moshiri, Chevron's head
of African and Latin American exploration and production, said
in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moshiri is under pressure to show results in Latin America
because of slumping production in Venezuela and a protracted
legal fight with Ecuador that shows little signs of abating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big oil companies, like Chevron, also have had a mixed
record of developing shale deposits around the world, with their
large bureaucracies often moving slower than small, more-nimble
start-up companies to develop unconventional oil and natural gas
deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, which has called Vaca Muerta one of the world's
most exciting shale plays, has previously forecast production
there could jump from around 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent
per day at present to 80,000 boed by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's decision "is a great demonstration of confidence
in the work of YPF and the potential of unconventional
hydrocarbons of Argentina," Miguel Galuccio, YPF's chief
executive officer, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which is 51 percent controlled by Buenos Aires,
is seen as crucial in helping the South American nation achieve
energy independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argentina unveiled a new consumer price index this year that
more accurately measures stubbornly high inflation, which has
also hampered energy development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2007 through the end of last year the government
reported inflation at about half the rate estimated by private
economists. The lack of credibility of official data took a toll
on business confidence already battered by falling central bank
reserves and heavy-handed currency controls meant to clamp down
on access to U.S. dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argentina's stock market has rallied 20 percent so
far this year on the back of Buenos Aires' shift toward more
investment-friendly policies, while locally traded government
debt prices have risen 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country, however, remains home to one of the world's
highest inflation rates, estimated at over 30 percent. Central
bank reserves have fallen 32 percent to $27.6 billion over the
last 12 months, triggering criticism from the International
Monetary Fund and a credit rating downgrade from Moody's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Chevron were down 1.6 percent at $117.25, and YPF
fell 1 percent to $30.25 on the New York Stock Exchange early
Thursday afternoon.

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Koch Industries KCHIN.UL and Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) private equity arm are acquiring one of the world's leading makers of printing-inks, Flint, from buyout group CVC CVC.UL, the four companies said in a joint statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

      to deliver an authentication platform with a truly robust group of 
      networks,&#8221; said NRTC&#8217;s Vice President of Video Services Madeleine 
      Forrer. &#8220;Our members&#8217; subscribers now have access to the most popular

      ago, we had our first member go live with TV Everywhere services for 
      Disney/ESPN. Their subscribers are already enjoying all of the 
      programmer&#8217;s content on their computers, smartphones and tablets.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      looking forward to helping our members deliver popular entertainment 
      programming and more premiere sporting events to viewers in rural 
      America no matter where they are,&#8221; Forrer added. &#8220;The rapid expansion of 
      TV Everywhere&#8217;s availability will continue to change how television 
      viewers both think about and watch TV.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;April 10 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said on Thursday
it had signed an agreement with state-controlled YPF SA
 to continue developing Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale
formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies first started drilling in the region last
year. Chevron, which called Vaca Muerta one of the world's most
exciting shale plays, has previously said production there could
jump from around 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day
currently to 80,000 boed by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Koch Industries KCHIN.UL and Goldman Sachs's (GS.N) private equity arm are acquiring the world's leading maker of printing-inks Flint from buyout group CVC CVC.UL, the four companies said in a joint statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal values Flint at more than 2.2 billion euros ($3 billion) and will cut its debt, enabling it to acquire competitors in coming years, two people familiar with the transaction said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to grow Flint organically, but also with acquisitions and already have a list of potential takeover targets," said Martin Hintze, Goldman Sachs's co-head of Corporate Equity Investing in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Luxembourg-based group makes just over half of its profit in the packaging industry, while inks for the printing industry account for the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As demand for ink to print newspapers and magazines declines, the new owners want to shift Flint's focus increasingly towards packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koch, which is one of the largest privately held companies in the United States, and Goldman Sachs have agreed to reduce Flint's debt by 20 percent from the current roughly 1.8 billion euros and have secured better terms for the remaining debt, Hintze said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale comes after several unsuccessful attempts by CVC to sell the company over the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Flint, which has roughly 6,600 staff and has annual sales of 2.2 billion euros, saw earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rise by 5 percent to about 325 million euros.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today confirmed that subsidiaries of the 
      company have signed agreements with the Argentine oil company YPF S.A. 
      to continue development of shale oil and gas resources from the Vaca 
      Muerta formation located in the Neuqu&#233;n province in Argentina.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is a significant step in our subsidiaries&#8217; joint efforts with YPF 
      to develop one of the most exciting shale plays in the world today,&#8221; 
      said George Kirkland, vice chairman of Chevron Corporation. &#8220;Vaca Muerta 
      could become an important contributor to Chevron&#8217;s long term production 
      growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The agreements build off the progress made with the drilling program 
      begun in 2013 and call for continued investment toward large-scale 
      drilling and production in the 96,000-acre (388-sq. km) Loma Campana 
      concession. The agreements also call for exploration of shale oil and 
      gas resources in the 49,400-acre (200-sq. km) Narambuena area located 
      about 70 miles (100 kilometers) north of Loma Campana in the Chihuido de

      Neuqu&#233;n Basin of west-central Argentina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;YPF is a reliable partner and operator that is advancing the project in 
      the right direction,&#8221; said Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa and 
      Latin America Exploration and Production Company. &#8220;We are pleased with

      Inc., a metro-Atlanta based manufacturer of high-quality,

      wounded, ill and injured service members and their families.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The WRNMMC, located in Bethesda, Maryland, recently installed a 297kW 
      solar parking canopy at The Wounded Warrior Lodge, an extended-stay 
      treatment and rehabilitation facility for wounded service members. The 
      solar canopy, Powered by Suniva&#174;, covers a six-story parking deck and 
      was installed by sub-contractor, SolBright Renewable Energy and managed 
      by contractor, dck worldwide and partner, Ttec.

      &#8220;Suniva is honored that its modules are used in the canopy that powers 
      The Wounded Warrior Lodge,&#8221; said Matt Card, vice president of global 
      sales and marketing of Suniva. &#8220;When SolBright Renewable Energy informed 
      us of the Wounded Warrior project we were thrilled to participate as 
      their trusted partner. Knowing that Suniva powers such an important 
      building makes this project feel a little extra special.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, April 10 (Reuters) - Koch Industries 
and Goldman Sachs's private equity arm are acquiring
European printing-ink maker Flint from buyout group CVC

and will see the buyers bolster Flint's equity position,
enabling it to acquire competitors in coming years, people
familiar with the transaction said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With a significantly improved capital structure, Flint
Group is best positioned to pursue its ambitious growth plans to
further strengthen its market leading positions," Matthias
Hieber, who heads Goldman Sachs' equity investments in Germany,

sell the asset over the last couple of years.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co executives had a clear message for shareholders after reporting declining first-quarter earnings: don't worry, be happy that the bank isn't chasing short-term gains by making irrational lending decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first quarter was a tough one for JPMorgan. Profit fell 19 percent, revenue fell 8 percent, and the bank set aside 38 percent more money to cover loan losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the important thing is that the bank is not lowering its lending standards, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel really good about the risks we're taking ... for the future of the company," Dimon said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank will not be too aggressive in areas where it says it believes other lenders have taken leave of their senses, such as business lending, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told analysts on a separate call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll do every rational and sensible deal we can do but we aren't going to chase growth at the expense of discipline," Lake said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors say they appreciate the bank's strategy. Analyst Mike Scanlon at John Hancock Asset Management said Dimon seems to be making the kind of cautious lending decisions that long-term investors should want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They gave up revenue instead of chasing every dollar of business," Scanlon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the financial crisis, Charles "Chuck" Prince, then chief executive of Citigroup, infamously said that his bank had no choice but to make aggressive loans to private equity funds because its rivals were. "As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance," he told the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior executive at JPMorgan, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said on Friday, "Jamie is not going to dance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By backing away when others lend more aggressively, JPMorgan is acting like it did before the credit crisis, Scanlon added. John Hancock Asset Management owns about 1 million shares of JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's recent tangles with regulators over a range of issues, including the loss of more than $6 billion in the London Whale derivatives scandal, may be making the bank more inclined to play it safe when it comes to all kinds of risk, said analyst Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of this is coming together to make a conservative bank that in the long-run is going to work very well for shareholders, but over the near-term is going to come up short at times, like they did this quarter," said Cassidy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has one of the highest valuations among the major commercial and investment banks, as measured by share price to tangible common book value, which is due in part to its tendency to know when to scale down credit risk, Cassidy added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &amp; Co, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, agrees that competition is heating up now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You tend to see competitors be a little more aggressive, price things more aggressively to generate revenue," said Tim Sloan, chief financial officer at Wells Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo said on Friday that it managed to boost its lending book in the first quarter, but much of its 14 percent net profit increase in the period came from one-time gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAGGING RIVALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For JPMorgan, remaining disciplined is painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's mortgage lending and bond trading businesses logged steep profit declines, and the bank's profits also fell in many other key businesses, including corporate lending and debt underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was not an exciting set of numbers," said Andrew Kohl, an associate portfolio manager at Alpine Financial Services Fund, which owns JPMorgan shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results and company commentary prompted analyst Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer to cut his JPMorgan earnings estimates. He reduced his 2014 estimate to $5.64 a share from $6.13, and his 2015 estimate to $6.00 a share from $6.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total loans on JPMorgan's books grew less than 1 percent in the first quarter compared with the year-earlier period, and the average rates it earned on its $730 billion of loans fell to 4.49 percent, from 4.78 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One headwind for loan growth at JPMorgan is the impact of old Washington Mutual assets that the bank is not replacing when they mature. JPMorgan bought Washington Mutual at the height of the financial crisis after it failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bank is consciously trying to limit its new business in areas where profitability is shrinking. For example, JPMorgan made just $17 billion mortgages in the first quarter, down from $52.7 billion in the same quarter last year. That nearly 70 percent drop is steeper than the 57 percent decline that the Mortgage Bankers Association expects for the industry in the first quarter, mainly as a result of the reduced appeal of refinancing because of higher interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to investors in February, JPMorgan's Consumer and Community Banking CEO Gordon Smith said that there is a lot of competition in mortgage lending now as volume shrinks, and the bank is trying to determine how much business it wants there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's total loan growth lags the overall market, Federal Reserve data show. Loans across the U.S. banking system rose about 3.5 percent from the final week of March 2013 to the last week of March 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall volume of loans to companies has been growing fast, Fed data show: commercial and industrial loans on banks' books were 7.8 percent higher at the end of March from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the riskiest part of that market, namely junk-rated loans to companies, quality has weakened, and deals are put together in a way that reduces protection to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In loans to companies, JPMorgan is increasingly seeing competition from private equity firms and other lenders outside of the banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $1 billion of loans that JPMorgan made to companies with weak credit quality have been refinanced by non-banks, Doug Petno, chief of the bank's commercial banking, said in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo's Sloan said he has seen increasing competition from non-banks as well, but added that Wells Fargo's ability to sell a wide range of products to customers has prevented it from losing too many clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter, companies took out $8.6 billion of second-lien loans, which are riskier as they provide lower recoveries to lenders in a default. That is the fifth-highest level on record and a 25 percent increase over each of the past two quarters, Thomson Reuters LPC data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York, Additional reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra, Peter Rudegeair and Michelle Sierra in New York; Writing by Dan Wilchins; Edited by Martin Howell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's board faces a lawsuit over the way it handled an error with its Internet Explorer browser that ended up costing the company a record-breaking $731 million fine by European antitrust regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, brought by shareholder Kim Barovic in federal court in Seattle on Friday, charges that directors and executives, including founder Bill Gates and former Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, failed to manage the company properly and that the board's investigation was insufficient into how the miscue occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal action is the first to emerge from a humiliating episode for Microsoft, which the software company has never fully explained and has accounted for only as a "technical error."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March last year, the European Union levied its largest ever antitrust fine against Microsoft for breaking a legally binding commitment made in 2009 to ensure that consumers in Europe had a choice of how they access the internet, rather than defaulting to Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its investigation found that updated software issued between May 2011 and July 2012 meant that 15 million users were not given a choice. It was the first time the European Commission, the EU's antitrust authority, handed down a fine to a company for failing to meet its obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her lawsuit, Barovic says she asked Microsoft's board to fully investigate how that mistake occurred and to take action against any directors or executives that had not performed their duties. She says Microsoft replied that it found no evidence of a breach of fiduciary duty by any current or former executives or directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Friday, Microsoft repeated that stance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ms. Barovic asked the board to investigate her demand and bring a lawsuit against the board and company executives," said an emailed statement from Microsoft. "The board thoroughly considered her demand as she requested and found no basis for such a suit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem on European computers prevented the so-called "ballot" screen from appearing. Sources close to the company have said it was connected to updated Windows 7 software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who was CEO at the time, and Steven Sinofsky, then the head of the Windows unit, both had their bonuses cut in 2012 after the error came to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Barovic v Ballmer et al in U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 14-00540&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Grant McCool)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co executives
had a clear message for shareholders after reporting declining
first-quarter earnings: don't worry, be happy that the bank
isn't chasing short-term gains by making irrational lending
decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first quarter was a tough one for JPMorgan. Profit fell
19 percent, revenue fell 8 percent, and the bank set aside 38
percent more money to cover loan losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the important thing is that the bank is not lowering its
lending standards, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel really good about the risks we're taking ... for
the future of the company," Dimon said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank will not be too aggressive in areas where it says
it believes other lenders have taken leave of their senses, such
as business lending, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told
analysts on a separate call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll do every rational and sensible deal we can do but we
aren't going to chase growth at the expense of discipline," Lake
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors say they appreciate the bank's strategy.
Analyst Mike Scanlon at John Hancock Asset Management said Dimon
seems to be making the kind of cautious lending decisions that
long-term investors should want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They gave up revenue instead of chasing every dollar of
business," Scanlon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the financial crisis, Charles "Chuck" Prince, then
chief executive of Citigroup, infamously said that his bank had
no choice but to make aggressive loans to private equity funds
because its rivals were. "As long as the music is playing,
you've got to get up and dance," he told the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior executive at JPMorgan, who was not authorized to
speak on the record, said on Friday, "Jamie is not going to
dance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By backing away when others lend more aggressively, JPMorgan
is acting like it did before the credit crisis, Scanlon added.
John Hancock Asset Management owns about 1 million shares of
JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's recent tangles with regulators over a range of
issues, including the loss of more than $6 billion in the London
Whale derivatives scandal, may be making the bank more inclined
to play it safe when it comes to all kinds of risk, said analyst
Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of this is coming together to make a conservative bank
that in the long-run is going to work very well for
shareholders, but over the near-term is going to come up short
at times, like they did this quarter," said Cassidy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has one of the highest valuations among the major
commercial and investment banks, as measured by share price to
tangible common book value, which is due in part to its tendency
to know when to scale down credit risk, Cassidy added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &amp; Co, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by
assets, agrees that competition is heating up now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You tend to see competitors be a little more aggressive,
price things more aggressively to generate revenue," said Tim
Sloan, chief financial officer at Wells Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo said on Friday that it managed to boost its
lending book in the first quarter, but much of its 14 percent
net profit increase in the period came from one-time gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAGGING RIVALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For JPMorgan, remaining disciplined is painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's mortgage lending and bond trading businesses
logged steep profit declines, and the bank's profits also fell
in many other key businesses, including corporate lending and
debt underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was not an exciting set of numbers," said Andrew Kohl,
an associate portfolio manager at Alpine Financial Services
Fund, which owns JPMorgan shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results and company commentary prompted analyst Chris
Kotowski of Oppenheimer to cut his JPMorgan earnings estimates.
He reduced his 2014 estimate to $5.64 a share from $6.13, and
his 2015 estimate to $6.00 a share from $6.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total loans on JPMorgan's books grew less than 1 percent in
the first quarter compared with the year-earlier period, and the
average rates it earned on its $730 billion of loans fell to
4.49 percent, from 4.78 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One headwind for loan growth at JPMorgan is the impact of
old Washington Mutual assets that the bank is not replacing when
they mature. JPMorgan bought Washington Mutual at the height of
the financial crisis after it failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bank is consciously trying to limit its new business
in areas where profitability is shrinking. For example, JPMorgan
made just $17 billion mortgages in the first quarter, down from
$52.7 billion in the same quarter last year. That nearly 70
percent drop is steeper than the 57 percent decline that the
Mortgage Bankers Association expects for the industry in the
first quarter, mainly as a result of the reduced appeal of
refinancing because of higher interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to investors in February, JPMorgan's Consumer and
Community Banking CEO Gordon Smith said that there is a lot of
competition in mortgage lending now as volume shrinks, and the
bank is trying to determine how much business it wants there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's total loan growth lags the overall market,
Federal Reserve data show. Loans across the U.S. banking system
rose about 3.5 percent from the final week of March 2013 to the
last week of March 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall volume of loans to companies has been growing fast,
Fed data show: commercial and industrial loans on banks' books
were 7.8 percent higher at the end of March from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the riskiest part of that market, namely junk-rated loans
to companies, quality has weakened, and deals are put together
in a way that reduces protection to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In loans to companies, JPMorgan is increasingly seeing
competition from private equity firms and other lenders outside
of the banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $1 billion of loans that JPMorgan made to companies
with weak credit quality have been refinanced by non-banks, Doug
Petno, chief of the bank's commercial banking, said in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo's Sloan said he has seen increasing competition
from non-banks as well, but added that Wells Fargo's ability to
sell a wide range of products to customers has prevented it from
losing too many clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter, companies took out $8.6 billion of
second-lien loans, which are riskier as they provide lower
recoveries to lenders in a default. That is the fifth-highest
level on record and a 25 percent increase over each of the past
two quarters, Thomson Reuters LPC data show.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, April 11 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's 
board faces a lawsuit over the way it handled an error with its
Internet Explorer browser that ended up costing the company a
record-breaking $731 million fine by European antitrust
regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, brought by shareholder Kim Barovic in federal
court in Seattle on Friday, charges that directors and
executives, including founder Bill Gates and former Chief
Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, failed to manage the company
properly and that the board's investigation was insufficient
into how the miscue occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal action is the first to emerge from a humiliating
episode for Microsoft, which the software company has never
fully explained and has accounted for only as a "technical
error."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March last year, the European Union levied its largest
ever antitrust fine against Microsoft for breaking a legally
binding commitment made in 2009 to ensure that consumers in
Europe had a choice of how they access the internet, rather than
defaulting to Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its investigation found that updated software issued between
May 2011 and July 2012 meant that 15 million users were not
given a choice. It was the first time the European Commission,
the EU's antitrust authority, handed down a fine to a company
for failing to meet its obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her lawsuit, Barovic says she asked Microsoft's board to
fully investigate how that mistake occurred and to take action
against any directors or executives that had not performed their
duties. She says Microsoft replied that it found no evidence of
a breach of fiduciary duty by any current or former executives
or directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Friday, Microsoft repeated that stance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ms. Barovic asked the board to investigate her demand and
bring a lawsuit against the board and company executives," said
an emailed statement from Microsoft. "The board thoroughly
considered her demand as she requested and found no basis for
such a suit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem on European computers prevented the so-called
"ballot" screen from appearing. Sources close to the company
have said it was connected to updated Windows 7 software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who was CEO at the time, and Steven Sinofsky, then
the head of the Windows unit, both had their bonuses cut in 2012
after the error came to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Barovic v Ballmer et al in U.S. District Court,
Western District of Washington, No. 14-00540

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Friday it would not grant a visa to Iran's proposed U.N. ambassador, citing the envoy's links to the 1979-1981 hostage crisis, in a rare step that raises questions about how much influence the White House can wield over the world body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama had come under strong pressure not to allow Hamid Abutalebi into the country to take up his position in New York, raising concerns that the dispute would disrupt delicate negotiation between Tehran, Washington and other world powers over Iran's nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White House spokesman Jay Carney said the United Nations and Iran had been told "that we will not issue a visa to Mr. Abutalebi." Neither the White House nor the State Department provided further explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. law allows the government to bar U.N. diplomats who are considered national security threats, but Obama's potentially precedent-setting step could open the United States to criticism that it is using its position as host nation to improperly exert political influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government objects to Abutalebi because of his suspected participation in a Muslim student group that seized the embassy in November 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The veteran diplomat has acknowledged that he acted as an interpreter for the militants who held the hostages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama's decision came days after negotiators from Iran, the United States and five other world powers met in Vienna for another round of nuclear talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations said the White House decision was unfortunate and may violate international law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a regrettable decision by the U.S. Administration which is in contravention of international law, the obligation of the host country and the inherent right of sovereign member states to designate their representatives to the United Nations," spokesman Hamid Babaei said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an Iranian official said he did not expect the dispute to affect the nuclear negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any official response would be up to the Iranian Foreign Ministry, but the U.S. decision "will have no impact on our talks with the P5+1," the official told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials also said they did not expect any impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations said it had no comment at this time on the U.S. decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DANGEROUS PRECEDENTS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama's decision raised concerns about possible precedents, such as calls from U.S. interest groups for future visas to be denied for political reasons, or retaliation abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the U.S. starts to pick and choose who can represent other countries at the UN, other countries are likely to react angrily. How would Washington feel if Switzerland vetoed its choice for American ambassador to the Human Rights Council in Geneva?" said Richard Gowan, an international relations expert at New York University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After former hostages objected to Abutalebi, members of Congress jumped to pass legislation banning him, seeing the issue as a chance to look tough on Iran after a new sanctions bill stalled in the Senate early this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unusually, the legislation passed unanimously in both chambers of the normally divided Congress this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many members of Congress, even Obama's fellow Democrats, are deeply skeptical about Iran, despite the administration's efforts to ease tensions with the long-time U.S. adversary. They had made clear they considered Iran's selection of Abutalebi as a rebuke of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am grateful that President Obama made the right decision and will deny the visa for this Iranian terrorist," U.S. Representative Doug Lamborn, a Colorado Republican who sponsored the bill in the House of Representatives, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House is still reviewing the legislation, which would bar any U.N. representative deemed to be behind acts of terrorism or espionage against the United States. It would need Obama's signature to become law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michelle Nichols at the United Nations and Parisa Hafezi in Ankara; Editing by Doina Chiacu and Mohammad Zargham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

      Fitch: JPMorgan 1Q'14 Results Hurt by Weaker Mortgage Production and 
      Fixed Income Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As expected by Fitch Ratings, JPMorgan Chase  Co.'s (JPM) 1Q'14 net 
      earnings of $5.3 billion were hurt by weakness in fixed income and a 
      continued decline in mortgage production. Bright spots included business 
      banking loan growth, market-leading credit card purchase volume growth, 
      strong investment banking fees in commercial banking, positive client 
      flows in asset management, and a continuation of solid asset quality 
      trends in consumer and commercial loan categories. Returns on tangible 
      common equity were 13% for the quarter compared to 17% a year earlier. 
      There were no significant items of note in the quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Results for the Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) were down 24% from 
      1Q'13, or 22% adjusting for DVA. The decline was driven by a 22% decline 
      in debt underwriting and a 21% decline in fixed income markets, which 
      was largely expected given market volumes. Markets revenue was down 
      overall, but investment banking fees were up modestly, as growth in 
      advisory and equity underwriting offset weaker debt issuance. The CIB 
      average VaR remained relatively low, at $42 million for the quarter, 
      which was flat with 4Q'13, but down from $62 million in 1Q'13. DVA/FVA 
      was a loss of $53 million in the quarter and is expected to remain 
      modest going forward, given the implementation of FVA in 4Q'13.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income in the Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) segment was down 
      from 1Q'13 and 4Q'13, given declines in mortgage revenue and higher 
      provision expense, offset to some extent by lower operating expenses. 
      Mortgage origination volume was down nearly 68% year over year and 27% 
      from the prior quarter, which appears to be in-line with other large 
      market participants. Production pre-tax income was a negative $186 
      million in the quarter and is expected to be negative for the year, 
      although it could improve modestly in 2Q'14 according to management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pre-tax earnings in the servicing business improved given declines in 
      the cost basis. Total servicing expenses were $582 million in the 
      quarter, which compares to a target of approximately $500 million per 
      quarter by year-end, which Fitch believes is achievable. MSR risk 
      management losses were relatively large, but reflected a higher 
      allocation of capital to the business. Credit metrics in the real estate 
      portfolio continued to decline, which supported $200 million of reserve 
      releases in the quarter. Fitch expects additional reserve releases over 
      the balance of the year, although at lower levels than seen in 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Card segment performance was relatively solid, but Fitch expects 
      provision expenses and continued margin compression to be headwinds over 
      the remainder of 2014. Reserve releases, which were $250 million in the 
      quarter ($50 million of which were related to student loans) are largely 
      complete. Still, nothing is signaling an imminent decline in credit 
      performance. The 1Q growth in net charge-offs were seasonally driven and 
      early-stage delinquencies continued to decline. Potential offsets to 
      earnings headwinds could be a continuation of strong sales growth, which 
      was up 10% from 1Q'13, and loan portfolio growth, which appears to have 
      bottomed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commercial Banking (CB) remains a very steady performer within JPM, with 
      earnings relatively flat year-over-year. Loan growth was up about 7% 
      from 1Q'13, with noted strength in commercial real estate. Credit 
      quality remained very strong, with net recoveries in the quarter. Asset 
      Management (AM) earnings were down due to an increase in expenses 
      related to higher headcount and costs associated with the control 
      agenda. Assets under management (AUM) were above $1.6 trillion at 
      quarter-end.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bank's core net interest margin, which excludes the impact of CIB's 
      market-based activities, was up 2 basis points sequentially, to 2.66% 
      due to higher investment securities yields, offset to some extent by 
      loan spread compression. JPM is expecting Treasury to report breakeven 
      net interest income (NII) by year-end, but reported negative NII of $87 
      million in 1Q'14.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM made no progress toward its year-end Basel III Tier 1 Common equity 
      (CET1) target in the quarter, as benefits from portfolio run-off and 
      capital generation were offset by the impact of models not approved for 
      Basel III. The CET1 ratio remained flat sequentially at 9.5% compared to 
      a year-end 2014 target of 10%. Still, progress was made on the 
      supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), which improved 50 basis points 
      sequentially at the firm level in 1Q'14, reaching 5.1%. The improvement 
      was driven by net retained earnings and preferred issuance of close to 
      $4 billion in the quarter. Additionally, the impact of the U.S. final 
      leverage ratio NPR, which was released earlier this week, benefited the 
      ratio by about 15-20 basis points. JPM expects to target firm SLR of 
      5.5% longer-term. Fitch regards JPM's capital levels to be consistent 
      with its current ratings and would expect the bank to achieve full 
      compliance with all regulatory requirements, well ahead of required 
      implementation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As recently disclosed, the Federal Reserve did not object to JPM's 
      capital plan as part of the annual CCAR process. As a result, JPM 
      announced a $0.02 per share increase in its quarterly dividend, to $0.40 
      per share, and authorization to repurchase up to $6.5 billion of common 
      equity through 1Q'15.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co posted far weaker-than-expected quarterly profit as uncertainty about the U.S. economy weighed on investor trading volumes and consumer borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from the first of the major Wall Street banks to post earnings underscore how difficult the first quarter was for the financial sector. JPMorgan's bond trading revenue plunged 21 percent, and mortgage lending revenue fell 84 percent from the same quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the bank's big businesses, including commercial lending and credit cards, delivered lower profits. But the bank is not responding by dialing up its risk-taking in commercial lending, and it views falling revenue in its bond trading business as part of a business cycle instead of a symptom of a broad-based and lasting decline in fixed-income trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not like selling cereal - it's not like your volumes go up 2 percent every day," Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said to reporters on a conference call. The business will grow over the next decade or two, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who earned plaudits for keeping his bank consistently profitable during the financial crisis, is struggling to figure out how to navigate the current environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his annual letter to shareholders earlier this week, Dimon noted that JPMorgan will have spent more than $2 billion more than usual from 2012 through the end of this year on complying with new rules, and devoted more than 1 million work hours to meeting new mortgage rules. The bank's net income dropped 16 percent last year due to massive legal settlements and rising compliance costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday's results showed how the bank's troubles appear to be extending beyond outsized legal settlements and meeting new rules, and into areas more fundamental to the business, such as loan demand and trading volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, net income fell 19 percent to $5.27 billion, or $1.28 per share, from $6.53 billion, or $1.59 per share, in the same quarter of 2013, the biggest U.S. bank said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.40 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total net revenue fell 8.5 percent to $22.99 billion, falling well short of the average estimate of $24.53 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares, which recently topped $61 to trade at their highest level in 13 years, fell 3.1 percent to $55.63 in afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORTGAGE LENDING FALLS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area where the bank is meeting with some success is keeping costs under control, a crucial effort when future revenues may be weak. JPMorgan said non-interest expenses fell 5 percent in the latest quarter to $14.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon is aiming to hold down overhead - which he defines as non-interest expenses aside from litigation - to below an average of $14.75 billion per quarter, or $59 billion for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortgage banking net income fell to $114 million in the quarter, a drop of $559 million from the year-earlier period. Production revenue, a measure of lending revenue, fell 84 percent to $161 million, and the bank made $17 billion of home loans, a 68 percent decline from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. mortgage lending has cooled after rising rates in the second half of last year have given fewer homeowners reason to refinance their loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &amp; Co, the biggest U.S. home lender, also reported results Friday and said its income from mortgage banking fell 46 percent from a year earlier. Gains on one-time items, however, contributed to a higher-than expected 14 percent rise in quarterly profit for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For JPMorgan, rising bond yields in the middle of last year, which resulted from the Federal Reserve's decision to slow down its bond buying program, also weighed on fixed income, currency, and commodity trading revenue, which fell to $3.76 billion from $4.75 billion in the same quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial banking income fell 3 percent to $578 million, hurt by declining revenue from making loans. Consumer credit and debit card income fell 1 percent to $1.35 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said total assets at the end of March stood at $2.48 trillion, up from $2.42 trillion at the end of December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm's supplementary leverage ratio, a measure of a bank's capital compared with its assets, stood at 5.1 percent at the end of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leverage ratios took on added importance on Tuesday when the Federal Reserve approved new rules setting minimum levels that could force the eight biggest U.S. banks to boost their capital by a total of $68 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule sets a higher minimum of 6 percent for the company's insured bank subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the rule was approved in its latest form, JPMorgan had said it was on track to raise its ratio from 4.6 percent at the end of December to the 5 percent minimum for its holding company by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LITIGATION EXPENSES "IMMATERIAL"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said its litigation expenses were immaterial in the latest quarter, under its "other corporate" accounting line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Litigation expenses totaled $347 million in the year-earlier quarter and $847 million in the fourth-quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter two years ago, litigation costs totaled $2.5 billion as the bank built up reserves in anticipation of big legal settlements that it ultimately reached in 2013. JPMorgan paid more than $20 billion last year to resolve legal claims stemming from a wide range of problems, including its London Whale derivatives loss and its marketing of bad mortgage securities before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's shares - which have nearly doubled in price since the bank was rocked in 2012 by its London Whale derivatives trading scandal and $6.2 billion loss - were trading at a multiple of 9.56 times estimated forward earnings on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That compares with 9.93 times for Goldman Sachs Group Inc and 11.38 times for Morgan Stanley, both of which report next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York and Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore; Editing by Ted Kerr, Dan Wilchins, Sofina Mirza-Reid and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK, April 11 (Fitch) As expected by Fitch Ratings,
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s 
(JPM) 1Q'14 net earnings of $5.3 billion were hurt by weakness
in fixed income 
and a continued decline in mortgage production. Bright spots
included business 
banking loan growth, market-leading credit card purchase volume
growth, strong 
investment banking fees in commercial banking, positive client
flows in asset 
management, and a continuation of solid asset quality trends in
consumer and 
commercial loan categories. Returns on tangible common equity
were 13% for the 
quarter compared to 17% a year earlier. There were no
significant items of note 
in the quarter.     
Results for the Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) were down
24% from 1Q'13, or 
22% adjusting for DVA. The decline was driven by a 22% decline
in debt 
underwriting and a 21% decline in fixed income markets, which
was largely 
expected given market volumes. Markets revenue was down overall,
but investment 
banking fees were up modestly, as growth in advisory and equity
underwriting 
offset weaker debt issuance. The CIB average VaR remained
relatively low, at $42 
million for the quarter, which was flat with 4Q'13, but down
from $62 million in 
1Q'13. DVA/FVA was a loss of $53 million in the quarter and is
expected to 
remain modest going forward, given the implementation of FVA in
4Q'13. 
Net income in the Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) segment
was down from 
1Q'13 and 4Q'13, given declines in mortgage revenue and higher
provision 
expense, offset to some extent by lower operating expenses.
Mortgage origination 
volume was down nearly 68% year over year and 27% from the prior
quarter, which 
appears to be in-line with other large market participants.
Production pre-tax 
income was a negative $186 million in the quarter and is
expected to be negative 
for the year, although it could improve modestly in 2Q'14
according to 
management. 
Pre-tax earnings in the servicing business improved given
declines in the cost 
basis. Total servicing expenses were $582 million in the
quarter, which compares 
to a target of approximately $500 million per quarter by
year-end, which Fitch 
believes is achievable. MSR risk management losses were
relatively large, but 
reflected a higher allocation of capital to the business. Credit
metrics in the 
real estate portfolio continued to decline, which supported $200
million of 
reserve releases in the quarter. Fitch expects additional
reserve releases over 
the balance of the year, although at lower levels than seen in
2013.   
Card segment performance was relatively solid, but Fitch expects
provision 
expenses and continued margin compression to be headwinds over
the remainder of 
2014. Reserve releases, which were $250 million in the quarter
($50 million of 
which were related to student loans) are largely complete.
Still, nothing is 
signaling an imminent decline in credit performance. The 1Q
growth in net 
charge-offs were seasonally driven and early-stage delinquencies
continued to 
decline. Potential offsets to earnings headwinds could be a
continuation of 
strong sales growth, which was up 10% from 1Q'13, and loan
portfolio growth, 
which appears to have bottomed.   
Commercial Banking (CB) remains a very steady performer within
JPM, with 
earnings relatively flat year-over-year. Loan growth was up
about 7% from 1Q'13, 
with noted strength in commercial real estate. Credit quality
remained very 
strong, with net recoveries in the quarter. Asset Management
(AM) earnings were 
down due to an increase in expenses related to higher headcount
and costs 
associated with the control agenda. Assets under management
(AUM) were above 
$1.6 trillion at quarter-end.  
The bank's core net interest margin, which excludes the impact
of CIB's 
market-based activities, was up 2 basis points sequentially, to
2.66% due to 
higher investment securities yields, offset to some extent by
loan spread 
compression. JPM is expecting Treasury to report breakeven net
interest income 
(NII) by year-end, but reported negative NII of $87 million in
1Q'14. 
JPM made no progress toward its year-end Basel III Tier 1 Common
equity (CET1) 
target in the quarter, as benefits from portfolio run-off and
capital generation 
were offset by the impact of models not approved for Basel III.
The CET1 ratio 
remained flat sequentially at 9.5% compared to a year-end 2014
target of 10%. 
Still, progress was made on the supplementary leverage ratio
(SLR), which 
improved 50 basis points sequentially at the firm level in
1Q'14, reaching 5.1%. 
The improvement was driven by net retained earnings and
preferred issuance of 
close to $4 billion in the quarter. Additionally, the impact of
the U.S. final 
leverage ratio NPR, which was released earlier this week,
benefited the ratio by 
about 15-20 basis points. JPM expects to target firm SLR of 5.5%
longer-term. 
Fitch regards JPM's capital levels to be consistent with its
current ratings and 
would expect the bank to achieve full compliance with all
regulatory 
requirements, well ahead of required implementation. 
As recently disclosed, the Federal Reserve did not object to
JPM's capital plan 
as part of the annual CCAR process. As a result, JPM announced a
$0.02 per share 
increase in its quarterly dividend, to $0.40 per share, and
authorization to 
repurchase up to $6.5 billion of common equity through 1Q'15.

&lt;p&gt;UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A U.S. decision to not issue a visa for an Iranian official to allow him to become Iran's ambassador to the United Nations was "regrettable," a spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is a regrettable decision by the U.S. Administration which is in contravention of international law, the obligation of the host country and the inherent right of sovereign member states to designate their representatives to the United Nations," spokesman Hamid Babaei said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by James Dalgleish)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Patent buyer Intellectual Ventures has persuaded Microsoft and Sony to invest in its latest acquisition fund while Apple and Intel, which invested with IV previously, declined to participate, according to people briefed on the fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment decisions by four technology companies come in the midst of a heated debate over whether it is too easy for patent owners to extract large royalty payments, and whether patent buying firms spur or stifle innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year IV curtailed patent acquisitions as it sought new investors, and IV now is ramping up, say three sources familiar with IV's activity in the patent market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft and Sony's investments give IV a fresh war chest to buy new patents," said Kevin Jakel, chief executive of Unified Patents, which advises tech companies on alternatives to patent aggregators like IV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Apple and Intel's decision is significant because the biggest tech companies have supported IV in the past. "This would be a dramatic departure," Jakel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intellectual Ventures declined to discuss investments. Microsoft, Sony, Intel and Apple also would not comment. It is unclear whether Intel and Apple could still opt to invest in IV's vehicle at a later time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Created in 2000, Intellectual Ventures has raised about $6 billion and acquired 70,000 patents and other intellectual property assets. The company is seeking to raise $3 billion more, a 2013 investor presentation reviewed by Reuters shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years IV and other firms like it have faced criticism from some in the technology industry, who argue that firms like IV, which do not primarily make products, exploit the patent system by demanding royalties and threatening litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IV argues that by buying patents from inventors, it creates a mechanism for them to capitalize on their ideas. Several large tech companies previously invested in IV, which gave them low-cost licenses to IV's vast patent portfolios as well as a portion of royalties IV collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp, Sony Corp, Apple and Intel all invested in IV's previous funds, court filings show. Prior to co-founding IV, Nathan Myhrvold was chief technology officer at Microsoft working closely with Bill Gates. Another IV co-founder, Peter Detkin, was previously an Intel in-house lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IV's fundraising comes as a proposal to make it easier to fight patent lawsuits passed the House of Representatives last year and is currently pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some companies like Google Inc publicly supported the bill, which included a provision to make it easier for the winner of a patent lawsuit to recover legal fees. Google invested in IV's first fund in 2003 but has said it declined to participate in subsequent ventures. IV sued Google's Motorola Mobility unit in 2011, and that litigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Apple were among seven major corporations which warned last week against weakening the patent system and hurting innovative companies. Still, Microsoft reiterated on Friday that it "applauds" the pending bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy Landers, an intellectual property professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law, said Apple and Intel's decision on IV's latest fund was probably unrelated to the political debate on patent reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The companies that are not investing in the fund have probably just found better uses for their money," Landers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2012 the average rate of return for IV's 2003 fund was 16.2 percent, while the 2008 fund stood at 2.5 percent, according to the 2013 investor presentation. In a court filing last year, Intellectual Ventures said it has earned more than $3 billion to date in licensing fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patent buyers also are facing some competition from companies like Unified Patents, which argue that tech companies should try to invalidate threatening patents instead of just financing aggregators like IV to acquire them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there's a recognition by a lot of companies that simply trying to buy your way out of the problem is like bailing water from a sinking ship," Jakel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jakel declined to disclose whether any of the tech companies in this report are clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco and Reiji Murai in Tokyo, editing by Peter Henderson, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds Analysis and Breakingviews links, updates stock price)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry and Tanya Agrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co posted far
weaker-than-expected quarterly profit as uncertainty about the
U.S economy weighed on investor trading volumes and consumer
borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results from the first of the major Wall Street banks to
post earnings underscore how difficult the first quarter was for
the financial sector. JPMorgan's bond trading revenue plunged 21
percent, and mortgage lending revenue fell 84 percent from the
same quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the bank's big businesses, including commercial
lending and credit cards, delivered lower profits. But the bank
is not responding by dialing up its risk-taking in commercial
lending, and it views falling revenue in its bond trading
business as part of a business cycle instead of a symptom of a
broad-based and lasting decline in fixed-income trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not like selling cereal - it's not like your volumes
go up 2 percent every day," Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said to
reporters on a conference call. The business will grow over the
next decade or two, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who earned plaudits for keeping his bank consistently
profitable during the financial crisis, is struggling to figure
out how to navigate the current environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his annual letter to shareholders earlier this week,
Dimon noted that JPMorgan will have spent more than $2 billion
more than usual from 2012 through the end of this year on
complying with new rules, and devoted more than 1 million work
hours to meeting new mortgage rules. The bank's net income
dropped 16 percent last year due to massive legal settlements
and rising compliance costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday's results showed how the bank's troubles appear to be
extending beyond outsized legal settlements and meeting new
rules, and into areas more fundamental to the business, such as
loan demand and trading volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, net income fell 19 percent to $5.27 billion, or
$1.28 per share, from $6.53 billion, or $1.59 per share, in the
same quarter of 2013, the biggest U.S. bank said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.40 per
share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total net revenue fell 8.5 percent to $22.99 billion,
falling well short of the average estimate of $24.53 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares, which recently topped $61 to trade at their
highest level in 13 years, fell 3.1 percent to $55.63 in
afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORTGAGE LENDING FALLS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area where the bank is meeting with some success is
keeping costs under control, a crucial effort when future
revenues may be weak. JPMorgan said non-interest expenses fell 5
percent in the latest quarter to $14.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon is aiming to hold down overhead - which he defines as
non-interest expenses aside from litigation - to below an
average of $14.75 billion per quarter, or $59 billion for the
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortgage banking net income fell to $114 million in the
quarter, a drop of $559 million from the year-earlier period.
Production revenue, a measure of lending revenue, fell 84
percent to $161 million, and the bank made $17 billion of home
loans, a 68 percent decline from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. mortgage lending has cooled after rising rates in the
second half of last year have given fewer homeowners reason to
refinance their loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &amp; Co, the biggest U.S. home lender, also
reported results Friday and said its income from mortgage
banking fell 46 percent from a year earlier. 
Gains on one-time items, however, contributed to a higher-than
expected 14 percent rise in quarterly profit for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For JPMorgan, rising bond yields in the middle of last
year, which resulted from the Federal Reserve's decision to slow
down its bond buying program, also weighed on fixed income,
currency, and commodity trading revenue, which fell to $3.76
billion from $4.75 billion in the same quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial banking income fell 3 percent to $578 million,
hurt by declining revenue from making loans. Consumer credit and
debit card income fell 1 percent to $1.35 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said total assets
at the end of March stood at $2.48 trillion, up from $2.42
trillion at the end of December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm's supplementary leverage ratio, a measure of a
bank's capital compared with its assets, stood at 5.1 percent at
the end of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leverage ratios took on added importance on Tuesday when the
Federal Reserve approved new rules setting minimum levels that
could force the eight biggest U.S. banks to boost their capital
by a total of $68 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule sets a higher minimum of 6 percent for the
company's insured bank subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the rule was approved in its latest form, JPMorgan
had said it was on track to raise its ratio from 4.6 percent at
the end of December to the 5 percent minimum for its holding
company by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LITIGATION EXPENSES "IMMATERIAL"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said its litigation expenses were immaterial in the
latest quarter, under its "other corporate" accounting line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Litigation expenses totaled $347 million in the year-earlier
quarter and $847 million in the fourth-quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter two years ago, litigation costs totaled
$2.5 billion as the bank built up reserves in anticipation of
big legal settlements that it ultimately reached in 2013.   
JPMorgan paid more than $20 billion last year to resolve legal
claims stemming from a wide range of problems, including its
London Whale derivatives loss and its marketing of bad mortgage
securities before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's shares - which have nearly doubled in price since
the bank was rocked in 2012 by its London Whale derivatives
trading scandal and $6.2 billion loss - were trading at a
multiple of 9.56 times estimated forward earnings on Thursday.  
 That compares with 9.93 times for Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 and 11.38 times for Morgan Stanley, both of which
report next week.

&lt;p&gt;By Jeffrey Goldfarb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s&#160;clean sheet already looks off-white. For the first time in years, its quarterly earnings weren&#8217;t cluttered with special items like whale-trade losses or legal costs. The U.S. mega-bank&#8217;s $5.3 billion profit in the three months to March fell short of expectations anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the advent of the financial crisis, JPMorgan&#8217;s results have regularly been clouded by a tangled mess of one-time adjustments. Last quarter alone, for example, there were four worth at least $750 million apiece. This time around, there were none that approached anything of that scale. Cleaner, however, didn&#8217;t mean better for Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s bottom line shrank by a fifth from a year ago, due mostly to sharp drops in the fixed-income trading and mortgage businesses. Return on equity slipped 3 percentage points, to 10 percent, a level generally considered to be breakeven relative to a lender&#8217;s cost of capital. JPMorgan&#8217;s shares also dipped as much as 3.5 percent, keeping them only just above the bank&#8217;s book value of $54.05 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wheeling and dealing in bonds and currencies can be pretty choppy, so until JPMorgan&#8217;s Wall Street rivals disclose their first-quarter results it won&#8217;t be clear whether the bank&#8217;s 21 percent year-on-year slide in fixed income trading revenue makes it a laggard. In home loans, though, Wells Fargo, which also reported first-quarter earnings on Friday, looked stronger. And JPMorgan&#8217;s earnings fell short of expectations for the third consecutive quarter, according to Barclays, after beating forecasts in 17 of the previous 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon reckons the worst of JPMorgan&#8217;s legal troubles are behind it. He also is getting a chance to reshape his inner circle after the departure of two more deputies, Mike Cavanagh and Blythe Masters. And yet he hardly sounds enthusiastic about the new beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a call with journalists, the often voluble Dimon declined to weigh in on the renewed debate over high-frequency trading even though JPMorgan is portrayed positively in Michael Lewis&#8217;s book, &#8220;Flash Boys.&#8221; And when asked if he was having fun, Dimon could only muster a terse affirmative. To be fair, broader market conditions were a drag in the first quarter. Both the CEO and his investors will be hoping JPMorgan can make more of the fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Wall Street's biggest banks report quarterly earnings this week and next, many will also offer a tiny glimpse into the scale of their commodity trading activity through a measure of trading risk called VaR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), the first to report, said on Friday its commodity markets Value-at-Risk (VaR) fell to its lowest in nine years in the first quarter of 2014 as it prepared to complete the sale of its physical commodities business. On March 19, it an announced a $3.5 billion deal to sell it to the Switzerland-based trading house Mercuria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, Wall Street banks group their commodities revenue under the fixed income category and do not break out the sector, often leaving VaR as a key risk-reward indicator that can measure commodities exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Louie Sussman)&lt;/p&gt;

			Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers Academy Celebrates 10 Years of 
      Invigorating Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Education
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        ExxonMobil and PGA golfer Phil Mickelson collaborate for 10 years to 
        improve math and science education through professional development 
        program for teachers
      
			
        500 elementary school teachers selected to attend one of three 
        Academies this summer
      
			
        The initiative has trained more than 4,100 teachers, impacting more 
        than 290,000 students
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      What can a simple egg drop teach a group of elementary school teachers 
      about force and motion? How can rolling marbles down tables illustrate 
      the impact mass has on movement? This summer, 500 teachers from all 50 
      states and the District of Columbia will learn the answers to these 
      questions and more, as they attend the 10th-annual Mickelson 
      ExxonMobil Teachers Academy held in Jersey City, NJ, Pittsburgh, PA, 
      and Houston, TX.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Academy, a partnership between PGA golfer Phil Mickelson, his wife 
      Amy, and ExxonMobil, 
      is an intensive, one-week, all-expenses-paid professional development 
      program that shows teachers how to put a fresh spin on classic math and 
      science concepts using fun, hands-on experiments. Teachers leave the 
      Academy equipped with new lessons, ready to encourage a lifelong love of 
      STEM&#8212;science, technology, engineering and math. Since its inception, 
      more than 4,100 teachers have been trained at the Academy, impacting the 
      lives of more than 290,000 students nationwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Academy gave me the skills and confidence needed to inspire 
      students to become interested in science and math,&#8221; said Zohar 
      Badenhausen, a teacher from Massachusetts who attended the Academy in 
      2013. &#8220;Using the real-world ideas and skills from the Mickelson 
      ExxonMobil Teachers Academy, I have been able to engage and excite my 
      students, spurring a new found and energized interest in STEM.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mickelson frequently talks about the importance of science in golf, 
      using calculations of force, motion, angles and distance to excel at the 
      game. &#8220;Amy and I are extremely proud of this Academy milestone, and one 
      of the highlights of our summer is visiting with and seeing first-hand 
      the impact this program has made on teachers across the country,&#8221; he 
      said. &#8220;We know interest in STEM subjects starts at an early age, and 
      we&#8217;re committed to training teachers to ignite a lifelong learning for 
      these important subjects.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the 10 years that the Academy has been supporting teachers in math 
      and science training, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 
      jobs for aerospace engineers increased by 112 percent, civil engineers 
      increased by 60 percent and chemical engineers increased by 37 percent. 
      Studies show that eight of the 10 fastest-growing job sectors require 
      math and science skills.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Through innovative learning techniques, the Academy equips teachers 
      with the tools and strategies to increase their students&#8217; interest and 
      excitement about math and science, helping to develop future scientists 
      and engineers,&#8221; said Suzanne McCarron, Exxon Mobil Corporation's general 
      manager of public and government affairs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Academy also announced today the names of the 150 teachers selected 
      to attend the national Academy in Jersey City, NJ. Teachers were 
      selected by a panel of educators from the National 
      Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the National 
      Science Teachers Association from more than 1,000 applications 
      submitted through www.sendmyteacher.com. 
      Teachers were chosen based on their qualifications, dedication to 
      inspiring students at an early age and overall commitment to enhancing 
      the teaching profession. The additional 350 teachers are selected in 
      conjunction with their local school districts and will be attending 
      Academies in Houston and Pittsburgh.

      The Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers Academy is part of ExxonMobil&#8217;s 
      long-term commitment to education. The company supports initiatives that 
      encourage students to take an active interest in math and science 
      careers, support the professional development of highly qualified 
      teachers and promote involvement by women and minority students.

 (Updates to open, adds data)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little
changed on Friday, as biotech stocks staged a rebound from a
selloff in the prior session, but disappointing earnings from
JPMorgan curbed gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co shares fell 3 percent to $55.66
as the biggest drag on the S 500 after it reported a far
weaker-than-expected quarterly profit as revenue from securities
trading fell. The S financial index lost 0.7 percent
as the worst performing S sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's not helping matters," said Ken Polcari, director of
the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York. "At
the moment that is going to prevent us from really rallying, if
anything it is going to cause more pressure as we go into the
end of the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Wells Fargo &amp; Co, the biggest U.S.
mortgage lender, reported a 14 percent rise in first-quarter net
profit as costs fell. Its shares gained 1.6 percent to $48.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S 500 companies' first-quarter earnings are projected to
have increased just 0.9 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters
data showed. That's down sharply from the start of the year,
when profit growth was estimated at 6.5 percent. Investors will
be looking at the impact of harsh winter weather on
first-quarter earnings, and signs of optimism for the second
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another sharp selloff in biotech and momentum names on
Thursday sent the Nasdaq to its worst decline since Nov.
9, 2011 and the benchmark S index to its biggest fall
since Feb 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After showing initial weakness Friday, biotechs rebounded,
with the Nasdaq biotech index up 1.1 percent after it
entered bear market territory earlier in the session, falling
more than 20 percent from its high on Feb 25. Shares of Gilead
Sciences Inc rose 3.8 percent to $68.02.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pendulum always swings too far to the left, so like
everything you might get a little more pressure, I don't think
you will see a 50 percent or 40 percent correction in some of
these names, 20 percent or 25 percent might be what you get,"
said Polcari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equities have been volatile this week, with Thursday's move
a sharp reversal from gains Wednesday after minutes from the
latest Federal Reserve policymakers' meeting suggested members
were more likely to keep rates low than previously expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CBOE Volatility index is up nearly 17 percent for
the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the recent declines, investors appear committed to
equities. Data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper service on Thursday
showed investors in U.S.-based funds poured $8.9 billion into
stock funds in the week ended April 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average fell 29.89 points or
0.18 percent, to 16,140.33, the S 500 gained 0.11
points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,833.19 and the Nasdaq Composite
 added 11.216 points, or 0.28 percent, to 4,065.322.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the week, the Dow is down 1.7 percent, the S is down
1.8 percent and the Nasdaq is down 1.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since reaching a record intraday high on April 4, the S
has fallen as much as 4.1 percent, while the Nasdaq has dropped
8.3 percent from its March 6 intraday high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seasonally adjusted producer price index for final
demand increased 0.5 percent last month, the largest increase in
nine months after slipping 0.1 percent in February, pointing to
some pockets of inflation at the factory gate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary
April reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment came in
at 82.6, the highest since July, compared with the final reading
of 80.0 in March, as both current conditions and expectations
brightened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gap Inc lost 1.5 percent to $38.72 after the
retailer posted its March sales results. The S retail index
 shed 0.3 percent.

      Research and Markets: Global Pet Care Market 2014-2018 with Del Monte, 
      Mars, Nestl&#233;  Procter  Gamble Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/f72hv5/global_pet_care) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Pet Care Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Pet Care Market will grow at a CAGR of 4.64% over the period 
      2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the past, the majority of pet food sales were generated from big 
      retail grocery chains and pet stores. However, nowadays, a number of 
      retailers stock private label pet food that is more profitable than 
      branded pet food. The major reasons for this are less costs incurred in 
      producing and selling private label products and ease in supply and 
      distribution. Moreover, private label products are cheaper than national 
      brands, thereby attracting new customers in emerging markets. Therefore, 
      the rise in supermarkets and hypermarkets is likely to lead to an 
      increase in the sales of private label pet care brands, which will in 
      turn, propel the growth of the Global Pet Care market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the Global Pet Care market is driven by several 
      factors of which growing urbanization is very important. In the recent 
      past, developed and developing countries have been witnessing rapid 
      urbanization, which has led to an increase in the disposable income of 
      the urban population. This has led to an increase in spending on pet 
      care products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that pets often face health problems that are 
      a matter of serious concern for their owners. One of the common problems 
      faced by pets is obesity, especially in dogs and cats. On average, one 
      out of five pets is obese because of the increased consumption of 
      packaged food products. Further, it has been observed that some pets get 
      addicted to packaged food and completely avoid home-cooked food, 
      resulting in side effects. Additionally, arthritis and heart disease are 
      some of the other increasing health problems faced by aging pets, thus, 
      restricting people from adopting pets. Therefore, health problems in 
      pets pose a significant challenge to the Global Pet Care market.

      Fitch Upgrades One and Downgrades Two Classes of J.P. Morgan 2001-CIBC3
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has upgraded one, downgraded two, and affirmed three 
      classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. 
      2001-CIBC3 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A detailed 
      list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The upgrade to the class G notes reflects the expected continued paydown 
      due to amortization and liquidation proceeds from a specially serviced 
      loan, as well as defeased collateral supporting the notes. The 
      downgrades are a result of realized losses on the class J and K notes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 25.1% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 4.2%, including $32.6 million (3.8% of 
      the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has 
      designated four loans (39.7%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 
      one specially serviced asset (25.2%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the March 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 97% to $15.3 million from $867.5 million at 
      issuance. Two loans (37.8%) are currently defeased. Interest shortfalls 
      are currently affecting classes L through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to loss is an 85,443 square foot mixed-used 
      property (25.2%) located in Waterford, MI. The loan transferred to the 
      special servicer due to declining performance of the property after 
      occupancy declined from 99% at securitization to 65.6% before the 
      transfer. Occupancy at the property was 48% at year-end 2013. Fitch 
      expects a significant loss on the loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings on the class G and H notes are expected to be stable as the 
      credit enhancement remains high and the transaction is expected to 
      continue to delever.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has taken the following actions as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.3 million class G upgraded to 'AAAsf' from 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$6.5 million class H affirmed at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$6.4 million class J downgraded to 'Dsf' from 'CCCsf'; RE 40%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Class K downgraded to 'Dsf' from 'Csf'; RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Class L affirmed at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Class M affirmed at 'Dsf'; RE 0%.

			Pfizer&#8217;s Ian Read Becomes PhRMA Board Chairman; Ken Frazier, George 
      Scangos Assume New Posts
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ian C. Read, chairman and CEO of Pfizer, Inc, was elected chairman of 
      the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) today 
      at the trade association&#8217;s annual meeting. Also elected were Kenneth C. 
      Frazier, chairman, president and CEO of Merck  Co, Inc., as 
      chairman-elect of the PhRMA Board of Directors, and George A. Scangos, 
      Ph.D., CEO of Biogen Idec, as Board treasurer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Read succeeds Robert J. Hugin, chairman and CEO of Celgene 
      Corporation, as PhRMA&#8217;s chairman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Bob Hugin is a true champion of the value that innovative medicines 
      deliver to patients, public health and our economy. Over the past year, 
      his tireless efforts to create new dialogues with partners in the 
      patient community and enthusiasm for better conveying the value of our 
      sector have greatly enhanced our advocacy for forward-looking policies 
      that promote innovation and provide patient access to new medicines,&#8221; 
      said PhRMA President and CEO John J. Castellani.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At a time when collaborative medical science and healthcare delivery in 
      the U.S. and around the world are rapidly evolving, we are fortunate to 
      have Ian Read as chairman,&#8221; Castellani added. &#8220;His vision for the future 
      of our healthcare system will help guide PhRMA as we embark on the many 
      challenges and opportunities ahead.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Read is the Chairman and CEO of Pfizer. He began his career with 
      Pfizer in 1978 as an operational auditor. Mr. Read worked in Latin 
      America through 1995, in roles including Chief Financial Officer, Pfizer 
      Mexico, and Country Manager, Pfizer Brazil. In 1996, he was appointed 
      president of Pfizer&#8217;s International Pharmaceuticals Group, with 
      responsibility for Latin America and Canada. He became Executive Vice 
      President, Europe, in 2000, and was named a Corporate Vice President in 
      2001, assuming responsibility for Canada, in addition to Europe, in 
      2002. Mr. Read later became accountable for operations in both the 
      Africa/Middle East region and Latin America. In 2006, he became senior 
      vice president, Pfizer, and Group President of the Worldwide 
      Biopharmaceutical Businesses, which he led through December 2010. In 
      that role, he oversaw five global business units &#8212; Primary Care, 
      Specialty Care, Oncology, Established Products and Emerging Markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our highest priority and purpose as an industry is to deliver 
      life-saving medicines to those who need them most. We are poised to 
      enter another golden era of innovation, transforming the way we do 
      research and development to speed the discovery of innovative new 
      medicines,&#8221; Mr. Read said. &#8220;To be successful in our purpose, we must 
      have a reputation that ensures the full support of all segments of civil 
      society. We are judged, ultimately, by our actions and we must work hard 
      to earn the trust and respect of our regulators, legislators, healthcare 
      professionals, RD partners and most importantly the patients who depend 
      on us, now and into the future.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Mr. Frazier is chairman and CEO of Merck  Co. Previously he served as 
      president of Merck with responsibility for the company&#8217;s three major 
      divisions: Global Human Health, Merck&#8217;s sales and marketing division for 
      pharmaceutical and vaccine products; Merck Manufacturing, the company&#8217;s 
      manufacturing and supply division; and Merck Research Laboratories, 
      Merck&#8217;s research organization. Mr. Frazier held a broad range of senior 
      management positions since joining Merck in 1992 as vice president, 
      general counsel and secretary of the Astra Merck Group. He received his 
      Bachelor&#8217;s degree from Pennsylvania State University and holds a J.D. 
      from Harvard Law School.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The outstanding contributions being made to society by the 
      biopharmaceutical companies who make up PhRMA&#8217;s membership inspire me 
      every day. I am enthusiastic about my new responsibilities and look 
      forward to supporting PhRMA&#8217;s ongoing efforts to advance healthcare for 
      patients, caregivers and society,&#8221; Mr. Frazier said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dr. Scangos was appointed CEO of Biogen Idec in June 2010. He joined 
      Biogen Idec from Exelixis, Inc., where he served as president and CEO 
      since October 1996. From 1987 to 1996, Dr. Scangos held various 
      positions at Bayer, Inc., including SVP of RD, and president of Bayer 
      Biotechnology, where he was responsible for research, business 
      development, process development, manufacturing, engineering and quality 
      assurance of Bayer&#8217;s recombinant products. Before joining Bayer in 1987, 
      Dr. Scangos was Professor of Biology at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. 
      Scangos received a B.A. in Biology from Cornell University, and a Ph.D. 
      from the University of Massachusetts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are entering an era of medical innovation that offers a real chance 
      to find therapies for some of the most challenging diseases, from 
      Alzheimer&#8217;s, to ALS, to many of the cancers that now have few or no 
      treatments. Success will require not only superior science but also 
      sound public policy. I look forward to working with my industry 
      colleagues, policymakers, and others toward a world where patients can 
      reap the full promise of what our industry has to offer,&#8221; said Dr. 
      Scangos.

 (Adds data, Wells Fargo earnings, updates prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set for a
lower open on Friday after earnings from JP Morgan Chase,
putting the S 500 on track to continue its selloff after
suffering its biggest drop in two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co shares fell 3.6 percent to
$55.35 in premarket after it reported a far weaker-than-expected
quarterly profit as revenue from securities trading fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Wells Fargo &amp; Co, the biggest U.S. mortgage
lender, reported a 14 percent rise in first-quarter net profit
as costs fell. Its shares slipped 1 cent to $47.70 in premarket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* S 500 companies' first-quarter earnings are projected to
have increased just 1 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters
data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the
year, when profit growth was estimated at 6.5 percent. Investors
will be looking at the impact of harsh winter weather on
first-quarter earnings, and signs of optimism for the
second-quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Another sharp selloff in biotech and momentum names on
Thursday sent the Nasdaq to its worst decline since Nov.
9, 2011 and the benchmark S index to its biggest fall
since Feb 3. Shares of Gilead Sciences Inc lost 1.7
percent to $54.35 in premarket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Equities have been volatile this week, with Thursday's
move a sharp reversal from gains on Wednesday after minutes from
the latest Federal Reserve policymakers' meeting suggested
members were more likely to keep rates low than previously
expected. The CBOE Volatility index is up nearly 14
percent for the week, closing at its highest level since March
14 on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* S 500 e-mini futures were down 9 points and below
fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into
account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures lost 77
points and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 26 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* For the week, the Dow is down 1.5 percent, the S is down
1.7 percent and the Nasdaq is down 1.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The seasonally adjusted producer price index for final
demand increased 0.5 percent last month, the largest increase in
nine months after slipping 0.1 percent in February, pointing to
some pockets of inflation at the factory gate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* At 9:55 a.m. (1355 GM), the preliminary Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment for
March is due. Estimates call for a reading of 81 versus the 80
in the prior month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Gap Inc lost 3.8 percent to $37.81 before the
opening bell after the retailer posted its March sales results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Datawatch Corp tumbled 27.6 percent to $15 in
premarket after the software company gave its second-quarter
outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* U.S. tax preparer H Block Inc said it would sell
its bank unit to BofI Federal Bank, freeing the company
from Federal Reserve oversight. H Block shares gained 7
percent to $30.40 while BofI Holdings climbed 10.5 percent to
$82.28 before the opening bell.

      Research and Markets: Global Pain Management Drugs Market 2014-2018 with 
      Abbott Labs, Eli Lilly, Endo Health Solutions, Pfizer  Purdue Pharma 
      Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/7jfkk5/global_pain) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Pain Management Drugs Market 2014-2018 with Abbott Labs, Eli Lilly, Endo 
      health Solutions, Pfizer  Purdue Pharma Dominating" report 
      to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Pain Management Drugs market will grow at a CAGR of 3.84 
      percent over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the main drivers in this market is the increase in global aging 
      population. The rise in aging population has consequently led to an 
      increase in the incidence of diseases such as chronic arthritis, 
      diabetic neuropathy, osteoarthritis, and cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RD activities are increasing due to the strong need for new efficacious 
      and better-tolerated medications. Developing better pain treatments is 
      the main goal of all pain research being conducted by various 
      institutes. Morphine is one such drug that works through the body's 
      natural pain-killing machinery, preventing pain messages from reaching 
      the brain. Patients receiving morphine also face the problem of morphine 
      tolerance. Scientists are working toward the development of a 
      morphine-like drug that will have the pain-deadening qualities of 
      morphine but without the drug's negative side effects, such as sedation 
      and the potential for addiction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the main challenges is the 
      increase in generic competition. The patent expiry of a drug results in 
      the loss of the exclusive market for that drug, leading to a rapid 
      decline in sales.

&lt;p&gt;April 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co reported a
19 percent decline in first-quarter profit as revenue from
securities trading fell in a climate of uncertainty about the
strength of the economic recovery and the Federal Reserve's
intentions on interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell to $5.27 billion, or $1.28 per share, from
$6.53 billion, or $1.59 per share, in the same quarter of 2013,
the biggest U.S. bank said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.40 per
share. It was not immediately clear if the reported results were
comparable. As last year, the results included special items.

      JPMorgan&#160;Chase  Co. (NYSE:JPM) today reported net income for the first 
      quarter of 2014 of $5.3 billion, compared with net income of $6.5 
      billion in the first quarter of 2013. Earnings per share were $1.28, 
      compared with $1.59 in the first quarter of 2013. Revenue1 
      for the quarter was $23.9 billion, down 8% compared with the prior year. 
      The Firm&#8217;s return on tangible common equity1 for the first 
      quarter of 2014 was 13%, compared with 17% in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As previously announced, the Board of Directors intends to increase the 
      second-quarter common stock dividend to $0.40 per share3 from 
      the current $0.38 per share; and the Board has also authorized the Firm 
      to repurchase $6.5 billion of common equity commencing within the second 
      quarter of this year through the end of the first quarter of 2015. 
      During the first quarter of 2014, the Firm repurchased $0.4 billion of 
      common equity. The Federal Reserve Board informed the Firm that it does 
      not object to the Firm&#8217;s proposed 2014 capital distribution plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the 
      financial results: &#8220;JPMorgan Chase had a good start to the year, given 
      there were industry-wide headwinds in Markets and Mortgage. Consumer  
      Community Banking deposit growth and card sales volume both remain above 
      the industry average2, and we have made significant progress 
      in Business Banking originations &#8211; up 22%. The Corporate  Investment 
      Bank was #1 in Global IB fees, with #1 positions in global debt and 
      equity, global syndicated loans and global long-term debt. Gross 
      investment banking revenue with Commercial Banking clients was up 31%. 
      Asset Management had its twentieth consecutive quarter of positive net 
      long-term client flows and had record loan balances, up 20%.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon continued: &#8220;We have growing confidence in the economy &#8211; consumers, 
      corporations and middle market companies are in increasingly good 
      financial shape and housing has turned the corner in most markets &#8211; and 
      we are doing our part to support the recovery. JPMorgan Chase provided 
      credit and raised capital of over $450 billion for our clients during 
      the first quarter of 2014, which included $5 billion for U.S. small 
      businesses.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon concluded: &#8220;As I said in my letter to shareholders this week, we 
      will dedicate extraordinary effort in 2014 adapting to the new global 
      financial architecture, and we will continue to make significant 
      progress on our control agenda. We face the future with a strong 
      foundation, a fortress balance sheet and excellent franchises built to 
      serve our clients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $1.9 billion, a decrease of $650 million, or 25%, 
      compared with the prior year, due to lower net revenue and higher 
      provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest 
      expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $10.5 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion, or 10%, 
      compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $7.0 billion, down 
      $183 million, or 3%, driven by spread compression in Credit Card, Auto 
      and Consumer  Business Banking, and by lower mortgage warehouse 
      balances, largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue 
      was $3.4&#160;billion, a decrease of $972 million, or 22%, driven by lower 
      mortgage fees and related income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $816&#160;million, compared with 
      $549&#160;million in the prior year and $72&#160;million in the prior quarter.&#160;The 
      current-quarter provision reflected a $450 million reduction in the 
      allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $1.3 billion. The 
      prior-quarter provision reflected a $1.2&#160;billion reduction in the 
      allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $1.3 billion. The 
      prior-year provision reflected a $1.2&#160;billion reduction in the allowance 
      for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $1.7 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $6.4&#160;billion, a decrease of $353&#160;million, or 5%, 
      from the prior year, driven by lower Mortgage Banking expense.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Mortgage Banking net income was $114 million, a decrease of $559 
      million from the prior year, driven by lower net revenue and lower 
      benefit from the provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower 
      noninterest expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $1.6 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion compared with 
      the prior year. Net interest income was $1.1 billion, a decrease of $117 
      million, or 10%, driven by lower warehouse balances as well as lower 
      loan balances due to portfolio runoff. Noninterest revenue was $511 
      million, a decrease of $1.0&#160;billion, driven by lower mortgage fees and 
      related income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $23 million2, 
      compared with a benefit of $198 million in the prior year. The current 
      quarter reflected a $200 million reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and 
      delinquencies. The prior year included a $650 million reduction in the 
      allowance for loan losses. Net charge-offs were $177 million, compared 
      with $452 million in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion, a decrease of $403 million, or 
      22%, from the prior year, due to lower headcount-related expense in 
      production and servicing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mortgage Production pretax loss was $58&#160;million, a 
      decrease of $485 million from the prior year, reflecting lower revenue, 
      partially offset by lower expense and lower repurchase losses. Mortgage 
      production-related revenue, excluding repurchase losses, was $292 
      million, a decrease of $926 million, from the prior year and $202 
      million from the prior quarter, largely reflecting lower volumes. 
      Production expense2 was $478 million, a decrease of 
      $232&#160;million from the prior year, predominantly due to lower 
      headcount-related expense; and a decrease of $511 million from the prior 
      quarter, predominantly due to the absence of non-MBS related legal 
      expense. Repurchase losses for the current quarter reflected a benefit 
      of $128 million, compared with losses of $81 million in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mortgage Servicing pretax loss was $270 million, compared 
      with a pretax loss of $101 million in the prior year, reflecting a 
      higher MSR risk management loss, largely offset by lower expenses. 
      Mortgage net servicing-related revenue was $713 million, a decrease of 
      $65 million from the prior year. MSR risk management was a loss of $401 
      million, which includes a negative $460 million fair value adjustment 
      primarily related to higher capital allocated to the business, compared 
      with a MSR risk management loss of $142 million in the prior year. 
      Servicing expense2 was $582 million, a decrease of $155 
      million from the prior year, reflecting lower headcount-related expense.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $837 million, a decrease of $108&#160;million, or 11%, from 
      the prior year. This decrease was largely due to lower net interest 
      income resulting from lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff.

		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $26 million, compared 
      with a benefit of $202&#160;million in the prior year. The current-quarter 
      provision reflected a $200 million reduction in the non credit-impaired 
      allowance for loan losses, reflecting continued improvement in home 
      prices and delinquencies. The prior-year provision included a $650 
      million reduction in the allowance for loan losses from the non 
      credit-impaired allowance. Net charge-offs were $174&#160;million, compared

      net charge-off rate1). Net recoveries of prime mortgage, 
      including option ARMs, were $7&#160;million (0.06% net recovery rate1), 
      compared with net charge-offs of $44 million (0.43% net charge-off rate1).

		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $346&#160;million, a decrease of $17&#160;million, or 5%, 
      compared with the prior year, driven by lower foreclosed asset expense, 
      partially offset by higher professional fees.

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $2.0&#160;billion, down 24% compared with $2.6 billion in the 
      prior year. These results primarily reflected lower revenue, partially 
      offset by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $8.6 billion, down 
      15% compared with $10.1 billion in the prior year. Excluding the impact 
      of a debit valuation adjustment (&#8220;DVA&#8221;) gain of $126 million in the 
      prior year, net revenue was down 14% from $10.0 billion in the prior 
      year, and net income was down 22% from $2.5 billion in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Banking revenue was $2.7 billion, down 8% from the prior year. 
      Investment banking fees were $1.4 billion, up 1% from the prior year. 
      The increase was driven by higher advisory fees of $383&#160;million, up 50% 
      from the prior year on strong wallet share of completed transactions, as 
      well as higher equity underwriting fees of $353 million, up 29% from the 
      prior year on higher industry-wide wallet levels. These were partially 
      offset by lower debt underwriting fees of $708 million, down 22% from 
      the prior year reflecting lower industry-wide volumes of high-yield bond 
      underwriting and loan syndications. Treasury Services revenue was $1.0 
      billion, down 3% compared with the prior year driven by lower trade 
      finance revenue as well as the impact of business simplification 
      initiatives. Lending revenue was $284&#160;million, a decline from $498 
      million in the prior year primarily due to lower gains on securities 
      received from restructured loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Markets  Investor Services revenue was $5.9 billion, down 18% from the 
      prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue of $3.8 billion was down 21% 
      from the prior year on weaker performance across most products and lower 
      levels of client activity compared to a stronger prior year. Equity 
      Markets revenue of $1.3 billion was down 3% compared with the prior 
      year, on lower derivatives revenue. Securities Services revenue was $1.0 
      billion, up 4% from the prior year primarily driven by higher net 
      interest income on higher deposits and higher asset-based custody fees. 
      Credit Adjustments  Other revenue was a loss of $197 million driven by 
      losses on net credit valuation adjustments (&#8220;CVA&#8221;) as well as losses, 
      net of hedges, related to funding valuation adjustments/DVA; prior year 
      revenue was a gain of $99 million, mainly driven by DVA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $49 million, compared with $11 
      million in the prior year. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to 
      period-end loans retained was 1.23%, compared with 1.11% in the prior 
      year. Excluding the impact of the consolidation of Firm-administered 
      multi-seller conduits and trade finance loans, the ratio of the 
      allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained1 was 
      2.18%, compared with 2.17% in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $5.6 billion, down 8% from the prior year, 
      primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation. The 
      compensation ratio
			was 33%.

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $578 million, a decrease of $18 million, or 3%, compared 
      with the prior year, reflecting an increase in noninterest expense and 
      lower net revenue, partially offset by a lower provision for credit 
      losses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $1.7&#160;billion, a decrease of $22 million, or 1%, compared 
      with the prior year. Net interest income was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 
      $45 million, or 4%, compared with the prior year, reflecting spread 
      compression, higher funding costs on loan products, and lower purchase 
      discounts recognized on loan repayments, partially offset by higher loan 
      balances. Noninterest revenue was $558&#160;million, an increase of $23 
      million, or 4%, compared with the prior year, driven by higher 
      investment banking fees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $698 million, a decrease of $55 
      million, or 7%, compared with the prior year. Revenue from Corporate 
      Client Banking was $446&#160;million, an increase of $13 million, or 3%, 
      compared with the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending was 
      $308 million, an increase of $17 million, or 6%, compared with the prior 
      year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $116&#160;million, an increase of 
      $4 million, or 4%, compared with the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $5 million, compared with $39 
      million in the prior year. Net recoveries were $14 million (0.04% net 
      recovery rate), compared with net recoveries of $7 million (0.02% net 
      recovery rate) in the prior year and net charge-offs of $25&#160;million 
      (0.07% net charge-off rate) in the prior quarter. The allowance for loan 
      losses to period-end loans retained was 1.95%, down from 2.05% in the 
      prior year and down from 1.97% in the prior quarter. Nonaccrual loans 
      were $485&#160;million, down $184 million, or 28%, from the prior year, and 
      down by $29 million, or 6%, from the prior quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $686 million, up 7% compared with the prior 
      year, largely reflecting higher control and headcount-related2 
      expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $441&#160;million, a decrease of $46 million, or 9%, from the 
      prior year, reflecting higher noninterest expense, largely offset by 
      higher net revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $2.8&#160;billion, an increase of $125&#160;million, or 5%, from 
      the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $2.2&#160;billion, up $124 million, 
      or 6%, from the prior year, due to net client inflows and the effect of 
      higher market levels, partially offset by lower valuations of seed 
      capital investments. Net interest income was $560&#160;million, up 
      $1&#160;million, or flat to the prior year, due to higher loan and deposit 
      balances, predominantly offset by narrower loan spreads.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenue from Private Banking was $1.5 billion, up 4% compared with the 
      prior year. Revenue from Institutional was $500 million, down 12%. 
      Retail was $769&#160;million, up 20%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Client assets were $2.4 trillion, an increase of $223&#160;billion, or 10%, 
      compared with the prior year. Assets under management were $1.6 
      trillion, an increase of $165 billion, or 11%, from the prior year, due 
      to the effect of higher market levels and net inflows to long-term 
      products. Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were 
      $746&#160;billion, up $58&#160;billion, or 8%, from the prior year, due to the 
      effect of higher market levels and custody inflows, partially offset by 
      brokerage outflows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $9 million, compared 
      with a provision for credit losses of $21 million in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $2.1 billion, an increase of $199 million, or 
      11%, from the prior year, primarily due to higher headcount-related2 
      expense and costs related to the control agenda.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        For the 12 months ended March 31, 2014, assets under management 
        reflected net inflows of $72 billion, driven by net inflows of $80 
        billion to long-term products and net outflows of $8 billion from 
        liquidity products. For the quarter, net inflows were $14 billion, 
        driven by net inflows of $20 billion to long-term products and net 
        outflows of $6 billion from liquidity products.

      Net income was $340 million, compared with net income of $250 million in 
      the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Private Equity reported net income of $215 million, compared with a net 
      loss of $182 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $363 million, 
      compared with a loss of $276 million in the prior year, primarily due to 
      net valuation gains on public and private investments and gains from 
      sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $94 million, compared with net 
      income of $24 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $2 million, 
      compared with $113 million in the prior year. Current-quarter net 
      interest income was a loss of $87 million, compared with a loss of $472 
      million in the prior year, reflecting the benefit of higher interest 
      rates and reinvestment opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other Corporate reported net income of $219 million, compared with net 
      income of $408 million in the prior year. The current quarter included 
      an after tax impact of approximately $90 million for writing down 
      deferred tax assets following New York State tax law changes enacted 
      March 31, 2014. The prior year included an after-tax benefit of $227 
      million for tax adjustments.

      (*) Presented on a managed basis. See notes on page 12 for further 
      explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled 
      $22,993 million, $23,156 million, and $25,122 million for the first 
      quarter of 2014, fourth quarter of 2013, and first quarter of 2013, 
      respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $5.3 billion, down $1.3 billion from the prior year. The 
      decrease was driven by lower net revenue and higher provision for credit 
      losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $23.9 billion, down $2.0 billion, or 8%, compared with 
      the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $13.0 billion, down $1.8 
      billion, or 12%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was 
      $10.9 billion, down $202 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year, 
      reflecting the impact of lower loan yields and lower trading and 
      investment securities balances, predominantly offset by higher 
      investment securities yields, lower long term debt and deposit interest 
      expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $850 million, up $233 million from 
      the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $807 
      million, compared with $545 million in the prior year. The 
      current-quarter consumer provision reflected a $449 million reduction in 
      the allowance for loan losses, compared to a $1.1 billion reduction in 
      the prior year. The current-quarter consumer allowance release primarily 
      reflects lower estimated losses in the mortgage and credit card 
      portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, compared with 
      $1.7 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 
      1.42% and 1.92%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses 
      was $43 million, compared with $72 million in the prior year. Wholesale 
      net charge-offs were $13 million, compared with net charge-offs of $35 
      million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.02% 
      and 0.05%, respectively. The Firm&#8217;s allowance for loan losses to 
      period-end loans retained1 was 1.75%, compared with 2.27% in 
      the prior year. The Firm&#8217;s nonperforming assets totaled $9.5 billion, 
      down from the prior quarter and prior year levels of $9.7 billion and 
      $11.7 billion, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $14.6 billion, down $787 million, or 5%, 
      compared with the prior year, primarily driven by lower 
      performance-based compensation in CIB and lower mortgage production and 
      servicing expense.

          In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, 
          management reviews the Firm's consolidated results and the results 
          of the lines of business on a &#8220;managed&#8221; basis, which is a non-GAAP 
          financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts 
          with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain 
          reclassifications to present total consolidated net revenue for the 
          Firm (and for each of the business segments) on a fully 
          taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. Accordingly, revenue from 
          investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is 
          presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
          securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows 
          management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both 
          taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact 
          related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. 
          These adjustments have no impact on consolidated net income/(loss) 
          as reported by the Firm or on net income/(loss) as reported by the 
          lines of business.

          The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans 
          excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans 
          held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) loans; and the 
          allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real 
          Estate Portfolios net charge-offs and net charge-off rates exclude 
          the impact of PCI loans.

          Tangible common equity (&#8220;TCE&#8221;) and return on tangible common equity 
          (&#8220;ROTCE&#8221;) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the 
          Firm&#8217;s common stockholders&#8217; equity (i.e., total stockholders&#8217; equity 
          less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible 
          assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. 
          ROTCE measures the Firm&#8217;s earnings as a percentage of TCE. TCE and 
          ROTCE are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, 
          in assessing the Firm&#8217;s use of equity, as well as facilitating 
          comparisons of the Firm with competitors.

          Tier 1 common capital and the Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel 
          III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules are each non-GAAP financial 
          measures. Additionally, the supplemental leverage ratio (&#8220;SLR&#8221;) 
          under Basel III rules is a non-GAAP financial measure. These 
          measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and 
          analysts to assess and monitor the Firm&#8217;s capital position. For 
          additional information on Tier 1 common and the Tier 1 common ratio

          The CIB provides non-GAAP financial measures, as such measures are 
          used by management to assess the underlying performance of the 
          business and for comparability with peers.
        
			
		
		
			
        The ratio for the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans is 
        calculated excluding the impact of consolidated Firm-administered 
        multi-seller conduits and trade finance loans, to provide a more 
        meaningful assessment of CIB&#8217;s allowance coverage ratio.
      
			
        Prior to January 1, 2014, the CIB provided non-GAAP financial measures 
        excluding the impact of FVA (effective fourth quarter 2013) and DVA on 
        net revenue and net income. Beginning in the first quarter 2014, the 
        Firm did not exclude FVA and DVA from its assessment of business 
        performance; however, the Firm continued to present these non-GAAP 
        measures for the periods prior to January 1, 2014, as they reflected 
        how management assessed the underlying business performance of the CIB 
        in those prior periods.

          Asset Management pretax margin represents income before income tax

          a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring 
          earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, 
          therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the 
          performance of Asset Management against the performance of its peers.

TouchShare, Inc. Joins the Authorized Reseller Program for Perceptive Pixel by Microsoft Devices

			&lt;p&gt;
				PASADENA, CA--(Marketwired - April 11, 2014) - TouchShare (formerly known as TouchTable, Inc.), the leader in next-generation geospatial collaboration solutions, is proud to announce its recognition as an authorized reseller of Perceptive Pixel by Microsoft (PPI) multi-touch devices. Through this partnership, TouchShare will continue to offer best-of-breed hardware platforms to complement its flagship geospatial collaboration software. This partnership will enhance the way in which corporations and organizations interact, analyze and share data among local and distributed teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an exciting step for TouchShare," said Bob Pette, TouchShare CEO. "Since the origins of our first geospatial collaboration system, named the TouchTable, our company has been at the forefront of the multi-touch space. As a PPI authorized reseller, we can continue to deliver industry-leading hardware and software solutions that redefine collaboration, communication and understanding during briefings, planning, and critical situations."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a company focused on an optimal group collaboration and data interaction, TouchShare looks to extend its product offering by providing premium collaborative environments for individuals, small groups and distributed teams. Perceptive Pixel by Microsoft devices come in a range of formats that will allow TouchShare's multi-touch collaborative software to be used effectively in command centers, conference rooms and individuals at desktops. PPI Devices feature:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&#160;Optically bonded glass to sensor for a better picture and less parallax &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&#160;Projective capacitive sensors for more pristine and accurate touch response&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&#160;Unlimited touches and smart sensor capabilities (i.e. palm rejection)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&#160;Low latency and improved responsiveness across small, medium and large format systems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Effective collaboration should involve all of your people and tap into all of your senses, including touch," said Bob Pette. "With the exponential growth in volume and variety of data, we're surrounded by information yet starving for insights. TouchShare addresses this challenge by giving everyone, regardless of physical location, the ability to filter and fuse the 'right' data to make the 'right' decision so teams can interact with the data more naturally or intuitively."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the upcoming GEOINT Symposium in Tampa, FL, April 14-17th, 2014, (www.geoint2013.com), TouchShare will have a range of Microsoft hardware devices on display (booth #4045).&#160;These will be operating in conjunction with a range of GIS-based software applications from TouchShare, including tech previews of forthcoming 3D clients and 2D browser-based clients. These applications, in conjunction with the Microsoft hardware, will revolutionize the way in which Geospatial Intelligence users collectively share and make decisions based on geospatial information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please contact us at info@touchshare.com for more information, or to arrange a demonstration or meeting.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      As previously announced, the Board of Directors intends to increase the 
      second-quarter common stock dividend to $0.40 per share3 from 
      the current $0.38 per share; and the Board has also authorized the Firm 
      to repurchase $6.5 billion of common equity commencing within the second 
      quarter of this year through the end of the first quarter of 2015. 
      During the first quarter of 2014, the Firm repurchased $0.4 billion of 
      common equity. The Federal Reserve Board informed the Firm that it does 
      not object to the Firm&#8217;s proposed 2014 capital distribution plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the 
      financial results: &#8220;JPMorgan Chase had a good start to the year, given 
      there were industry-wide headwinds in Markets and Mortgage. Consumer  
      Community Banking deposit growth and card sales volume both remain above 
      the industry average2, and we have made significant progress 
      in Business Banking originations &#8211; up 22%. The Corporate  Investment 
      Bank was #1 in Global IB fees, with #1 positions in global debt and 
      equity, global syndicated loans and global long-term debt. Gross 
      investment banking revenue with Commercial Banking clients was up 31%. 
      Asset Management had its twentieth consecutive quarter of positive net 
      long-term client flows and had record loan balances, up 20%.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon continued: &#8220;We have growing confidence in the economy &#8211; consumers, 
      corporations and middle market companies are in increasingly good 
      financial shape and housing has turned the corner in most markets &#8211; and 
      we are doing our part to support the recovery. JPMorgan Chase provided 
      credit and raised capital of over $450 billion for our clients during 
      the first quarter of 2014, which included $5 billion for U.S. small 
      businesses.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon concluded: &#8220;As I said in my letter to shareholders this week, we 
      will dedicate extraordinary effort in 2014 adapting to the new global 
      financial architecture, and we will continue to make significant 
      progress on our control agenda. We face the future with a strong 
      foundation, a fortress balance sheet and excellent franchises built to 
      serve our clients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $1.9 billion, a decrease of $650 million, or 25%, 
      compared with the prior year, due to lower net revenue and higher 
      provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest 
      expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $10.5 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion, or 10%, 
      compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $7.0 billion, down 
      $183 million, or 3%, driven by spread compression in Credit Card, Auto 
      and Consumer  Business Banking, and by lower mortgage warehouse 
      balances, largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue 
      was $3.4&#160;billion, a decrease of $972 million, or 22%, driven by lower 
      mortgage fees and related income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $816&#160;million, compared with 
      $549&#160;million in the prior year and $72&#160;million in the prior quarter.&#160;The 
      current-quarter provision reflected a $450 million reduction in the 
      allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $1.3 billion. The 
      prior-quarter provision reflected a $1.2&#160;billion reduction in the 
      allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $1.3 billion. The 
      prior-year provision reflected a $1.2&#160;billion reduction in the allowance 
      for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $1.7 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $6.4&#160;billion, a decrease of $353&#160;million, or 5%, 
      from the prior year, driven by lower Mortgage Banking expense.

			Mortgage Banking net income was $114 million, a decrease of $559 
      million from the prior year, driven by lower net revenue and lower

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $1.6 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion compared with 
      the prior year. Net interest income was $1.1 billion, a decrease of $117 
      million, or 10%, driven by lower warehouse balances as well as lower 
      loan balances due to portfolio runoff. Noninterest revenue was $511 
      million, a decrease of $1.0&#160;billion, driven by lower mortgage fees and 
      related income.

		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $23 million2, 
      compared with a benefit of $198 million in the prior year. The current 
      quarter reflected a $200 million reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and 
      delinquencies. The prior year included a $650 million reduction in the 
      allowance for loan losses. Net charge-offs were $177 million, compared 
      with $452 million in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion, a decrease of $403 million, or 
      22%, from the prior year, due to lower headcount-related expense in 
      production and servicing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mortgage Production pretax loss was $58&#160;million, a 
      decrease of $485 million from the prior year, reflecting lower revenue, 
      partially offset by lower expense and lower repurchase losses. Mortgage 
      production-related revenue, excluding repurchase losses, was $292 
      million, a decrease of $926 million, from the prior year and $202 
      million from the prior quarter, largely reflecting lower volumes. 
      Production expense2 was $478 million, a decrease of 
      $232&#160;million from the prior year, predominantly due to lower 
      headcount-related expense; and a decrease of $511 million from the prior 
      quarter, predominantly due to the absence of non-MBS related legal 
      expense. Repurchase losses for the current quarter reflected a benefit 
      of $128 million, compared with losses of $81 million in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mortgage Servicing pretax loss was $270 million, compared 
      with a pretax loss of $101 million in the prior year, reflecting a 
      higher MSR risk management loss, largely offset by lower expenses. 
      Mortgage net servicing-related revenue was $713 million, a decrease of 
      $65 million from the prior year. MSR risk management was a loss of $401 
      million, which includes a negative $460 million fair value adjustment 
      primarily related to higher capital allocated to the business, compared 
      with a MSR risk management loss of $142 million in the prior year. 
      Servicing expense2 was $582 million, a decrease of $155 
      million from the prior year, reflecting lower headcount-related expense.

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $2.0&#160;billion, down 24% compared with $2.6 billion in the 
      prior year. These results primarily reflected lower revenue, partially 
      offset by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $8.6 billion, down 
      15% compared with $10.1 billion in the prior year. Excluding the impact 
      of a debit valuation adjustment (&#8220;DVA&#8221;) gain of $126 million in the 
      prior year, net revenue was down 14% from $10.0 billion in the prior 
      year, and net income was down 22% from $2.5 billion in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Banking revenue was $2.7 billion, down 8% from the prior year. 
      Investment banking fees were $1.4 billion, up 1% from the prior year. 
      The increase was driven by higher advisory fees of $383&#160;million, up 50% 
      from the prior year on strong wallet share of completed transactions, as 
      well as higher equity underwriting fees of $353 million, up 29% from the 
      prior year on higher industry-wide wallet levels. These were partially 
      offset by lower debt underwriting fees of $708 million, down 22% from 
      the prior year reflecting lower industry-wide volumes of high-yield bond 
      underwriting and loan syndications. Treasury Services revenue was $1.0 
      billion, down 3% compared with the prior year driven by lower trade 
      finance revenue as well as the impact of business simplification 
      initiatives. Lending revenue was $284&#160;million, a decline from $498 
      million in the prior year primarily due to lower gains on securities 
      received from restructured loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Markets  Investor Services revenue was $5.9 billion, down 18% from the 
      prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue of $3.8 billion was down 21% 
      from the prior year on weaker performance across most products and lower 
      levels of client activity compared to a stronger prior year. Equity 
      Markets revenue of $1.3 billion was down 3% compared with the prior 
      year, on lower derivatives revenue. Securities Services revenue was $1.0 
      billion, up 4% from the prior year primarily driven by higher net 
      interest income on higher deposits and higher asset-based custody fees. 
      Credit Adjustments  Other revenue was a loss of $197 million driven by 
      losses on net credit valuation adjustments (&#8220;CVA&#8221;) as well as losses, 
      net of hedges, related to funding valuation adjustments/DVA; prior year 
      revenue was a gain of $99 million, mainly driven by DVA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $49 million, compared with $11 
      million in the prior year. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to 
      period-end loans retained was 1.23%, compared with 1.11% in the prior 
      year. Excluding the impact of the consolidation of Firm-administered 
      multi-seller conduits and trade finance loans, the ratio of the 
      allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained1 was 
      2.18%, compared with 2.17% in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $5.6 billion, down 8% from the prior year, 
      primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation. The 
      compensation ratio
			was 33%.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $578 million, a decrease of $18 million, or 3%, compared 
      with the prior year, reflecting an increase in noninterest expense and 
      lower net revenue, partially offset by a lower provision for credit 
      losses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $1.7&#160;billion, a decrease of $22 million, or 1%, compared 
      with the prior year. Net interest income was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 
      $45 million, or 4%, compared with the prior year, reflecting spread 
      compression, higher funding costs on loan products, and lower purchase 
      discounts recognized on loan repayments, partially offset by higher loan 
      balances. Noninterest revenue was $558&#160;million, an increase of $23 
      million, or 4%, compared with the prior year, driven by higher 
      investment banking fees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $698 million, a decrease of $55 
      million, or 7%, compared with the prior year. Revenue from Corporate 
      Client Banking was $446&#160;million, an increase of $13 million, or 3%, 
      compared with the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending was 
      $308 million, an increase of $17 million, or 6%, compared with the prior 
      year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $116&#160;million, an increase of 
      $4 million, or 4%, compared with the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $5 million, compared with $39 
      million in the prior year. Net recoveries were $14 million (0.04% net 
      recovery rate), compared with net recoveries of $7 million (0.02% net 
      recovery rate) in the prior year and net charge-offs of $25&#160;million 
      (0.07% net charge-off rate) in the prior quarter. The allowance for loan 
      losses to period-end loans retained was 1.95%, down from 2.05% in the 
      prior year and down from 1.97% in the prior quarter. Nonaccrual loans 
      were $485&#160;million, down $184 million, or 28%, from the prior year, and 
      down by $29 million, or 6%, from the prior quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $686 million, up 7% compared with the prior 
      year, largely reflecting higher control and headcount-related2 
      expense.

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $441&#160;million, a decrease of $46 million, or 9%, from the 
      prior year, reflecting higher noninterest expense, largely offset by 
      higher net revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $2.8&#160;billion, an increase of $125&#160;million, or 5%, from 
      the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $2.2&#160;billion, up $124 million, 
      or 6%, from the prior year, due to net client inflows and the effect of 
      higher market levels, partially offset by lower valuations of seed 
      capital investments. Net interest income was $560&#160;million, up 
      $1&#160;million, or flat to the prior year, due to higher loan and deposit 
      balances, predominantly offset by narrower loan spreads.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenue from Private Banking was $1.5 billion, up 4% compared with the 
      prior year. Revenue from Institutional was $500 million, down 12%. 
      Retail was $769&#160;million, up 20%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Client assets were $2.4 trillion, an increase of $223&#160;billion, or 10%, 
      compared with the prior year. Assets under management were $1.6 
      trillion, an increase of $165 billion, or 11%, from the prior year, due 
      to the effect of higher market levels and net inflows to long-term 
      products. Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were 
      $746&#160;billion, up $58&#160;billion, or 8%, from the prior year, due to the 
      effect of higher market levels and custody inflows, partially offset by 
      brokerage outflows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $9 million, compared 
      with a provision for credit losses of $21 million in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $2.1 billion, an increase of $199 million, or 
      11%, from the prior year, primarily due to higher headcount-related2 
      expense and costs related to the control agenda.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $340 million, compared with net income of $250 million in 
      the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Private Equity reported net income of $215 million, compared with a net 
      loss of $182 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $363 million, 
      compared with a loss of $276 million in the prior year, primarily due to 
      net valuation gains on public and private investments and gains from 
      sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $94 million, compared with net 
      income of $24 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $2 million, 
      compared with $113 million in the prior year. Current-quarter net 
      interest income was a loss of $87 million, compared with a loss of $472 
      million in the prior year, reflecting the benefit of higher interest 
      rates and reinvestment opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other Corporate reported net income of $219 million, compared with net 
      income of $408 million in the prior year. The current quarter included 
      an after tax impact of approximately $90 million for writing down 
      deferred tax assets following New York State tax law changes enacted 
      March 31, 2014. The prior year included an after-tax benefit of $227 
      million for tax adjustments.

      (*) Presented on a managed basis. See notes on page 12 for further 
      explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled 
      $22,993 million, $23,156 million, and $25,122 million for the first 
      quarter of 2014, fourth quarter of 2013, and first quarter of 2013, 
      respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $5.3 billion, down $1.3 billion from the prior year. The 
      decrease was driven by lower net revenue and higher provision for credit 
      losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $23.9 billion, down $2.0 billion, or 8%, compared with 
      the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $13.0 billion, down $1.8 
      billion, or 12%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was 
      $10.9 billion, down $202 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year, 
      reflecting the impact of lower loan yields and lower trading and 
      investment securities balances, predominantly offset by higher 
      investment securities yields, lower long term debt and deposit interest 
      expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $850 million, up $233 million from 
      the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $807 
      million, compared with $545 million in the prior year. The 
      current-quarter consumer provision reflected a $449 million reduction in 
      the allowance for loan losses, compared to a $1.1 billion reduction in 
      the prior year. The current-quarter consumer allowance release primarily 
      reflects lower estimated losses in the mortgage and credit card 
      portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, compared with 
      $1.7 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 
      1.42% and 1.92%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses 
      was $43 million, compared with $72 million in the prior year. Wholesale 
      net charge-offs were $13 million, compared with net charge-offs of $35 
      million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.02% 
      and 0.05%, respectively. The Firm&#8217;s allowance for loan losses to 
      period-end loans retained1 was 1.75%, compared with 2.27% in 
      the prior year. The Firm&#8217;s nonperforming assets totaled $9.5 billion, 
      down from the prior quarter and prior year levels of $9.7 billion and 
      $11.7 billion, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $14.6 billion, down $787 million, or 5%, 
      compared with the prior year, primarily driven by lower 
      performance-based compensation in CIB and lower mortgage production and 
      servicing expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;

          In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, 
          management reviews the Firm's consolidated results and the results 
          of the lines of business on a &#8220;managed&#8221; basis, which is a non-GAAP 
          financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts 
          with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain 
          reclassifications to present total consolidated net revenue for the 
          Firm (and for each of the business segments) on a fully 
          taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. Accordingly, revenue from 
          investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is 
          presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
          securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows 
          management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both 
          taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact 
          related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. 
          These adjustments have no impact on consolidated net income/(loss) 
          as reported by the Firm or on net income/(loss) as reported by the 
          lines of business.

          The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans 
          excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans 
          held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) loans; and the 
          allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real 
          Estate Portfolios net charge-offs and net charge-off rates exclude 
          the impact of PCI loans.

          Tangible common equity (&#8220;TCE&#8221;) and return on tangible common equity 
          (&#8220;ROTCE&#8221;) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the 
          Firm&#8217;s common stockholders&#8217; equity (i.e., total stockholders&#8217; equity 
          less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible 
          assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. 
          ROTCE measures the Firm&#8217;s earnings as a percentage of TCE. TCE and 
          ROTCE are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, 
          in assessing the Firm&#8217;s use of equity, as well as facilitating 
          comparisons of the Firm with competitors.

          Tier 1 common capital and the Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel 
          III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules are each non-GAAP financial 
          measures. Additionally, the supplemental leverage ratio (&#8220;SLR&#8221;) 
          under Basel III rules is a non-GAAP financial measure. These 
          measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and 
          analysts to assess and monitor the Firm&#8217;s capital position. For 
          additional information on Tier 1 common and the Tier 1 common ratio

          The CIB provides non-GAAP financial measures, as such measures are 
          used by management to assess the underlying performance of the 
          business and for comparability with peers.
        
			
		
		
			
        The ratio for the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans is 
        calculated excluding the impact of consolidated Firm-administered 
        multi-seller conduits and trade finance loans, to provide a more 
        meaningful assessment of CIB&#8217;s allowance coverage ratio.
      
			
        Prior to January 1, 2014, the CIB provided non-GAAP financial measures 
        excluding the impact of FVA (effective fourth quarter 2013) and DVA on 
        net revenue and net income. Beginning in the first quarter 2014, the 
        Firm did not exclude FVA and DVA from its assessment of business 
        performance; however, the Firm continued to present these non-GAAP 
        measures for the periods prior to January 1, 2014, as they reflected 
        how management assessed the underlying business performance of the CIB 
        in those prior periods.

      books to U.S. communities in need and will present families with free 
      digital books from Disney Publishing Worldwide, through a new program 
      announced today, Disney Junior's Give a Book, Get a Book. 
      Storytelling is the foundation of the initiative designed to inspire 
      parents and caregivers to spend time each day sharing stories that help 
      develop the critical thinking, vocabulary and language skills a 
      preschooler needs. The program includes a redemption code offering a

      back by donating books to the community of their choice. Disney Junior&#8217;s Give 
      a Book, Get a Book, also includes public service announcements, free 
      storytime events at Boys  Girls Clubs of America and Disney Store 
      locations, and interactive Radio Disney events.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The program was announced today by Nancy Kanter, Executive Vice 
      President and General Manager, Disney Junior Worldwide and First Book 
      Board Member, Dr. Martha Bernadett during the Disney Social Media Moms 
      Celebration at the Disneyland Resort.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ms. Kanter said, "With each and every one of our Disney Junior series, 
      we let a child experience the magic and learning that comes with a story 
      well told, and deepen the emotional connection and sense of wonder and 
      adventure that have defined storytelling at the Disney company for 
      generations." She continued, "The Give a Book, Get a Book 
      program is a way for families to share stories and enter the world of 
      giving in a simple yet effective way."

      literacy advocate LeVar Burton, Cofounder and Curator-in-Chief of the 
      award-winning Reading 
      Rainbow app, spoke about the importance of building literacy and of 
      storytelling in the digital age. Disney Junior stars Ariel Winter and 
      Tim Gunn (of "Sofia the First") and David Arquette (of "Jake and the 
      Never Land Pirates") also participated in a storybook reading for event 
      attendees and their families. Genevieve Goings (of Disney Junior's "Choo 
      Choo Soul"), who hosts the Give a Book, Get a Book public 
      service announcements on Disney Channel, emceed the event.

      "There are few things more powerful than stories to connect children to 
      the world and help them imagine what they can become," said Kyle Zimmer, 
      president and CEO of First Book. "Yet, books and stories are in short 
      supply for kids in need. That's why we're proud to be joining forces 
      with our friends at Disney to put brand new books into the hands of 
      children who so desperately need them."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Through the donation of 30 million books over the last 15 years, Disney 
      Publishing Worldwide's collaboration with First Book has brought the 
      magic of reading and storytelling to millions of children, unleashing 
      their imaginations and opening their worlds," said Andrew B. Sugerman, 
      Executive Vice President, Disney Publishing Worldwide. "We're thrilled 
      to expand this program with Disney Junior's Give a Book, Get a Book."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Families can now take advantage of an all-new website, GiveaBookGetaBook.com, 
      featuring tools and resources for parents and caregivers that promote 
      the value of storytelling and offer interactive activities. Beginning 
      April 21 in Disney Store locations and later this summer at other 
      nationwide retailers, there are two ways to Give a Book, Get a Book. 
      For a limited time, with the purchase of any specially-marked Disney 
      Junior book or product, receipts or packaging will include a redemption 
      code allowing kids and families to direct the donation of a book to 
      First Book in the region of their choice and to access a free Disney 
      Digital Book to share as a family. Additionally, Give a Book, Get a 
      Book bookmarks with redemption codes will be distributed to visitors 
      at participating public libraries and Radio Disney events throughout the 
      summer. With the help of families across the United States, Disney and 
      First Book will donate up to one million books through this program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Also starting April 21, Disney Store locations will provide an enhanced 
      interactive "Storytime Powered by Give a Book, Get a Book" 
      featuring two new stories from Disney Junior favorites, "Sofia the 
      First" and "Jake and the Never Land Pirates." In addition to the 
      in-store readings, Disney Store locations will host special storytime 
      events at Boys  Girls Clubs of America in multiple markets across the 
      U.S. Children at these events will be given a free book along with a

&lt;p&gt;The Bharatiya Janata Party, led by prime-ministerial hopeful Narendra Modi, and its allies have until now been forecast to win the largest chunk of the 543 parliamentary seats but fall short of the 272-seat mark needed for a majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would force them to seek a coalition with some of India's increasingly powerful regional parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a poll for the private news channel NDTV showed the BJP and its allies winning a narrow majority of 275 seats. That would be an increase of 16 seats since the last NDTV poll a little over a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian elections are notoriously hard to call, however, due to the country's diverse electorate and a parliamentary system in which local candidates hold great sway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls in 2004 wrongly predicted victory for a BJP-led alliance and in 2009 underestimated the winning margin of the ruling Congress party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi, chief minister of the western state of Gujarat, has been wooing voters by promising to get India out of its slowest economic growth in a decade and by pointing to his track record of cutting red tape and attracting investment in his state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RELIGIOUS TENSIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet his image remains tarnished by Hindu-Muslim riots in Gujarat on his watch 12 years ago, in which more than 1,000 people - most of them Muslims - were killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi denies accusations that he failed to stop the riots and a Supreme Court inquiry found no evidence to prosecute him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amit Shah, who runs the BJP's campaign in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, was reprimanded last week by election authorities for speeches that appeared to justify religious riots in Muzaffarnagar in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's 815 million voters are heading to the polls in nine stages from April 7 to May 12, with results due on May 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest NDTV-Hansa Research opinion poll surveyed voters in over 350 parliamentary constituencies and had a margin of error or plus or minus 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling Congress party, led by the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, and its allies were forecast to win just 111 parliamentary seats in the poll. Congress faces a struggle to be re-elected after a decade in power due to public anger over the economic slowdown, high inflation and a string of corruption scandals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's retail inflation has remained near 10 percent for the last three years, mainly driven by higher food prices. Growth has struggled at a decade-low of nearly 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An opinion poll earlier this month by the CNN-IBN news channel and the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, one of India's most trusted polling groups, gave between 234 and 246 seats to the BJP and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Shyamantha Asokan; Editing by Tom Heneghan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - A Miami federal judge released a Miami-Dade Police Department internal affairs detective on $500,000 bond after he was charged with helping drug smugglers and orchestrating a murder-for-hire plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of an agreement with federal prosecutors Ralph Mata, 45, will wear an electronic tracking bracelet while released, the judge ordered during a bond hearing on Monday. Mata agreed to waive extradition and will be transferred to New Jersey, where the bulk of the investigation took place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's definitely going to plead not guilty," Mata's attorney Barry Fleisher said, adding that he expects to post bail for Mata later today or tomorrow morning at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mata, a 22-year law-enforcement veteran who allegedly called himself "The Milk Man," was arrested last week in Miami in connection with arranging for two assassins dressed in police uniforms and badges to kill two members of a rival group, according to a criminal complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mata said he would pay the assassins $150,000 per target, the complaint said. In meetings with the would-be assassins, Mata gave them a down payment of $5,000 and a box of cigars for their "willingness" to participate in the plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug dealers ultimately decided not to move forward with the plot, but Mata was paid for setting it up, the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also helped to transport the drug dealers' money and guns to the Dominican Republic, and was given thousands of dollars and a Rolex watch worth $10,000 for his help, the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mata's arrest stunned the Miami-Dade county police department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The allegations against Lt. Mata are beyond shocking and disturbing," the director of the Miami-Dade Police, J.D. Patterson, said in a statement on Monday, offering the full cooperation of his department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This matter is a source of monumental disappointment and distress to myself, our community, and the Miami-Dade Police Department family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mata's arrest appears linked to three New Jersey men - Juan C. Arias, Martin Nu&#241;ez-Lora and Persio Nu&#241;ez - arrested in 2012 for smuggling cocaine into the U.S. via shipping containers carrying bananas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2012 Drug Enforcement Administration agents raided Arias' northern New Jersey home, finding $400,000. Though Arias suspected members of his group stole the money, Mata used law enforcement contacts to learn the DEA seized the money and reported back to members of the organization, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three men in 2013 each plead guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine and are awaiting sentencing. A lawyer for Arias declined to comment and lawyers for Nu&#241;ez-Lora and Nu&#241;ez couldn't be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mata also faces other charges, including aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The narcotics charges each carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This story was corrected to say "conviction" instead of "arrest" in paragraph 11)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Adams; editing by Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will punish people who employ foreigners illegally or break the terms of their visas, in an effort to encourage local employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punishment ranging from fines and jail terms to confiscation of assets and deportation may be imposed, escalating a year-long crackdown on visa irregularities that have been overlooked for decades. The Interior Ministry decision was carried on the official Saudi Press Agency on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police raids and an amnesty on fines for immigration violations last year caused over a million foreigners to leave voluntarily. Their departure was followed by the deportation of hundreds of thousands of others, mostly Ethiopians and Yemenis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear how many people with invalid visas remain in Saudi Arabia. Some economists estimate it might stretch to millions of people. Around 20 million Saudis and 10 million foreigners live in the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riyadh hopes that stricter enforcement of visa rules will encourage hiring Saudi nationals, by making it harder and more expensive to employ expatriates, who tend to be cheaper than the kingdom's own citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saudi visa rules stipulate that all foreign workers must be sponsored by their employers and cannot work for themselves or other companies or individuals. The government says expatriates who set up their own businesses or work for companies that do not sponsor them deny jobs to Saudis and make it harder to enforce quotas for local and foreign staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saudi unemployment is officially around 12 percent for Saudis, but that figure does not account for the 60 to 70 percent of working-age people who do not hold jobs and are not actively seeking work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economists have warned Riyadh it needs to boost private- sector employment, because eventually it will be unable to reduce joblessness through public-sector hiring, as it sometimes has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour Minister Adel al-Fakeih said in January the crackdown on visas coupled with sweeping reforms over recent years has doubled the number of Saudis in private-sector jobs since mid 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a large number of those without proper documents are thought to be manual laborers and domestic servants, jobs that most Saudis do not want. Economists have also said it is unclear whether the policies will ultimately create sustainable jobs, and they have caused short-term disruption, particularly in the construction sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PUNISHMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreigners working for themselves or overstaying their residence visas face a fine of 10,000 riyals ($2,667) and deportation for a first offence, rising to 50,000-riyal fines and six months in prison followed by deportation for three offences or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immigrants who entered Saudi Arabia illegally will be fined 15,000 riyals and jailed for two months before deportation for a first offence, rising to 100,000 riyals and six months in prison with deportation for three or more offences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who smuggle or transport illegal immigrants will be fined 25,000-100,000 riyals and have their vehicle confiscated. Prison terms range from six months to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who employ or aid foreigners without proper visas, and sponsors who let them work for themselves or other people, face fines of 15,000-100,000 riyals, a freeze on hiring expatriates and prison terms of up to six months and deportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional penalties are imposed for licensed pilgrimage operators that fail to report when people coming to Mecca or Medina for Haj do not return to their countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries with large numbers of citizens working in Saudi Arabia include Yemen, Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Angus McDowall; Editing by Larry King)&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Depression Drugs Market 2014-2018 with 
      GlaxoSmithKline plc, Eli Lilly  Co., Pfizer Inc., and Forest 
      Laboratories Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/3stzbq/global_depression) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Depression Drugs Market 2014-2018 with GlaxoSmithKline plc, Eli Lilly  
      Co., Pfizer Inc., and Forest Laboratories Dominating" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Increasing public awareness regarding depression and associated 
      disorders is expected to increase the acceptability of various drugs, 
      and thereby an increase in drug penetration. For instance, ADAP educates 
      high school students, teachers, and parents about depression disorder. 
      ADAP aims to increase awareness about mood disorders in young people 
      while stressing the need for evaluation and treatment. Similarly, the 
      Peer-to-Peer Depression Awareness Campaign project is the student 
      education component of the educational collaboration between the 
      Depression Center and Ann Arbor public schools. The project aims to 
      educate high school students about depression and depressive illnesses, 
      and support them in finding creative ways to deliver this knowledge to 
      their peers in order to reduce stigma, raise awareness, and help to 
      promote the early detection of depression, bipolar disorder, and related 
      illnesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main drivers in this market is the 
      increase in the number of patients suffering from depression. The 
      increasing aging population is contributing to the growth of the market. 
      The number of patients suffering from depression is increasing owing to 
      increasingly elevated stress levels, unhealthy lifestyle, and social 
      imbalances both in developing and developed nations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the main challenges is the 
      generic erosion of key blockbuster drugs. The introduction of low-priced 
      generic drugs increases competition among vendors and reduces the cost 
      of patented/branded drugs substantially.

      Red Hat and IBM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Combination of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, Red Hat Storage and 
      IBM System X servers improves IT performance, simplifies management and 
      halves storage costs for the multinational electronics giant
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world&#8217;s leading provider of open source 
      solutions, and IBM (NYSE: IBM) 
      today announced that Casio Computer Company Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, has 
      realized significant results in IT efficiency, performance and cost 
      savings with a solution comprising Red Hat Storage, Red Hat Enterprise 
      Virtualization and IBM 
      System x servers. By combining virtualized industry-standard 
      servers with open software-defined storage, Casio now has a highly 
      available and agile storage solution that can accommodate heavy data 
      workloads by scaling to petabytes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Casio Computer Co., Ltd., established in 1957, is one of the world&#8217;s 
      leading manufacturers of consumer electronics and business equipment 
      solutions including calculators, mobile phones, cameras, musical 
      instruments and watches. The company previously used monolithic 
      proprietary storage hardware and software that became extremely 
      expensive because the operation and maintenance had to be entrusted to 
      the vendor.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Casio, with the help of premier IBM Business Partner Lightwell Ltd. Co., 
      deployed Red Hat Storage into its existing infrastructure comprising Red 
      Hat Enterprise Virtualization and IBM System x3650 servers to cut its 
      high storage costs and to avoid inflexible vendor lock-in. IBM System x 
      servers with Red Hat solutions were used to provide the backbone for the 
      virtualized environment to offer reliability and support for new digital 
      capabilities focused on increasing sales and visibility of Casio&#8217;s 
      clock, digital cameras and tablets products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Red Hat Storage acts as a data-store of Red Hat Enterprise 
      Virtualization, the open datacenter virtualization solution built on 
      industry-leading performance of the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) 
      hypervisor. Within two years, Casio slashed its storage costs in half by 
      integrating the internal storage disks of multiple servers and using it 
      as one large storage pool that is accessible through the virtualized 
      server. The Red Hat Storage management console also provides a 
      simplified and unified way to manage both the storage and virtualized 
      server environments for optimized performance.

		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;By deploying Red Hat Storage with Red Hat Virtualization running on IBM 
      x series servers, we were finally able to build a storage environment at 
      a low cost while using commodity servers. Our costs, including various 
      procurement costs and operating fees, fell to less than half of what we 
      had been spending before implementing Red Hat Storage. And, our IT usage 
      was by no means optimal or efficient. We were locked in by vendors&#8217; 
      proprietary storage hardware technologies, so we couldn&#8217;t manipulate the 
      system ourselves.&#8221;

      &#8220;Companies like Casio understand that virtualization is a business 
      decision, providing them a competitive advantage by improving overall 
      system utilization, increasing efficiency and lowering costs. IBM's 
      System x servers are specifically designed to provide the resiliency, 
      flexibility, performance, economy, and ease of installation and 
      operation that are essential to any virtualization solution.&#8221;

      &#8220;Red Hat is pleased to assist Casio in slashing its storage costs and 
      improving IT performance by deploying the powerful combination of open 
      virtualized storage running on standard servers. The integrated 
      management capabilities of Red Hat Storage and Red Hat Enterprise 
      Virtualization enables Casio to easily fine-tune their infrastructure

      Research and Markets: Global Customer Cloud App Market 2014-2018 with 
      Apple Inc., Google Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Zoho Corp Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/wmvhcw/global_customer) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Customer Cloud App Market 2014-2018 with Apple Inc., Google Inc., 
      Microsoft Corp. and Zoho Corp Dominating" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Customer Cloud App market to grow at a CAGR of 15% to 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers is the increased need for effective and 
      efficient storage systems. Consumer cloud computing allows users to 
      effectively store content in the form of photos, music, documents, etc. 
      Data stored on the cloud can be accessed anytime and through a web 
      browser on any device such as a smartphone, tablet, PC or any handheld 
      device.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Customer Cloud App market is witnessing a number of new 
      vendors entering the market and providing cloud-based storage solutions. 
      With the entry of new vendors such as Western Digital Technologies Inc. 
      and the expansion of free storage space by vendors such as Box Inc., 
      there is increasing competition among vendors resulting in a decrease of 
      prices of cloud-based storage solutions. Furthermore, many established 
      vendors are entering into partnerships with other cloud-based service 
      providers to develop cloud-based storage solutions to provide an 
      end-to-end solution to customers. Large storage infrastructures are 
      being established to meet the growing cloud computing and cloud-based 
      storage requirements of customers across the globe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is a growing 
      concern for the security of data in the network. Personal data security 
      is a major concern for customers that are storing their data over the 
      cloud storage infrastructure. The cloud-based storage service providers 
      are incorporating advanced security measures which ensure the safety of 
      the data.

		&lt;p&gt;
      In an effort to promote healthy, active lifestyles, Coca-Cola (NASDAQ: 
      COKE) is partnering with Charlotte Parent magazine and CVS in an 8-week 
      program in which Charlotte area residents are challenged to get out and 
      get active!
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To participate and be eligible to win prizes, residents need to sign up 
      at www.charlotteparent.com.&#160;Families 
      earn points, based on participation, for a chance to win prizes during 
      the 8-week challenge period, April 15-June 9. To help promote the Fit 
      Family Challenge, Coca-Cola has invested more than $125,000 on the 
      program&#8217;s implementation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Participants can also find support via blogs, expert advice, wellness 
      tips and information on free exercise classes through the Charlotte 
      Parent website.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At Charlotte Parent, we believe children are our greatest treasure and 
      they deserve to be healthy and happy. The Fit Family Challenge is a 
      positive way to reach families in our community with an encouraging 
      message about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle,&#8221; says Eve White, 
      executive editor and publisher of Charlotte Parent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Since the first Coke was shared in 1886, our company has believed good 
      things happen when people come together,&#8221; said Lauren Steele,&#160;Sr. VP, 
      Corporate Affairs, Coca-Cola Bottling Company Consolidated. &#8220;The Fit 
      Family Challenge is just another example of the Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s 
      commitment to dealing with today&#8217;s important issues. We believe that to 
      seriously address obesity, there needs to be an open and honest 
      dialogue, coupled with a comprehensive approach toward promoting 
      nutrition and physical exercise.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As a lifelong fitness advocate, I believe everyone needs access to 
      healthy foods and have ample opportunities to exercise so they can live 
      healthy lives,&#8221; said North Carolina House of Representative Member Ruth 
      Samuelson.&#160;&#8220;That&#8217;s why I support the Coca-Cola Fit Family Challenge and 
      its efforts to boost awareness of the importance of eating healthy and 
      exercising daily.&#160;And I know that Charlotte families will get out there, 
      get moving!&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;CVS/pharmacy is committed to helping people on their path to better 
      health, so we are pleased to support the Fit Family Challenge by raising 
      awareness about the importance of exercise, a well-balanced diet and 
      getting enough rest,&#8221; said David Purdy, Area Vice President, 
      CVS/pharmacy.

			Osterman Research White Paper, Sponsored by Sonian, Finds Email 
      Archiving and Retention Limitations within Microsoft Office 365
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New study proposes that third-party cloud offerings are necessary, 
      supplemental features to enhance Office 365 native capabilities
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Osterman 
      Research has released its latest white paper, Microsoft&#174; 
      Office 365&#174; for the Enterprise: How to Strengthen Security, 
      Compliance and Control. The paper is sponsored by, among others, Sonian, 
      the pioneer in cloud-powered email archiving. This insightful document 
      explores the Office 365 environment, its applicability to organizations 
      of all sizes and the third-party capabilities that savvy customers 
      should consider in order to supplement the platform, specifically to 
      enhance security, archiving and encryption.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We believe that Office 365 provides a useful set of features and 
      functions that will, no doubt, be well received by many organizations,&#8221; 
      said Michael Osterman, President of Osterman Research. &#8220;The third-party 
      market for cloud-based and on-premises capabilities designed to 
      supplement or replace specific Office 365 features and functions will 
      grow at a healthy pace as the market for Office 365 grows.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The white paper notes third-party enhancements will provide more 
      granular and capable archiving, security and encryption features to 
      ensure a more robust data management platform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional research findings include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Archiving and retention limitations, such as migration challenges, 
        minimal in-place archival and retention support, inability to support 
        key compliance requirements for SharePoint Online content, 30-day time 
        limits for some mailbox folders, and limitations for end-user search 
        capabilities compared to third party solutions.
      
			
        Security limitations, including lack of support for redundant spam 
        filters, and lack of support for some of the more advanced threat 
        protection techniques.
      
			
        Microsoft can move customer data without advance notice, with no 
        guarantee of where that data will be stored.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;There are a number of obvious advantages and some limitations for 
      organizations considering Office 365, including sub-optimal archiving, 
      security and encryption features, which this Osterman Research white 
      paper makes clear,&#8221; said Greg Arnette, CTO at Sonian. &#8220;Sonian&#8217;s email 
      archiving solution perfectly complements Office 365 and provides users 
      with seamless integration and migration, unlimited storage and 
      retention, and fast and accurate search to derive meaning and make 
      quicker decisions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Sonian email archive service supports hosted and on-premise 
      Exchange, Office 365 and many other messaging servers. It can be quickly 
      deployed without hardware, without software and without up-front costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft Office 365 offers a suite of Office applications, including 
      email, web conferencing and other productivity tools, which are 
      delivered over cloud services such as Exchange Online, Lync Online, 
      OneDrive, Skype and SharePoint Online.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) buyout arm said on Monday they have agreed to acquire capital markets data and software provider Ipreo Holdings LLC from another buyout firm, KKR &amp; Co LP (KKR.N).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal underscores Ipreo's appeal to private equity firms, which routinely turn to investment banks to tap capital markets and have an understanding of the reliance of these banks on financial research and specialized software for their deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms of the transaction were not publicly disclosed but a person briefed on the deal said it valued Ipreo a little lower than $975 million. KKR will retain a minority ownership stake in Ipreo, the private equity firms said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based Ipreo provides software to manage several aspects of the capital market activities of investment banks, including book building and deal-related accounting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also offers databases with equity and fixed income market contacts.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - Private equity firm
Blackstone Group LP and Goldman Sachs Group Inc's 
buyout arm said on Monday they have agreed to acquire capital
markets data and software provider Ipreo Holdings LLC from
another buyout firm, KKR &amp; Co LP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal underscores Ipreo's appeal to private equity firms,
which routinely turn to investment banks to tap capital markets
and have an understanding of the reliance of these banks on
financial research and specialized software for their deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms of the transaction were not publicly disclosed but
a person briefed on the deal said it valued Ipreo a little lower
than $975 million. KKR will retain a minority ownership stake in
Ipreo, the private equity firms said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based Ipreo provides software to manage several
aspects of the capital market activities of investment banks,
including book building and deal-related accounting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also offers databases with equity and fixed income market

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co posted far weaker-than-expected quarterly profit as uncertainty about the U.S. economy weighed on investor trading volumes and consumer borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from the first of the major Wall Street banks to post earnings underscore how difficult the first quarter was for the financial sector. JPMorgan's bond trading revenue plunged 21 percent, and mortgage lending revenue fell 84 percent from the same quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the bank's big businesses, including commercial lending and credit cards, delivered lower profits. But the bank is not responding by dialing up its risk-taking in commercial lending, and it views falling revenue in its bond trading business as part of a business cycle instead of a symptom of a broad-based and lasting decline in fixed-income trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not like selling cereal - it's not like your volumes go up 2 percent every day," Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said to reporters on a conference call. The business will grow over the next decade or two, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who earned plaudits for keeping his bank consistently profitable during the financial crisis, is struggling to figure out how to navigate the current environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his annual letter to shareholders earlier this week, Dimon noted that JPMorgan will have spent more than $2 billion more than usual from 2012 through the end of this year on complying with new rules, and devoted more than 1 million work hours to meeting new mortgage rules. The bank's net income dropped 16 percent last year due to massive legal settlements and rising compliance costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday's results showed how the bank's troubles appear to be extending beyond outsized legal settlements and meeting new rules, and into areas more fundamental to the business, such as loan demand and trading volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, net income fell 19 percent to $5.27 billion, or $1.28 per share, from $6.53 billion, or $1.59 per share, in the same quarter of 2013, the biggest U.S. bank said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.40 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total net revenue fell 8.5 percent to $22.99 billion, falling well short of the average estimate of $24.53 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares, which recently topped $61 to trade at their highest level in 13 years, fell 3.1 percent to $55.63 in afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORTGAGE LENDING FALLS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area where the bank is meeting with some success is keeping costs under control, a crucial effort when future revenues may be weak. JPMorgan said non-interest expenses fell 5 percent in the latest quarter to $14.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon is aiming to hold down overhead - which he defines as non-interest expenses aside from litigation - to below an average of $14.75 billion per quarter, or $59 billion for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortgage banking net income fell to $114 million in the quarter, a drop of $559 million from the year-earlier period. Production revenue, a measure of lending revenue, fell 84 percent to $161 million, and the bank made $17 billion of home loans, a 68 percent decline from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. mortgage lending has cooled after rising rates in the second half of last year have given fewer homeowners reason to refinance their loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &amp; Co, the biggest U.S. home lender, also reported results Friday and said its income from mortgage banking fell 46 percent from a year earlier. Gains on one-time items, however, contributed to a higher-than expected 14 percent rise in quarterly profit for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For JPMorgan, rising bond yields in the middle of last year, which resulted from the Federal Reserve's decision to slow down its bond buying program, also weighed on fixed income, currency, and commodity trading revenue, which fell to $3.76 billion from $4.75 billion in the same quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial banking income fell 3 percent to $578 million, hurt by declining revenue from making loans. Consumer credit and debit card income fell 1 percent to $1.35 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said total assets at the end of March stood at $2.48 trillion, up from $2.42 trillion at the end of December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm's supplementary leverage ratio, a measure of a bank's capital compared with its assets, stood at 5.1 percent at the end of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leverage ratios took on added importance on Tuesday when the Federal Reserve approved new rules setting minimum levels that could force the eight biggest U.S. banks to boost their capital by a total of $68 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule sets a higher minimum of 6 percent for the company's insured bank subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the rule was approved in its latest form, JPMorgan had said it was on track to raise its ratio from 4.6 percent at the end of December to the 5 percent minimum for its holding company by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LITIGATION EXPENSES "IMMATERIAL"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said its litigation expenses were immaterial in the latest quarter, under its "other corporate" accounting line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Litigation expenses totaled $347 million in the year-earlier quarter and $847 million in the fourth-quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter two years ago, litigation costs totaled $2.5 billion as the bank built up reserves in anticipation of big legal settlements that it ultimately reached in 2013. JPMorgan paid more than $20 billion last year to resolve legal claims stemming from a wide range of problems, including its London Whale derivatives loss and its marketing of bad mortgage securities before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's shares - which have nearly doubled in price since the bank was rocked in 2012 by its London Whale derivatives trading scandal and $6.2 billion loss - were trading at a multiple of 9.56 times estimated forward earnings on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That compares with 9.93 times for Goldman Sachs Group Inc and 11.38 times for Morgan Stanley, both of which report next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York and Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore; Editing by Ted Kerr, Dan Wilchins, Sofina Mirza-Reid and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co executives had a clear message for shareholders after reporting declining first-quarter earnings: don't worry, be happy that the bank isn't chasing short-term gains by making irrational lending decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first quarter was a tough one for JPMorgan. Profit fell 19 percent, revenue fell 8 percent, and the bank set aside 38 percent more money to cover loan losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the important thing is that the bank is not lowering its lending standards, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel really good about the risks we're taking ... for the future of the company," Dimon said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank will not be too aggressive in areas where it says it believes other lenders have taken leave of their senses, such as business lending, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told analysts on a separate call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll do every rational and sensible deal we can do but we aren't going to chase growth at the expense of discipline," Lake said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors say they appreciate the bank's strategy. Analyst Mike Scanlon at John Hancock Asset Management said Dimon seems to be making the kind of cautious lending decisions that long-term investors should want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They gave up revenue instead of chasing every dollar of business," Scanlon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the financial crisis, Charles "Chuck" Prince, then chief executive of Citigroup, infamously said that his bank had no choice but to make aggressive loans to private equity funds because its rivals were. "As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance," he told the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior executive at JPMorgan, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said on Friday, "Jamie is not going to dance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By backing away when others lend more aggressively, JPMorgan is acting like it did before the credit crisis, Scanlon added. John Hancock Asset Management owns about 1 million shares of JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's recent tangles with regulators over a range of issues, including the loss of more than $6 billion in the London Whale derivatives scandal, may be making the bank more inclined to play it safe when it comes to all kinds of risk, said analyst Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of this is coming together to make a conservative bank that in the long-run is going to work very well for shareholders, but over the near-term is going to come up short at times, like they did this quarter," said Cassidy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has one of the highest valuations among the major commercial and investment banks, as measured by share price to tangible common book value, which is due in part to its tendency to know when to scale down credit risk, Cassidy added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &amp; Co, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, agrees that competition is heating up now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You tend to see competitors be a little more aggressive, price things more aggressively to generate revenue," said Tim Sloan, chief financial officer at Wells Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo said on Friday that it managed to boost its lending book in the first quarter, but much of its 14 percent net profit increase in the period came from one-time gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAGGING RIVALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For JPMorgan, remaining disciplined is painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's mortgage lending and bond trading businesses logged steep profit declines, and the bank's profits also fell in many other key businesses, including corporate lending and debt underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was not an exciting set of numbers," said Andrew Kohl, an associate portfolio manager at Alpine Financial Services Fund, which owns JPMorgan shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results and company commentary prompted analyst Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer to cut his JPMorgan earnings estimates. He reduced his 2014 estimate to $5.64 a share from $6.13, and his 2015 estimate to $6.00 a share from $6.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total loans on JPMorgan's books grew less than 1 percent in the first quarter compared with the year-earlier period, and the average rates it earned on its $730 billion of loans fell to 4.49 percent, from 4.78 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One headwind for loan growth at JPMorgan is the impact of old Washington Mutual assets that the bank is not replacing when they mature. JPMorgan bought Washington Mutual at the height of the financial crisis after it failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bank is consciously trying to limit its new business in areas where profitability is shrinking. For example, JPMorgan made just $17 billion mortgages in the first quarter, down from $52.7 billion in the same quarter last year. That nearly 70 percent drop is steeper than the 57 percent decline that the Mortgage Bankers Association expects for the industry in the first quarter, mainly as a result of the reduced appeal of refinancing because of higher interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to investors in February, JPMorgan's Consumer and Community Banking CEO Gordon Smith said that there is a lot of competition in mortgage lending now as volume shrinks, and the bank is trying to determine how much business it wants there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's total loan growth lags the overall market, Federal Reserve data show. Loans across the U.S. banking system rose about 3.5 percent from the final week of March 2013 to the last week of March 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall volume of loans to companies has been growing fast, Fed data show: commercial and industrial loans on banks' books were 7.8 percent higher at the end of March from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the riskiest part of that market, namely junk-rated loans to companies, quality has weakened, and deals are put together in a way that reduces protection to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In loans to companies, JPMorgan is increasingly seeing competition from private equity firms and other lenders outside of the banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $1 billion of loans that JPMorgan made to companies with weak credit quality have been refinanced by non-banks, Doug Petno, chief of the bank's commercial banking, said in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo's Sloan said he has seen increasing competition from non-banks as well, but added that Wells Fargo's ability to sell a wide range of products to customers has prevented it from losing too many clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter, companies took out $8.6 billion of second-lien loans, which are riskier as they provide lower recoveries to lenders in a default. That is the fifth-highest level on record and a 25 percent increase over each of the past two quarters, Thomson Reuters LPC data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York, Additional reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra, Peter Rudegeair and Michelle Sierra in New York; Writing by Dan Wilchins; Edited by Martin Howell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Goldman Sachs Group Inc filed its shareholder proxy earlier this month, it was free of a proposal that has become increasingly popular among corporate governance activists: a demand for more disclosure about lobbying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman's big Wall Street rivals can't say the same. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc and Morgan Stanley all face lobbying-disclosure proposals this year. Some activist shareholders want the banks to be more transparent about their lobbying objectives, disclose more about the trade groups they belong to and say how much money they spend to influence policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman persuaded the Needmor Fund - which had sponsored a lobbying-disclosure proposal on the investment bank's proxy in 2013 - not to try again this year. Goldman's lead director, James Schiro, went on a tour to hear the views of groups of shareholders after taking the role last year and sought to work out compromises, people who attended the meetings told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't want to engage after the fact, we want to be able to deal with the issues by listening and engaging ahead of time," said John F.W. Rogers, chief of staff and secretary to Goldman's board of directors. "We believe this approach has been very productive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for Needmor Fund, whose proposal received the support of just 5.64 percent of Goldman shareholders voting last year, said Goldman is moving in the right direction. For instance, the bank now issues periodic statements about its lobbying activities and political spending, and has an ongoing dialogue with shareholders about the disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In light of their strong policy on political spending, as well as their partial disclosure on lobbying, investors decided not to pursue the lobbying resolution for this year," said Timothy Smith of Walden Asset Management, who represented Needmor in discussions with Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steps Goldman has taken have gone over well with shareholders, Smith said. This year its proxy has just one shareholder proposal, down from four in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's private discussions with a variety of shareholder groups - whose concerns can range from return-on-equity to climate change - have allowed the bank to escape public-relations headaches and underscore its effort to repair its image. It had often been portrayed in the media and by critics as the poster child for Wall Street greed in the aftermath of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LISTENING HELPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other big banks facing lobbying proposals argue in their proxies that they already disclose enough. They also say boards and management teams review lobbying activities and political spending regularly to ensure all of it is in the best interest of shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, for instance, bolstered its disclosures on lobbying in the corporate governance section of its web site and on its proxy after learning this year that it would face a lobbying proposal for the first time, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Goldman, Morgan Stanley said it does not use corporate money for elections and that its political and lobbying activities are subject to oversight by its management and board of directors. But unlike Goldman, the bank did not reach out to its critics - in this case the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), which is pursuing the proposal on Morgan Stanley's proxy this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would like them to do more," John Keenan, AFSCME corporate governance analyst, said of Morgan Stanley, including disclosing its trade association memberships and what it might pay to those groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its proxy proposal, AFSCME says: "Transparent reporting would reveal whether company assets are being used for objectives contrary to Morgan Stanley's long-term interests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's actions show that "listening to shareholders can be beneficial to both shareholders and the companies," said Courteney Keatinge, senior environmental, social and governance analyst at the proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis &amp; Co. Proposals related to lobbying and political spending have been the most popular kind for the past three years, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists point to other companies where they withdrew proposals recently in exchange for more lobbying disclosure, including at BlackRock Inc and Visa Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The large banks have minimal disclosure around lobbying and their trade association memberships generally," said Michael Pryce-Jones, a representative of union pension fund adviser CtW Investment Group, which is sponsoring the proposal on Citi's proxy. "That is why they are receiving these proposals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citi declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INVESTOR SEES GAPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a meeting last fall, Schiro told a group of shareholders motivated by social, political and ethical issues that Goldman has strict policies on political activities, Smith, Rogers and others who attended the meeting said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, while Goldman employees contribute more money to political campaigns than any of its rivals, the bank itself makes no political contributions. Goldman was one of just five out of 195 leading U.S. companies studied to voluntarily take that position last year, according to the Center for Political Accountability. Moreover, Goldman's U.S. employees are required to submit all proposed political contributions for review by the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Schiro's meeting with the investors, Goldman has put out public statements on "policy engagement and political participation." The dialogue between the bank and the shareholder groups remains open, partly through a special team in Goldman's investor relations department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman didn't agree to all of Needmor Fund's requests. Like Morgan Stanley, it still declines to list all of the trade groups it belongs to, or disclose "indirect" lobbying spending through those groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith at Walden Asset Management praised Schiro's willingness to talk but said "there are still huge gaps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs' momentum is in the right direction, Smith said, "Let's not overstate it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Ross Kerber; Editing by Paritosh Bansal, John Pickering and Martin Howell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 14 (Reuters) - Blackstone and Goldman Sachs'
 investment arm are set to buy Ipreo from KKR in a
private equity secondary deal that values the data company at
$975 million, the Financial Times reported, citing people
familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal could be announced as early as Monday, the
newspaper said. (r.reuters.com/qyb58v)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planned sale, coming barely three years after KKR
acquired Ipreo for $425 million, reflects the trend for private
equity groups to flip assets among themselves at a time when
there are fewer fresh deals on the ground, the FT said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ipreo was formed by the merger of i-Deal and Hemscott in
2006, with the backing of Veronis, Merrill Lynch and Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KKR, Ipreo as well as potential buyers Goldman Sachs and
Blackstone did not immediately respond to emails seeking
comments on the report.

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
SYDNEY, April 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings says that Australia-based
Coca-Cola 
Amatil's (CCL, BBB+/Stable) revised profit guidance, announced
last Friday 11 
April 2014, is within expectations and metrics remain well
within tolerance 
levels.
At present net debt/EBITDAR (leverage) is tracking slightly
higher than our 
August 2013 estimates (2.24x in FY13 and is now expected to peak
at 2.33x in 
FY14) but there is still significant headroom under the negative
rating trigger. 
In August 2013, Fitch noted that CCL's leverage was likely to
remain comfortably 
below its negative rating guideline of 3x and would likely fall
to 2x over the 
FY13-FY16. 
Fitch has factored in Australian soft drink price deflation of
2% in 2014, 
reverting to 1% from FY15-16, and an Australian beverage segment
EBIT margin of 
17%, representing a 4% fall from CCL's long-run average of 21%,
over the next 
five years. 
At the root of CCL's earnings downgrade is the pricing pressure
being exerted by 
Asahi Group's Pepsi and Schweppes brands in the supermarket
aisles. Some of this 
pricing pressure is now spilling over into CCL's Australian
non-grocery channel, 
which accounts for about 48% of its domestic soft drink sales
volume.  
Fitch believes that non-branded convenience stores are
increasingly sourcing 
products from the grocery channel. CCL attributed an 8.2% fall
in non-grocery 
channel sales volumes to pricing and poor execution of
promotions. However this 
does not capture the full extent of the weakness. During heavy
Pepsi brand 
promotional campaigns, non-branded convenience stores are able
to source product 
cheaply at the supermarket rather than directly from suppliers.
This trend is 
not only resulting in an increase in Pepsi volumes through the
grocery channel 
but also putting pressure on CCL's higher margin non-grocery
channel. The Pepsi 
brand is no stranger to discounting, with this strategy
accounting for what 
Fitch estimates to be as much as 80% of their total volumes.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp needs a "data culture" to thrive in the new computing environment, according to chief executive Satya Nadella, in his third public appearance in three weeks putting his imprint on the software company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadella, who took the helm in February, is seeking to push Microsoft further toward mobile and 'cloud,' or Internet-connected, computing.

"You have to build deeply into the fabric of the company a culture that thrives on data."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From managing its own heating costs to analyzing customers' website usage, Nadella set out Microsoft's plan to play a central role in gathering, storing, processing and presenting data, taking advantage of its database products, data centers and its Office suite of applications, including the ubiquitous Excel spreadsheet program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Think of Office as the canvas, or the surface area, or the scaffolding from which you can access the data," said Nadella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His comments about a data-driven computing environment were not ground-breaking, but they form a part of a striking new approach at Microsoft, which Nadella calls "mobile first, cloud first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, that means focusing on making Microsoft's internet-friendly software widely available as services rather than traditional products, and playing a role in all realms of computing rather than just attempting to dominate markets with Windows and Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella made his latest appearance to boost Tuesday's launch of SQL Server 2014, the latest version of Microsoft's market-leading database software, worth more than $5 billion in sales per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also announced an early public test version of a cloud-based system for managing data automatically generated from machines, and the release of Microsoft's Analytics Platform System, which lets customers analyze large chunks of information, attacking the exploding market for what has become known as 'big data.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations could save $1.6 trillion over the next four years by unifying their data collection and analyzing it better, according to a report by tech research firm IDC, commissioned by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To be able to truly benefit from this platform you need to have a data culture inside of your organization.

      Research and Markets: Global High Performance Computing (HPC) Market 
      2014-2018 with Cray, Dell, HP  IBM Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/8rd6xq/global_high) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      High Performance Computing (HPC) Market 2014-2018 with Cray, Dell, HP  
      IBM Dominating" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global High Performance Computing (HPC) market to grow at a CAGR of 
      8% to 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the 
      increasing demand to maintain the data explosion. The Global HPC market 
      has also been witnessing the growing demand for HPCaaS. However, the 
      high implementation cost of compute resources could pose a challenge to 
      the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      HPC as a Service is fast gaining in popularity in the Global HPC market 
      since it offers high performance on demand and a scalable HPC computing 
      environment. The computing resources provided by the service providers 
      can vary in power, technology, and latency. HPCaaS helps optimize the 
      environment for HPC; with the help of HPCaaS, enterprises can solve the 
      problem of surge capacity for time-critical analysis by having resources 
      available as and when needed. HPCaaS has a centralized system so that 
      enterprises can minimize the impact of remote collaboration issues. 
      HPCaaS is designed to leverage the financial benefits of a managed 
      solution, cloud, while providing an infrastructure focused around HPC. 
      This gives enterprises the capability to meet an organization's research 
      and engineering compute requirements without incurring the capital and 
      operational costs associated with setting up an in-house HPC cluster.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the high implementation cost of HPC 
      resources is one of the major challenges confronting this market. The 
      deployment of HPC solutions is an expensive process, which needs a 
      detailed and usually costly process of defining requirements. This 
      increases the criticality of the process because, once deployed, further 
      costs may be incurred if any changes have to be made.

      Research and Markets: Global Data Center Integrated Workload Systems 
      Market 2014-2018 with Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM Corp., and Oracle Corp. 
      Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/dbrcms/global_data) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Data Center Integrated Workload Systems Market 2014-2018" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Data Center Integrated Workload Systems market to grow at a 
      CAGR of 49% to 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Among the numerous growth drivers for the Global Data Center IWS market, 
      increase in big data is the major growth driver. In data centers, highly 
      complex data traffic moves in a random order between storage, internet, 
      servers, and intranet. Moreover, there are varieties of traditional and 
      advanced data-intensive applications, including VoIP, storage access, 
      and emerging converged I/O.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In recent years, the markets have witnessed an increase in virtualized 
      networking environments in data centers. Additionally, customers have 
      been wishing to tune their networks but they have been limited by 
      constraints in network management tools. Virtualization has increased 
      the deployment of multi-core and blade server platforms, resulting in 
      consolidation of the storage environment. Virtual networks can be 
      programmed and bonded to workloads, and they are scalable to demand. 
      Moreover, they do not require physical network reconfiguration. As they 
      are not restricted by physical boundaries, the network resources can be 
      efficiently utilized across noncontiguous clusters. With traditional 
      networks it has been difficult to manage and integrate the systems they 
      support and the services delivered by them. Earlier attempts to bridge 
      this gap further increased the complexity of the network configuration 
      in understanding the application status and requirements, observing the 
      network traffic, and then replying according to the configured policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the main challenges is concerns 
      regarding vendor lock-in. The investment required for data center 
      integrated infrastructure systems is huge, and thus it takes time for 
      enterprises to generate a substantial return on investment. Implementing 
      a complete data center integrated infrastructure system solution usually 
      takes a considerable amount of time. This increases the criticality of 
      the process because, once the deployment has started, it becomes very 
      costly to make any changes.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates Banco Santander Chile's Upcoming Sr Bonds Totalling JPY27.3B 
      'A+'(exp)
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned a Long-term Foreign Currency rating of 
      'A+'(exp) to Banco Santander Chile's (BSC) senior unsecured Medium Term 
      Notes Program of up to JPY2020 billion to be issued in the TOKYO 
      PRO-BOND market and to the following tranches to be issued within the 
      programme:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      3 years JPY6.6 billion floating rate bonds
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      3 years JPY2 billion fixed rate bonds
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      5 years JPY18.7 billion fixed rate bonds
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bonds rank pari-passu with all of BSC's existing and future senior 
      unsecured debt. The final rating is contingent upon the receipt of final 
      documents conforming to information already received.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings assigned to BSC's new debt issuances correspond to the 
      bank's Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BSC's IDRs are driven by its Viability Rating (VR) of 'a+' and does not 
      factor in any extraordinary support from its parent, although it remains 
      a strategically important subsidiary for Santander.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BSC's VR and IDRs reflect its market-leadership position and its strong 
      franchise within Chile, whose economy continues to perform well. The 
      ratings also reflect the bank's healthy asset quality, adequate 
      profitability (albeit pressured in the last two years), adequate funding 
      capital position and independent management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BSC's liquidity benefits from a sizeable, historically stable, and 
      well-diversified retail deposit base. In addition, BSC has significantly 
      reduced refinancing risk and exposure to more price-sensitive 
      institutional deposits by growing core deposits and building a liquidity 
      cushion while maintaining access to capital markets without any apparent 
      rise in funding costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BSC's stand-alone capital is adequate for its rating category and its 
      liquidity position is strong, while its exposure to the Santander group 
      is negligible and constrained by stringent local regulations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Downward pressure for BSC's VR and IDRs could arise from sustained 
      pressure on profitability stemming from a further rise in loan loss 
      provisions or from markedly lower liquidity or capitalization. More 
      specifically, BSC's VR could be downgraded if its return on average 
      assets (ROAA) consistently remains below 1.3%, its Fitch Core Capital to 
      Weighted Assets ratio falls and is maintained below 9%, together with 
      asset quality deterioration and/or if the bank reduces its liquidity 
      cushion significantly and it remains well below its current levels. 
      There is limited upside potential in the near future for BSC's VR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch currently rates BSC as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Foreign and local currency long-term IDRs 'A+'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* To idle Wolverine, Willow Creek and Brule mines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* To record severance charge of $7 mln in Q2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares rise as much as 5.7 pct

 (Adds comments from analysts, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 15 (Reuters) - Coal miner Walter Energy Inc 
said it would idle its Canadian mines and temporarily lay off
about 700 employees, in the latest sign of stress in the
industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it would immediately stop production at its
Wolverine and Willow Creek mines in British Columbia, while its
Brule mine in the same province would likely shut down by July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter's shares, which rose as much as 5.7 percent in
morning trading, were down 1.6 percent at $7.67 in early
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coal companies are struggling with weak prices and a sharp
drop in demand for both thermal coal, used in power generation,
and metallurgical coal, used to make steel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James River Coal Co filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so-called "met" coal prices at $120 per ton for the
hard coking variety, Walter's Canadian operations were losing
about $27 million in annualized earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Brean Capital analyst
Lucas Pipes wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to idle the mines also highlighted Walter's
increasing dependence on its U.S. operations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's cost of sales in Canada was $132.55 per ton in
the fourth quarter, compared with $93.63 in the United States,
Walter said in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley analyst Evan Kurtz said in a note that the
idling of the mines would be positive for Walter's liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter, which said it would continue to operate preparation
plants to complete the processing of stockpiled coal, said it
expected to record a severance charge of about $7 million in the
second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said last year that it could cut production at
underperforming mines and explore the sale of non-core assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter cut its capital expenditure by about 60 percent to
$154 million in 2013 and said in February that it expects to
spend less than $150 million in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anannya Pramanick and Kanika Sikka in Bangalore;

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK/SANTIAGO, April 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a
Long-term 
Foreign Currency rating of 'A+'(exp) to Banco Santander Chile's
(BSC) senior 
unsecured Medium Term Notes Program of up to JPY2020 billion to
be issued in the 
TOKYO PRO-BOND market and to the following tranches to be issued
within the 
programme:
3 years JPY6.6 billion floating rate bonds 
3 years JPY2 billion fixed rate bonds
5 years JPY18.7 billion fixed rate bonds
The bonds rank pari-passu with all of BSC's existing and future
senior unsecured 
debt. The final rating is contingent upon the receipt of final
documents 
conforming to information already received.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
The ratings assigned to BSC's new debt issuances correspond to
the bank's 
Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A+'.
BSC's IDRs are driven by its Viability Rating (VR) of 'a+' and
does not factor 
in any extraordinary support from its parent, although it
remains a 
strategically important subsidiary for Santander. 
BSC's VR and IDRs reflect its market-leadership position and its
strong 
franchise within Chile, whose economy continues to perform well.
The ratings 
also reflect the bank's healthy asset quality, adequate
profitability (albeit 
pressured in the last two years), adequate funding capital
position and 
independent management.
BSC's liquidity benefits from a sizeable, historically stable,
and 
well-diversified retail deposit base. In addition, BSC has
significantly reduced 
refinancing risk and exposure to more price-sensitive
institutional deposits by 
growing core deposits and building a liquidity cushion while
maintaining access 
to capital markets without any apparent rise in funding costs. 
BSC's stand-alone capital is adequate for its rating category
and its liquidity 
position is strong, while its exposure to the Santander group is
negligible and 
constrained by stringent local regulations.
RATING SENSITIVITIES 
Downward pressure for BSC's VR and IDRs could arise from
sustained pressure on 
profitability stemming from a further rise in loan loss
provisions or from 
markedly lower liquidity or capitalization. More specifically,
BSC's VR could be 
downgraded if its return on average assets (ROAA) consistently
remains below 
1.3%, its Fitch Core Capital to Weighted Assets ratio falls and
is maintained 
below 9%, together with asset quality deterioration and/or if
the bank reduces 
its liquidity cushion significantly and it remains well below
its current 
levels. There is limited upside potential in the near future for
BSC's VR. 
Fitch currently rates BSC as follows:
--Foreign and local currency long-term IDRs 'A+'; Outlook
Stable;
--Foreign and local currency short-term IDRs 'F1';
--Viability rating 'a+';
--Support rating '1';
--Support rating floor 'A-';
--Long-term national rating 'AAA(cl)'; Outlook Stable;
--Short-term national rating 'N1+(cl)'; 
--Senior unsecured bonds 'A+' and national long-term rating
'AAA(cl)';
--Subordinated bonds national long-term rating 'AA(cl)';
--National equity rating 'Primera Clase nivel 1'.

annually through productivity improvements by 2016, and would 
redirect much of the savings into increased advertising and

 - in February to help compete in the home soda-making market,

urging them to review Coke's equity compensation plan before the
annual meeting on April 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wintergreen Chief Executive David Winters called the equity
plan "deeply flawed" and said Coke may need to spend $2 billion
per year to offset the dilution caused by the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winters has previously said the plan, when combined with
existing equity awards, could dilute shareholders' interests by
more than 14.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola shares were trading at $40.06 at 1:06 PM ET.

		&lt;p&gt;BIRMINGHAM, AL--(Marketwired - April 15, 2014) -
 Walter Energy, Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSX: WLT) will begin idling its Canadian operations, including the Wolverine and Brazion coal mines in British Columbia, in April 2014.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will place its Wolverine mine (located near the district municipality of Tumbler Ridge) on idle status effective immediately.&#160;Brazion (which includes the operations of Brule and Willow Creek and is located near the district municipality of Chetwynd) will continue to operate the Brule mine but expects to idle the mine by July 2014.&#160;The company will continue to operate its preparation plants at these mines to complete processing of coal that already has been mined and is in inventory.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 2013, coal production from Wolverine, which produces mid-volatile hard coking coal, was 1.6 million metric tons, while the Brazion mines produced approximately 1.9 million metric tons of low-vol PCI and 0.1 million metric tons of hard coking coal.&#160;As of December 31, 2013, Walter Energy had approximately 1.1 million metric tons of coal in inventory in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employment impacts include temporary layoffs of approximately 415 employees at the Wolverine mine, approximately 280 employees at Brazion, and other administrative support staff.&#160;A limited number of employees will remain at each site to operate the preparation plants and, once coal processing is complete, to perform ongoing equipment maintenance and provide ongoing security for the sites during the idle period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These layoffs are particularly unfortunate because our employees have worked very hard to keep these mines competitive in the face of daunting market conditions," said Walter J. Scheller III, Chief Executive Officer.&#160;"Equally important, they've worked safely."&#160;Scheller noted that the Brule mine completed 2013 without a reportable safety incident.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These coal reserves remain valuable assets," Scheller added.&#160;"However, given the current met coal pricing environment, our best course of action at this time is to idle these operations until we can achieve reasonable value from these reserves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company expects to incur severance charges of approximately $7 million in the second quarter of 2014 in connection with the idling of the mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Walter Energy

		&lt;h1&gt;CorvisaCloud Delivers New Level of Contact Center Flexibility With Voice and SMS Platform&lt;/h1&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;New Platform Gives Businesses and Developers the Power to Build Custom Communications Solutions to Meet Unique Business Needs&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;MILWAUKEE, WI--(Marketwired - Apr 15, 2014) - 
				Cloud-based contact center software provider, CorvisaCloud, LLC., today announced the release of its hosted voice and SMS platform. By expanding its offering from a product suite, to a product-plus-platform solution, CorvisaCloud gives businesses and developers the freedom and flexibility to build custom applications that address their exact communication needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new offering stems from CorvisaCloud's belief that one size does not fit all for communications software, an insight gained from working with clients of various sizes and industries who have implemented their contact center product suite. With the introduction of the CorvisaOne&#8482; platform, businesses no longer have to settle for "close enough" with their communication technologies. Instead, they can bring their specific contact center visions to fruition, while extending the longevity of their IT investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CorvisaOne platform allows customers and developers to easily create the exact applications needed for their business or contact center by giving them the ability to build voice and SMS apps from scratch or leverage and customize a la carte components of the CorvisaOne product suite, such as phone extensions, call queues or lead management features. Unlike other market solutions, CorvisaCloud eliminates the need for businesses to buy or manage their own infrastructure by handling all hosting, scaling and backend support on its enterprise-class network. A robust set of developer tools, including Git repositories for easy deployment, built in debugging and test frameworks and open source access to code libraries, expand the platform beyond a basic web services API or SDK. This flexibility grants businesses greater speed to market and ensures that solutions that work today can be easily reconfigured to meet tomorrow's needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ventana Research's benchmark research on contact centers in the cloud found that 44 percent of companies believe adopting systems in the cloud is the future when it comes to building modern infrastructure to manage customer interactions," says Richard Snow, vice president and research director of customer and contact center research at Ventana Research. "The new platform offering from CorvisaCloud addresses this need by simplifying manageability, and providing ease of adaptability for contact center processes in an organization."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CorvisaCloud has helped us deliver better service to our customers with its IVR product for over two years. We have always been pleased by the reliability and functionality of the company's software, but the unlimited flexibility that we will gain with the CorvisaOne platform will truly transform our telephony experience," said Larry D. Beck, director, Heartland Billing Solutions, Heartland Payment Systems. "The CorvisaOne platform will allow us to meet the exact needs of each of our clients with minimal effort and no backend maintenance -- it's a game changer." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new CorvisaOne platform underscores CorvisaCloud's commitment to extending the enterprise-ready capabilities of their offerings. Key features of the CorvisaOne platform include:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Full hosting, scaling and backend support: Provides unprecedented scalability and support for customers by eliminating the need for them to buy or maintain infrastructure or hardware.
            
				App creation and product modification options: CorvisaCloud's Summit environment, based on the standard Lua programming language, allows developers to easily create applications or customize CorvisaCloud's products to meet current and future business needs.
            
				Powerful developer tools: Git code management repositories, built in debugging and test frameworks and access to code libraries, allow developers to make and deploy changes with ease.
            
				Enterprise compliance and reliability: Maintains stringent compliance and security standards, including PCI, SOX and HIPAA, so businesses can ensure uptime and security for their critical communications systems.&#160;
			&lt;p&gt;"Our goal is to offer businesses the ultimate flexibility by meeting 100 percent of their needs instead of just 80 or 90 percent.&#160;Our new platform-plus-product model allows any customer to have the ideal voice communications solution for their business without worrying about upfront expenditures, ongoing maintenance or scalability," said Matt Lautz, president of CorvisaCloud.&#160;"We believe this will bring significant value to enterprises with complex communication needs while letting developers focus on developing great apps instead of managing infrastructure. The opportunities for what can be created are really limitless." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on the CorvisaOne platform, please visit www.corvisacloud.com/platform.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About CorvisaCloud
				CorvisaCloud brings customer success to the heart of every business interaction through our cloud-based communications software platform and consulting services.&#160;We help businesses work smarter, save money, and make customers happier... and with our passion for service, we make getting there an enjoyable experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 15 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co reported an 8
percent fall in quarterly net earnings after a decline in

&lt;p&gt;The company's net income attributable to shareholders fell
to $1.62 billion, or 36 cents per share, in the first quarter
ended March 28 from $1.75 billion, or 39 cents per share, a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding items, earnings were 44 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 4 percent to $10.58 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said that while global sales volumes rose 2
percent in the quarter, volumes fell 4 percent in Europe.

      The Coca-Cola Company today reported first quarter 2014 operating 
      results. Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The 
      Coca-Cola Company said, &#8220;Our growth momentum is steadily improving in 
      line with our expectations, as we delivered sequentially stronger volume 
      growth of 2% in the quarter while gaining global volume and value share 
      in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. While we are making meaningful 
      progress across our five strategic priorities to restore our momentum, 
      we are firmly committed to further advancing our growth trajectory 
      through 2014 as we are accelerating marketing investments in our brands 
      and focusing relentlessly on marketplace execution in partnership with 
      our bottling partners around the world. In the near term, we are 
      committed to delivering on our performance goals and generating 
      increased shareowner value through improved productivity efforts and 
      targeted investments. All of us at The Coca-Cola Company remain 
      confident in our ability to deliver on our strategies while further 
      strengthening our foundation for profitable and sustainable long-term 
      growth toward our 2020 Vision.&#8221;

			PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company reported worldwide volume growth of 2% for the 
      first quarter and gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic 
      ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages, as we continue to leverage the 
      strongest portfolio of brands in the industry. Volume in our developed 
      markets was down 1%, impacted by the shift in the Easter holiday from 
      the first quarter last year to the second quarter this year. However, 
      volume increased in certain key developed markets, including Japan (+3%) 
      and Australia (+1%), while volume in North America was even. Volume grew 
      3% in our developing and emerging markets, with China (+12%) and Brazil 
      (+4%) both accelerating sequentially due to strong marketing campaigns 
      centered around holiday programming and the FIFA World CupTM 
      as well as a systemwide focus on execution. India and Russia both grew 
      volume 6% while gaining NARTD volume and value share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After adjusting for the deconsolidation of certain Company-owned 
      bottling operations in 2013, the Company delivered comparable currency 
      neutral net revenue growth of 2%, capturing global price/mix of 2% on 
      concentrate sales volume that was even in the quarter. Excluding the 
      impact of these structural changes, we grew comparable currency neutral 
      operating income 7%, while investing in brand-building initiatives. The 
      Company returned $713 million in cash to its shareowners through net 
      share repurchases in the quarter, and we are on track to repurchase 
      between $2.5 to $3.0 billion in shares by the end of the year. In 
      February, the Company increased our quarterly dividend 9% to $0.305 per 
      share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.22 per share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worldwide sparkling beverage volume was down 1% for the quarter, as we 
      gained global value share and maintained global volume share in 
      sparkling beverages. As anticipated, the shift in the Easter holiday 
      impacted our global sparkling portfolio&#8217;s performance for the quarter. 
      In addition, our sparkling volume in Great Britain was down double 
      digits as our bottling partner maintained disciplined pricing in the 
      quarter, which we expect will remain rational going forward, and as our 
      system transitioned into a new 1.75L consumer-relevant package. 
      Importantly, we are seeing initial positive results in key markets where 
      we have incrementally invested to drive growth. In China, increased 
      marketing efforts coupled with a strong activation of our Chinese New 
      Year programming resulted in double-digit transaction growth as we 
      focused on driving consumption of our entry-level immediate consumption 
      packages. In North America, accelerated media investments with 
      successful Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics and Super Bowl advertising drove a 
      sequential improvement in brand Coca-Cola volume.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We grew worldwide still beverage volume 8% for the quarter, with solid 
      volume growth across multiple beverage categories, including juices and 
      juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas, packaged water, sports drinks and 
      energy drinks. We gained global volume and value share in total still 
      beverages, including juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas, 
      packaged water and sports drinks.

			Eurasia  Africa
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our Eurasia and Africa Group grew volume 2%, cycling a strong 15%, and 
        maintained volume share in NARTD beverages. Four of the group&#8217;s five 
        business units delivered volume growth for the quarter despite a 
        challenging macroeconomic environment and social unrest in certain 
        markets.
      
			
        Price/mix increased a strong 9% due to positive pricing in the 
        majority of markets coupled with favorable geographic mix. Reported 
        operating income grew 7% in the quarter with comparable currency 
        neutral operating income increasing 23%, reflecting solid revenue 
        growth as well as the timing and tight control of operating expenses, 
        partially offset by increased investments in our brands.
      
			
        During the quarter, Eurasia and Africa continued to focus on driving 
        executional capabilities in the marketplace, programming around the 
        Olympics, and integrated marketing campaigns such as &#8220;Coke with 
        Meals&#8221;. Sparkling beverage volume grew 1%, led by brand Coca-Cola in 
        Russia, which increased 9%, as we concluded a robust calendar of 
        marketing activities related to the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. Still 
        beverage volume grew 7% in the quarter, resulting in volume and value 
        share gains, with balanced volume growth across all categories.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Europe
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Volume in our Europe Group was down 4%, driven primarily by the shift 
        of the Easter holiday into the second quarter this year and the impact 
        of our bottling partner maintaining disciplined pricing in Great 
        Britain while transitioning into a new 1.75L consumer-relevant package 
        for sparkling beverages.
      
			
        Concentrate sales were ahead of unit case sales primarily due to the 
        timing of shipments. For the full year, we expect concentrate sales to 
        be in line with unit case sales. The consolidation of the innocent 
        juice and smoothie business in second quarter 2013 delivered 7 points 
        of Europe&#8217;s price/mix and disproportionately contributed to net 
        revenues as compared to operating income due to the higher cost 
        structure associated with a finished goods business and our level of 
        investment in innocent as we continue to build and expand the 
        business. Reported operating income increased 5% in the quarter. 
        Comparable currency neutral operating income increased 4% in the 
        quarter, driven by positive pricing in the majority of markets, 
        favorable geographic mix and the favorable timing of operating 
        expenses, partially offset by the consolidation of the innocent 
        business.
      
			
        Our sparkling beverage volume declined 5% in the quarter, while still 
        beverage volume grew 1%.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Latin America
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Volume growth of 1% in Latin America in the quarter was driven by 
        renewed momentum in our Brazil business unit, which benefited from 
        robust marketing campaigns, centered around the FIFA World CupTM 
        and the Carnival holiday, as well as favorable weather. Volume in
				our 
        Latin Center (+5%) and South Latin (+2%) business units continued to 
        grow, partially offset by a low single-digit volume decline in Mexico 
        given the new excise tax that impacted the beverage industry and our 
        business.
      
			
        Unit case sales were ahead of concentrate sales primarily due to the 
        timing of shipments. For the full year, we expect concentrate sales to 
        be in line with unit case sales. Price/mix for the group increased 
        11%, reflecting positive pricing in all four business units as well as 
        the underlying inflationary environment in several markets. Reported 
        operating income decreased 12% in the quarter, with comparable 
        currency neutral operating income up 8%, reflecting positive pricing 
        coupled with favorable geographic mix, partially offset by strong 
        investments in our brands, including investments related to the FIFA 
        World CupTM.
      
		
		
			
        Sparkling beverage volume for the group was down 1%, reflecting the 
        impact of the new excise tax in Mexico, while we drove sparkling 
        volume growth in the remaining three business units, leading to 
        maintained volume share in core sparkling beverages. Still beverage 
        volume grew high single digits, driven by solid growth across all 
        business units, resulting in volume and value share gains in total 
        still beverages, including ready-to-drink teas, sports drinks and 
        packaged water.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			North America
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our North America Group delivered even volume versus the prior year 
        quarter while gaining value share and maintaining volume share.
      
			
        Price/mix for our sparkling business increased 2%, reflecting the 
        further implementation of our new pricing strategy, while overall 
        price/mix for the group was even. Reported operating income increased 
        25%, which includes items impacting comparability, principally net 
        gains/losses related to our economic hedges. Comparable currency 
        neutral operating income declined 8% in the quarter, reflecting one 
        less selling day in the quarter, the shift in the Easter holiday and 
        the timing of operating expenses, and is expected to normalize 
        throughout the year.
      
			
        Our sparkling beverage volume declined 1% in the quarter, although it 
        outperformed the rest of the industry as we leveraged our 
        occasion-brand-price-package-channel (OBPPC) architecture to deliver 
        value share growth ahead of volume share growth. Brand Coca-Cola 
        volume was even in the quarter, a sequential improvement, and we saw 
        significant improvement in brand health metrics driven by both the 
        quantity and quality of media investments around Super Bowl and Sochi 
        2014 Winter Olympics programming. Our flavored sparkling portfolio did 
        well in the quarter, with Fanta up 3% and Sprite up 1%. Still beverage 
        volume grew 3% in the quarter, with balanced growth and volume and 
        value share gains across most still beverage categories, making this 
        the 16th consecutive quarter that our still beverage 
        portfolio has either maintained or gained both volume and value share. 
        Powerade continued its growth trajectory, up 9%, with growth coming 
        from both the base business and the new Powerade Zero Drops. Our juice 
        and juice drinks business continues to grow volume, led by Simply, up 
        10%, with significant improvement in brand health metrics driven by 
        both the quantity and quality of media investments.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Asia Pacific
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our Asia Pacific Group grew volume 7% in the quarter, resulting in 
        volume share growth in total NARTD beverages. Growth was broad based, 
        including 12% growth in China, 6% growth in India and 3% growth in 
        Japan.
      
			
        Concentrate sales in the quarter were ahead of unit case sales 
        primarily due to the timing of shipments. For the full year, we expect 
        concentrate sales to be in line with unit case sales. Unfavorable 
        price/mix in the quarter was primarily a result of geographic mix as 
        well as shifts in product and channel mix within individual markets. 
        Reported operating income was down 8% in the quarter. Comparable 
        currency neutral operating income increased 2% in the quarter, 
        reflecting volume growth partially offset by unfavorable price/mix and 
        continued investments behind our brands.
      
			
        Sparkling beverage volume increased low single digits in the quarter, 
        led by brand Coca-Cola (+2%) and Sprite (+4%), resulting in volume and 
        value share gains. Still beverage volume grew double digits in the 
        quarter, with volume share gains in total still beverages, including 
        juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas, packaged water and 
        sports drinks.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bottling Investments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our Bottling Investments Group (BIG) grew volume 5% in the quarter on 
        a comparable basis, led by China and India, after adjusting for the 
        net impact of structural changes, primarily the deconsolidation of the 
        Philippine and Brazilian bottling operations in 2013. BIG volume, 
        including the impact of structural changes, was down 10% in the 
        quarter.
      
			
        The reported operating loss for the quarter was $26 million, which 
        includes restructuring charges associated with our Company-owned 
        bottling operations in Germany. Comparable currency neutral operating 
        income decreased 79% due to the structural changes referenced above 
        and one less selling day in the quarter, partially offset by improved 
        performance in certain markets.

			FINANCIAL REVIEW
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Summary of First Quarter 2014 Financial Performance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported net revenues declined 4%. Unit case sales were in line with 
      concentrate sales after adjusting for the effect of one less selling day 
      in the quarter and structural changes. Excluding the impact of 
      structural changes, comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 2% in 
      the quarter, reflecting even concentrate sales and positive price/mix. 
      Structural changes that impacted net revenues were primarily the 
      deconsolidation of bottling operations in the Philippines and Brazil in 
      2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported operating income decreased 1%. Currency was a 10% headwind and 
      structural changes were a 2% headwind on comparable operating income. 
      Excluding the impact of structural changes, comparable currency neutral 
      operating income increased 7%. Despite the effect of one less selling 
      day in the quarter and strategically investing in brand-building 
      initiatives around the world, we captured positive operating expense 
      leverage as we benefited from the timing of operating expenses, while 
      also continuing to efficiently manage our operating costs. Items 
      impacting comparability reduced first quarter 2014 operating income by 
      $83 million and reduced first quarter 2013 operating income by $203 
      million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported EPS was $0.36 and comparable EPS was $0.44. Items impacting 
      comparability reduced first quarter 2014 reported EPS by a net $0.08 and 
      reduced first quarter 2013 reported EPS by a net $0.07. Comparable 
      currency neutral EPS was up 5% for the quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.2% and the 
      underlying effective annual tax rate was 23.0%. The variance between the 
      reported rate and the underlying rate was due to the tax effect of 
      various items impacting comparability, separately disclosed in this 
      document in the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
      schedule.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The underlying effective tax rate does not reflect the impact of 
      significant or unusual items and discrete events, which, if and when 
      they occur, are separately recognized in the appropriate period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      First quarter cash from operations was $1.1 billion, up 123%, primarily 
      due to cycling incremental pension contributions last year and the 
      efficient management of working capital, partially offset by an 
      unfavorable impact from currency exchange rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first quarter, our net share repurchases totaled $713 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Currency
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on recent changes to the Venezuelan currency exchange rate 
      mechanisms, we changed the exchange rate we used to remeasure our 
      Venezuelan subsidiary&#8217;s financial statements into U.S. dollars. As of 
      March 28, 2014, we used the exchange rate determined by periodic 
      auctions for U.S. dollars conducted under Venezuela&#8217;s Complementary 
      System of Foreign Currency Administration (SICAD 1). As of March 28, 
      2014, the SICAD 1 rate was 10.8 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, compared to 
      the official exchange rate of 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar we 
      previously used. During the first quarter, the Company recorded charges 
      of $247 million related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on our current projections, we expect this change in exchange 
      rates to have an unfavorable currency impact on our operating income for 
      the remainder of 2014. Additionally, the Venezuelan government issued a 
      new law on fair pricing establishing the maximum profit a business can 
      earn in Venezuela. We are currently evaluating the impact the new law 
      may have on our 2014 operating results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2014 Outlook
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bottling transactions completed in 2013 are anticipated to have an 
      unfavorable 1% structural impact on both our full-year 2014 net revenues 
      and operating income, with the full impact occurring in the first half 
      of the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Currency exchange rates are expected to have an unfavorable impact on 
      our reported results in 2014. Based on current spot rates, our existing 
      hedge positions, and the cycling of our prior year rates, we estimate 
      currency will be an approximate 7% headwind on our full-year operating 
      income, and an approximate 7% headwind on our second quarter operating 
      income. This outlook reflects the negative impact of the Venezuela 
      devaluation, partially offset by slight improvements in other currencies 
      as compared to the outlook we provided at the time of our year-end 2013 
      earnings release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The underlying effective annual tax rate on operations in 2014 is 
      expected to remain unchanged at approximately 23.0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2014, we are targeting net share repurchases of $2.5 to $3.0 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period.
      
			
        &#8220;Concentrate sales&#8221; represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, 
        beverage bases and powders sold by, or used in finished beverages sold 
        by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers.
      
			
        &#8220;Sparkling beverages&#8221; means NARTD beverages with carbonation, 
        including energy drinks and carbonated waters and flavored waters.
      
			
        &#8220;Still beverages&#8221; means nonalcoholic beverages without carbonation,

        juices and juice drinks, teas, coffees, sports drinks and 
        noncarbonated energy drinks.
      
			
        All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit 
        case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are 
        computed based on average daily sales, unless otherwise noted. &#8220;Unit 
        case&#8221; means a unit of measurement equal to 24 eight-ounce servings of 
        finished beverage. &#8220;Unit case volume&#8221; means the number of unit cases 
        (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverages directly or indirectly 
        sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers.
      
			
        First quarter 2014 financial results were impacted by one less selling 
        day, and fourth quarter 2014 financial results will be impacted by one 
        additional selling day. Unit case volume results for the quarters are 
        not impacted by the variance in selling days due to the average daily 
        sales computation referenced above.
      
			
        As previously announced, effective Jan. 1, 2014, the Company renamed 
        our Pacific operating segment the Asia Pacific operating segment.
      
			
        The Company reports its financial results in accordance with 
        accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). 
        However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures 
        provide users with additional meaningful financial information that 
        should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. 
        Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making 
        financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the 
        Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in 
        addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported 
        results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial 
        information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.

      first quarter 2014 results today, April 15, 2014 at 9:30 a.m. EDT. We 
      invite investors to listen to a live audiocast of the conference call at 
      our website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com 
      in the &#8220;Investors section&#8221;. A replay in downloadable MP3 format and a 
      transcript of the call will also be available within 24 hours after the 
      audiocast on our website. Further, the &#8220;Investors&#8221; section of our 
      website includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, which 
      may be used periodically by management when discussing our financial 
      results with investors and analysts, to our results as reported under 
      GAAP.

      The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting 
      principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP" or referred 
      to herein as "reported"). However, management believes that certain 
      non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful 
      financial information that should be considered when assessing our 
      ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial 
      measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in 
      evaluating the Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should 
      be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company&#8217;s 
      reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP 
      financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of 
      accounting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The following information is provided to give qualitative and 
      quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items 
      impacting comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, 
      our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly 
      titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to 
      consider as "items impacting comparability" based on how management 
      views our business; makes financial, operating and planning decisions; 
      and evaluates the Company's ongoing performance. Items such as charges, 
      gains and accounting changes which are viewed by management as impacting 
      only the current period or the comparable period, but not both, or as 
      relating to different and unrelated underlying activities or events 
      across comparable periods, are generally considered "items impacting 
      comparability". In addition, we provide the impact that changes in 
      foreign currency exchange rates had on our financial results ("currency 
      neutral").

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months ended March&#160;28, 2014 and March&#160;29, 2013, the 
      Company recorded charges of $42 million and $21 million, respectively, 
      related to the integration of our German bottling and distribution 
      operations as well as other restructuring initiatives outside the scope 
      of the Company's productivity and reinvestment program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Productivity and Reinvestment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months ended March&#160;28, 2014 and March&#160;29, 2013, the 
      Company recorded charges of $86 million and $102&#160;million, respectively, 
      related to our productivity and reinvestment program. This program is 
      focused on the following initiatives: global supply chain optimization; 
      global marketing and innovation effectiveness; operating expense 
      leverage and operational excellence; data and information technology 
      systems standardization; and further integration of CCE's former North 
      America business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In February 2014, the Company announced that we are expanding our 
      productivity and reinvestment program to drive an incremental $1&#160;billion 
      in productivity by 2016 that will primarily be redirected into increased 
      media investments. Our incremental productivity goal consists of two 
      relatively equal components. First, expanded savings through global 
      supply chain optimization, data and information technology system 
      standardization, and resource and cost reallocation. These savings will 
      be reinvested in global brand-building initiatives, with an emphasis on 
      increased media spending. Second, we will be increasing the 
      effectiveness of our marketing investments by transforming our marketing 
      and commercial model to redeploy resources into more consumer-facing 
      marketing investments to accelerate growth.

		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months ended March&#160;28, 2014 and March&#160;29, 2013, the 
      Company recorded net charges of $6 million and $30&#160;million, 
      respectively. These amounts represent the Company&#8217;s proportionate share 
      of unusual or infrequent items recorded by certain of our equity method 
      investees.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months ended March&#160;29, 2013, the Company recorded a 
      charge of $1 million related to transaction costs associated with the 
      pending merger of certain bottling partners. The Company also recorded a 
      benefit of $1 million related to an adjustment to the Company's loss on 
      the sale of a majority interest in our previously consolidated 
      Philippine bottling operations to Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. in 
      January 2013.

			Impact of Natural Disasters
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused widespread flooding and wind 
      damage across the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, primarily in 
      New York and New Jersey. During the three months ended March&#160;29, 2013, 
      the Company reversed charges of $3 million due to the refinement of 
      previously established accruals related to the loss or damage of certain 
      fixed assets resulting from the hurricane.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Economic (Nondesignated) Hedges
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company uses derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price 
      risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing 
      process as well as the purchase of vehicle fuel. Although these 
      derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge 
      accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in fair 
      values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company excludes the net impact of mark-to-market adjustments for 
      outstanding hedges and realized gains/losses for settled hedges from our 
      non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying 
      exposure being hedged impacts our condensed consolidated statement of 
      income. We believe this adjustment provides meaningful information 
      related to the impact of our economic hedging activities. During the 
      three months ended March&#160;28, 2014 and March&#160;29, 2013, the net impact of 
      the Company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities 
      described above resulted in a decrease of $45 million and an increase of 
      $82 million, respectively, to our non-GAAP operating income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Hyperinflationary Economies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months ended March&#160;28, 2014 and March&#160;29, 2013, the 
      Company recorded charges of $247 million and $149 million, respectively, 
      related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, including our 
      proportionate share of the charges incurred by an equity method investee 
      which has operations in Venezuela.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Certain Tax Matters
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months ended March&#160;28, 2014 and March&#160;29, 2013, the 
      Company recorded a net tax charge of $5&#160;million and $1 million, 
      respectively, related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to 
      our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Currency Neutral
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Management evaluates the operating performance of our Company and our 
      international subsidiaries on a currency neutral basis. We determine our 
      currency neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as 
      appropriate, our current period actual U.S. dollar operating results by 
      the current period actual exchange rates (that include the impact of 
      current period currency hedging activities), to derive our current 
      period local currency operating results. We then multiply or divide, as 
      appropriate, the derived current period local currency operating results 
      by the foreign currency exchange rates (that also include the impact of 
      the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) used to 
      translate the Company's financial statements in the comparable prior 
      year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating 
      results would have been if the foreign currency exchange rates had not 
      changed from the comparable prior year period.

				STEALTHbits Technologies Inc., a leading supplier of unstructured data and Microsoft infrastructure solutions, announced today the launch of a new rating system designed to measure the difficulty of verifying Microsoft Security Bulletin deployments to Windows desktop and server infrastructure.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEALTHbits' StealthAUDIT Management Platform has been leveraged by some of the world's largest organizations for over a decade to verify the proper application of Microsoft patches following 'Patch Tuesday' releases.&#160;With the launch of the new Patch Validation Index (PVI), STEALTHbits' customers and all organizations will have a monthly point of reference to determine how difficult it is for each Security Bulletin to be verified using conventional methods, such as scripting and manual checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The term 'Patch Management' may no longer have the cache it once had, but it's something that many organizations still struggle with today," says Adam Laub, VP of Marketing for STEALTHbits Technologies.&#160;"Pushing the patches really isn't the problem.&#160;There are multiple mature offerings available to provision patches across an enterprise, but what organizations encounter problems with is verifying that the patches actually made it to the desired destinations and installed properly.&#160;You can't trust your provisioning application to tell you that.&#160;It's like asking the chef if the cookies are good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel that patching is still, and will continue to be, a vital component of every organization's security programs," said Jonathan Sander, Strategy and Research Officer for STEALTHbits Technologies.&#160;"It's the blocking and tackling of IT Security.&#160;If you aren't patched properly, then you're only as strong as your weakest link."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEALTHbits began providing a solution to verify Microsoft patch releases in 2003 in order to fill a critical gap in the patch management processes of their first three customers -- the world's largest General Merchandiser, largest Telecommunications provider, and third largest Mail, Package, and Freight Delivery firm.&#160;Each organization had multiple patch provisioning frameworks at their disposal, but no way to validate that the patches they pushed were installing properly.&#160;As a result, teams within these organizations would work around the clock, often extending into the next month's patch cycle, to ensure the proper patches were installed on each system.&#160;The process was time and labor intensive, in addition to error prone and often, incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each month, STEALTHbits builds validation routines as plug-in job sets within the StealthAUDIT Management Platform and distributes them to subscribing customers.&#160;The validation routines encompass all the proper checks, from operating system, software, file versions, registry values, and more to definitively determine whether or not each patch is installed and taking effect.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, these checks are performed in an entirely agent-less scan, eliminating the need to deploy any code to target systems.&#160;The result is near instant verification of patch deployments that save organizations thousands of potential man-hours per year, in addition to drastically mitigating the risk of being subject the exploits the patches are designed to fix, in turn increasing an organization's security posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, visit http://www.stealthbits.com/PVI, email sales@stealthbits.com, or call +1-201-447-9300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABOUT STEALTHbits Technologies

      Research and Markets: Global Cloud System Management Software Market 
      2014-2018 with BMC Software, CA Technologies, IBM  VMware Inc Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/fvhmcm/global_cloud) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Cloud System Management Software Market 2014-2018" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Cloud System Management Software market will grow at a CAGR 
      of 32% to 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers is the increasing adoption of hybrid cloud 
      computing solutions by enterprises worldwide. Private cloud 
      infrastructure and public cloud computing are in demand among 
      enterprises. Hybrid cloud is an integrated model of both private and 
      public cloud models.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: Cloud computing 
      and cloud-based services are being widely adopted by enterprises and 
      end-users. Cloud computing equipment and infrastructure are located in 
      different locations, making it difficult to manage the equipment. 
      Enterprises and cloud-based service providers are looking at 
      consolidating the equipment at a single location, which can ease the 
      management of the computing infrastructure. The cloud systems management 
      software applications are capable of cloud configurability, centralized 
      management, collaboration, control, and maintenance. To tap this growing 
      opportunity, many vendors are providing application and infrastructure 
      collaboration features in cloud systems management software to 
      enterprises.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the security of enterprise networks is 
      one of the major concerns of end-users and enterprises across the world. 
      The increasing complexity of the network infrastructure is leading to an 
      increase in loopholes in the system. Cloud system management software 
      solutions are expected to bridge all the gaps in the system and increase 
      the security of the data being accessed and transmitted across 
      enterprise networks. Therefore, enterprises are expecting higher 
      security features to be incorporated as a part of the cloud system 
      management software. The majority of enterprises are storing their 
      critical business information and data in cloud storage, which is 
      increasing the security risk. The efficient retrieval of data and secure 
      access by applications is also a major challenge for the vendors of 
      cloud system management software solutions.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Sonia Gandhi, president of India's ruling Congress party, has issued a rare direct appeal to the nation not to return an opposition she said was motivated by "hatred and falsehood" in the country's general election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-minute TV address was aired at prime time on Hindi-language channels just as an opinion poll showed for the first time that an alliance led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could win an outright majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their vision, clouded with hatred and falsehood, their ideology, divisive and autocratic, will drive us to ... ruination," the Italian-born widow of 1980s prime minister Rajiv Gandhi said in the clip broadcast on Monday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gandhi, 67, has taken centre stage in a bid to avert what polls predict will be the worst-ever election defeat for Congress, after a weak campaign led by her son and political heir apparent, Rahul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP dismissed the address as "a farewell speech given in desperation", driving home an advantage it has reaped from recent accounts by former government insiders that Sonia Gandhi had kept Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on a tight leash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She wants to give power to the people but did not give power to the prime minister," Prakash Javadekar, the BJP's national spokesman, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEART AND SOUL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting in a book-lined study and wearing a dark red Sari, Sonia Gandhi did not mention the BJP's prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, by name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But her comments clearly targeted his brand of Hindu nationalism that she believes poses a threat to social peace in India's diverse society of 1.2 billion, and at a BJP campaign focused on Modi that critics say smacks of a personality cult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is this, the very heart and soul of India, that we are fighting to protect in this election, from those who seek to change it, and to divide us," said Gandhi. "They want to impose uniformity. They say: 'Just believe in me.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi, 63, is campaigning as a no-nonsense administrator who has fought corruption and nurtured investment during more than a decade as chief minister of the western state of Gujarat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But questions persist over an eruption of sectarian bloodshed in Gujarat in 2002 in which more than 1,000 were killed, mostly Muslims. Modi has denied accusations that he failed to halt the riots, and a Supreme Court inquiry found that he had no case to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior Modi aide has, however, been banned from campaigning by the election authorities for statements directed at minority Muslims in Uttar Pradesh that promoted "hatred and ill-will". The northern state, India's most populous, is a must-win territory for any party staking a claim on power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's five-week general election, which kicked off on April 7, has seen a high turnout so far in what some analysts say is evidence of a "Modi wave" that could propel the BJP to power for the first time in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest opinion poll, for private news channel NDTV, showed the BJP and its allies winning 275 parliamentary seats, enough for a three-seat majority. That was an increase of 16 seats from the last NDTV poll just over a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest round of voting comes on Thursday, with 122 seats being contested in regions in the north, including Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka in the south and Rajasthan in the northwest. Voting ends on May 12, with results due on May 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Manoj Kumar; Writing by Douglas Busvine; Editing by John Chalmers and Ron Popeski)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, April 16 (Reuters) - Disappointing results
from Google Inc  and IBM may unnerve
investors shaken by a strong recent selloff in tech stocks,
underscoring the challenges the Internet and IT sectors face as
corporate report cards come due in coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies, both barometers of their respective
industries, posted March-quarter results on Wednesday that
missed Wall Street's revenue targets, and their shares fell in
after hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM blamed weak hardware sales for its lowest quarterly
revenue in five years, worsened by an 11 percent slide in
overall sales in emerging markets including China, Brazil,
Russia and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That spells trouble for other tech companies reliant on
enterprise-spending, such as Oracle, Cisco,
EMC and Hewlett-Packard, which report results
this month or next. Like IBM, they have struggled to grow their
businesses, particularly in China, whose economy is
down-shifting after years of hyper-growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise spending in general has been on the wane for 
traditional computing giants as corporations and even
governments increasingly turn to software-as-a-service (SaaS)
and other cloud offerings instead of maintaining their own
in-house technology infrastructure. Many, including IBM and
Oracle, have been left behind by smaller, younger rivals as
spending goes toward emerging areas like big data, cloud and
cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing a lot of traditional technology vendors
struggle," said FBR analyst Dan Ives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're seeing spending go away from big-bang projects
toward smaller, more modular types of deployments, which speaks
to why a lot of SaaS players are doing well. Customers want to
buy just the drink rather than the whole bar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's and IBM's poor results on Wednesday may do little
to change investors' sentiment following a recent drop in tech
stocks. Since early March, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has
fallen over 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOBILE AD WORRIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the latest results factored in, including IBM and
Google, tech earnings growth estimates for the quarter have
fallen by roughly two-thirds since the start of the year,
according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 1, as the first quarter got under way, analysts on
average predicted tech earnings would grow by 7 percent. But
now, as first-quarter reports trickle out, analysts on average
expect growth of just 2.4 percent, according to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That also marks a deceleration in tech profit growth from
the fourth quarter, when it totaled 10.3 percent, but it is an
improvement from 2013's first quarter, when tech profits shrank
by 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Google's case, investors initially pummeled the stock in
after-hours trading after the world's largest Internet company
reported its miss, plus a drop in margins as cost-per-click, or
the average price of an online ad, slid 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares rebounded after CFO Patrick Pichette attributed
that profitability decline to a spike in expenses partly because
of its $3.2 billion acquisition of home automation pioneer Nest
last quarter, which tacked on a raft of payroll and research
costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the three largest Internet corporations -
Google, Facebook Inc  and Twitter Inc - have
each grappled with advertising on mobile devices, where the
growth is currently concentrated, and where smartphones with
smaller displays typically command lower ad prices than on
desktop PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For investors in Google, accustomed to the company enjoying
one of the highest ad margins in the business, mobile ads have
translated to a steep drop in ad rates. The transition has been
less jarring at Facebook, which once relied almost exclusively
on low-margin display or banner ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, which had difficulty monetizing its 140-character
stream-of-consciousness messaging model, is catching on with TV
advertisers because of its growing position as a "second screen"
to accompany TV viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are trying to adapt to a new delivery system which
is mobile," said B. Riley &amp; Co analyst Sameet Sinha. "It is a
challenge for most companies, and it's going to be here for the
next couple of years."

      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2011-C4
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed seven classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp., commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates, series 2011-C4 (JPMCC 2011-C4). A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations reflect the stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool. There have been no delinquent or specially serviced 
      loans since issuance. As of the April 2014 distribution date, the pool's 
      aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 5% to $1.38 billion from 
      $1.45 billion at issuance. There are currently no loans on the 
      servicer's watchlist.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest loan (14% of pool) is secured by 972,484 square feet (sf) of 
      a 1.15 million sf regional mall located in Jersey City, NJ. The mall is 
      anchored by Macy's, JC Penney (non-collateral), Sears, and Kohl's. Major 
      tenants include AMC Lowes Theatre, Pay Half, and Forever XXI. Year-end 
      (YE) 2013 in-line sales improved to approximately $525 per square foot 
      (psf) from $472 psf at issuance. Macy's also reported improved sales of 
      $301 psf compared to $268 psf at issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fourth largest loan (7.7%) is secured by a 541,026 sf mixed-use 
      complex located along the waterfront in the Financial District of San 
      Francisco, CA. The previous largest tenant, ATT, which occupied 
      approximately 29% of the NRA, vacated at its August 2013 lease 
      expiration. A new tenant, Salesforce.com, has leased the former ATT 
      space and additional square footage for a total of 43% of the NRA. The 
      new tenant's rent will commence in phases: starting in August 2014 on 
      17% of the NRA; February 2015 on an additional 11%; May 2015 on an 
      additional 14%; and May 2017 on the remaining 1%. Salesforce.com's rent 
      would be in the range of $45 to $46 psf, compared to ATT's average rent 
      of approximately $37 psf prior to vacating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The sixth largest loan (5.6%) is secured by a 606,233 sf, nine-building 
      office complex located in downtown San Jose, CA. One of the largest 
      tenants, GSA, which occupies 6.4% of the NRA, had recently renewed its 
      lease until October 2022 (on 3.7% of NRA) and January 2027 (2.7%). The 
      GSA lease had a prior lease expiration of May 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The eighth largest loan (4.5%) is secured by a 433,900 sf anchored 
      shopping center located at the base of the San Francisco Bay Bridge in 
      Emeryville, CA. Two of the largest tenants, Pak N' Save and Sports 
      Authority, both renewed their leases for an additional five years to 
      June 2019 and November 2019, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All classes maintain Stable Rating Outlooks. Due to the recent issuance 
      of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics. Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in 
      the 'J.P Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2011-C4' (May 
      17, 2011) report, available at www.fitchratings.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$6.1 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 16 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp
 reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue as
weakness in its storage and server businesses continues to
offset gains in its software services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total revenue fell 4 percent to $22.5 billion in the first
quarter, below analysts' average estimate of $22.91 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest technology services company's net profit
fell to $2.38 billion, or $2.29 per share, from $3.03 billion,
or $2.70 per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On an adjusted basis, the company earned $2.54 per share, in
line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson
Reuters I/B/E/S.

      IBM (NYSE:IBM) today announced first-quarter 2014 diluted earnings of 
      $2.29 per share, a year-to-year decrease of 15 percent. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) diluted earnings were $2.54 per share, compared with 
      operating diluted earnings of $3.00 per share in the first quarter of 
      2013, a decrease of 15 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      First-quarter net income was $2.4 billion, down 21 percent year-to-year. 
      Operating (non-GAAP) net income was $2.6 billion compared with $3.4 
      billion in the first quarter of 2013, a decrease of 22 percent. The 
      results include the impact of a charge of approximately $870 million for 
      workforce rebalancing and a gain of nearly $100 million for the 
      divestiture of the customer care outsourcing business, consistent with 
      the company&#8217;s full-year guidance in January 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues for the first quarter of 2014 of $22.5 billion were down 
      4 percent (down 2 percent, adjusting for currency; down 1 percent, 
      excluding the customer care outsourcing business) from the first quarter 
      of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In the first quarter, we continued to take actions to transform parts 
      of the business and to shift aggressively to our strategic growth areas 
      including cloud, big data analytics, social, mobile and security,&#8221; said 
      Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As we move through 2014, we will begin to see the benefits from these 
      actions. Over the long term, they will position us to drive growth and 
      higher value for our clients.&#8221;

      First-quarter operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings exclude $0.25 per 
      share of charges: $0.16 per share for the amortization of purchased 
      intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, and $0.09 per 
      share for retirement-related charges.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM expects full-year 2014 GAAP diluted earnings per share of at least 
      $17.00, and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of at least 
      $18.00. The 2014 operating (non-GAAP) earnings expectations exclude 
      $1.00 per share of charges for amortization of purchased intangible 
      assets, other acquisition-related charges, and retirement-related 
      charges.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds response from IBM)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - Mexican mobile phone operator
Iusacell SA de CV sued IBM Corp on Wednesday, accusing
the U.S. technology giant of making fraudulent representations
that caused it to lose $2.5 billion in profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in New York,
centered on a contract that Iusacell said IBM induced it to
enter into in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Events subsequent to the execution of the agreement have
revealed that IBM both knowingly misrepresented and wrongfully
concealed from Iusacell material facts both before and during
the parties' relationship," Iusacell said in the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said in a statement that the lawsuit was a "transparent
attempt" by Iusacell, which is co-owned by media and retail
mogul Ricardo Salinas' Grupo Salinas and broadcast giant Grupo
Televisa, to avoid its contractual obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said it signed a long-term contract with Iusacell in
2010 under which IBM's Mexican unit made significant investments
in Iusacell's business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite major improvement to Iusacell's information
technology infrastructure and growth in Iusacell's revenues,
Iusacell has failed to pay IBM Mexico what it is owed under the
contract," IBM said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's Mexican unit already has filed an arbitration claim
against Iusacell in an effort to enforce the contract, according
to IBM, which called Wednesday's lawsuit an "ill-advised attempt
to end-run" that case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Grupo Salinas had no immediate comment on
the case and a lawyer for Iusacell did not respond to a request
for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the lawsuit, Iusacell's management designed a
plan to boost the market share and revenue of the company, which
was then the third-largest mobile phone operator in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubtful its existing information technology systems could
support the plan, Iusacell sought advice from IBM, the lawsuit
said. Several pages of the complaint are then redacted, leaving
it unclear what happened next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iusacell, however, said in the lawsuit that IBM's capacity
limits crippled its performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not known why parts of the complaint were redacted.
Companies sometimes seek to keep material confidential to
protect trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeks $2.5 billion in damages. Iusacell said its
claims are governed by Mexican law, which entitles it to both
actual damages and lost profits that stemmed from its reliance
on the alleged IBM misrepresentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Iusacell SA de CV v. International Business

      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2000-C10
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed eight classes of JP Morgan Commercial 
      Mortgage Finance Corp., commercial mortgage pass-through certificates 
      series 2000-C10. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are a result of stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral and sufficient credit enhancement. There are eight loans 
      remaining in the pool, the second largest of which is defeased (15.4%). 
      None of the remaining loans are in special servicing or considered a 
      Fitch Loan of Concern. Six loans (77.9%) are secured by retail 
      properties and one is secured by a self-storage property (6.7%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the April 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 97.7% to $17.1 million from $738.5 million 
      at issuance. Fitch modeled losses of 3.8% of the remaining pool; 
      expected losses on the original pool balance total 8.5%, including $62.3 
      million (8.4% of the original pool balance) in realized losses to date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

Iusacell SA de CV sued IBM Corp on Wednesday, accusing
the U.S. technology giant of making fraudulent representations
that caused it to lose $2.5 billion in profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in New York,
was heavily redacted, leaving many of the claims unclear. But
the complaint centered on a contract Iusacell claimed IBM
induced it to enter into in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Events subsequent to the execution of the agreement have
revealed that IBM both knowingly misrepresented and wrongfully
concealed from Iusacell material facts both before and during
the parties relationship," Iusacell said in the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeks more than $2.5 billion in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for IBM did not immediately respond to a

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;April 16, 2014.- Banco Santander Chile launched at 9:30am Tokyo time today a new bond issue, this time in the Tokyo Pro-Bond Market (TPBM) for an amount of JPY$27.3 billion. This issue was just the second globally in the TPBM and the first from Latin America. Additionally, it was the largest issue by a Chilean firm in Japan to date. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This bond demonstrated the growing interest for Chilean paper from Japanese investors. Demand came 100% from Japanese investors, including policy banks, local asset managers, Shinkin Banks and insurance companies. Given the high demand from a diverse pool of investors, the bond was divided into 3 tranches: (i) a 3 year FRN of JPY$ 2 billion priced at a coupon of 0.72% equivalent to Libor3m+90 basis points, (ii) a 3 FRN year of JPY$ 6.6 billion priced at a rate of 3-month JPY-LIBOR-BBA + 55 basis points, equivalent to Libor 3M + 90 basis points and (iii) a 5 year fixed note for JPY$18.7 billion at a rate of 0.97%, equivalent to Libor 3M + 121 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;According to Pedro Murua, Manager of Structured Finance at the Bank: "We are very excited with this landmark transaction that opens the door for us to Japanese investors. The size and maturity of this issue reflects the positive view Japanese investors have on Chile and Santander Chile. This bond clearly demonstrates our strategy of diversifying our funding base. This year Santander Chile has issued in Japan, Chile, Australia, Switzerland and the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The joint lead managers for this transaction were: Daiwa Securities, JP Morgan Securities and Mizuho. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Banco Santander Chile, at year-end 2013 was Chile's largest bank by assets (US$51.4bn) and had a core capital ratio of 10.6%. Santander Chile is also one of the highest rated entities in the region with an aa3 rating from Moody's, A+ from Fitch and A from Standard and Poor's. Banco Santander Chile trades in the local Chilean stock markets (Bsantander) and the NYSE (BSAC). The majority shareholder of the Bank is Grupo Santander that controls 67% of the Bank. &lt;/p&gt;

			The Hartford Signs Agreement With IBM To Move IT To The Cloud
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The 
      Hartford and IBM announced a new six-year technology services 
      agreement to implement a new service model that includes a private 
      cloud infrastructure. The partnership supports The Hartford&#8217;s 
      strategy to drive profitable growth and increase operational 
      effectiveness as it continues to focus on its property and casualty, 
      group benefits and mutual funds businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As The Hartford continues to execute on its strategic plan, we are 
      making significant technology investments to increase operational 
      effectiveness and improve our competitiveness,&#8221; said Andy Napoli, 
      president of Consumer Markets and Enterprise Business Services at The 
      Hartford. &#8220;The partnership with IBM will help The Hartford implement a 
      strategic technology infrastructure that will provide us with greater 
      agility and offer us more flexibility and transparency as we continue to 
      grow our businesses.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Hartford will move to a private cloud-based infrastructure on IBM&#8217;s 
      PureFlex System. Under the $500 million agreement, IBM will also provide 
      a number of other services related to mainframe, storage, backup and 
      resiliency. The Hartford will define the services it requires, and IBM 
      will be responsible for the solution and delivery of those services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement is an example of how leading organizations are 
      utilizing cloud technology to gain competitive advantage,&#8221; said Philip 
      Guido, general manager, IBM Global Technology Services, North America. 
      &#8220;Clients today are looking for IT partners who can understand and help 
      drive their business with a focus on innovation and delivering business 
      outcomes, not just IT efficiency. This expansion of our partnership with 
      The Hartford illustrates the work IBM is leading with cloud.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A recent IBM 
      study reveals that 66 percent of organizations are using cloud to 
      strengthen the relationship between IT and lines of business, and the 
      majority are using cloud to integrate and apply mobile, social, 
      analytics and Big Data technologies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the agreement, The Hartford and IBM will also partner on the 
      creation of a joint innovation committee to foster collaboration on 
      strategic initiatives. The project will leverage the expertise of both 
      firms, market insights and research to build new business models and 
      competitive capabilities that will enhance The Hartford&#8217;s ability to 
      anticipate and meet the needs of customers and agents.

      Research and Markets: Global Industrial and Institutional Cleaners 
      Market 2014-2018 with BASF SE, Ecolab, Sealed Air Corp  The Procter and 
      Gamble Co Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/chxq7m/global_industrial) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Industrial and Institutional Cleaners Market 2014-2018 with BASF SE, 
      Ecolab, Sealed Air Corp  The Procter and Gamble Co Dominating" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Industrial and Institutional Cleaners market will grow at a 
      CAGR of 5.24 percent over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Industrial and Institutional Cleaners market is expected to 
      witness robust growth during the forecast period. All major vendors are 
      trying to expand their markets by capturing developing countries, as 
      they are the hub of economic development. Many major players in the 
      market are looking for mergers and acquisitions, and creating alliances 
      with small, regional, and large organizations to capture more market 
      share. This enhances their distribution channels, improves their market 
      reach, and gives them a competitive advantage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the Global Industrial and Institutional 
      Cleaners market is driven by several factors and one such driver is the 
      rising awareness of the importance of hygiene among people. The 
      increasing awareness and care about the need for a hygienic and sterile 
      environment among people and industries is driving the demand for II 
      cleaners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is the 
      unstable economic conditions and intense competition in the global 
      market, which leads to serious price wars and declining profit margins.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman Scarlato Karon  Penny, P.C., on behalf of SWS Group, Inc. 
      (NYSE: SWS) shareholders, is investigating whether the proposed 
      acquisition of&#160;SWS Group, Inc. (&#8220;SWS&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) by Hilltop 
      Holdings Inc. is in the best interest of the Company&#8217;s shareholders. It 
      appears that the &#8220;special committee&#8221; assigned to consider whether this 
      transaction was in the best interest of all of the Company&#8217;s 
      shareholders may have lacked independence in approving a deal which 
      provides a lower return than an acquisition previously proposed by the 
      Esposito Group. The chairman of Hilltop Holding, Inc., Gerald Ford, sits 
      on the board of directors of SWS.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/l5rgn2/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Cloud-based ITSM Market 2014-2018 with BMC Software, CA Technologies, 
      Hewlett-Packard, IBM  ServiceNow Dominating" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global Cloud-based ITSM market to grow at a CAGR of 16% to 2018.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A major factor contributing to the growth of the market is the 
      increasing demand for economical ITSM services from the SMEs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The concept of BYOD, which allows employees to use their personal 
      devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones for work, is gaining 
      popularity. The concept is characterized by changes in work locations, 
      time zone barriers, and access of official and confidential data via 
      personal devices of employees. In order to address problems arising out 
      of such aspects, ITSM software vendors are now providing their services 
      tailor-made for smartphones and tablets. This trend is expected to 
      strengthen in the future, thereby pushing the market's growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges the market 
      is facing is the concern of integrating new or updated forms of ITSM 
      services with existing solutions. The integration involves not only 
      security concerns, but also the technical expertise and high costs 
      required for the transition.

      and Oracle Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/3jnzg8/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Document-centric Collaboration Market 2014-2018 with EMC Corp., IBM 
      Corp., Microsoft Corp., OpenText Corp., and Oracle Dominating" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Document-centric Collaboration market to grow at a CAGR of 8% 
      to 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers in the market is the need to increase 
      productivity and efficiency. With the globalization of companies, the 
      customer base has expanded exponentially. This forces enterprises to 
      communicate regularly with their customers. As most communication 
      between enterprises and their customers is in the form of documents such 
      as letters, statements, bills, and marketing materials, a large number 
      of documents are created and delivered. Document-centric collaboration 
      solutions enable organizations to share documents in real time, share 
      information, and discuss issues and provide solutions in a much shorter 
      time period than was possible earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In recent years, the rapidly evolving market dynamics and changing 
      aspects of businesses have prompted organizations worldwide to 
      continuously innovate and overhaul their existing business models and 
      enterprise infrastructure. This is witnessed especially in the case of 
      SMEs, where document-centric collaboration supports the growth of a 
      company by eliminating time- consuming manual processes and enabling 
      organizations to focus on more value-added tasks and helping them in 
      gaining a competitive advantage by streamlining business processes and 
      improving operational efficiency. Moreover, document-centric 
      collaboration solutions help in the effective storage and sharing of 
      business-critical information among SMEs. Hence, the infrastructure of 
      many SMEs requires upgrades and advancements in order to cater to the 
      current market demands. This drives the evolution and rapid adoption of 
      secure and consistent IT solutions such as document-centric 
      collaboration solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the key challenges in the market 
      is the high implementation and maintenance cost. The price of 
      document-centric collaboration solutions includes the cost of licensing, 
      system design and customization, implementation, training, and 
      maintenance. After purchasing the license, organizations also need to 
      hire resources for proper implementation of the solution.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Strong sales volume growth in China helped The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) beat quarterly revenue estimates as lower-priced, smaller soda bottles and juices attracted more price and health-conscious shoppers in the world's second largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case volumes in China rose 12 percent in the first quarter of the year, boosted by marketing campaigns around the key Chinese New Year holiday shopping period, helping drive a global two percent rise in volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil, India and Russia also saw strong volume sales growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, like rival PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), has been battling falling soda sales in developed markets such as the United States, where its soda sales last year were the lowest since 1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said a focus on smaller, lower priced products in China was helping target consumers in fast-growing, smaller cities, where demand is outstripping larger urban centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our newly architected packaging portfolio in China is really working with the smaller packs and the new price points," Coca-Cola Chairman and CEO Muhtar Kent said on an earnings call after the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A greater focus on health among Chinese consumers also increased sales volumes of the Coca-Cola's Minute Maid Pulpy juice drink brand by 8 percent in the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts cautioned the strong China results were partly due to weak growth in the first quarter of last year, when volumes were up just one percent due to a slowing economy and rising competition from local rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Chinese consumers said the smaller sizes were cute as well as convenient. "The mini Coca-Cola is adorable, I love the small packaging," said a microblogger on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola does not break out China sales separately. The business falls under its Asia-Pacific region, the company's second-biggest market by revenue, which accounted for 13 percent of overall sales in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WORLD CUP BOOST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola is looking to leverage this year's soccer World Cup in Brazil, where it is a key sponsor, to help revive soda sales which fell one percent globally for the quarter. Its soda brands include Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A World Cup-linked campaign has already helped the Brazilian and China markets, the firm said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, which plans to invest $8 billion in China in the five years to 2017, accounted for 16 percent of the soft drinks market in 2012. The sector is worth an estimated 487.4 billion yuan ($78.33 billion) this year, according to consultants Euromonitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth in China contrasts with flat sales in North America, the company's biggest market, where an unusually cold winter and a shift away from fizzy drinks suppressed demand. European sales fell 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke said in February it is looking to cut costs by $1 billion annually through productivity improvements by 2016, and would redirect much of the savings into increased advertising and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW VENTURES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has also been looking to diversify away from its soda business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company bought a 10 percent stake this year in Keurig Green Mountain Inc (GMCR.O) - known for its K-cup coffees - to help compete in the home soda-making market, dominated by Israel-based Sodastream International Ltd (SODA.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership is looking to develop machines to dispense cold drinks such as juices and teas. Coke owns the Minute Maid juice and Honest Tea brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said Coke's global volume growth was "impressive" in a quarter marked by harsh weather, a strong dollar and the effects of tensions between Russia and United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From here, we believe volumes will continue to accelerate," Modi wrote in an analyst note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Coca-Cola was cautious, saying unfavorable currency rates would create a seven percent "headwind" for both second-quarter and 2014 full-year results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's net income attributable to shareholders fell eight percent to $1.62 billion, or 36 cents per share, from $1.75 billion a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding items, earnings were 44 cents per share, matching the average analyst estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 4 percent to $10.58 billion, slightly ahead of analyst estimates of $10.55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares rose around 4 percent on Tuesday, bringing them back to where they were about a year ago. They ended at $40.18.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) and IBM Corp (IBM.N) will again have to face a U.S. lawsuit claiming they encouraged race-based human rights abuses in apartheid-era South Africa, despite a series of recent court decisions limiting the right to pursue such cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviving a 12-year-old lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan accepted an argument from a group of plaintiffs that corporations may be held liable under a 1789 law, the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), that lets non-U.S. citizens pursue some cases in U.S. courts over alleged violations of international law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No principle of domestic or international law supports the conclusion that the norms enforceable through the ATS ... apply only to natural persons and not to corporations," Scheindlin wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her decision came in a case that the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, also in Manhattan, in August had said should be dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously we're thrilled," said Diane Sammons, a partner at Nagel Rice law firm in Roseland, New Jersey, representing some plaintiffs.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co and IBM
Corp will again have to face a U.S. lawsuit claiming
they encouraged race-based human rights abuses in apartheid-era
South Africa, despite a series of recent court decisions
limiting the right to pursue such cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviving a 12-year-old lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Shira
Scheindlin in Manhattan accepted an argument from a group of
plaintiffs that corporations may be held liable under a 1789
law, the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), that lets non-U.S. citizens
pursue some cases in U.S. courts over alleged violations of
international law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No principle of domestic or international law supports the
conclusion that the norms enforceable through the ATS ... apply
only to natural persons and not to corporations," Scheindlin
wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her decision came in a case that the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, also in Manhattan, in August had said should be
dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously we're thrilled," said Diane Sammons, a partner at

arguments made before the Supreme Court's decision in the Kiobel
case, and sought a chance to meet the new, tighter standard set
by that court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's decision provides that chance, and Scheindlin set
a May 15 deadline to file a new complaint against Ford and IBM,
whose full name is International Business Machines Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany's Daimler AG and Rheinmetall AG 
 had also been defendants, but Scheindlin agreed in December
that the Kiobel decision barred claims against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Motors Corp had also been among the defendants, but
Sammons said claims against it were discharged during that
automaker's 2009 bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apartheid ended in 1994 when South Africa held its first

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - IBM Corp (IBM.N), the world's biggest technology services company, reported its lowest quarterly revenue in five years on Wednesday, as Big Blue struggles with falling demand for its hardware and faces challenges in growth markets like China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of IBM fell as much as 4 percent to $188.20 in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue for the Armonk, NY-based firm fell 4 percent to $22.5 billion in the first quarter, below analysts' average estimate of $22.91 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have had eight revenue declines in a row," said Fred Hickey, editor of The High-Tech Strategist newsletter, which is widely read by investors. "They have missed so many times, it's hard to keep track of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's first-quarter revenue was the lowest the company reported since the first quarter of 2009, when revenue was $21.71 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware revenue, which includes servers and systems storage, plunged 23 percent to $2.4 billion, as sales in growth markets declined 11 percent, led by Asia-Pacific, where reported revenue declined 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has been restructuring its business and laying-off workers in efforts to achieve its targeted operating earnings of $20 per share by 2015. In January, the company agreed to sell its low-end server business to Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) for $2.3 billion in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company on Wednesday reiterated its full-year operating earnings target of $18 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They used to be a leader," said Hickey, who has followed IBM for 30 years. "Now they sell one business after the next. That is not a way to grow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All segments of IBM's systems and technology business reported double-digit declines, led by the System z segment, which fell 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company warned that its hardware business may continue to face hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we look to the balance of 2014, we continue to expect good performance in the key growth areas, though our overall revenue growth will be impacted by the challenges in our hardware business," Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINA WOES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the Americas fell 4 percent, while revenue in the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China declined 11 percent, led by China where revenue fell by 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although IBM books only about 5 percent of its sales in China, declining revenue over the last three quarters has been dragging down the company's emerging markets business overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Ginni Rometty has visited China on two occasions in the last three months, seeking to restore trust with Chinese regulators in the wake of last year's revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of spying.

Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) claimed that spot, which IBM had held for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are not yet getting the kind of lift off of software that they would need to pump up overall IBM revenues into positive growth territory," Forrester analyst Andrew Bartels said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BETTING ON CLOUD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM plans to spend more than $1.2 billion to expand its web-based software products, better known as cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said its cloud revenue was up more than 50 percent in the quarter. The annual run rate of cloud delivered as a service doubled from last year to $2.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving to the cloud allows businesses to cut costs by ditching bulky servers for network-based software and using remote data centers run by technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, IBM has bought two companies to expand its cloud business, Silverpop, a developer of cloud-based marketing software, and cloud-based database software startup Cloudant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company spent $3.1 billion to acquire 10 companies in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, IBM said it will invest more than $1 billion to establish a new business unit for Watson - the supercomputer system that beat humans on the television quiz show "Jeopardy" - deployed on SoftLayer cloud computing infrastructure business the company bought last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global cloud services market last year grew by almost a fifth to an estimated $131 billion, according to research firm Gartner. IBM Markets Intelligence estimates the market could be as big as $200 billion by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't see where the upside is going to come, unless there is something major -- a major restructuring or other major change," Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer with Solaris Asset Management, which helps manage some $1.5 billion, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghriskey said Watson has yet to yield any blockbuster products capable of turning around the revenue declines.

Asset Management, which helps manage some $1.5 billion, told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghriskey said Watson has yet to yield any blockbuster

$2.29 per share, from $3.03 billion, or $2.70 per share, a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results included a $870 million charge related to job
cuts, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On an adjusted basis, the company earned $2.54 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected earnings of $2.54 per
share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock, which gained 4.6 percent over the last three
months, closed at $196.40 on the Nasdaq on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Marina Lopes in New York, Jim Finkle

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) both cited stronger commodities trading as a bright spot in the first quarter, aided in part by extraordinary volatility caused by the coldest U.S. winter in three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two longest-serving banks in the sector took on more risk in the quarter, and may be benefiting from rivals scaling back or quitting the raw materials trading business due to new capital and trading regulations and slimming profit margins, underscoring the benefits of sticking out a tough patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The firms that are announcing exits from commodities, for example, they weren't in those businesses in the 1990s," Goldman Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said. "We got into commodities in 1981."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which is selling its physical oil trading arm to Russia's Rosneft but will retain its large power and natural gas desks, said a "strong performance" in commodities helped boost its wider Fixed Income and Commodities (FICC) net revenue to $1.7 billion from $1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had real strength in commodities, given volatility in the market driven by weather, and we had a real robust client activity," Morgan's Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told Reuters. She said commodities revenues would still have been "slightly" higher excluding physical oil trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which has said it has no intention of backing away from the J Aron franchise it bought three decades ago, said "significantly higher" net revenue in natural resources trading compared with early 2013 had helped offset lower returns across the rest of FICC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether energy markets were the main driver, Schwartz said: "That's where the primary volatility was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks offered no further details, but market sources said they appeared to be among the biggest trading beneficiaries of the deep freeze that swept much of North America this winter,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;triggering the greatest price volatility in years for many regional fuel, electricity and natural gas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aided by sophisticated models that process weather data in seconds, one popular spread trade was buying U.S. natural gas and selling in Europe, which enjoyed the warmest winter on record, trading sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may have also benefited by holding fuel or natural gas in storage, releasing it to meet surges in demand. For instance, physical natural gas prices at the primary New York Transco hub in mid-January surged more than 20-fold to $120 per million British thermal units in one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The liquids side of it was getting to be very seriously constrained because of the cold snap ... if you have the storage and the inventory on hand, you clearly benefited from that," said Patrick Reames, Managing Partner and Commodity Technology Advisory, in Sugar Land, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks do not provide any financial information about their commodity trading, but analysts reckon that Goldman and Morgan likely contributed around a third of the overall industry's estimated $4.5 billion in revenues last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZERO-SUM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks were not alone in benefiting from the gyrations, which appeared to cast winners and losers regardless of their place in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harsh weather delivered a series of unexpected jolts, including an unprecedented shortage of propane in the Midwest that caused prices to treble, a surge in ethanol prices to more than gasoline due to slower rail deliveries and an unusual turn by some East Coast generators to burn oil for power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One large utility operator in the U.S. Northeast was able to sell some excess natural gas to power generators at huge profits on the coldest days of the winter when prices in New York averaged over $30 per mmBtu, a source familiar with the trades said. Michigan-based utility DTE Energy (DTE.N) said it lost $3 million on energy trading in the last quarter of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cargill, one of the world's largest commodity traders, said its quarterly earnings fell 28 percent due to several market disruptions, including a trading loss in power markets that one industry publication put at over $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there has been no suggestion that big traders may have exacerbated the price spikes, adding to rising consumer energy costs, the strong results come at a delicate time for Wall Street's powerhouses as they seek to fend off tougher rules that could curtail their physical trading operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve is now reviewing public comments on whether it should push back banks' decade-long expansion into the raw materials supply chain over fears such risky trading could endanger the financial system - or that it might allow Wall Street too much sway over commodity prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIVALS WITHDRAW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upbeat revenue figures also offered signs of hope for a business line that's been under intensifying margin pressure in recent years due to restrictions on trading with banks' own money, rising capital requirements, and signs the so-called commodities super cycle may have peaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's results may also illustrate how Goldman and Morgan Stanley are benefiting from rivals exiting or scaling back in the sector, including one-time top five firms like JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now it feels like we're starting to maybe see the beginnings of some marginal benefit of competitors exiting parts of our business that otherwise quite frankly they had charged in with excess," Schwartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top 10 banks in commodities made $4.5 billion from natural resources trading in 2013, a report from UK analytics firm Coalition showed earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While significantly below the near $14 billion made by banks in commodities in 2008, it still represents a sizeable chunk of Wall Street's overall earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley reported an increase in commodities exposure known as Value-at-Risk (VaR) from the last quarter, with Goldman raising its VaR to $21 million, the highest in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley increased its commodity VaR to $20 million from $18 million, despite preparing to sell its merchant oil trading business to Russian energy major Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's overall FICC revenue fell 11 percent to $2.85 billion from the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Sheppard in London and Lauren Tara LaCapra, Scott DiSavino and Cezary Podkul in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum)&lt;/p&gt;

exacerbated the price spikes, adding to rising consumer energy
costs, the strong results come at a delicate time for Wall
Street's powerhouses as they seek to fend off tougher rules that
could curtail their physical trading operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve is now reviewing public comments on
whether it should push back banks' decade-long expansion into
the raw materials supply chain over fears such risky trading
could endanger the financial system - or that it might allow
Wall Street too much sway over commodity prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIVALS WITHDRAW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upbeat revenue figures also offered signs of hope for a
business line that's been under intensifying margin pressure in
recent years due to restrictions on trading with banks' own
money, rising capital requirements, and signs the so-called
commodities super cycle may have peaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's results may also illustrate how Goldman and
Morgan Stanley are benefiting from rivals exiting or scaling
back in the sector, including one-time top five firms like
JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now it feels like we're starting to maybe see the
beginnings of some marginal benefit of competitors exiting parts
of our business that otherwise quite frankly they had charged in
with excess," Schwartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top 10 banks in commodities made $4.5 billion from
natural resources trading in 2013, a report from UK analytics
firm Coalition showed earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While significantly below the near $14 billion made by banks
in commodities in 2008, it still represents a sizeable chunk of
Wall Street's overall earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley reported an increase in
commodities exposure known as Value-at-Risk (VaR) from the last
quarter, with Goldman raising its VaR to $21 million, the
highest in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley increased its commodity VaR to $20 million
from $18 million, despite preparing to sell its merchant oil
trading business to Russian energy major Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's overall FICC revenue fell 11 percent to $2.85
billion from the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Sheppard in London and Lauren Tara LaCapra,

&lt;p&gt;(Adds analyst comment; updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Vrinda Manocha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 17 (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd
  signed a deal that allows the Israeli
drugmaker to launch a generic version of Pfizer Inc's 
blockbuster painkiller Celebrex in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. court in March invalidated a patent extending
Pfizer's marketing exclusivity for Celebrex to Dec. 2, 2015.
Celebrex's basic chemical patent is set to expire this May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said on Thursday it would continue to defend the
patent extending its marketing exclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(The deal) helps them to get through 2014 with a lot less
competition," Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As soon as other generics get in, (Pfizer's) sales will
erode even quicker."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration usually grants 180
days of marketing exclusivity to drugmakers who are first to
file for generic approvals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker, said it
believed it was the first to file for an approval of a generic
version of at least three of the four dose strengths of
Celebrex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Teva was concerned about the second patent that
potentially could hold, so to reduce the risk, they said they
would launch later," Conover said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal settles Pfizer's patent infringement lawsuit
against Teva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. drugmaker has also sued other generic drugmakers,
including Mylan Inc and Actavis Inc, which are
seeking U.S. regulatory approval to sell their own versions of
Celebrex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deals between patent holders and generic drug makers have
come under increasing regulatory scrutiny because of their
potential to delay the launch of cheaper medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is seeking a settlement of
$1 billion or more from drugmakers, including AbbVie Inc
, Actavis Plc and Teva, for settling patent-related
lawsuits that allegedly end up making drugs more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrex, which is used to treat arthritis pain and
inflammation, generated about $2.92 billion in sales in 2013,
according to Pfizer's annual regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Under certain conditions, the license will be
royalty-bearing, through the remaining term of the patent (Dec.
2, 2015)," a Pfizer spokesman told Reuters in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company declined to reveal other terms of the
settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teva's U.S.-listed shares were up 1 percent at $50.41 in
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Pfizer's
shares were little changed at $30.24.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group

two-year prison term on June 17 for insider trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan directed Gupta

serving his sentence at an institution chosen by the Federal

and conspiracy charges for having fed tips, from Goldman board
meetings in the second half of 2008, to longtime friend Raj
Rajaratnam, founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the conviction on March 25, rejecting Gupta's claim that
Rakoff improperly admitted wiretap evidence at trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, on April 8, Gupta asked the panel to
reconsider, or for the entire 2nd Circuit to review the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Gupta, did not immediately
respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta is also a former global managing director of the
consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is the top corporate official convicted in a broad
federal insider trading probe unveiled in October 2009, when
charges against Rajaratnam were announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is appealing his conviction to the U.S. Supreme
Court. He is serving an 11-year prison term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has won about 80 convictions and guilty pleas
in the probe. On April 11, a federal judge approved a guilty
plea by Steven Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors LP to resolve
criminal insider trading charges, including a $1.2 billion
penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York, No. 11-cr-00907.

      Research and Markets: Global Enterprise NAS Market 2014-2018 with EMC 
      Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM Corp., NetApp Inc. Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/tfg4db/global_enterprise) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Enterprise NAS Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global Enterprise NAS market will grow at a CAGR of 25.44 
      percent over the period 2013-2018.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There is a fine line between NAS and SAN solutions; however, it is 
      possible to create a hybrid solution that contains both these 
      technologies. The SAN and NAS hybrid solution simplifies storage 
      administration and adds flexibility to the system. It is also easier to 
      replace and reconfigure faulty servers when SAN architecture is used in 
      the solution. Hybrid solutions are also used in data centers to keep the 
      pace of data flow at its normal rate. The hybrid SAN and NAS solution 
      also provides a more effective disaster recovery process. The Fiber 
      Channel over IP and iSCSI protocols has been developed to support this 
      hybrid solution over IP networks. Hence, along with the NAS market, the 
      SAN market is also being influenced by this hybrid solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, an increase in the volume of structured and 
      unstructured data in enterprises is one of the main drivers. Enterprise 
      applications are generating large volumes of data, and the same is 
      expected to continue during the forecast period. The majority of 
      corporate data sources include the data generated from enterprise 
      applications, along with newly generated cloud-based data and social 
      network data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the increasing popularity of cloud-based 
      network storage solutions is one of the main challenges. Network storage 
      facilities are also being provided with a cloud-based solution, thereby 
      providing various options that are not available in NAS solutions.

&lt;p&gt;April 17 (Reuters) - Investment banks Morgan Stanley 
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc posted better-than-expected
quarterly earnings on Thursday, helped by gains in merger
advisory and stock underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results underscored how businesses viewed as stodgy
before the financial crisis are becoming critical drivers of
earnings growth for investment banks now. Goldman's fixed-income
trading revenue plunged during the first quarter, both for
trades it did for customers and investments on its own account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bank's investment management and its stock
underwriting and merger advisory businesses logged big gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley managed to boost revenue in its bond trading
business, after posting a particularly weak first quarter in
2013. But excluding gains or losses from changes in the value of
the bank's debt, the company's trading revenue fell during the
quarter, while revenue from wealth management, investment
management, stock and bond underwriting, and merger advisory all
rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares were up 1.35 percent at $158.34 in morning
trading, while shares of Morgan Stanley were up 4.2 percent at
$31.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are the last of the major
Wall Street banks to report first quarter results, and most
rivals' earnings have shown similar strength in businesses like
underwriting and merger advisory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Goldman Sachs, trading is such a big part of its
business that higher revenue in areas like merger advisory has
less of an impact on the bottom line than for its rival Morgan
Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs still gets more than 60 percent of its total
revenue from trading including its investing and lending
activities, while for Morgan Stanley that figure is less than 40
percent, and sometimes closer to half that percentage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the financial crisis, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
James Gorman has been emphasizing businesses like wealth
management and merger advisory, which tend to generate more
stable earnings and require less capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorman's predecessor John Mack agreed in 2009 to buy
Citigroup's Smith Barney retail brokerage business over time, a
deal that closed in the middle of 2013. That deal was designed
to make Morgan Stanley a safer company after it nearly collapsed
during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley posted net income applicable to common
shareholders of $1.45 billion, or 74 cents per share, compared
with $936 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average expected the bank to post earnings of 59
cents a share, according to ThomsonReuters I/B/E/S. It was not
immediately clear how the estimates compare to the actual
results, but several analysts said the bank beat consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' CEO Lloyd Blankfein, on the other hand, has
made fewer strategic changes at the bank since the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter, the bank posted an 11 percent decline
in earnings to common shareholders, to $1.95 billion, or $4.02 a
share, from $2.19 billion, or $4.29 a share, in the same quarter
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected earnings of $3.45 per
share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That decline came largely from its revenue in institutional
client trading, which fell 13 percent to $4.45 billion, and
investing and lending for its own account, which fell 26 percent
to $1.53 billion.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd said it settled a patent lawsuit with Pfizer Inc, allowing the Israeli drugmaker to launch a generic version of Pfizer's blockbuster painkiller Celebrex in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, a U.S. court invalidated a patent covering Celebrex, giving Pfizer's rivals a chance to sell cheaper versions. Pfizer had said it would appeal the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug, which is used to treat arthritis pain and inflammation, generated about $2.92 billion in sales in 2013, according to Pfizer's annual regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teva, which is the world's largest generic drugmaker, said it believed it was the first to file for an approval of a generic of three dose strengths of Celebrex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration usually grants first-to-file drugmakers 180 days of marketing exclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said on Thursday it would continue to defend the patent, which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted in March, extending its marketing exclusivity until December 2, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Under certain conditions, the license will be royalty-bearing, through the remaining term of the patent (December 2, 2015)," a Pfizer spokesman told Reuters in an emailed statement. "The remaining terms of the settlement are confidential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company sued several drugmakers, including Mylan Inc and Actavis Inc, which are also seeking U.S. regulatory approval to sell their generic versions of Celebrex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrex's basic chemical patent expires on May 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teva's shares were up 1 percent at $50.43 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Pfizer's shares were little changed at $30.11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Vrinda Manocha and Esha Dey in Bangalore; Editing by Kirti Pandey and Prateek Chatterjee)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported an 11 percent drop in quarterly profit as client activity remained constrained and fixed-income revenue shrank, but both earnings and revenue beat market estimates and the Wall Street bank's shares rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman said net income fell to $1.95 billion, or $4.02 per share, in the first three months of the year from $2.19 billion, or $4.29 per share, in the same period of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected earnings of $3.45 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total net revenue fell 8 percent to $9.33 billion, but beat the average estimate of $8.70 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's shares, which had fallen more than 20 percent since the start of the year to Wednesday's close, were up 1.9 percent at $160.28 before the opening bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investment Banking and Investment Management generated solid results, while market sentiment shifted throughout the quarter, constraining client activity in various parts of our franchise," Chairman and Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of Goldman's rivals also reported a drop in revenue from fixed-income trading in the quarter, but Goldman has more at stake than others because it has a less diverse business mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's revenue from fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) trading fell 11 percent from a year earlier to $2.85 billion in the quarter ended March 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed income investors have been holding off on trading in the face of uncertainty about how quickly the U.S. Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman makes most of its money from trading and investing in capital markets. This sets it apart from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp, which have big consumer lending businesses, and Morgan Stanley, which has a large wealth-management arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank trades securities for clients, underwrites stocks and bonds, advises on mergers and has an investment-management business that caters to institutions and wealthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also has a merchant banking business that makes investments and loans with its own money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Thursday, Morgan Stanley - Goldman's closest rival - reported a 55 percent jump in first-quarter earnings as higher revenue from its institutional securities business augmented another strong quarter from wealth management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley said its FICC revenue increased 13 percent in the quarter, making it the only big U.S. bank to increase income from the fixed-income market in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIXED RESULTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman produced mixed results in other areas of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debt underwriting revenue fell 5 percent to $660 million due to a decline in refinancing activity, which had driven earnings for the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, equity underwriting revenue rose 12 percent to $437 million as a slew of companies filed for initial public offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the company's investing and lending business fell 26 percent to $1.53 billion, reflecting the decline in fixed-income activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment management revenue rose 20 percent to $1.57 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With business conditions remaining tough, Goldman has been cutting costs, particularly compensation. Compensation expenses fell 8 percent to $4.01 billion in the latest quarter while total operating expenses dropped 6 percent to $6.31 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the bank enters its fifth consecutive year of declining revenue, Blankfein is facing pressure to explain how Goldman will adapt and boost revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income trading once accounted for more than 40 percent of Goldman's revenue on an annual basis. But since 2009 - when markets flourished briefly in the aftermath of the financial crisis - the business has declining almost steadily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New rules have forced banks to hold more capital against risky trades and limited their ability to trade for their own books. A lack of risk-taking among clients across fixed-income markets has also put a damper on results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect market volumes to eventually pick up, there are questions about the long-term profit potential of fixed-income trading businesses for Wall Street banks - a debate dubbed "cyclical vs. secular."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein and other Goldman executives have steadfastly maintained that the changes to trading - in terms of regulations, client preferences and lower revenue - are temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As weaker banks exit the business, Goldman will be able to gain market share and raise prices, they have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York and Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore; Editing by Ted Kerr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Goldman says commodity revenue "significantly higher"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Morgan Stanley says "strong performance" bolstered FICC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Both banks may be benefiting from rivals scaling back&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Sheppard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley both reported stronger net revenue in commodities
trading during the first quarter on Thursday, as the two
longest-serving banks in the sector took on more risk and
benefited from rivals scaling back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said "significantly higher" net revenue in natural
resources trading compared with early 2013 had helped offset
lower returns across the rest of its Fixed Income and
Commodities (FICC) business, while Morgan Stanley said a "strong
performance" in commodities had helped boost FICC net revenue to
$1.7 billion from $1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commodities results on Wall Street have been under pressure
in recent years due to restrictions on trading with banks' own
money, rising capital requirements, and signs the so-called
commodities supercycle may have peaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While one quarter does not necessarily reverse a trend,
Thursday's results may illustrate how Goldman and Morgan Stanley
are benefiting from rivals exiting or scaling back in the
sector, including one-time top five firms like JPMorgan 
Deutsche Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top 10 banks in commodities made $4.5 billion from
natural resources trading in 2013, a report from UK analytics

&lt;p&gt;(Adds details and background, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Lauren Tara LaCapra and Tanya Agrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported
an 11 percent drop in quarterly profit as client activity
remained constrained and fixed-income revenue shrank, but both
earnings and revenue beat market estimates and the Wall Street
bank's shares rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said net income fell to $1.95 billion, or $4.02 per
share, in the first three months of the year from $2.19 billion,
or $4.29 per share, in the same period of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected earnings of $3.45 per
share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total net revenue fell 8 percent to $9.33 billion, but beat
the average estimate of $8.70 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's shares, which had fallen more than 20 percent
since the start of the year to Wednesday's close, were up 1.9
percent at $160.28 before the opening bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investment Banking and Investment Management generated
solid results, while market sentiment shifted throughout the
quarter, constraining client activity in various parts of our
franchise," Chairman and Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in
a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of Goldman's rivals also reported a drop in revenue
from fixed-income trading in the quarter, but Goldman has more
at stake than others because it has a less diverse business mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's revenue from fixed income, currency and
commodities (FICC) trading fell 11 percent from a year earlier
to $2.85 billion in the quarter ended March 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed income investors have been holding off on trading in
the face of uncertainty about how quickly the U.S. Federal
Reserve will tighten monetary policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman makes most of its money from trading and investing
in capital markets. This sets it apart from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co
, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp,
which have big consumer lending businesses, and Morgan Stanley
, which has a large wealth-management arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank trades securities for clients, underwrites stocks
and bonds, advises on mergers and has an investment-management
business that caters to institutions and wealthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also has a merchant banking business that makes
investments and loans with its own money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Thursday, Morgan Stanley - Goldman's closest
rival - reported a 55 percent jump in first-quarter earnings as
higher revenue from its institutional securities business
augmented another strong quarter from wealth management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley said its FICC revenue increased 13 percent in
the quarter, making it the only big U.S. bank to increase income
from the fixed-income market in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIXED RESULTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman produced mixed results in other areas of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debt underwriting revenue fell 5 percent to $660 million due
to a decline in refinancing activity, which had driven earnings
for the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, equity underwriting revenue rose 12 percent to $437
million as a slew of companies filed for initial public
offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the company's investing and lending business fell
26 percent to $1.53 billion, reflecting the decline in
fixed-income activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment management revenue rose 20 percent to $1.57
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With business conditions remaining tough, Goldman has been
cutting costs, particularly compensation. Compensation expenses
fell 8 percent to $4.01 billion in the latest quarter while
total operating expenses dropped 6 percent to $6.31 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the bank enters its fifth consecutive year of
declining revenue, Blankfein is facing pressure to explain how
Goldman will adapt and boost revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income trading once accounted for more than 40 percent
of Goldman's revenue on an annual basis. But since 2009 - when
markets flourished briefly in the aftermath of the financial
crisis - the business has declining almost steadily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New rules have forced banks to hold more capital against
risky trades and limited their ability to trade for their own
books. A lack of risk-taking among clients across fixed-income
markets has also put a damper on results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect market volumes to eventually pick up, there
are questions about the long-term profit potential of
fixed-income trading businesses for Wall Street banks - a debate
dubbed "cyclical vs. secular."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein and other Goldman executives have steadfastly
maintained that the changes to trading - in terms of
regulations, client preferences and lower revenue - are
temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As weaker banks exit the business, Goldman will be able to
gain market share and raise prices, they have said.

			Goldman Sachs Reports First Quarter Earnings Per Common Share of $4.02
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) today reported net revenues of 
      $9.33&#160;billion and net earnings of $2.03&#160;billion for the first quarter 
      ended March&#160;31,&#160;2014. Diluted earnings per common share were $4.02 
      compared with $4.29 for the first quarter of 2013 and $4.60 for the 
      fourth quarter of 2013. Annualized return on average common 
      shareholders&#8217; equity (ROE)&#160;(1) was 10.9% for the first 
      quarter of 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Highlights
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Goldman Sachs continued its leadership in investment banking, ranking 
        first in worldwide completed mergers and acquisitions for the 
        year-to-date.&#160;(2) The firm also ranked first in 
        worldwide equity and equity-related offerings, common stock offerings 
        and initial public offerings for the year-to-date.&#160;(2)
			
			
        Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.78&#160;billion, which is 
        the highest quarterly performance since 2007.
      
			
        Investment Management generated strong net revenues of $1.57&#160;billion, 
        as assets under supervision increased to a record $1.08&#160;trillion, 
        including record quarterly net inflows in long-term assets under 
        supervision of $40&#160;billion&#160;(3).
      
			
        The firm continues to manage its liquidity and capital conservatively.

      _____________
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are generally pleased with our performance for the quarter given the 
      operating environment,&#8221; said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and Chief 
      Executive Officer. &#8220;Investment Banking and Investment Management 
      generated solid results, while market sentiment shifted throughout the 
      quarter, constraining client activity in various parts of our franchise. 
      Our collection of businesses gives the firm significant room for growth 
      as economic conditions broadly improve and we continue to remain focused 
      on prudently managing our capital and cost structure.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Net Revenues
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investment Banking
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.78&#160;billion for the first 
      quarter of 2014, 13% higher than the first quarter of 2013 and 4% higher 
      than the fourth quarter of 2013. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were 
      $682&#160;million, 41% higher than the first quarter of 2013, primarily 
      reflecting an increase in client activity in Europe. Net revenues in 
      Underwriting were $1.10&#160;billion, essentially unchanged compared with the 
      first quarter of 2013. Net revenues in equity underwriting were higher 
      compared with the first quarter of 2013, reflecting higher net revenues 
      from private placements and initial public offerings. Net revenues in 
      debt underwriting were slightly lower compared with the first quarter of 
      2013, due to significantly lower net revenues from commercial 
      mortgage-related activity compared with a strong first quarter of 2013, 
      partially offset by higher net revenues from investment-grade activity. 
      The firm&#8217;s investment banking transaction backlog decreased compared 
      with the end of 2013.&#160;(7)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Institutional Client Services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $4.45&#160;billion for the 
      first quarter of 2014, 13% lower than the first quarter of 2013 and 31% 
      higher than the fourth quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution 
      were $2.85&#160;billion, 11% lower than the first quarter of 2013, reflecting 
      significantly lower net revenues in interest rate products, currencies 
      and mortgages, as well as lower net revenues in credit products. These 
      results were partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in 
      commodities compared with the first quarter of 2013. During the quarter, 
      market-making conditions generally improved compared with the fourth 
      quarter of 2013. However, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client 
      Execution continued to operate in a challenging environment and levels 
      of activity generally remained low.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Equities were $1.60&#160;billion, 17% lower than the first 
      quarter of 2013. Excluding net revenues related to the firm&#8217;s Americas 
      reinsurance business&#160;(8), which was sold in the second 
      quarter of 2013, net revenues in Equities were 6% lower than the first 
      quarter of 2013. Net revenues in equities client execution were 
      significantly lower compared with the same prior year period, primarily 
      reflecting the sale of the firm&#8217;s Americas reinsurance business. In 
      addition, net revenues were significantly lower in both derivatives and, 
      to a lesser extent, cash products. Commissions and fees were slightly 
      higher compared with the first quarter of 2013, primarily reflecting an 
      increase in European equity volumes. Securities services net revenues 
      were higher compared with the first quarter of 2013, reflecting growth 
      in customer balances. During the quarter, Equities experienced 
      challenging market-making conditions, particularly in Japan and certain 
      emerging markets as equity prices declined.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The net gain attributable to the impact of changes in the firm&#8217;s own 
      credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected 
      was $15&#160;million (all related to Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities 
      Client Execution) for the first quarter of 2014, compared with a net 
      loss of $77&#160;million ($42&#160;million and $35&#160;million related to Fixed 
      Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client 
      execution, respectively) for the first quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investing  Lending
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Investing  Lending were $1.53&#160;billion for the first 
      quarter of 2014, 26% lower than both the first quarter of 2013 and the 
      fourth quarter of 2013. Results for the first quarter of 2014 included 
      net gains of $702&#160;million from investments in equities, primarily driven 
      by private equities, principally reflecting company-specific events. In 
      addition, Investing  Lending net revenues included net gains and net 
      interest income of $597&#160;million from debt securities and loans, and 
      other net revenues of $230&#160;million related to the firm&#8217;s consolidated 
      investments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investment Management
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Investment Management were $1.57&#160;billion for the first 
      quarter of 2014, 20% higher than the first quarter of 2013 and 2% lower 
      than the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in net revenues compared 
      with the first quarter of 2013 reflected significantly higher incentive 
      fees, as well as higher management and other fees primarily due to 
      higher average assets under supervision. During the quarter, total 
      assets under supervision&#160;(9) increased $41&#160;billion to 
      $1.08&#160;trillion. Long-term assets under supervision&#160;(9) 
      increased $54&#160;billion, including net inflows of $40&#160;billion&#160;(3), 
      primarily in fixed income assets. Net market appreciation of $14&#160;billion 
      during the quarter was primarily in fixed income and equity assets. 
      Liquidity products&#160;(9) decreased $13&#160;billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Expenses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating expenses were $6.31 billion, 6% lower than the first quarter 
      of 2013 and 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Compensation and Benefits
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The accrual for compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, 
      estimated year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity 
      awards and other items such as benefits) was $4.01&#160;billion for the first 
      quarter of 2014, 8% lower than the first quarter of 2013, reflecting a 
      decrease in net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net 
      revenues for the first quarter of 2014 was 43.0%, consistent with the 
      first quarter of 2013. Total staff decreased 1% compared with the end of 
      2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Non-Compensation Expenses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Non-compensation expenses were $2.30&#160;billion, 3% lower than the first 
      quarter of 2013 and 24% lower than the fourth quarter of 2013. The 
      decrease compared with the first quarter of 2013 was due to a decline in 
      insurance reserves, reflecting the sale of the firm&#8217;s Americas 
      reinsurance business, as well as lower other expenses, primarily due to 
      lower operating expenses related to consolidated investments. These 
      decreases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and 
      amortization expenses, reflecting $150&#160;million of impairment charges in 
      the first quarter of 2014 related to consolidated investments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first quarter of 2014 included net provisions for litigation and 
      regulatory proceedings of $115&#160;million compared with $110&#160;million for 
      the first quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Provision for Taxes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2014 was 32.7%, 
      up from the full year tax rate of 31.5% for 2013, primarily due to a 
      decrease in permanent benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Capital
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of March&#160;31,&#160;2014, total capital was $244.73&#160;billion, consisting of 
      $79.10&#160;billion in total shareholders&#8217; equity (common shareholders&#8217; 
      equity of $71.90&#160;billion and preferred stock of $7.20&#160;billion) and 
      $165.63&#160;billion in unsecured long-term borrowings. Book value per common 
      share was $154.69 and tangible book value per common share&#160;(10) 
      was $145.04, both approximately 1% higher compared with the end of 2013. 
      Book value per common share and tangible book value per common share are 
      based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units 
      granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 
      464.8&#160;million as of March&#160;31,&#160;2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the quarter, the firm repurchased 10.3&#160;million shares of its 
      common stock at an average cost per share of $166.58, for a total cost 
      of $1.72&#160;billion. The remaining share authorization under the firm&#8217;s 
      existing repurchase program is 46.9&#160;million shares.&#160;(11)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the regulatory capital requirements applicable to bank holding 
      companies, the firm&#8217;s Tier&#160;1 capital ratio&#160;(6) was 
      16.3%&#160;(5) and the firm&#8217;s Common Equity Tier&#160;1 ratio&#160;(6) 
      was 14.6%&#160;(5) as of March&#160;31,&#160;2014, in each case 
      reflecting both the revised definition of regulatory capital and the 
      transitional provisions which became effective January&#160;1,&#160;2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the first quarter of 2014, the firm completed a satisfactory parallel 
      run under the revised capital framework. Therefore, beginning with the 
      second quarter of 2014, the firm&#8217;s capital ratios will be computed under 
      the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s Basel&#160;III Advanced approach. As of 
      March&#160;31,&#160;2014, the firm&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio&#160;(12) 
      computed under this approach was 11.3%&#160;(5).
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Other Balance Sheet and Liquidity Metrics
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The firm&#8217;s global core excess liquidity (GCE)&#160;(4) was 
        $175&#160;billion&#160;(5) as of March&#160;31,&#160;2014 and 
        averaged $181&#160;billion&#160;(5) for the first quarter 
        of 2014, compared with an average of $183&#160;billion for the fourth 
        quarter of 2013.
      
			
        Total assets were $916&#160;billion&#160;(5) as of 
        March&#160;31,&#160;2014, compared with $912&#160;billion as of December&#160;31,&#160;2013.
      
			
        Level&#160;3 assets were $41&#160;billion&#160;(5) as of 
        March&#160;31,&#160;2014, compared with $40&#160;billion as of December&#160;31,&#160;2013, and 
        represented 4.5% of total assets.

		&lt;p&gt;
      The Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. declared a 
      dividend of $0.55 per common share to be paid on June&#160;27,&#160;2014 to common 
      shareholders of record on May&#160;30,&#160;2014. The firm also declared dividends 
      of $236.98, $387.50, $252.78, $252.78, $371.88 and $343.75 per share of

      representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock), to be 
      paid on May&#160;12,&#160;2014 to preferred shareholders of record on 
      April&#160;27,&#160;2014. In addition, the firm declared dividends of $1,011.11 
      per each share of Series&#160;E Preferred Stock and Series&#160;F Preferred Stock, 
      to be paid on June&#160;2,&#160;2014 to preferred shareholders of record on

			Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking 
      Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This press release contains &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the 
      meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not 
      historical facts, but instead represent only the firm&#8217;s beliefs 
      regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently 
      uncertain and outside of the firm&#8217;s control. It is possible that the 
      firm&#8217;s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly 
      materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition 
      indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some 
      of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm&#8217;s future 
      results and financial condition, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part&#160;I, Item&#160;1A 
      of the firm&#8217;s Annual Report on Form&#160;10-K for the year ended 
      December&#160;31,&#160;2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Certain of the information regarding the firm&#8217;s capital ratios, 
      risk-weighted assets, total assets, level&#160;3 assets and global core 
      excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates. These estimates are 
      forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly 
      materially, as the firm completes its financial statements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Statements about the firm&#8217;s investment banking transaction backlog also 
      may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject 
      to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that 
      they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, 
      that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, 
      possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors 
      that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a 
      transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting 
      transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic 
      conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities 
      markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer 
      of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a 
      decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate 
      financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the 
      transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a 
      discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the 
      firm&#8217;s investment banking transactions, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part&#160;I, 
      Item&#160;1A of the firm&#8217;s Annual Report on Form&#160;10-K for the year ended 
      December&#160;31,&#160;2013.

            Tangible book value per common share is computed by dividing 
            tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity (total shareholders' equity 
            less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets) 
            by the number of common shares outstanding, including restricted 
            stock units granted to employees with no future service 
            requirements. Management believes that tangible common 
            shareholders&#8217; equity and tangible book value per common share are 
            meaningful because they are measures that the firm and investors 
            use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible common shareholders&#8217; 
            equity and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP 
            measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures 
            used by other companies. The table below presents a reconciliation 
            of total shareholders' equity to tangible common shareholders'

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Disappointing results from Google Inc and IBM may unnerve investors shaken by a strong recent selloff in tech stocks, underscoring the challenges the Internet and IT sectors face as corporate report cards come due in coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies, both barometers of their respective industries, posted March-quarter results on Wednesday that missed Wall Street's revenue targets, and their shares fell in after hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM blamed weak hardware sales for its lowest quarterly revenue in five years, worsened by an 11 percent slide in overall sales in emerging markets including China, Brazil, Russia and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That spells trouble for other tech companies reliant on enterprise-spending, such as Oracle, Cisco, EMC and Hewlett-Packard, which report results this month or next. Like IBM, they have struggled to grow their businesses, particularly in China, whose economy is down-shifting after years of hyper-growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise spending in general has been on the wane for traditional computing giants as corporations and even governments increasingly turn to software-as-a-service (SaaS) and other cloud offerings instead of maintaining their own in-house technology infrastructure. Many, including IBM and Oracle, have been left behind by smaller, younger rivals as spending goes toward emerging areas like big data, cloud and cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing a lot of traditional technology vendors struggle," said FBR analyst Dan Ives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're seeing spending go away from big-bang projects toward smaller, more modular types of deployments, which speaks to why a lot of SaaS players are doing well. Customers want to buy just the drink rather than the whole bar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's and IBM's poor results on Wednesday may do little to change investors' sentiment following a recent drop in tech stocks. Since early March, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has fallen over 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOBILE AD WORRIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the latest results factored in, including IBM and Google, tech earnings growth estimates for the quarter have fallen by roughly two-thirds since the start of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 1, as the first quarter got under way, analysts on average predicted tech earnings would grow by 7 percent. But now, as first-quarter reports trickle out, analysts on average expect growth of just 2.4 percent, according to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That also marks a deceleration in tech profit growth from the fourth quarter, when it totaled 10.3 percent, but it is an improvement from 2013's first quarter, when tech profits shrank by 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Google's case, investors initially pummeled the stock in after-hours trading after the world's largest Internet company reported its miss, plus a drop in margins as cost-per-click, or the average price of an online ad, slid 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares rebounded after CFO Patrick Pichette attributed that profitability decline to a spike in expenses partly because of its $3.2 billion acquisition of home automation pioneer Nest last quarter, which tacked on a raft of payroll and research costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the three largest Internet corporations - Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc - have each grappled with advertising on mobile devices, where the growth is currently concentrated, and where smartphones with smaller displays typically command lower ad prices than on desktop PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For investors in Google, accustomed to the company enjoying one of the highest ad margins in the business, mobile ads have translated to a steep drop in ad rates. The transition has been less jarring at Facebook, which once relied almost exclusively on low-margin display or banner ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, which had difficulty monetizing its 140-character stream-of-consciousness messaging model, is catching on with TV advertisers because of its growing position as a "second screen" to accompany TV viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are trying to adapt to a new delivery system which is mobile," said B. Riley &amp; Co analyst Sameet Sinha. "It is a challenge for most companies, and it's going to be here for the next couple of years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

      IBM (NYSE:IBM) today announced first-quarter 2014 diluted earnings of 
      $2.29 per share, a year-to-year decrease of 15 percent. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) diluted earnings were $2.54 per share, compared with 
      operating diluted earnings of $3.00 per share in the first quarter of 
      2013, a decrease of 15 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      First-quarter net income was $2.4 billion, down 21 percent year-to-year. 
      Operating (non-GAAP) net income was $2.6 billion compared with $3.4 
      billion in the first quarter of 2013, a decrease of 22 percent. The 
      results include the impact of a charge of approximately $870 million for 
      workforce rebalancing and a gain of nearly $100 million for the 
      divestiture of the customer care outsourcing business, consistent with 
      the company&#8217;s full-year guidance in January 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues for the first quarter of 2014 of $22.5 billion were down 
      4 percent (down 2 percent, adjusting for currency; down 1 percent, 
      excluding the customer care outsourcing business) from the first quarter 
      of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In the first quarter, we continued to take actions to transform parts 
      of the business and to shift aggressively to our strategic growth areas 
      including cloud, big data analytics, social, mobile and security,&#8221; said 
      Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As we move through 2014, we will begin to see the benefits from these 
      actions. Over the long term, they will position us to drive growth and 
      higher value for our clients.&#8221;

			First-Quarter GAAP &#8211; Operating (non-GAAP) Reconciliation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      First-quarter operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings exclude $0.25 per 
      share of charges: $0.16 per share for the amortization of purchased 
      intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, and $0.09 per 
      share for retirement-related charges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Full-Year 2014 Expectations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM expects full-year 2014 GAAP diluted earnings per share of at least 
      $17.00, and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of at least 
      $18.00. The 2014 operating (non-GAAP) earnings expectations exclude 
      $1.00 per share of charges for amortization of purchased intangible 
      assets, other acquisition-related charges, and retirement-related 
      charges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Geographic Regions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Americas&#8217; first-quarter revenues were $9.6 billion, a decrease of 4 
      percent (down 2 percent, adjusting for currency) from the 2013 period. 
      Revenues from Europe/Middle East/Africa were $7.6 billion, up 4 percent 
      (up 1 percent, adjusting for currency). Asia-Pacific revenues decreased 
      12 percent (down 6 percent, adjusting for currency) to $5.0 billion. OEM 
      revenues were $355 million, down 17 percent compared with the 2013 first 
      quarter.

			Growth Markets
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenues from the company&#8217;s growth markets decreased 11 percent (down 5 
      percent, adjusting for currency). Revenues in the BRIC countries &#8212; 
      Brazil, Russia,&#160;India and China &#8212; decreased 11 percent (down 6 percent, 
      adjusting for currency).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Global Technology Services segment revenues were down 3 percent (down 1 
      percent, adjusting for currency) to $9.3 billion. Excluding the impact 
      of the divested customer care outsourcing business, revenues were down 1 
      percent (up 2 percent, adjusting for currency). Global Business Services 
      segment revenues were flat (up 2 percent, adjusting for currency) to 
      $4.5 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pre-tax income from Global Technology Services was down 15 percent and 
      pre-tax margin decreased to 14.1 percent, including an impact of 
      approximately $0.3 billion for the workforce rebalancing charge. Global 
      Business Services pre-tax income decreased 11 percent and pre-tax margin 
      decreased to 13.6 percent, including an impact of approximately $0.2 
      billion for the workforce rebalancing charge.

			Microsoft Makes $250,000 Contribution to Leadership Council on Legal 
      Diversity
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Leadership Council on Legal Diversity (LCLD) announced this week 
      that it has received a $250,000 contribution from Microsoft Corporation 
      to support strategic initiatives to diversify leadership and development 
      opportunities across the legal profession.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is the largest contribution received to date by the five-year-old 
      organization, according to LCLD Executive Director Robert J. Grey Jr.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is an extraordinary expression of confidence in what this 
      generation of leaders in the law is doing to expand leadership 
      opportunities in the profession,&#8221; said Grey. &#8220;This gift will enable us 
      to expand and strengthen the programs we believe will advance the 
      careers of the rising generation of diverse talent in our profession.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LCLD, composed of the Managing Partners of the nation&#8217;s leading law 
      firms and the General Counsel of Fortune 500 corporations, has taken on 
      a multi-year &#8220;Talent to Leadership&#8221; commitment. Its programs reach 
      diverse law students through mentoring and first-year (1L) initiatives 
      and also provide career development and networking opportunities for 
      attorneys who have been identified by their firms or corporate legal 
      departments as rising leaders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of January 2014, LCLD&#8217;s programs have reached more than 2,500 law 
      students through its nationwide mentoring effort, 300 law students 
      through its 1L Scholars program, and 400 diverse attorneys through its 
      Fellows program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It is critical that we identify strong diverse lawyers and create 
      leadership opportunities for them,&#8221; said Brad Smith, Chair of the LCLD 
      board of directors and General Counsel and Executive Vice President for 
      Microsoft Corporation. &#8220;Unless the legal profession makes faster 
      progress, it will miss out on the dynamism and creativity that diversity 
      brings. We need a legal profession that is as diverse as the country we 
      serve &#8211; a prerequisite for healthy legal service for a democracy.&#8221;

		&lt;h1&gt;SHAREHOLDER ALERT: Pomerantz Law Firm Announces the Filing of a Class Action Against Walter Investment Management Corporation and Certain Officers - WAC&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Apr 18, 2014) - &#160;Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Walter Investment Management Corporation ("Walter Investment" or the "Company") (NYSE: WAC) and certain of its officers.&#160;The class action, filed in United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, and docketed under 1:14-cv-20880, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Walter Investment securities between May 9, 2012 and February 26, 2014,&#160;both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"). This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are a shareholder who purchased Walter Investment securities during the Class Period, you have until May 6, 2014 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class.&#160;A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com.&#160;To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll free, x237. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and number of shares purchased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Investment is a loan servicer and business solutions provider focused on generating recurring, fee-based revenues from an "asset-light" platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company lacked adequate internal controls over financial accounting and compliance with applicable laws; (2)&#160;the Company's internal controls were not effective; (3)&#160;the Company's financial statements contained false and misleading statements; (4) the Company had failed to disclose material weaknesses in the internal controls of its recently acquired subsidiary, RMS; (5) the Company had overstated the value of its RMS acquisition; (6) the Company was in violation of applicable laws, rules and regulations; (7) the Company's business practices violated consumer financial protection laws, thereby jeopardizing future revenues and profits; and, (8) as a result of the foregoing, the Company's statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 18, 2013, the Company shocked investors by disclosing that, based on an evaluation by the Company's Board of Directors and management, "our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of this material weakness, management has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this news, the Company's shares fell $8.61 per share to close on March 19, 2013 at $32.98 per share, a drop of over 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On February 27, 2014, the Company announced in a Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Form 8-K filing that the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") issued a Civil Investigation Demand ("CID") to Green Tree Servicing LLC ("Green Tree"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, requesting information on a broad range of subjects relating to the company's operations.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this news, shares of Walter Investment fell from $28.28 to $25.90, more than 8%, on unusually heavy trading volume, on February 27, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Florida, and San Diego, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 70 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JERSEY CITY, N.J., April 18, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fundtech, a market leader in global transaction banking solutions, is proud to announce that Bank of China, IBM, and Fundtech have received the The Asian Banker's China Technology Implementation Award 2014 for best corporate payments project. The award was given for the bank's implementation of its Global Unified Payment Platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In September 2012, Bank of China selected Fundtech to provide and implement its Global PAYplus solution, along with IBM as its technology implementation consultant. The solution allowed Bank of China to unify payments platforms across branches in dozens of countries and to connect disparate local clearing systems. In September 2013&#8212;less than 12 months after signing the contract&#8212;the bank went live with the platform in a number of countries. Today Bank of China has improved processes, reduced costs, begun to centralize payment information and integrate systems, and is expanding its renminbi (RMB) business overseas&#8212;all critical steps in its goal to become a leading player in the international banking marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Financial institutions today face significant challenges, including streamlining global operations and the increasing efficiency while reducing costs," says Isaac Yaniv, Executive Vice President, Global Payments, Fundtech. "Fundtech would like to congratulate Bank of China not only for this prestigious award win, but also for having the vision and commitment to take on such a transformative payments project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We are pleased to recognize Bank of China, together with IBM and Fundtech, in their pursuit of payments technology implementation excellence," says Foo Boon Ping, Managing Editor, The Asian Banker. "Working together, these players have executed one of the most significant payments transformation projects in the APAC region in a remarkably short timeframe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Technology Implementation Awards, conducted by The Asian Banker since 2006, are designed to recognize achievement and identify emerging best practices in technology implementations within the Asia Pacific region. Winners are selected by a panel of advisors, industry leaders, practitioners, and academics, based on in-depth submissions that exhibit new concepts, new technologies, and creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - U.S. pharmaceutical giant
Pfizer has approached British rival AstraZeneca 
to propose a 60 billion pound ($101 billion) takeover, Britain's
Sunday Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper cited senior investment bankers and industry
sources saying that informal conversations about a deal had
taken place between the two but that no talks were currently
under way after AstraZeneca resisted the approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and AstraZeneca both declined to comment on the
report to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca, Britain's second-biggest pharmaceuticals group,
has been frequently touted as a potential takeover target as it
wrestles with patents expiring on a number of best-selling
drugs, leaving future growth uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these problems, the company has attracted attention
for experimental cancer drugs it is developing, which could be
interesting for Pfizer which has faced patent losses of its own,
notably anti-cholesterol treatment Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two firms are familiar with each other's products
working together on projects such as the pioneering of a new
kind of clinical trial for cancer drugs announced last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer could use cash it has accumulated through overseas
subsidiaries, which if repatriated to the U.S. would be heavily
taxed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past Swiss drug firm Novartis and larger
British peer GlaxoSmithKline have been mentioned as
potential suitors, although GSK has publicly said it is not
interested in making a large acquisition in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca, which announces first quarter results on
Thursday, has a market valuation of around $80 billion, compared
with Pfizer - valued at $193 billion, according to Thomson
Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings at AstraZeneca fell 6 percent in the fourth quarter
of 2013, and the drugmaker has said it expects them to keep
falling in 2014 as generic competition to Nexium, its popular
heartburn and ulcer drug, takes a big bite out of U.S. profits
from late May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca has suffered a dry period in drug discovery in
recent years and badly needs to find new medicines to replace
blockbusters such as Nexium and Crestor, a treatment for high
cholesterol that will lose patent protection in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's last big acquisition was in 2009, when it bought
U.S. rival Wyeth for $68 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.5949 British Pounds)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc has agreed to pay $190 million to settle a class action lawsuit alleging the pharmaceutical company took steps to delay market entry of generic versions of its epilepsy drug Neurontin, according to court documents filed on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers representing a class of Neurontin purchasers disclosed the terms of the settlement in a motion seeking approval of the deal that was filed in New Jersey federal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, first filed in 2002, alleged that Pfizer took multiple steps to maintain its exclusivity on the sale of Neurontin, including sham patent infringement lawsuits and promotion of the drug for unapproved uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buyers of Neurontin claimed that Pfizer's activity forced them to pay inflated prices for the drug.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc may come back to bid for British drug company AstraZeneca Plc after its reported 60 billion pound ($101 billion) takeover approach was rejected, since a deal could make sense for the U.S. pharmaceuticals giant as it seeks to build up its cancer franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to adding promising - though still risky - experimental medicines known as immunotherapy's that boost the body's immune system to fight tumors, acquiring AstraZeneca could also generate significant cost savings, according to industry analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, a deal at around a 25 percent premium to the current share price funded by cash, cheap debt and some stock could boost Pfizer earnings immediately, they believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies have declined to comment on a report in the Sunday Times, which cited senior investment bankers and industry sources saying that Pfizer approached the British pharmaceuticals group about a deal. The newspaper said no talks were currently under way after AstraZeneca resisted the approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citi analyst Andrew Baum said he believed the report was "very likely genuine" and Pfizer could return to the fray, given the attractiveness of AstraZeneca's pipeline of cancer drugs, its expertise in autoimmune diseases and the scope for taking out costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We anticipate Pfizer to push aggressively ahead with a second approach," Baum wrote in a research note on Monday, adding that AstraZeneca might seek to structure any deal as a merger of equals as a defense strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betaville, a British financial blog, on Monday said AstraZeneca had hired Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to act as "defense" advisors in the event Pfizer makes a new effort to acquire the London-based drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two investment banks already act as AstraZeneca's corporate brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blog also said that Pfizer may be working with JP Morgan to work on any potential bid. AstraZeneca and Pfizer declined to comment on the investment bankers, and officials at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley could not immediately be reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares closed up 2 percent, while AstraZeneca shares rose 8.8 percent, both on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has a long track record of making major acquisitions, with the $68 billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009 its last major deal, after earlier acquisitions of Pharmacia and Warner Lambert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker has more recently been divesting certain operations and mega-mergers have fallen out of fashion in the pharmaceuticals industry following scepticism about how well some of them have worked. But Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has said he would still consider a large deal that made sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read also has an incentive to buy assets overseas rather than in the United States since Pfizer has tens of billions of dollars accumulated through foreign subsidiaries, which if repatriated to the U.S. would be heavily taxed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTHER BIDDERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pfizer move on AstraZeneca might flush out other bidders.

adding that AstraZeneca might seek to structure any deal as a
merger of equals as a defense strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betaville, a British financial blog, on Monday said
AstraZeneca had hired Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to act as
"defense" advisors in the event Pfizer makes a new effort to
acquire the London-based drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two investment banks already act as AstraZeneca's
corporate brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blog also said that Pfizer may be working with JP Morgan

with the $68 billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009 its last major
deal, after earlier acquisitions of Pharmacia and Warner
Lambert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker has more recently been divesting certain

immunotherapy was likely the main lure for Pfizer, since the
field is expected to become one of the biggest areas of modern
medicine in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Mark Clark at Deutsche Bank said Pfizer would be
making something of a "leap of faith" since AstraZeneca's most
exciting cancer drugs are still at an early stage of
development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has a highly promising breast cancer drug in
late-stage development called palbociclib but otherwise its
cancer portfolio is relatively weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Notably, Pfizer appears to be nowhere in the important
field of immuno-oncology, which Bristol-Myers Squibb,
Roche, Merck &amp; Co and AstraZeneca currently
dominate," Schoenebaum said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bristol, Roche and Merck are viewed as being ahead of
AstraZeneca in the new cancer field but the British firm
believes it can make up ground by pioneering drug combinations,
including the use of a medicine known as tremelimumab that it
licensed from Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca and its rivals will present the latest clinical
data on promising new cancer drugs at the May 30 to June 3
annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DRUG PIPELINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The London market was closed on Monday for Easter but the
talk of Pfizer's interest in AstraZeneca is likely to overshadow
dealings when trade resumes on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot, who has
been credited for progress in rebuilding the company's new drug
pipeline since taking over in 2012, fuelling a rally in the
shares, will also come under pressure to address the reported
Pfizer approach when he presents half-year results on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculation over such a takeover, which would be potentially
the biggest ever foreign takeover of a British company, is
likely to trigger concerns about jobs in Britain's
pharmaceuticals sector, which is viewed as a key industry by the
government but which has been under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca has already laid off thousands of scientists and
other staff as it shrinks its cost base to cope with a fall in
sales due to patent losses on blockbuster medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With heartburn treatment Nexium losing U.S. patent
protection next month and cholesterol fighter Crestor facing
patent expiry in 2016, the decline in sales is expected to
continue for several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to reshape the company, Soriot is currently
moving its research and corporate headquarters to Cambridge,
England. Pfizer has also made the university city a research hub
after shuttering a large research site in Sandwich, southern
England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cambridge connection is only one link between Pfizer and
AstraZeneca, highlighting how the companies know each other
well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca's head of innovative medicines Mene Pangalos
also used to work at Pfizer and the two firms are familiar with
each other's products from working together on projects, such as
a pioneering of a new kind of clinical trial for cancer drugs
announced last week.

      Fitch: Goldman Reports Solid 1Q'14 Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Goldman) reported solid results for first 
      quarter 2014 (1Q'14) generally in line with Fitch Ratings' expectations. 
      Results were moderately lower than 4Q'13; but benefitting from strong 
      fixed income, currency and commodities trading and lower 
      non-compensation expenses offset by elevated compensation expenses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues (excluding DVA) increased 4% sequentially to $9.3 billion 
      at 1Q'14 despite continued uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic 
      environment conditions, Federal Reserve bond buying tapering and 
      interest rates. Non-compensation expenses declined 24% 
      quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) primarily due to lower provisions for legal 
      and regulatory matters. Compensation expenses increased $1.8 billion to 
      $4 billion at 1Q'14 due to seasonality, but was 8% lower than 1Q'13. 
      Compensation represented 43% of net revenues at 1Q'14 unchanged from 
      1Q'13.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Institutional Client Services net revenues (excluding DVA impact and the 
      sale of the reinsurance business in 2013) increased 23% sequentially, 
      but was down 11% from 1Q'13. Fixed income net revenues (excluding DVA) 
      improved 50% from 4Q'13, but was 13% lower than 1Q'13. The increase was 
      driven by higher market activity in commodities, rates and mortgages. 
      Equities decreased 7% from 1Q'13(excluding the sale of Goldman's 
      reinsurance business) as a result of less favorable market conditions 
      primarily in Japan and certain emerging markets. Trading value at risk 
      (VaR) of $82 billion was virtually unchanged from 4Q'13.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investment banking revenues of $1.8 billion were 4% higher than 4Q'13 
      driven by strong advisory business. Underwriting revenues were down 3% 
      QoQ and virtually unchanged year-over-year (YoY). Debt underwriting 
      revenues were up 29% from 4Q'13 due to an increase in investment grade 
      and leveraged finance activity. Lower equity underwriting revenues were 
      due to fewer IPOs during 1Q'14, which is consistent with industry 
      volumes. The backlog for investment banking remains strong and Goldman 
      should benefit from increased activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investing and lending revenues decreased 26% both QoQ and YoY. Net 
      revenues for equity securities declined 50% from a strong 4Q'13. Debt 
      securities and loan, however, benefitted from higher gains on 
      investments and net interest income. Asset management revenues of $1.5 
      billion were unchanged sequentially, but up 20% YoY. Assets under 
      supervision increased to a record $1.08 trillion, due to net inflows and 
      market appreciation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the past several years, Goldman has consistently maintained 
      liquidity at conservative levels. Global core excess liquidity, 
      including unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash, was a solid 
      $175 billion or 19% of total assets at 1Q'14.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman estimated that its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III advanced 
      approach at 1Q'14 was 11.3% on a transitional basis, comfortably above 
      the 8.5% minimum and above Goldman's target of 9.5%. Goldman estimated 
      that its supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) under the rules recently 
      proposed by the Federal Reserve was approximately 4.2% for the holding 
      company, below the minimum threshold of 5%. Under the new proposal, the 
      holding company SLR was negatively impacted by the CDS add-on and 
      collateralized assets associated with customer activity. Furthermore, 
      fund investments, which Goldman is required to reduce as part of the 
      Volcker Rule, continue to negatively impact the SLR. Goldman estimates 
      that harvesting these fund investments should improve the holding 
      company SLR by approximately 50 basis points. Goldman estimated that the 
      Goldman Sachs Bank USA's SLR was 5.6% at 1Q'14, below the minimum 
      threshold of 6%. Fitch believes that Goldman will be able to meet the 
      supplementary leverage minimums ahead of implementation deadline in 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During 1Q'14, as part of Goldman's share repurchase program, $1.72 
      billion of common shares were repurchased. Goldman received a no 
      objection to its capital request under CCAR but only after it revised 
      its submission.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc has agreed
to pay $190 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging
the pharmaceutical company took steps to delay market entry of
generic versions of its epilepsy drug Neurontin, according to
court documents filed on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers representing a class of Neurontin purchasers
disclosed the terms of the settlement in a motion filed in New
Jersey federal court seeking approval of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, first filed in 2002, alleged that Pfizer took
multiple steps to maintain its exclusivity on the sale of
Neurontin, including sham patent infringement lawsuits and
promotion of the drug for unapproved uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buyers of Neurontin claimed that Pfizer's activity forced
them to pay inflated prices for the drug. Pfizer, which denied
wrongdoing in the case, did not immediately return a message
seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're happy with the result after a long and hard
litigation," said Robert Kaplan, one of the attorneys for the
plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, Pfizer agreed to pay $430 million to federal and
state governments and pleaded guilty to criminal charges of
illegally marketing Neurontin, a drug the company obtained with
its 2000 acquisition of Warner Lambert Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Neurontin Antitrust Litigation, No.
02-1390, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey.

			Wintergreen Advisers Sends Second Letter to Warren Buffett on 
      Coca-Cola Equity Plan
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As investors continue to prepare to cast their proxy ballots ahead of 
      the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) annual shareholders&#8217; meeting on April 
      23, David Winters, CEO of Wintergreen Advisers, sent a second letter to 
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s largest shareholder, Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire 
      Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Winters wrote, &#8220;We do not believe it would be consistent with 
      Berkshire&#8217;s long ingrained culture to support such a plan at any of your 
      equity holdings, much less one worth nearly $16 billion. If the proposed 
      2014 Coca Cola Equity Plan were to be approved by its shareholders, the 
      implication for investment returns in our country may be devastating.&#8221;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      April 16, 2014
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dear Warren,
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the years your conviction and passion for corporate diligence and 
      responsibility has echoed through the American consciousness. Like 
      Jiminy Cricket you sit on our shoulders reminding us to do what is 
      right. Work hard, be fair, save for our future, stand up for what is 
      right, and think like an owner. Now the United States and investors are 
      at a crossroads. People of all political persuasions recognize the 
      enormous disparity in financial wealth between the vast majority of 
      Americans and the very top ranks of the corporate elite.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Millions of investors depend upon Coca-Cola as a staple in their 
      financial security planning. Some invest directly in Coca-Cola, others 
      invest in index or actively managed equity funds, and some invest 
      indirectly through the investment vehicle most near and dear to your 
      heart, Berkshire Hathaway. Whether in the initial formative years of 
      saving, in the midst of their careers or in the payout period of a 
      well-deserved retirement, there are millions of people who worked hard 
      for their money and believed the promise that their money would work 
      hard for them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Later this month at the company&#8217;s annual meeting, shareholders will vote 
      to determine whether they will transfer a meaningful portion of 
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s intrinsic value from the shareholders to the top five 
      percent of the company&#8217;s employees. The proposed equity plan, when 
      combined with existing plans, could dilute all Coca-Cola shareholders by 
      taking up to 16.6% of the value of each share, worth $6.67 per Coca-Cola 
      share at last night&#8217;s closing price of $40.18, and handing it to the top 
      5% of Coke management. If Coke uses the share repurchase program to 
      offset the issuance of these shares as they have done in recent years, 
      shareholders will be further damaged. The company may have to divert 
      approximately $2 billion per year (one-quarter of its free cash flow) 
      from productive uses to offsetting dilution. To a business with a 27% 
      return on equity, the opportunity cost of spending $2 billion per year 
      to offset dilution is enormous.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As you stated in your 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders,
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised 
      our percentage ownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 8.9% to 
      9.1%...And, if you think tenths of a percent aren&#8217;t important, ponder 
      this math: For the four companies in aggregate, each increase of 
      one-tenth of a percent in our share of their equity raises Berkshire&#8217;s 
      share of their annual earnings by $50 million.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola repurchased 121 million shares in 2013, but turned around and 
      issued 54 million shares and options to management, reducing the share 
      count by only 67 million shares. Now realize that if Coca-Cola hadn&#8217;t 
      issued those 54 million shares to executives, Berkshire&#8217;s ownership of 
      Coca-Cola would now be 9.2% instead of 9.1% and Berkshire&#8217;s share of 
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s earnings would be $10 million larger. We agree with you - 
      one tenth of a percent IS a big deal to Berkshire! With the proposed 
      2014 Equity Plan potentially issuing more shares in fewer years than 
      previous equity compensation plans, this dilution headwind to Berkshire 
      and all Coca-Cola shareholders will likely only grow worse.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the 52 years you have been Chairman and CEO, you have not implemented 
      such a dilutive compensation plan at Berkshire Hathaway, and it is 
      unthinkable that you ever will. We do not believe it would be consistent 
      with Berkshire&#8217;s long ingrained culture to support such a plan at any of 
      your equity holdings, much less one worth nearly $16 billion. If the 
      proposed 2014 Coca Cola Equity Plan were to be approved by its 
      shareholders, the implication for investment returns in our country may 
      be devastating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe that approval of the proposed Coca-Cola plan will harm the 
      returns of all Coca-Cola shareholders, including Berkshire. If the 
      proposed plan becomes the model for subsidiaries within Berkshire, the 
      financial returns for all Berkshire shareholders would be dramatically 
      diminished. Similar plans implemented by more companies in the SP 500 
      Index could starve index fund owners of their expected returns. 
      Investors who vote for these excessively dilutive plans risk becoming 
      enablers in the spiral of ever-higher executive pay.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With enough shares remaining under existing plans to function well for 
      another year, Coca-Cola does not need a new plan at this time. 
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s board of directors should take the time to rethink and 
      refine the proposed equity plan in a manner that will be fair and 
      reasonable from the perspective of both shareholders and employees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe that Coca-Cola&#8217;s proposed 2014 Equity Plan is bad for 
      Berkshire Hathaway, bad for Coca-Cola, and bad for the investment 
      outlook for U.S. companies. This is a moment in time when America again 
      looks to you to continue to stand up for what is best for our 
      corporations and our country, just as you have talked about and done for 
      decades. Coca-Cola and Berkshire shareholders, and in reality all of 
      America, are counting on you to demand that shareholders be treated as 
      partners instead of piggy banks. This is an opportunity to champion the 
      true owners of American businesses &#8211; the shareholders.

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK, April 21 (Fitch) The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
(Goldman) reported 
solid results for first quarter 2014 (1Q'14) generally in line
with Fitch 
Ratings' expectations. Results were moderately lower than 4Q'13;
but benefitting 
from strong fixed income, currency and commodities trading and
lower 
non-compensation expenses offset by elevated compensation
expenses. 
Net revenues (excluding DVA) increased 4% sequentially to $9.3
billion at 1Q'14 
despite continued uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic
environment conditions, 
Federal Reserve bond buying tapering and interest rates.
Non-compensation 
expenses declined 24% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) primarily due
to lower 
provisions for legal and regulatory matters. Compensation
expenses increased 
$1.8 billion to $4 billion at 1Q'14 due to seasonality, but was
8% lower than 
1Q'13. Compensation represented 43% of net revenues at 1Q'14
unchanged from 
1Q'13.  
Institutional Client Services net revenues (excluding DVA impact
and the sale of 
the reinsurance business in 2013) increased 23% sequentially,
but was down 11% 
from 1Q'13.  Fixed income net revenues (excluding DVA) improved
50% from 4Q'13, 
but was 13% lower than 1Q'13.  The increase was driven by higher
market activity 
in commodities, rates and mortgages. Equities decreased 7% from
1Q'13(excluding 
the sale of Goldman's reinsurance business) as a result of less
favorable market 
conditions primarily in Japan and certain emerging markets.
Trading value at 
risk (VaR) of $82 billion was virtually unchanged from 4Q'13.  
Investment banking revenues of $1.8 billion were 4% higher than
4Q'13 driven by 
strong advisory business. Underwriting revenues were down 3% QoQ
and virtually 
unchanged year-over-year (YoY). Debt underwriting revenues were
up 29% from 
4Q'13 due to an increase in investment grade and leveraged
finance activity. 
Lower equity underwriting revenues were due to fewer IPOs during
1Q'14, which is 
consistent with industry volumes. The backlog for investment
banking remains 
strong and Goldman should benefit from increased activity.   
Investing and lending revenues decreased 26% both QoQ and YoY. 
Net revenues for 
equity securities declined 50% from a strong 4Q'13. Debt
securities and loan, 
however, benefitted from higher gains on investments and net
interest income. 
Asset management revenues of $1.5 billion were unchanged
sequentially, but up 
20% YoY. Assets under supervision increased to a record $1.08
trillion, due to 
net inflows and market appreciation.
Over the past several years, Goldman has consistently maintained
liquidity at 
conservative levels. Global core excess liquidity, including
unencumbered, 
highly liquid securities and cash, was a solid $175 billion or
19% of total 
assets at 1Q'14.  
Goldman estimated that its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III
advanced approach 
at 1Q'14 was 11.3% on a transitional basis, comfortably above
the 8.5% minimum 
and above Goldman's target of 9.5%. Goldman estimated that its
supplementary 
leverage ratio (SLR) under the rules recently proposed by the
Federal Reserve 
was approximately 4.2% for the holding company, below the
minimum threshold of 
5%. Under the new proposal, the holding company SLR was

that Goldman will be able to meet the supplementary leverage
minimums ahead of 
implementation deadline in 2018.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices grilled a lawyer for Coca-Cola Co on Monday, asking why a juice label touting the presence of pomegranates and blueberries should not be considered misleading if the drink contained just a trace of the fruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola argued that it could not be sued over the labeling of one of its Minute Maid juice products because the label complies with rules of the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees some aspects of labeling for processed foods and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POM Wonderful, which makes a product that is 100 percent pomegranate juice, had filed suit against Coca-Cola, claiming the Minute Maid juice label was misleading and would hurt sales for its own product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minute Maid juice is sold as a "Pomegranate Blueberry Flavored Blend of 5 Juices." It is mostly apple and grape juice with just 0.3 percent pomegranate juice and 0.2 percent blueberry juice, according to a POM court filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney Kathleen Sullivan, who argued for Coca-Cola, said the company could not be sued by POM for being "misleading" under the Lanham Act, which is designed to protect trademarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to disagree: "I don't know why it's impossible to have a label that fully complies with the FDA regulations and also happens to be misleading on the entirely different question of commercial competition, consumer confusion that has nothing to do with health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pomegranate and blueberries are popular with health-conscious Americans because they contain antioxidants that some believe prevent cancer and heart disease, although the science behind that belief is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question of whether the labeling is misleading drew sharp questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Anthony Kennedy said, "I think it's relevant for us to ask whether people are cheated in buying this product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sullivan said consumers were sophisticated enough to know that when they see a food label containing the word "flavored" that other juices would be in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Anthony Kennedy shot back: "Don't make me feel bad because I thought that was pomegranate juice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also raised the question of "whether people are cheated in buying this product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Sonia Sotomayor agreed with Kennedy, saying: "You're permitted to use this name under their (FDA) regulations. But why are you permitted to use it in a misleading way?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sullivan took exception to the justices' statements. "Coke's label is as a matter of law not misleading," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, addressing a related issue, argued that the FDA has a huge job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Labels for juices are not really high on its list. It has very limited resources. You are asking us to take what it has said about juice as blessing (on) this label," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy agreed: "It is doubtful that FDA has sufficient resources to police food and beverage labeling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a parallel fight, the Federal Trade Commission has accused POM of making health claims for its juices that the company cannot substantiate. POM is appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Coca-Cola closed at $40.75, up 0.07 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case at the Supreme Court is POM Wonderful LLC v.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds comments from Sotomayor and Ginsburg, adds share price)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Diane Bartz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, April 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices
grilled a lawyer for Coca-Cola Co on Monday, asking why a
juice label touting the presence of pomegranates and blueberries
should not be considered misleading if the drink contained just
a trace of the fruits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola argued that it could not be sued over the labeling
of one of its Minute Maid juice products because the label
complies with rules of the Food and Drug Administration, which
oversees some aspects of labeling for processed foods and
drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POM Wonderful, which makes a product that is 100 percent
pomegranate juice, had filed suit against Coca-Cola, claiming
the Minute Maid juice label was misleading and would hurt sales
for its own product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minute Maid juice is sold as a "Pomegranate Blueberry
Flavored Blend of 5 Juices." It is mostly apple and grape juice
with just 0.3 percent pomegranate juice and 0.2 percent
blueberry juice, according to a POM court filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney Kathleen Sullivan, who argued for Coca-Cola, said
the company could not be sued by POM for being "misleading"
under the Lanham Act, which is designed to protect trademarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to disagree: "I don't
know why it's impossible to have a label that fully complies
with the FDA regulations and also happens to be misleading on
the entirely different question of commercial competition,
consumer confusion that has nothing to do with health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pomegranate and blueberries are popular with
health-conscious Americans because they contain antioxidants
that some believe prevent cancer and heart disease, although the
science behind that belief is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question of whether the labeling is misleading drew
sharp questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Anthony Kennedy said, "I think it's relevant for us
to ask whether people are cheated in buying this product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sullivan said consumers were sophisticated enough to know
that when they see a food label containing the word "flavored"
that other juices would be in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Anthony Kennedy shot back: "Don't make me feel bad
because I thought that was pomegranate juice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also raised the question of "whether people are
cheated in buying this product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Sonia Sotomayor agreed with Kennedy, saying: "You're

&lt;p&gt;(Updates throughout with police information)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Alex Lawler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil shut one of
Britain's main underground fuel pipelines, it said on Monday,
after police found a stash of diesel they believe was siphoned
off by thieves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police arrested two men, aged 32 and 34, in connection with
the theft. Media reported that more than 30,000 litres of
diesel, worth 41,000 pounds ($70,000) at pump prices, was
involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police launched their investigation on Thursday after a
large quantity of diesel was found in a industrial storage unit
at West Wellow, Hampshire, southern England, where the thieves
are thought to have tapped into the 14-inch pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Midline Pipeline runs north from Esso's Fawley oil
refinery near Southampton to its terminal in Birmingham, central
England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two men from the Salisbury area were arrested late Sunday
and were being held in custody for questioning on Tuesday,
police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lines of enquiry include establishing the exact amount of
fuel stolen and examining the suspected sophisticated method
used in this alleged theft," police said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fuel is stored safely and securely and is being
retrieved by engineers from the nearby Esso refinery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, known as Esso in Britain, said in a statement: "Esso
is committed to the very highest standards of safety. The
pipeline has therefore been closed down, and our specialists are
working to check it and, if necessary, effect any repair."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stealing oil from pipelines is relatively rare in Britain,
but the theft of metals such as copper cable has led to
communications and rail network disruptions. In Nigeria, theft
from pipelines is estimated to cost the government up to $1
billion per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esso is making alternative supply arrangements and does not
expect its retail customers to be affected by the pipeline
closure, a company spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pipeline has a spur to Birmingham Airport, although this
is rarely used now as most fuel supplied to the airport goes by
road, he said.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, April 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices
sharply questioned a lawyer for Coca-Cola on Monday,
asking why a juice label touting pomegranate and blueberry
should not be considered misleading if the drink contained only
a tiny amount of the fruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officially, the case was about whether a competitor - in
this case POM Wonderful - could challenge as misleading the
label on a juice bottle sold by Coke's Minute Maid brand if the
Food and Drug Administration had not objected to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minute Maid juice is sold as a "Pomegranate Blueberry
Flavored Blend of 5 Juices" but is primarily apple and grape
juice with 0.3 percent pomegranate juice and 0.2 percent
blueberry juice, according to a POM court filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POM Wonderful, which makes a juice that is 100 percent
pomegranate juice, argued that the Minute Maid juice label was
misleading and would hurt sales for its product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pomegranate and blueberry are popular with health conscious
Americans because they contain antioxidants that some believe
prevent cancer and heart disease, although the science behind
that belief is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathleen Sullivan, who argued for Coca-Cola, said that the
label complied with rules laid down by the FDA, the federal
agency that oversees some aspects of food labeling for processed
foods and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, she said, the company could not be sued by POM for
being "misleading" under the Lanham Act, which is designed to
protect trademarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to disagree: "I don't

relevant for us to ask whether people are cheated in buying this
product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a parallel fight, the Federal Trade Commission has
accused POM of making health claims for its juices that the

      Tonight The Joe Torre Safe At Home Foundation will host a special 
      advance screening of Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Million Dollar Arm,&#8221; which hits theaters 
      nationwide on May 16, 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Joe Torre Safe At Home Foundation was created in 2002 to bring a 
      greater understanding, awareness and compassion to those suffering 
      through the experience of domestic abuse. Its mission is to educate to 
      end the cycle of domestic violence and save lives. The Foundation was 
      created by Joe Torre and his wife, Ali, as a result of the impact that 
      domestic violence had on Torre growing up as a child. In 2005, the 
      Foundation established its signature programming initiative, Margaret&#8217;s 
      Place, named in memory of Joe&#8217;s mother. Margaret&#8217;s Place is a 
      comprehensive program that provides students with a safe room in school 
      where they can meet with a professional trained in domestic violence 
      intervention and prevention. There are currently Margaret&#8217;s Places in 
      the Los Angeles and New York City areas.

      core values, such as children, teamwork and family,&#8221; said Torre. &#8220;I want 
      to thank Disney for giving us and our supporters the opportunity to see 
      the film in advance. We know it will be a home run.&#8221;

      Based on a true story, sports agent JB Bernstein (Jon Hamm) finds that 
      business has changed and things aren&#8217;t going well for his career. In a 
      last ditch effort to save his livelihood he concocts a scheme to find 
      baseball&#8217;s next great pitching ace. Hoping to find a young cricket 
      pitcher he can turn into a major league baseball star, JB travels to 
      India to produce a reality show competition called &#8220;The Million Dollar 
      Arm.&#8221; With the help of cantankerous but eagle-eyed retired baseball 
      scout Ray Poitevint (Alan Arkin), he discovers Dinesh (played by Madhur 
      Mittal from &#8220;Slumdog Millionaire&#8221;) and Rinku (played by Suraj Sharma 
      from &#8220;Life of Pi&#8221;), two 18-year-old boys who have no idea about playing 
      baseball, yet have a knack for throwing a fastball. Hoping to sign them 
      to major league contracts and make a quick buck, JB brings the boys home 
      to America to train. While the Americans are definitely out of their 
      element in India, the boys, who have never left their rural villages, 
      are equally challenged when they come to the States. As the boys learn 
      the finer points of baseball, JB, with the help of his charming friend 
      Brenda (Lake Bell), learns valuable life lessons about teamwork, 
      commitment and what it means to be a family.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Directed by Craig Gillespie from a screenplay written by Tom McCarthy, 
      Disney&#8217;s drama &#8220;Million Dollar Arm&#8221; stars Jon Hamm, Aasif Mandvi, Bill 
      Paxton, Suraj Sharma, Lake Bell and Alan Arkin. The producers are Mark 
      Ciardi, Gordon Gray and Joe Roth. The executive producers are Palak 
      Patel, Kevin Halloran, Bill Simmons and Connor Schell.

      Series Champion as Manager of the New York Yankees, who is currently the

      into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., on July 27, 2014.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Monday declined to review a ruling against Exxon Mobil Corp that ordered the company to pay $105 million in damages for polluting New York City's groundwater with a toxic gasoline additive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision not to hear the case leaves intact a July 2 U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that upheld the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a jury concluded that Exxon contaminated water supply wells when the additive, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), leaked from its underground storage tanks in the borough of Queens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeals court rejected Exxon's arguments that it was required to use the additive under the federal Clean Air Act. An oxygen-containing substance that is added to gasoline to promote more complete combustion and reduce air pollution, MTBE was one of several additives recommended by regulators to reduce emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has now largely been phased out of the U.S. fuel supply because of its danger to groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York City claimed Exxon went ahead and used the chemical in the 1980s through the first half of the 2000s despite warnings from its own scientists and engineers that it could be harmful in areas that relied on groundwater for drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MTBE has been identified as an animal carcinogen and a possible human carcinogen and causes water to smell foul and taste bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The water wells in southeast Queens that were contaminated serve as a backup supply for the city's drinking water when the reservoirs upstate go offline because of repairs or droughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York case was intended serve as a bellwether case to provide guidance for other MTBE complaints that have been brought around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Exxon Mobil v. City of New York, U.S. Supreme Court, 13-842.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; additional reporting by Mica Rosenberg; Editing by Will Dunham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, April 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on
Monday declined to review a ruling against Exxon Mobil Corp
 that ordered the company to pay $105 million in damages
for polluting New York City's groundwater with a toxic gasoline
additive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision not to hear the case leaves intact a July 2
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that upheld the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a jury concluded that Exxon contaminated water
supply wells when the additive, methyl tertiary butyl ether
(MTBE), leaked from its underground storage tanks in the borough
of Queens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeals court rejected Exxon's arguments that it was
required to use the additive under the federal Clean Air Act. An
oxygen-containing substance that is added to gasoline to promote
more complete combustion and reduce air pollution, MTBE was one
of several additives recommended by regulators to reduce
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has now largely been phased out of the U.S. fuel supply
because of its danger to groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York City claimed Exxon went ahead and used the chemical
in the 1980s through the first half of the 2000s despite
warnings from its own scientists and engineers that it could be
harmful in areas that relied on groundwater for drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MTBE has been identified as an animal carcinogen and a
possible human carcinogen and causes water to smell foul and
taste bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The water wells in southeast Queens that were contaminated
serve as a backup supply for the city's drinking water when the
reservoirs upstate go offline because of repairs or droughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York case was intended serve as a bellwether case to
provide guidance for other MTBE complaints that have been
brought around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Exxon Mobil v. City of New York, U.S. Supreme
Court, 13-842.

		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Company Achieves Microsoft Lync 2013 Qualification and Becomes the First Service Provider Certified on the Sonus SBC 5210 Session Border Controller to Offer TLS and SRTP for Lync 2013 Worldwide&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, TX--(Marketwired - Apr 21, 2014) -  One Source Networks (OSN), the global voice and managed network services partner of choice for large enterprises, today announced that its Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Trunking solution has earned Microsoft Lync 2013 qualification. The testing includes completion of advanced, optional SRTP and TLS support, which provides encryption of call signaling and media. OSN's SIP Trunking solution utilizes the Sonus SBC 5210 Session Border Controller, which is certified for Microsoft Lync Server 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Lync is one of the most popular Unified Communications platforms today, deployed in the majority of Fortune 500 enterprises.&#160;It provides an integrated infrastructure where users can communicate seamlessly across a range of mediums -- from chat to video to meetings. Ensuring that a service provider is Lync certified is critical for enterprises that want to take advantage of the full capabilities of the platform and require secure transmission of sensitive media, such as voice communications.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One Source Networks is proud to be leading the industry in achieving these certifications," said Ernest Cunningham, CEO of One Source Networks. "Our global enterprise customers are increasingly turning to Unified Communications to stay in touch, whether on their mobile device on the road or in their corporate headquarters. Enabling them with a Microsoft Lync-certified SIP solution guarantees interoperability, while TLS and SRTP ensure the security of communications that this market segment expects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These certifications follow OSN's 2013 announcement of the expansion of its voice network, one of the largest global deployments of the Sonus SBC 5210 Session Border Controller, with four nodes in the U.S., plus nodes in Hong Kong, London and Bogot&#225;. The company chose Sonus' SBC because of its scalability and ability to support Unified Communications, aligning with OSN's 2014 product development goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Sonus platform delivers advanced multimedia capabilities with support for voice, video and collaboration on a highly scalable, robust architecture, enabling OSN to deliver a seamless, secure Unified Communications experience to enterprises across multiple locations and devices," said David Tipping, vice president and general manager, SBC Business, Sonus. "It is a celebrated achievement to have the Sonus SBC 5210 certified for deployment with OSN's SIP Trunking solution and Microsoft Lync 2013. Together, Sonus and OSN are helping enterprises enhance network capabilities and ensure interoperability with high levels of network security in Lync environments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft Lync enables anybody in an organization to talk to anyone else -- whether inside or outside of the organization. Microsoft Lync 2013 certification is a demonstration of OSN's commitment to helping enterprises of all sizes maximize their Lync Enterprise Voice investments, and we congratulate OSN on their successful testing," said BJ Haberkorn, director of Lync product management at Microsoft. "Proven interoperability with Lync 2013 allows OSN to support enterprises' Lync deployments at all of their sites, no matter where they are located, with exceptional quality and performance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its Microsoft Lync 2013 certification, OSN becomes one of only ten service providers worldwide to currently have this qualification level. The company is able to leverage these capabilities to support the diverse UC requirements and deployment models of its global enterprise customer base. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About One Source Networks

			Walton Street Debt Fund: Out on a Limb? asks new report by UNITE HERE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Has Walton Street Capital gone out on a limb by departing from its two 
      decade long history as a real estate equity manager? The private equity 
      real estate manager launched fundraising early this year for its newest 
      fund, the Walton Street Real Estate Debt Fund, which will pursue a core 
      real estate debt strategy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A new 
      report by UNITE HERE, "Walton Street Real Estate Debt Fund: 
      Out on a Limb" is available at www.waltonstreetwrecks.org.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key points:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Until very recently, Walton Street has been primarily an equity 
        investor focused on acquiring opportunistic real estate, not a lender 
        to third-party owners of core real estate.
			
			
				Despite Walton Street's focus on opportunistic equity, results in 
        its core competency have suffered: none of Walton Street's funds 
        raised since 2000 were ranked as first quartile as of September 2013.
			
			
				Management fees charged by Walton Street for its Debt Fund would be 
        significantly higher than in peer funds. Why should LPs pay a premium 
        for an inexperienced manager with a poor track record?
			
			
				Walton Street largely failed to deploy its prior debt fund &#8212; the 
        Fund V Participating Debt Facility, which was targeted at 
        restructuring debt among troubled Fund V properties.
			
			
				Many of the worst failures by Walton Street and JMB Realty stemmed 
        from a failure to effectively manage deal-level debt, which led to 
        hundreds of millions in investor losses.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Pfizer may come back to
bid for British drug company AstraZeneca after its
reported 60 billion pound ($101 billion) takeover approach was
rejected, since a deal could make sense for the U.S.
pharmaceuticals giant as it seeks to build up its cancer
franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to adding promising - though still risky -
experimental medicines known as immunotherapies that boost the
body's immune system to fight tumours, acquiring AstraZeneca
could also generate significant cost savings, according to
industry analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, a deal at around a 25 percent premium to the
current share price funded by cash, cheap debt and some stock
could boost Pfizer earnings immediately, they believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies have declined to comment on a report in the
Sunday Times, which cited senior investment bankers and industry
sources saying that Pfizer approached the British
pharmaceuticals group about a deal. The newspaper said no talks
were currently under way after AstraZeneca resisted the
approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citi analyst Andrew Baum said he believed the report was
"very likely genuine" and Pfizer could return to the fray, given
the attractiveness of AstraZeneca's pipeline of cancer drugs,
its expertise in autoimmune diseases and the scope for taking
out costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We anticipate Pfizer to push aggressively ahead with a
second approach," Baum wrote in a research note on Monday,
adding that AstraZeneca might seek to structure any deal as a
merger of equals as a defence strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has a long track record of making major acquisitions,
with the $68 billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009 its last major
deal, after earlier acquisitions of Pharmacia and Warner
Lambert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker has more recently been divesting certain
operations and mega-mergers have fallen out of fashion in the
pharmaceuticals industry following scepticism about how well
some of them have worked. But Chief Executive Ian Read has said
he would still consider a large deal that made sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read also has an incentive to buy assets overseas rather
than in the United States since Pfizer has tens of billions of
dollars accumulated through foreign subsidiaries, which if
repatriated to the U.S. would be heavily taxed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pfizer move on AstraZeneca might flush out other bidders.
U.S. biotech giant Amgen already has a tie up with
AstraZeneca in autoimmune medicines to treat diseases like
psoriasis and severe asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novartis and larger GlaxoSmithKline have
also been mentioned in the past as potential suitors, although
GSK has in recent years said publicly it is not interested in
making a large acquisition, while Novartis is in the middle of
strategic review and already has a presence in cancer
immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at ISI, agreed cancer
immunotherapy was likely the main lure for Pfizer, since the
field is expected to become one of the biggest areas of modern
medicine in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Mark Clark at Deutsche Bank said Pfizer would be
making something of a "leap of faith" since AstraZeneca's most
exciting cancer drugs are still at an early stage of
development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has a highly promising breast cancer drug in
late-stage development called palbociclib but otherwise its
cancer portfolio is relatively weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Notably, Pfizer appears to be nowhere in the important
field of immuno-oncology, which Bristol-Myers Squibb,
Roche, Merck &amp; Co and AstraZeneca currently
dominate," Schoenebaum said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bristol, Roche and Merck are viewed as being ahead of
AstraZeneca in the new cancer field but the British firm
believes it can make up ground by pioneering drug combinations,
including the use of a medicine known as tremelimumab that it
licensed from Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca and its rivals will present the latest clinical
data on promising new cancer drugs at the May 30-June 3 annual
meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The London market was closed on Monday for Easter but the
talk of Pfizer's interest in AstraZeneca is likely to overshadow
dealings when trade resumes on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, who has been
credited for progress in rebuilding the company's new drug
pipeline since taking over in 2012, fuelling a rally in the
shares, will also come under pressure to address the reported
Pfizer approach when he presents half-year results on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculation over such a takeover, which would be potentially
the biggest ever foreign takeover of a British company, is
likely to trigger concerns about jobs in Britain's
pharmaceuticals sector, which is viewed as a key industry by the
government but which has been under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca has already laid off thousands of scientists and
other staff as it shrinks its cost base to cope with a fall in
sales due to patent losses on blockbuster medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With heartburn treatment Nexium losing U.S. patent
protection next month and cholesterol fighter Crestor facing
patent expiry in 2016, the decline in sales is expected to
continue for several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to reshape the company, Soriot is currently
moving its research and corporate headquarters to Cambridge,
England. Pfizer has also made the university city a research hub
after shuttering a large research site in Sandwich, southern
England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cambridge connection is only one link between Pfizer and
AstraZeneca, highlighting how the companies know each other
well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca's head of innovative medicines Mene Pangalos
also used to work at Pfizer and the two firms are familiar with
each other's products from working together on projects, such as
a pioneering of a new kind of clinical trial for cancer drugs
announced last week.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) asset-management business has agreed to buy Westpeak Global Advisors, a firm that aims to beat market indexes by using factors other than company size to pick stock investments.&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Application Performance Management (APM) 
      Software Market 2014-2018 with CA Technologies, Compuware, HP  IBM 
      Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/jtl652/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Application Performance Management (APM) Software Market 2014-2018 with 
      CA Technologies, Compuware, HP  IBM Dominating" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Application Performance Management Software (APM) market to 
      grow at a CAGR of 16% to 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers is the growing demand for APM-as-a-Service. 
      Cloud technology provides ease of deploying and maintaining APM software 
      which increases the overall cost savings from business operations. This 
      model has become the preferred deployment model especially for SMEs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The enterprises' staff is deeply impacted by the smart mobile devices as 
      this technology allows the staff to do their work outside the workplace. 
      Staff can bring their own device and work by using that device. Hence, 
      the need to monitor application performance on mobile phones and tablet 
      devices is rising continuously. The monitoring on mobile devices can be 
      done through real user experience monitoring. However, it is very 
      challenging to monitor a given application when accessed on different 
      devices at different times. APM reporting needs to deliver performance 
      metrics and its result to mobile devices for the operations' 
      administrators. Therefore, mobile devices are increasingly being used in 
      enterprises, and APM solutions must be able to monitor end-user 
      experiences and application performance. In addition, mobile devices are 
      also gaining popularity for displaying dashboards to APM user groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the varying needs of businesses 
      constitute one of the major challenges faced by this market. APM 
      software vendors are finding it difficult to understand the different 
      business models of buyers, which is a major setback in this market.

      has announced the addition of the "Global

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Email market to grow at a CAGR of 7% to 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the main drivers in this market is the increasing usage of mobile 
      phones and smartphones in the workplace. Currently, most E-mail 
      applications are supported by smartphones and tablets. Due to increasing 
      business expansion, employees are bringing their own devices to the 
      workplace to get updates and thereby increase their productivity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Enterprises across the globe are increasingly adopting hosted E-mail 
      platforms and other cloud-based services for their growing business 
      requirements. Hosted E-mail services allow businesses to take advantage 
      of the reduced costs of server deployment. Moreover, enterprises have 
      now realized the cost benefits associated with adopting hosted services. 
      Hosted services have various advantages such as rapid scalability, easy 
      access, uninterrupted service, and high security, and these factors are 
      responsible for their higher adoption. Hence, many organizations have 
      been slowly moving their infrastructure into the hosted platform in 
      recent years. Thus, organizations now prefer to use software through the 
      cloud model to deploy licensed versions of the software.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the requirement for a dedicated internet 
      connection is one of the major challenges confronting the market. For 
      sending and receiving E-mails, organizations require a dedicated 
      internet connection and this comes at an additional cost, thereby 
      increasing the total operational cost of an organization.

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to JPMBB 2014-C19
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) is pleased to announce the assignment of 
      preliminary ratings to 15 classes of the JPMBB 2014-C19 transaction (see 
      ratings listed below). JPMBB 2014-C19 is a $1.4 billion CMBS conduit 
      transaction collateralized by 69 fixed-rate commercial mortgage loans 
      that are secured by 100 properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loans have principal balances ranging from $1.5 million to $125.0 
      million for the largest loan in the pool, which is secured by The 
      Outlets at Orange (8.9%), a 787,697 sf retail outlet center located in 
      Orange, California. The five largest loans, which also include NSP 
      Multifamily Portfolio (8.5%), 470 Vanderbilt Avenue (7.1%), Arundel 
      Mills  Marketplace (6.4%), and 55 Broadway (5.0%), represent 35.8% of 
      the initial pool balance, while the 10 largest loans represent 52.5%. 
      Loans representing 53.8% of the pool balance have 10-year terms, and the 
      remainder of the pool is comprised of loans with terms of five years 
      (35.0%), seven-years (8.5%), and 20-years (2.7%). A sizeable portion of 
      the aggregate pool balance (65.8%) consists of loans with interest only 
      (IO) periods, which is represented by both full-term IO (36.4%) and 
      partial term IO (29.4%) loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction incorporated our multi-borrower 
      rating process that begins with our analysts' evaluation of underlying 
      collateral properties' financial and operating performance, which 
      determine KBRA&#8217;s estimate of sustainable net cash flow (KNCF) and KBRA 
      value using our CMBS Property Evaluation Guidelines. On an aggregate 
      basis, KNCF was 4.2% less than the issuer cash flow. KBRA capitalization 
      rates were applied to each asset&#8217;s KNCF to derive values that were, on 
      an aggregate basis, 34.8% less than third party appraisal values. The 
      pool has an in-trust KLTV of 99.8% and an all-in KLTV of 103.4%, which 
      was skewed by two loans, The Outlets at Orange and Arundel Mills  
      Marketplace, which are low leveraged. Without these loans, the in-trust 
      KLTV and all-in KLTV are 104.7% and 108.9%. respectively. Each of the 
      two loans has credit characteristics which are consistent with a &#8216;BBB-&#8216; 
      rated obligation when analyzed on a stand-alone basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For complete details of the analysis, please see our Presale Report, JPMBB 
      2014-C19, published today at www.krollbondratings.com. 
      The preliminary ratings are based on information known to KBRA at the 
      time of this publication. Information received subsequent to this 
      release could result in the assignment of final ratings that differ from 
      the preliminary ratings.

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of April 17, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $56,382,769 
      non-rated class, the $105,717,769 interest-only class X-C, and the 
      $21,703,000 class CSQ.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 69 loans secured by 100 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.41 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association; Barclays Bank PLC; KeyBank 
      National Association; and Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 81.6% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis on 75.1%, and asset summary reviews on 75.1% of the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.32x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 100.9%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 10.2%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 7.7% to issuer cash flows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Improved Leverage from Recent Transactions: The pool's Fitch DSCR and 
      LTV are 1.32x and 100.9%, respectively, are better than the 2013 and 
      2014 year-to-date (YTD) averages of 1.29x and 101.6%, and 1.18x and 
      104.7%, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Above-Average Property Quality: Fitch assigned property quality grades 
      of 'A-' or better to three of the 10 largest loans in the pool, which 
      represent 13.1% of the balance of properties inspected by Fitch. 
      Furthermore, property quality grades of 'B+' or better were assigned to 
      44.2% of the balance of properties inspected by Fitch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Limited Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 10.62% of the 
      initial pool balance prior to maturity. The pool's concentration of 
      partial interest loans of 29.4% is lower than the 2013 and 2014 YTD 
      averages of 34% and 37.63%, respectively. However, the pool's 
      concentration of full-term interest-only loans at 36.4% is higher than 
      the 2013 and 2014 YTD averages of 17.1% and 15.8%, respectively. There 
      is one fully amortizing loan, Centerville Square (2.7%), and Grand 
      Williston Hotel (0.8%) is a five-year loan amortizing on a 10-year 
      schedule.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 10.26% below the 
      most recent reported net operating income (NOI) (for properties that NOI 
      was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in 
      higher defaults and loss severity on defaulted loans and could result in 
      potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch evaluated the 
      sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMBB 2014-C19 certificates and 
      found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further 
      declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 10% from 
      Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'AAsf' 
      could result. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from 
      Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' 
      could result. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 
      30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 
      'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report includes a detailed 
      explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying pre-sale report.

			Wintergreen Asks Shareholders to Consider Nine Points Before Voting 
      on Coca-Cola&#8217;s Equity Plan
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ahead of the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) annual shareholders&#8217; meeting 
      tomorrow, April 23, David Winters, CEO of Wintergreen Advisers, wrote a 
      letter intended for all Coca-Cola shareholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Winters wrote &#8220;We believe Coca-Cola&#8217;s 2014 annual proxy statement fails 
      to present important information &#8216;in a clear and easy to read manner&#8217; 
      with regard to the description of the proposed equity plan. We hope all 
      fiduciaries will consider this letter and the attachment; &#8216;Nine Points 
      to Consider Before Voting on Coca-Cola&#8217;s 2014 Equity Plan,&#8217; in light of 
      the material Coca-Cola has provided and ask themselves whether Coca-Cola 
      has been forthcoming about the implications of the proposed equity plan.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Winters continued &#8220;If there is significant opposition to the proposed 
      equity plan, we believe the Coca-Cola board should consider whether it 
      has a sufficient mandate from shareholders to fully implement the plan. 
      Should the board proceed with the plan, we will be watching closely to 
      see whether it is executed in a manner that serves shareholders&#8217; 
      interests and will continue to communicate our concerns.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Separately, earlier today the Florida State Board of Administration, 
      owner of approximately 6.4 million Coca-Cola shares, announced it has 
      voted against the Coca-Cola 2014 equity plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The full text of the letter is included below.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Wintergreen Advisers, LLC Letter to Coca-Cola Shareholders
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      April 22, 2014
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dear Fellow Coca-Cola Shareholders:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since we made public our first letters to the Coca-Cola Board of 
      Directors and Warren Buffett on March 21, we have been fortunate to 
      receive expressions of support from many shareholders, both large and 
      small, who share our concerns about Coca-Cola&#8217;s proposed equity plan. 
      Several large institutional investors have publicly announced their 
      opposition to the proposed equity plan, and we are hopeful that even 
      more will come forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wintergreen Advisers, LLC, like other institutional investors, fund 
      managers and financial advisers, has a fiduciary duty to its clients to 
      act in their interests when voting on proxy matters. We all rely on a 
      public company's proxy materials to present important information &#8220;in a 
      clear and easy to read manner&#8221; and expect a &#8220;plain English explanation 
      of how boards arrive at pay decisions.&#8221;1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wintergreen believes Coca-Cola&#8217;s 2014 annual proxy statement fails to 
      meet these standards with regard to the description of the proposed 
      equity plan. We hope all fiduciaries will consider this letter and the 
      attachment &#8220;Nine Points to Consider Before Voting on Coca-Cola&#8217;s 
      Proposed 2014 Equity Plan&#8221; in light of the material Coca-Cola has 
      provided and ask themselves whether Coca-Cola has been forthcoming about 
      the implications of the proposed equity plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Like many other institutions, Wintergreen reports its proxy voting 
      record each year and gives careful consideration to every vote we cast 
      on behalf of our clients. We simply could not justify a vote in favor of 
      Coca-Cola's proposed equity plan once we understood its potential impact 
      on our clients&#8217; investment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We concluded that Coca-Cola was proposing a very bad plan. It is bad for 
      Coca-Cola, the vast majority of Coca-Cola employees and above all, it is 
      bad for shareholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Recently, Coca-Cola issued a statement that the proposed equity plan is 
      "closely in line with past plans approved by the Board and the 
      shareowners,&#8221;2 but we believe it is abundantly clear that 
      this is simply not true. The proposed equity plan is potentially highly 
      dilutive and destructive to long-term shareholder value. We do not 
      believe it is in shareholders&#8217; best interests to have their investment 
      diluted so that the top 5% of Coca-Cola&#8217;s most highly compensated 
      employees can be gifted with equity to this extent, above and beyond 
      their cash compensation and other benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We are long-term investors and we want management to be well-rewarded if 
      they do a great job for shareholders, but under the proposed plan the 
      division of value tilts too far in favor of Coca-Cola&#8217;s management at 
      the expense of shareholders. By increasing stock-option awards, 
      shortening the award period and including lower performance hurdles, we 
      believe the plan could lead to outsized rewards for management and 
      increased dilution for shareholders. This is not in the best interest of 
      Coca-Cola or its shareholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We look forward to the results of the balloting on the proposed equity 
      plan and believe the final vote will show that there are many investors 
      who share our concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If there is significant opposition to the proposed equity plan, we 
      believe the Coca-Cola board should consider whether it has a sufficient 
      mandate from shareholders to fully implement the plan. Should the board 
      proceed with the plan, we will be watching closely to see whether it is 
      executed in a manner that serves shareholders&#8217; interests and will 
      continue to communicate our concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sincerely,
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

      David J. Winters, CEOWintergreen Advisers, LLC.973-263-4500
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Nine Points to Consider Before Voting on Coca-Cola&#8217;s 2014 Equity Plan
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wintergreen Advisers urges all shareholders to carefully consider the 
      following items as they prepare vote on the plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			1. Coca-Cola&#8217;s proposed plan, unlike previous plans, allows an 
      individual to receive more than 5% of the awards available under the 
      plan.3
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2. The proposed plan permits the Compensation Committee to award 
      "bonus shares" that are &#8220;not subject to any restrictions or conditions.4
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			3. The proposed plan includes 27 criteria that can potentially be 
      used by the board to justify equity awards, many of which are not 
      subject to any disclosed standard of success.5 In 
      recent measurement periods, the hurdle rate that must be met to receive 
      shares and options has been lowered. While the hurdle rate has been 
      raised for the current measurement period, it is below what was required 
      in previous periods.6
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			4. The proposed plan allows Coca-Cola's Compensation Committee to 
      &#8220;exclude&#8221; and &#8220;adjust&#8221; certain items from the evaluation of management 
      performance.7 In football terms, this allows the 
      Compensation Committee to move the goal posts closer once the ball is in 
      the air.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			5. The proposed plan, when combined with previous plans, could dilute 
      shareholders by up to 16.6%.8
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			6. The proposed plan, as envisioned by Coca-Cola, will result in the 
      issuance of up to 340,000,000 shares and options.9 
      This represents a 21% increase in potential awards compared to the 
      previous plan.10
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			7. The proposed plan allows the Compensation Committee to issue these 
      340,000,000 shares and options over four years.11 
      This time period is more than 33% shorter than the time period under the 
      2008 plan.12
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			8. The proposed plan may require Coca-Cola to spend even more on 
      share repurchases than the $1.3 billion it spent in 2013 in order to 
      offset dilution.13 These 2013 buybacks comprised 
      27% of Coca-Cola&#8217;s &#8220;robust share repurchase program,&#8221;14 a 
      figure that could rise under the proposed plan and divert a significant 
      portion of the company&#8217;s cash flow away from more productive and 
      profitable uses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			9.
			Coca-Cola&#8217;s compensation policies get a low rating from a 
      leading proxy advisory firm. Institutional Shareholder Services 
      (ISS) gives Coca-Cola&#8217;s compensation policy a score of 8, near the 
      bottom of the ISS scale.15

			Chevron Unveils PitPack Motor Oil Dispensing System
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Solution Designed to Increase Efficiency and Profitability while 
      Significantly Reducing Waste for Professional Motor Oil Installers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Products Company, a Chevron U.S.A. Inc. division, maker of the 
      Havoline&#174; brand of advanced engine oils, today introduced its 
      new Chevron PitPack easy-dispense motor oil system. The unique packaging 
      and delivery system helps professional motor oil installers more 
      efficiently store and deliver oil to customer vehicles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The PitPack system can reduce landfill waste by up to 89 percent by 
      using 6-gallon plastic bags and recyclable corrugate boxes of motor oil 
      rather than individual plastic quart bottles. This package can reduce a 
      car&#8217;s time needed in a service bay by dispensing motor oil quickly from 
      the boxes via a high-flow, no drip tap. Chevron&#8217;s PitPack rack also has 
      a unique shelf design to keep fluid spills from reaching the floor and 
      allows for easy clean up in fast-paced shop environments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The up-right PitPack rack system takes up approximately half the space 
      of the equivalent volume of quart cases, allowing businesses to provide 
      the broad range of Havoline&#174;, Delo&#174; and Supreme 
      products. It is a bulk-type alternative for locations where adding 
      another tank is not viable and space for a 55-gallon drum is not 
      available. This solution helps professional installers manage the 
      complexity associated with the growing number of premium products 
      (synthetics, synthetic blends, and high mileage).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Port Consolidated Inc., a Chevron 1st Source Elite 
      Lubrication Marketer, has already seen the benefits of the PitPack 
      system. According to Michael Griffith, vice president for the company, 
      &#8220;The PitPack system is a win for Port Consolidated, a win for our 
      installers, and a win for the consumers. As a distributor, we benefit 
      from an increased ability to penetrate accounts with specialty 
      lubricants and a reduction in delivery frequency as opposed to typical 
      case goods. Our installers benefit from better inventory control, lower 
      cost of goods, and faster turn times. Additionally, the end users like 
      the fact that they are doing their part to help the environment by doing 
      business with a facility that reduces waste.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dave Schletewitz, Havoline North America Brand Manager at Chevron, 
      added, &#8220;The PitPack system can deliver significant operational 
      efficiencies, at a lower cost than dealing with quart packages, all with 
      strong environmental benefits. This 8-box rack system significantly 
      reduces plastic waste by holding the equivalent of 192 plastic quart 
      bottles in its 100% recyclable corrugate boxes. It&#8217;s a win-win for 
      businesses looking to improve profits, efficiency and their 
      environmental stewardship &#8211; and a win for consumers who want to spend 
      their dollars with businesses that are committed to reducing waste in 
      their community.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There will be 20 motor oil products available across the Havoline&#174;, 
      Delo&#174; and Supreme brands, and product orders can be made 
      through the regular channels.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds details, background from para 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Alex Lawler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 22 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is working
to reopen one of Britain's main underground fuel pipelines after
the discovery of a tapping device and a stash of diesel that
police believe was siphoned off by thieves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which operates as Esso in Britain, said on
Tuesday that the device was found on the Midline pipeline that
transports fuel from its Fawley Refinery near the south coast to
its Birmingham fuel terminal in central England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our specialists are now working to remove the tapping
device and repair and test the pipeline and restore it to normal
operations as soon as possible," Exxon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuel tapping from pipelines is a major problem in countries
such as Nigeria, costing billions of dollars a year, but is
virtually unknown in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police launched an investigation on Thursday after a large
quantity of diesel was found in an industrial storage unit at
West Wellow in Hampshire, southern England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media reported that more than 30,000 litres of diesel was
involved, worth 41,000 pounds ($70,000) at pump prices. Police
said on Monday that they had arrested two men, aged 32 and 34,
in connection with the theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said on Tuesday that there has been no product leaks
and it does not expect retail customers to be affected by the
pipeline closure because it has made alternative supply
arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While fuel tapping from UK pipelines is rare, media have
reported a small but growing number of fuel thefts from vehicle
tanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theft of metals, such as copper cable, has led to
communications and rail network disruptions.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Multi-Cloud Cost Management and Financial Analytics Software Released
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Embotics&#174;, a leading provider of enterprise-class Cloud 
      Management Software, today announced it is releasing a set of new 
      multi-cloud cost management and financial analytics capabilities within 
      its latest release of the Embotics vCommander&#8482; software. The new 
      vCommander 5.1 release is generally available this month, April 2014, 
      and will expand on the company&#8217;s mission of helping enterprises and 
      service providers to better analyze, orchestrate, govern and broker 
      across multi-hypervisor and multi-cloud environments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Support for IBM SoftLayer&#174;, Microsoft&#174; Azure, 
      Google Cloud Platform, and Rackspace&#174; Public Cloud has been 
      added to vCommander 5.1, allowing Embotics&#8217; users to model and compare 
      the economics of running their workloads across one or more hypervisor 
      and cloud platforms. These new platforms are in addition to the support 
      within vCommander for VMware&#174; vSphere&#174;, Microsoft 
      Hyper-V, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and the OpenStack&#174; based 
      HP Cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have enhanced the innovative capabilities of the Embotics vCommander 
      Cloud Management Platform to model economics and make comparative 
      financial recommendations across a growing set of on-premises hypervisor 
      and off-premises cloud platforms. This powerful new software allows our 
      customers to make informed decisions regarding where to place their 
      workloads and how best to optimize their costs over time,&#8221; said Jay 
      Litkey, Founder and President of Embotics.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Embotics&#8217; philosophy remains &#8216;No vendor lock-in.&#8217; Our customers value 
      freedom of choice and the ability to deploy and manage platform-neutral 
      IT services across private, public and hybrid cloud environments based 
      on economic recommendations, these are very important to them,&#8221; added 
      Michael Torto, Chief Executive Officer of Embotics.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Embotics vCommander 5.1 continuously monitors and discovers a user&#8217;s 
      existing virtual assets contained within their data centers and 
      off-premises public clouds. Through integrated financial analytics, 
      vCommander helps quantify the costs of operating the current virtual 
      infrastructure, and then performs comparative assessments and 
      recommendations across alternative hypervisor and cloud platforms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As a platinum channel partner of Embotics, we are excited to offer this 
      new cross-cloud capability to the market,&#8221; said Mark Westling, Chief 
      Technology Officer of Right! Systems Inc. and also a founding member of 
      the M7 Global Partners, a leading consortium of leading IT Solutions 
      Providers. &#8220;Platform-neutral, open hybrid cloud computing is the way of 
      the future and certainly supports our role as a trusted advisor for our 
      customers. Understanding &#8216;which cloud is right for me?&#8217; can be a very 
      difficult question to answer and requires sophisticated software 
      analytics like those contained in Embotics vCommander to do well.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Embotics vCommander 5.1 also consists of a number of other new 
      capabilities including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Support for HP Public Cloud extending vCommander&#8217;s self-service and 
        provisioning automation.
      
			
        A number of enhanced workflow capabilities allowing for even faster 
        automation of IT-as-a-Service (ITaaS) delivery; for example, 
        out-of-the-box BlueCat IPAM integration.
      
			
        Console connection proxy providing self-service users access to their 
        Virtual Machines (VMs) without the need for direct network access to 
        the underlying hypervisor management platform&#8212;VMware vCenter or 
        Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM). This is 
        especially important for secure enterprise environments and managed 
        service providers.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Embotics&#8217; 100+ clients now include such high profile organizations as 
      NASA, Cisco, the Netherlands Ministry of Defence, Cablevision, McKinsey 
       Company, Jabil Circuit, and Peak 10. One of Embotics&#8217; largest 
      deployments provides federated management of close to 30 globally 
      distributed data centers.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 22 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil said it
found a tapping device on a UK oil products pipeline following
reports that a stash of diesel had been discovered that police
said had been siphoned off by thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Esso Midline pipeline is secure and there has been no
leak of product," Exxon, known as Esso in the UK, said in a
statement on Tuesday. "The pipeline was closed as a precaution
following the discovery of the fuel store."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Esso is committed to the very highest standards of safety,
and our specialists are now working to remove the tapping device
and repair and test the pipeline and restore it to normal
operations as soon as possible."

 (Adds company source on bidders)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, April 22 (Reuters) - Lufthansa's IT
infrastructure business, which the airline is trying to sell, is
drawing interest from big IT groups IBM, Hewlett-Packard

		&lt;h1&gt;InVisage Tops $100 Million in Funding With New $18 Million Round, Expands Exec Team&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;MENLO PARK, CA--(Marketwired - Apr 22, 2014) -  As it readies its QuantumFilm&#8482; Camera Sensor for launch, InVisage Technologies, Inc. today announced a new round of funding, two new leadership appointments and a first product sampling to select customers. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;InVisage's $18 million round of funding brings the total amount that it has raised since its creation to more than $100 million. Investors include GGV Capital, Nokia Growth Partners, RockPort Capital, InterWest Partners, Intel Capital and OnPoint Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The additional funding enables InVisage to scale manufacturing capacity from its initial pilot production line to support high volume customers and further its mission to mass produce fast, thin, high performance cameras in ultra-small form-factors.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;InVisage's QuantumFilm&#8482; is the camera industry's most significant development since the invention of CCDs. Initially targeted at smartphones, QuantumFilm&#8482; cameras produce, high-quality photos, even in extreme lighting conditions. InVisage has transformed the camera sensor by adding a thin layer of quantum dot film on standard CMOS wafers to produce high performance cameras that can be mass-produced leveraging conventional CMOS processes. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;InVisage also expanded its leadership team with two new additions: Ephraim Kwok as CFO and Emanuele Mandelli as VP of Engineering. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Kwok brings more than 35 years of financial management experience, including over 20 years as a CFO. Between 2005 and 2012, he was the CFO of Alpha and Omega Semiconductor where he successfully completed a private round of financing, an IPO and two strategic acquisitions. During his tenure at Elantec Semiconductor, he successfully completed a follow-on public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Mandelli has more than 20 years of image sensor, x-ray detectors and particle physics detectors experience. He began his career at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory where he designed integrated circuits for high energy physics, space and medical instrumentation. He delivered the pixel readout modules for the Atlas CERN inner detector that eventually confirmed the Higgs boson theory. He then joined AltaSens, an early stage venture spun off from Rockwell Scientific later acquired by JVC Kenwood where he designed high end CMOS image sensors for cinematographers, television broadcasters and filmmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"I am delighted to welcome Ephraim and Emanuele to the InVisage family," said InVisage President and CEO Jess Lee. "With the breadth of knowledge and experience they bring, Ephraim and Emanuele further strengthens our base in order to bring QuantumFilm&#8482; products to market and ushering in a new era in cameras."&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"QuantumFilm&#8482; is one of the most exciting camera innovations we have seen in the last decade, as conventional CMOS sensors have hit an innovation wall," said Bo Ilsoe, Partner, Nokia Growth Partners and InVisage board member. "Jess has built a great team at InVisage and they are now bringing their highly differentiated products to the market."&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;InVisage also revealed that the first InVisage QuantumFilm&#8482; image sensor has begun sampling to selected customers. For more up-to-date information, please visit www.invisage.com/blog.

			OPT Pivotal #1 and OPT Pivotal #2 Studies, Together with Three

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today top-line results from two pivotal 
      Phase 3 trials from the Oral 
      treatment Psoriasis Trials 
      (OPT) Program, OPT Pivotal #1 (A3921078) and OPT Pivotal #2 (A3921079), 
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase 
      (JAK) inhibitor, the first in a new class of medicines being 
      investigated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. 
      The OPT Pivotal #1 and OPT Pivotal #2 studies showed that tofacitinib, 
      as a 5 mg or a 10 mg dose taken as a pill twice-daily, met the primary 
      efficacy endpoints of statistically significant superiority over placebo 
      at Week 16 in the proportion of subjects achieving a Physician&#8217;s Global 
      Assessment response of &#8220;clear&#8221; or &#8220;almost clear,&#8221; and the proportion of 
      subjects achieving at least a 75% reduction in Psoriasis Area and 
      Severity Index, two commonly used measures of efficacy in psoriasis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      No new safety signals for tofacitinib were observed in the OPT Pivotal 
      #1 or OPT Pivotal #2 studies. Detailed analyses of these studies, 
      including additional efficacy and safety data, will be submitted for 
      presentation at a future scientific meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Psoriasis is a long-term disease with no cure that can have a 
      significant impact on patients. Although it is one of the most common 
      chronic inflammatory diseases, many psoriasis patients remain untreated, 
      undertreated or dissatisfied with their treatment, according to recently 
      published surveys,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Romano, Global Medicines Development 
      Lead for the Pfizer Global Innovative Pharmaceutical business. 
      &#8220;Tofacitinib is the first in a new class of investigational psoriasis 
      treatments, and I am encouraged by our Phase 3 results to-date that 
      demonstrate the potential of tofacitinib to be an important new 
      treatment option for adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque 
      psoriasis.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Top-line results from the first two studies from the OPT Program, OPT 
      Compare and OPT Retreatment, were previously announced in October 2013, 
      and these four studies, in addition to a long-term extension study, will 
      form the planned psoriasis submission package to regulatory authorities 
      in various markets. Pfizer currently intends to submit a supplemental 
      New Drug Application (sNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) for the approval of tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice-daily for the 
      treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis by 
      early 2015.

			About OPT Pivotal #1 (A3921078) and OPT Pivotal #2 (A3921079)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OPT Pivotal #1 and OPT Pivotal #2 were Phase 3, 52-week, multi-site, 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies 
      evaluating the safety and efficacy of tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg 
      twice-daily in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis 
      who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. There were over 
      900 patients randomized into each of the studies.

			About the OPT Clinical Trial Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Phase 3 OPT clinical trial program consists of five studies 
      (including one long-term extension study) evaluating oral tofacitinib 5 
      mg and 10 mg twice-daily in adults with moderate-to-severe chronic 
      plaque psoriasis. It is a global, comprehensive clinical development 
      program that includes over 3,600 patients in 36 countries, and is one of 
      the largest global clinical trial programs in moderate-to-severe chronic 
      plaque psoriasis to date. In addition to the OPT Pivotal #1 and OPT 
      Pivotal #2 studies, the OPT Program includes the following Phase 3 
      studies of tofacitinib in adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque 
      psoriasis:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				OPT Compare (A3921080):
				A 12-week, Phase 3 study 
        comparing the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg 
        twice-daily to high-dose ENBREL (etanercept) 50 mg twice-weekly as 
        well as to placebo.
      
			
				OPT Retreatment (A3921111): A Phase 3 study evaluating the 
        efficacy and safety of the withdrawal from, and then the retreatment 
        with, tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice-daily compared to placebo.
      
			
				OPT Extend (A3921061): A long-term extension study evaluating 
        the safety and tolerability of tofacitinib. Patients who participated 
        in the Phase 2 trial or any of the other Phase 3 studies had the 
        option, if eligible, to enroll in this study.

			About Plaque Psoriasis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated disease, affecting the skin and 
      other organs, such as nails and joints. It affects approximately 
      two-to-three percent of people worldwide and 7.4 million people in the 
      United States.1,2,3,4,5,6,7 Due to inconsistent response to 
      treatment, adverse effects, and the limited persistence of therapeutic 
      effects of some therapies, a need for additional therapies for patients 
      with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis still remains.8,9,10 
      According to recently published surveys, approximately 50% of patients 
      with psoriasis are dissatisfied with their treatment, and 
      under-treatment represents a significant problem. Even though guidelines 
      typically state that moderate-to-severe patients are candidates for 
      systemic therapy &#8211; e.g., medicines given by mouth or an injection - many 
      treated adult plaque psoriasis patients appear to be undertreated, with 
      approximately 30% of treated moderate patients and 22% of treated severe 
      patients receiving only topical therapies, like ointments and creams, in 
      the U.S.11
		&lt;/p&gt;

			XELJANZ&#174; (tofacitinib citrate) RA U.S. Label Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tofacitinib is approved in more than 20 countries around the world for 
      the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. In the U.S., 
      the brand name for tofacitinib is XELJANZ&#174; (ZEL&#8217; JANS&#8217;) 5 mg 
      tablets, and it is approved for the treatment of adults with moderately 
      to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate 
      response or intolerance to methotrexate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XELJANZ is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) 
      inhibitor. XELJANZ is used to treat adults with moderately to severely 
      active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not work well.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in people with 
        Hepatitis B or C.
      
			
        XELJANZ is not for people with severe liver problems.
      
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in children.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				XELJANZ can lower the ability of the immune system to fight 
        infections. Some people have serious infections while taking XELJANZ, 
        including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, 
        or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died 
        from these infections. Healthcare providers should test patients for 
        TB before starting XELJANZ, and monitor them closely for signs and 
        symptoms of TB and other infections during treatment. People should 
        not start taking XELJANZ if they have any kind of infection unless 
        their healthcare provider tells them it is okay.
			
			
				XELJANZ may increase the risk of certain cancers by changing the 
        way the immune system works. Malignancies were observed in clinical 
        studies of XELJANZ.
			
			
        The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to 
        initiating XELJANZ in patients with chronic or recurrent infection; 
        who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of a serious or 
        an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of 
        endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions 
        that may predispose them to infection.
      
			
        Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation 
        (e.g., herpes zoster), was observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ.
      
			
        Use of live vaccines should be avoided concurrently with XELJANZ. 
        Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines 
        prior to initiating XELJANZ therapy.
      
			
        Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to 
        prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain 
        white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr 
        virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).
      
			
        Some people taking XELJANZ get tears in their stomach or intestines. 
        This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal 
        anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. 
        Patients should tell their healthcare provider right away if they have 
        fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away, or a change in 
        bowel habits. XELJANZ should be used with caution in patients who may 
        be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients 
        with a history of diverticulitis).
      
			
        XELJANZ can cause changes in certain lab test results including low 
        blood cell counts, increases in certain liver tests, and increases in 
        cholesterol levels. Healthcare providers should do blood tests before 
        starting patients on XELJANZ and while they are taking XELJANZ, to 
        check for these side effects. Normal cholesterol levels are important 
        to good heart health. Healthcare providers may stop XELJANZ treatment 
        because of changes in blood cell counts or liver test results.
      
			
        Use of XELJANZ in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not 
        recommended.
      
			
        Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to become 
        pregnant or are pregnant.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is not known if XELJANZ will harm an unborn baby. To monitor the 
      outcomes of pregnant women exposed to XELJANZ, a registry has been 
      established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients and pregnant 
      women are encouraged to register themselves by calling 1-877-311-8972.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to 
        breastfeed or are breastfeeding. Patients and their healthcare 
        provider should decide if they will take XELJANZ or breastfeed. They 
        should not do both.
      
			
        In carriers of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the 
        liver), the virus may become active while using XELJANZ. Healthcare 
        providers may do blood tests before and during treatment with XELJANZ.
      
			
        Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common 
        cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, and nasal congestion, 
        sore throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis).

      Research and Markets: Global Talent Management Software Market 
      2014-2018: IBM Corp., Oracle Corp., SAP AG, and SumTotal Systems Inc 
      Dominates the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/dmrgp6/global_talent) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Talent Management Software Market 2014-2018: IBM Corp., Oracle Corp., 
      SAP AG, and SumTotal Systems Inc Dominates the Industry" report 
      to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Talent Management Software market to grow at a CAGR of 17% to 
      2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers in this market is the need to streamline HR 
      functions. Talent management software helps to streamline HR activities 
      and improve the operational efficiency of an organization. Management 
      tools have been gaining prominence in organizations; moreover, talent 
      management applications provide the right kind of solutions to the 
      growing administrative concerns of a company's HR division.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In recent years, the high adoption of cloud computing technology by 
      enterprises has been one of the emerging trends in the Global Talent 
      Management Software market. Cloud-based talent management software acts 
      as an infrastructure design with a higher potential than traditional 
      talent management deployment methods. Thus, organizations can use their 
      private cloud for supporting their HR analytics. The budget constraints 
      for IT, insufficient time to build in-house software, and cost 
      advantages attached to hosted or on-demand software subscriptions are 
      the primary factors responsible for the increased adoption of 
      cloud-based talent management solutions by enterprises. In addition, 
      cloud services do not have overhead costs of space, power, and cooling 
      that are generally incurred with the deployment of traditional in-house 
      talent management solutions. Hence, the growing popularity of cloud 
      computing technology is a recent trend that is expected to auger well 
      for the growth of the market during the forecast period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the difficulty in selecting the right 
      vendor is one of the major challenges confronting this market. The 
      evaluation and selection of talent management software is a 
      time-consuming process because of its complexity. Organizations have to 
      ensure that the talent management software is able to link directly to 
      their existing HR software applications and share uninterrupted data.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 22 (Reuters) - Shares in European drugmakers
received a shot in the arm on Tuesday amid a flurry of activity,
with Novartis striking a multi-billion dollar deal with
GlaxoSmithKline and reports U.S. giant Pfizer had approached
Britain's AstraZeneca over a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and AstraZeneca declined to comment
on a Sunday Times report of a possible $100 billion deal, but
the potential bid fueled speculation the sector was ripe for
consolidation as drugmakers build scale in specialized areas
where they can find growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European healthcare sector index was up 2.8
percent at 0927 GMT, led by AstraZeneca, up 6.5 percent at 4,030
pence, and GSK, up 5.4 percent at 1,643 pence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Britain's Hikma Pharmaceuticals and BTG
also rose more than 4 percent, while Shire, a perennial
subject of takeover speculation, was up 4.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also pointed to Belgium's UCB SA, up 3.1
percent, and Switzerland's Actelion, 1.5 percent
stronger, as potential targets for a larger rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citi said the "usual suspects were likely to return to
focus", noting that previously cited potential targets in Europe
included Shire, Actelion and UCB, based on either promising
pipelines or significant cost and tax synergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect renewed interest in the use of offshore cash held
by US companies to fund ex-US M," the analysts said in a
briefing note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sunday Times cited sources saying informal conversations
had taken place between Pfizer and AstraZeneca but the British
company resisted the approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big driver behind Pfizer's interest is drugs to treat
cancer, including promising experimental medicines in
AstraZeneca's pipeline know as immunotherapies, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novartis is also strengthening its oncology
portfolio with the GlaxoSmithKline deal, an area in which GSK
said it ranked outside the global top 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swiss drugmaker is paying $14.5 billion for GSK's
oncology business and is also divesting its vaccines business to
GSK for $7.1 billion plus royalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate transaction, Novartis said it had agreed to
divest its animal health division to Eli Lilly for about
$5.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novartis shares rose 2.5 percent in morning trade to 76.5
euros.

      Research and Markets: Global Human Machine Interface (HMI) Market 
      2014-2018 with General Electric, Invensys  Schneider Electric 
      Dominating the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/xrjkbb/global_human) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Human Machine Interface (HMI) Market 2014-2018 with General Electric, 
      Invensys  Schneider Electric Dominating the Industry" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Human Machine Interface (HMI) market to grow at a CAGR of 10% 
      to 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The growth in industrial automation is one of the major drivers in the 
      market. The Process industry in the APAC region is growing faster than 
      the global Process industry, creating a positive impact on the HMI 
      market in this region.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      HMI vendors are continually developing their technology to survive in 
      the competitive business environment in which they operate. They have 
      started developing proactive HMI systems that act as diagnostic tools 
      and help implement preventive measures in manufacturing plants. With the 
      help of these proactive HMI systems, end-users can locate and control 
      production-related problems. In addition, these HMI systems have video 
      capabilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the continuous decline in product prices 
      is one of the major challenges in the market. The prices of HMI systems 
      are steadily declining as a result of the increased popularity of open 
      source HMI software and the easy availability of low-cost HMI systems. 
      These factors have a negative effect on the pricing strategy of HMI 
      vendors.

      Research and Markets: Gulf Cooperation Council IT Market Report 
      2014-2018 with Dell Inc., Hewlett Packard Co., IBM Corp. and Lenovo 
      Group Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/726s5s/it_market_in_gcc) 
      has announced the addition of the "IT 
      Market in GCC 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The market in to grow at a CAGR of 8% to 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Many investors across the globe are focusing on GCC countries. Investors 
      are being attracted by the large market size and high purchasing power 
      of GCC countries. Also, the increasing focus on non-oil sectors by 
      governments of GCC countries is another factor that has led to increased 
      interest among investors. The UAE and Saudi Arabia top the list in terms 
      of FDI, while Kuwait and Qatar are still catching up. GCC countries were 
      the recipients of around 5 percent of global FDI in 2013. The IT sector 
      has attracted 10-12 percent of the total number of FDI deals in the GCC 
      during the last five years. Various IT investment programs and 
      e-government initiatives are key reasons why the IT industry is a 
      lucrative option for investors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the adoption of cloud services is still in the 
      early stages in the GCC. Although only one-third of GCC enterprises are 
      currently using some form of cloud, many others are showing increased 
      interest in it. It has been observed that there is a specific interest 
      among organizations in adopting private clouds, and Telecom is one of 
      the largest spending sectors in this area.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that GCC countries are highly vulnerable to 
      cyber attacks as they are a prime target for cyber criminals. There have 
      been attacks on government, financial institutions, and some MNCs.

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, April 22 (Reuters) - Lufthansa's IT
infrastructure business, which the airline is trying to sell, is
drawing interest from IBM, Hewlett-Packard and
France's Atos, German paper Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung (FAZ) reported, without citing any sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lufthansa earlier this month said it was seeking a buyer for
the business, part of its IT unit Lufthansa Systems, and has
already held some early talks with interested parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM declined to comment on the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atos and HP were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are in talks with several sector heavyweights about a
takeover of the IT infrastructure, and we want to secure most of
the jobs following a sale," Lufthansa's Chief Financial Officer
Simone Menne told FAZ in an interview published on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the plans, Lufthansa Systems will be divided
into three parts - Infrastructure, Airline Solutions and
Industry Solutions. The infrastructure division, which employs
1,400 people, will be sold, while the other two will remain
within the Lufthansa group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the infrastructure business accounted for 40 percent
of Systems' total turnover of 640 million euros ($883.45
million), it made up only 25 percent of the unit's profit.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit against the Federal Reserve Bank of New York by a former bank examiner who claimed the Fed fired her after she refused to change certain findings about Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams in Manhattan ruled that the failure by the former examiner, Carmen Segarra, to connect her disclosure of Goldman's alleged violations to her May 2012 firing was "fatal" to her whistleblower lawsuit. Abrams also said Segarra could not file an amended lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Congress sought to protect employees of banking agencies ... who adequately allege that they have suffered retaliation for providing information regarding a possible violation of a 'law or regulation,'" the judge wrote. "Plaintiff has not done so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segarra's findings that Goldman's conflict-of-interest practices may have violated merely an "advisory letter" that did not carry the force of law did not entitle her to whistleblower protection under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, Abrams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linda Stengle, a lawyer for Segarra, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack Gutt, a New York Fed spokesman, declined to comment. The New York Fed has said its personnel decisions are based exclusively on job performance and subject to thorough review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EL PASO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segarra said she joined the New York Fed in October 2011, after previously working as a lawyer at Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that at the New York Fed, her legal compliance and risk team had initially voted to downgrade Goldman's annual rating for policies and procedures, after she had determined that the bank had no companywide conflict of interest policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said her boss, Michael Silva, and his deputy, Michael Koh, became concerned that a downgrade could cause clients to stop doing business with the Wall Street bank, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Segarra's review included the roughly $23 billion takeover of pipeline company El Paso Corp by Kinder Morgan Inc. Goldman advised El Paso on the 2012 merger despite holding a big stake in Kinder Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silva, Koh and another supervisor, Johnathon Kim, were also defendants in Segarra's lawsuit, and Abrams dismissed claims against them. Goldman was not a defendant. A bank spokesman, Michael DuVally, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUDGE-SHOPPING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her ruling on Wednesday, Abrams also rejected a move by Stengle for greater disclosure by the judge about her husband's relationship with Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abrams disclosed on April 3 that she had just learned that her husband, Greg Andres, a partner at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, was representing Goldman in an advisory capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stengle said at the time she would not seek Abrams' recusal, the judge said, and went ahead the next day with scheduled oral arguments on the defendants' bid to dismiss the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on April 11, Stengle made a written request for a "more complete disclosure" of Andres' relationship with Goldman, and Abrams' own working relationship with another defense lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abrams said that was too late, given that Segarra by then would have had a chance to "sample the temper of the court" and perhaps anticipate she would lose unless Abrams recused herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The timing of plaintiff's requests suggests that she is engaging in precisely the type of 'judge-shopping' the 2nd Circuit has cautioned against," Abrams wrote, referring to the federal appeals court in New York. "Such an attempt to engage in judicial game-playing strikes at the core of our legal system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan Peters, a Davis Polk spokeswoman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Segarra v.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Technology powerhouses like Microsoft Corp and AOL Inc are flexing their muscles as storytellers, parading TV network-style shows before advertisers at an annual digital content showcase in New York next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an eye on the big bucks such shows can command, Microsoft will trot out a soccer reality show called "Every Street United." Sony Corp's digital network Crackle will serve up Jerry Seinfeld's "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee" and AOL is presenting a documentary drama about five New Yorkers called "Connected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a big shift from the short Web episodes many tech companies have presented for the last two years at the week-long "NewFronts" event - modeled after the annual "upfronts" where broadcast and cable TV channels show their wares to Madison Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Inc is also looking for longer original programming it can unveil at the showcase, three people familiar with those efforts said on condition on of anonymity because the deals have yet to be finalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer said on Yahoo's earnings call last week that the company plans to make fewer, more focused investments in original content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are going to see more original content overall and no doubt everyone is working to package their offerings like TV because they have their eyes on TV dollars," said Kris Magel, chief investment officer at Initiative, the media buying division of Interpublic Group of Cos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But TV-scaled ad spending is unlikely to flow to online video commercials that usually run before and during a program, advertisers and analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Online video just doesn't offer nearly the reach that broadcast does," said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AOL has spent about half a billion dollars over the last three years on shorter content. On Wednesday, it also inked a deal with Miramax to stream the independent studio's films on the AOL network for free, but with ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Internet companies are bucketed into the snackable short form space," Ran Harnevo, president of AOL Video, said. "But we are seeing the growth in the consumption of content on big screens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the NewFronts, which starts on April 28, Microsoft will show longer original shows produced by the company's Xbox Entertainment Studios that exploit the Internet's strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The challenge TV has is it's not very effective in being able to reach a very discrete target audience and measure it and have more interactive components," said Scott Ferris, general manager of TV and video advertising for Microsoft. "We have very engaged, high-quality audiences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online series can get messages in front of people who watch little TV, said Peter Naylor, senior vice president of sales for Hulu.com. The website, owned by Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp and 21st Century Fox, will also pitch shows to advertisers next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a segment of the video universe that is very, very hard to reach through traditional television," Naylor said. "Online video is a way to reach those light TV viewers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because online viewers have to search for content, advertisers may end up paying more to reach them than on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost per thousand (CPM) for a commercial on a cable network, for example, might be between $10 to $30, depending on the show and the demographic, estimates Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. For online video, a CPM for a comparable demographic could be in the range of $20 to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of aspiration in the NewFronts initiatives," said Wieser. "The reality is traditional TV budgets are intended for content vehicles that are TV-like. (Content) with short term, low budgets with unknown or even known talent is unlikely to capture anything resembling a meaningful TV budget."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hurdle is that the money that presenters make from the NewFronts is not tracked by the Internet Advertising Bureau which hosts the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ari Bluman, chief digital investment officer of GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP, notes the TV industry's annual showcase for advertisers exists because they can only buy so many commercial spots on TV, whereas this is not an issue online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it may take some time before online shows become mainstream enough to draw big ad dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, the NewFronts "is more of a showcase for what's new and exciting," Bluman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ronald Grover and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds comments from plaintiffs' lawyer, paragraph 4-5 and 10)&lt;/p&gt;

, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, the London Metal Exchange
and warehouse operators want a judge to throw out lawsuits
saying that from May 2009 they conspired to reduce the supply
and increase the price of aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They argued in New York federal court motions late on
Tuesday that commercial buyers of aluminum and consumers who
purchased aluminum-based products lacked standing to sue under
antitrust law because they did not store metal in the
defendants' warehouses or trade on the LME.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits said that the defendants conspired to delay the
delivery of aluminum from certain warehouses, allowing the LME 
and the financial firms to profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the plaintiff's lawyers, Christopher Lovell of Lovell
Stewart Halebian Jacobson, said his clients were directly
injured by the defendants' conduct, which gives them standing.
Some business were forced to leave the aluminum market because
of the delays, Lovell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's one of the injuries that results from a violation of
the antitrust laws," Lovell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue of delays in the U.S. aluminum market has plagued
the industry for years, but captured public and political
attention only last year. The U.S. Department of Justice and the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission are investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest allowed
three groups of plaintiffs to file separate lawsuits seeking
class action status: direct purchaser plaintiffs, commercial
end-users and consumer-end users. Forrest has scheduled a
hearing in the case for Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LME has argued it was protected by the 1976 U.S. Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act, which limits when a foreign sovereign
may be sued in U.S. courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LME said that it is an organ of the United Kingdom,
entitling it to FSIA immunity. Although it is privately owned,
LME argued it is "statutorily tasked with the public regulatory
function of maintaining an orderly market and affording proper
protection to investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lovell said that the plaintiffs "seriously contest" the
LME's claim to immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litigation,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MELVILLE, N.Y., April 23, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FalconStor Software&#174;, Inc. (Nasdaq:FALC), a market leader in data protection and migration, today announces a free migration program for IBM&#174; ProtecTIER&#174; customers, offering a no charge, like-for-like license swap. Due to the interoperable, hardware-agnostic nature of FalconStor technology, this migration program allows customers to reuse their existing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Customers migrating to FalconStor's solution will experience complete business continuity, as automatic tape caching functions allow backups and recoveries to continue uninterrupted as data or tapes are migrated in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We're proud to offer IBM ProtecTIER customers the freedom to migrate their data at no cost and with no interruptions," said Gary Quinn, President and CEO, FalconStor Software. "In today's business world, data is a critical asset whose value cannot be underestimated. It's essential that data be managed and protected properly. For FalconStor customers, that means having the industry's most flexible, cost-effective solutions without the worry of vendor lock-in or data loss and downtime. We're confident that our new customers will benefit from the improved performance and freedom offered by FalconStor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

New customers will be migrated onto the recently launched FalconStor Optimized Backup  Deduplication 8.0&#8482;. This solution platform allows users to manage both block and file backup and deduplication on a single node, significantly reducing the backup window and shrinking the storage footprint. New customers are required to sign a three-year maintenance agreement and can purchase additional capacity and/or data management solutions at their discretion. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Availability and pricing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Healthcare IT Outsourcing Market 2014-2018 
      with Accenture plc, Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co.  IBM Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/vrkv5n/global_healthcare) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Healthcare IT Outsourcing Market 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Healthcare IT Outsourcing market to grow at a CAGR of 7% over 
      the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A major growth driver is the need for the Healthcare sector to reduce 
      operational time and cost, which is achieved through the use of 
      healthcare IT outsourcing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Healthcare providers across the globe are witnessing increased adoption 
      of cloud computing and other cloud-based services. Healthcare providers 
      have realized the cost benefits associated with adopting cloud-based IT 
      outsourcing services. The advantages of cloud-based services such as 
      rapid scalability, easy access, uninterrupted service, and flexibility 
      are responsible for their increased adoption. Cloud-based IT outsourcing 
      services have also reduced the need to spend on servers and data 
      centers. Thus, the adoption of cloud-based services is the major trend 
      that is being witnessed in the Global Healthcare IT Outsourcing market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the most common barriers to IT 
      outsourcing by healthcare providers is that the profits generated from 
      the outsourcing of healthcare IT requirements are failing to match up 
      with the costs involved in the process of outsourcing.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp, in its latest attempt at reviving demand for its hardware products, is launching high-end system servers that it says are 50 times faster than its closest competitor at analyzing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The POWER8 servers, the product of a $2.4 billion, three-year investment, are part of the company's decade-long shift to higher-value hardware technology. IBM said the machines are 50 times faster than the low-end x86-based servers it sold to Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology services provider said on Wednesday it hopes the servers, designed for large-scale computing, will appeal to clients looking to manage new types of social and mobile computing and mass amounts of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the company reported its lowest quarterly revenue in five years, weighed down by falling demand for its storage and server products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM dominates the higher-end server market with 57 percent market share, according to research firm Canalys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For IBM customers in particular the POWER8 represents a generational jump forward so far as overall performance and system capacity goes," said Charles King, an analyst at Pund-IT in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"POWER8 should help IBM move forward in this very cloud-centric, analytic path that it has been working on," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts, however, say that IBM's shift to high-end servers makes products like POWER8 appealing only to niche customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not every app needs a high-end server," said Jefferies analyst Peter Misek. "With IBM getting out of that lower-end business, it dramatically shrinks their addressable market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to make the servers adaptable to different needs, IBM released the data specifications for its POWER8 processor to the OpenPOWER foundation, allowing the development community to deliver new system designs based on POWER8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundation, whose more than two dozen members include Google, Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies, U.S. chip-maker Nvidia Corp and Taiwan-based server supplier Tyan Computer Corp, will have access to hardware previously proprietary to IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Marina Lopes; Editing by Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;

      raise awareness of the United Way and find innovative ways to raise 
      money to fund the many programs that give hope to the people of Houston. 
      Making positive contributions to society is central to the way we do 
      business, and our partnership with the United Way is an important part 
      of that commitment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      ExxonMobil employees also donated money and volunteered their time for 
      many other nonprofit organizations in the Houston area. This is

&lt;p&gt;(Changes "fund" to "funds" in second paragraph; removes the
word "apart" from third paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Lauren Tara LaCapra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's
 asset-management business has agreed to buy Westpeak
Global Advisors, a firm that aims to beat market indexes by
using factors other than company size to pick stock investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, disclosed on Tuesday, comes as Goldman is working
to bulk up its asset management unit, partly by strengthening
its quantitative product offerings. It is also part of a broader
trend of money managers offering so-called "smart beta"
strategies that deliver the high returns of some actively
managed funds but with the lower cost of investing in an index
fund or exchange-traded fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Westpeak creates and distributes its investment strategies
through alliances with companies including FTSE Group, Russell
Investment Group and Natixis. Like other smart beta firms it
picks stocks for its index funds based on factors like
volatility, liquidity or relative value, rather than market
capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Armen Avanessians, the head of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management's quantitative business, and Gary
Chropuvka, its head of customized and tax efficient beta
businesses, said the deal was attractive because Westpeak's
products complemented GSAM's existing offerings and because its
employees were a good cultural fit within the Wall Street bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were enamored with the approach and we're quite excited
about the people," said Avanessians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to provide terms of the acquisition, which
it expects to close in June. Westpeak and its employees will
remain in Boulder, Colorado, where the company is based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is still working to repair damage from
quantitative-fund losses during the financial crisis. One of its
biggest quant funds, Global Alpha, shuttered in 2011 after
losing more than $10 billion of investor money since 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a report last October, Credit Suisse analysts said GSAM
was still suffering from a lack of client demand for quant
products. Chropuvka said the business has seen "pretty strong
flows" recently, and now has $50 billion in assets under
management, $30 billion of which pertains to the smart-beta
strategies that are Westpeak's specialty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from the consulting firm Towers Watson show that
smart-beta strategies have beaten market-cap strategies by 0.9
to 2.1 percentage points, on average, since 1964. Institutional
investors allocated three times as many assets to smart beta
strategies in 2013 as they did the previous year, Towers Watson
said. Investment management firms ranging from Blackrock Inc
 to WisdomTree have been developing smart-beta funds to
capture investor interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's Advanced Beta Strategies platform offers three
categories of products: those that aim for returns similar to
hedge funds, those that provide customized returns depending on
a client's investment objectives, and those that are focused on
tax-efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avanessians said Westpeak's products would appeal to
institutional clients that do not bet against stocks, and want
to have liquidity and transparency into index components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Richard Beales
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola&#160;is set to face bubbling discontent at its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. Several shareholders, led by Wintergreen Advisers, object to the $180 billion drinks giant&#8217;s equity pay plan. Some, including pension funds from Ontario and Florida, want the chairman and chief executive jobs split. Nearly a quarter voted against top executives&#8217; compensation last year. With the stock underperforming, it&#8217;s no wonder investors are grouchy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan to renew and beef up the company&#8217;s share plan for 6,400 or so employees isn&#8217;t all bad. Many investors reckon senior-ranking people should own stock, and the details are laid out transparently. Its size, however, has raised eyebrows. Coca-Cola says if all awards under the plan proceed, existing shareholders would be diluted by more than 14 percent, a stake worth $25 billion at the company&#8217;s current market value. Buybacks and other factors reduce the figure, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the objection to such a big potential transfer of value is Coke&#8217;s track record. Its shares have lagged the SP 500 Index this year and over 12 months, five years and 10 years. For seriously long-term investors, the stock price only fairly recently regained a peak level above $40 that had last been reached in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albert Meyer, founder of investment fund Bastiat Capital, has calculated how Coke&#8217;s historical earnings and cash flow numbers would look had it paid employees a similar &#8211; even slightly higher &#8211; value in cash rather than options or stock granted under past plans. On average, he estimates little change for the past seven years, which stacks up well against other companies he has analyzed. A big difference, though, is an overhang of already-granted options and restricted stock at the end of 2013 that could cost more than $4 billion to mop up. A bigger equity plan will only increase what amounts to a liability to employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the pay for Coca-Cola Chairman and Chief Executive Muhtar Kent, at $30.5 million for 2012, was one reason for last year&#8217;s protest vote against compensation. His package dipped to $20.4 million for 2013, but some shareholders still think Coke rewards executives too well. One helpful check might be to appoint an independent chairman. And with the pay of directors, top executives and equity recipients requiring some 50 pages to summarize, a vote against the new equity plan is another way to protest.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;MILWAUKEE, WI--(Marketwired - Apr 23, 2014) -  Cloud-based communications provider, CorvisaCloud, LLC., today announced that it has secured $30 million in funding from parent company Novation Companies, Inc. (OTCQB: NOVC). The additional capital will be devoted to expanding CorvisaCloud's sales, marketing and operational development efforts and potential acquisitions. The funds will also be used to accelerate product development and customer acquisition of CorvisaCloud's CorvisaOne&#8482; contact center software products and platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CorvisaCloud is experiencing strong momentum in the cloud contact center arena and as a result, we believe the time is now to take this company to the next level," said Lance Anderson, CEO, Novation Companies. "The additional funds will drive substantial enterprise value while helping propel operations and allowing us to look at potential acquisitions. We look forward to accelerating CorvisaCloud's initial success and building upon its increasing roster of globally recognizable brand name clients." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This infusion of capital from Novation arrives at the perfect time as we make our mark in the cloud communications space," said CorvisaCloud President Matt Lautz. "Novation clearly recognizes the significant market opportunity and this additional funding is a great vote of confidence in CorvisaCloud's vision, value and future." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses of all sizes are increasingly migrating their IT operations to the cloud. Contact centers are a key part of customer service, but powering and maintaining legacy systems is expensive and the data can be difficult to collect and manage. According to DMG Consulting's Cloud-Based Contact Center Infrastructure Market Report, more than 62% of organizations were using some type of cloud-based contact center solution as part of their operation in September 2013, and approximately half (45.6%) of the organizations that are not yet using cloud-based contact center solutions are planning to move in this direction in the next 18 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2011, CorvisaCloud offers a cloud-based communications suite, including inbound and outbound contact center solutions, business phone systems (PBX) and robust platform customization options. Its cloud-based solutions remove the upfront costs and high maintenance associated with on-premise legacy solutions, offering immediate scalability and broader flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CorvisaCloud's products have helped businesses of all sizes gain operational efficiencies, improve customer service and lower costs. Companies such as Direct Buy and Heartland Payment Systems use CorvisaCloud's technology to streamline workflow and deliver the best customer experience possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About CorvisaCloud

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) new chief executive got off to a winning start with Wall Street on Thursday as the world's largest software company eased past analysts' profit estimates despite the pressure of falling computer sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its shares rose almost 3 percent in after-hours trading to $40.96, keeping the stock at levels not seen since the turn-of-the-century Internet stock boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares are up about 8 percent since company veteran Satya Nadella took over as CEO in early February, and are up 19 percent since his predecessor Steve Ballmer announced plans to retire last August, easily outpacing the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 .SPX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are excited about Nadella's focus on mobile and cloud, or Internet-based, computing, designed to take Microsoft beyond its traditional PC-based Windows business. Nadella is set to face analysts' questions for the first time in public on a conference call later on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This quarter is a nice step in the right direction for Nadella and Microsoft," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. "We would characterize these results as solid in a choppy IT spending environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella's emphasis on cloud computing helped its server software business, while a softer-than-expected decline in PC sales limited damage to the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company reported quarterly profit of $5.66 billion, or 68 cents per share, compared with $6.05 billion or 72 cents in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline was exaggerated by deferred revenue boosting the year-ago figure, and the latest quarter's profit beat Wall Street's average estimate of 63 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales fell 0.4 percent to $20.4 billion, meeting analysts' average estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personal computer sales fell by as much as 4.4 percent in the quarter, according to the two major technology research firms, making the eighth straight quarter of declines as tablets and smartphones gain in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That decline was likely muted by the end of Microsoft's support for its decade-old Windows XP system in early April, which appears to have prompted many people to buy a new computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) new chief executive on Thursday won rave reviews for his first public encounter with Wall Street analysts who said he communicated willingness to transform the world's largest software company as it scrambles to catch up in the mobile-computing era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marking the first time in five years that a Microsoft chief executive joined a quarterly earnings conference call, veteran insider Satya Nadella, who took over the helm on February 4, said his first weeks in the new job were taken up with getting to know the company afresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he is also dealing with the reality of the new tech marketplace in which Microsoft has ceded its market dominance to Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is important and valuable to see the company with the fresh perspective, to get grounded both on our current realities and future opportunities," said Nadella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What you can expect of Microsoft is courage in the face of reality; we will approach our future with a challenger mindset; we will be bold in our innovation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella was helped by a quarterly profit decline that wasn't as bad as feared by many investors, and he got a generally enthusiastic reception from analysts who have warmed to his strategy based on mobile and cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He did a Picasso-like job creating more transparency for Microsoft, as he embarks down this transformational path to the cloud," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. "He has created enormous goodwill for Microsoft with the street and that speaks to optimism around shares since he took over the reins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft stock has crept up 19 percent since longtime Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer announced his plan to retire last August and is up 8 percent since Nadella took his place. It was up a further 2.5 percent after-hours on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just by joining the call, Nadella marked a change of approach at the software goliath. Ballmer rarely spoke on the quarterly call, a symbol of his indifferent relationship with Wall Street, which broadly blamed him for Microsoft's lackluster stock growth for most of the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a good performance," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen, who listened to Nadella's debut call. "It shows that he has a vision, is well aware of the competitive landscape and is thoroughly knowledgeable of the capabilities within Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al Hilwa, an analyst at tech research firm IDC, said Nadella did a good job establishing rapport: "It was interesting in that if it wasn't for the welcoming greetings by the financial analysts, it sounded like he has been doing it all his life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella, who has made three major public appearances since taking over, expanded on his theory of focusing on mobile and internet-centric computing, which he says is necessary in what he calls the "mobile-first, cloud-first world".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To back that approach up, Nadella has already introduced Microsoft's hugely popular Office software for Apple's iPad and opted to give away Windows to makers of small-screen mobile devices, moves which show Nadella wants Microsoft's services widely available without being tethered to the Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not offer up any more concrete plans in the call on Thursday and answered very broadly when asked if he was strategically reviewing any parts of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're all the time reviewing and one of the things that I feel as a leadership team, we have really picked up the pace on asking the hard questions," Nadella said.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, April 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's new
chief executive on Thursday won rave reviews for his first
public encounter with Wall Street analysts who said he
communicated willingness to transform the world's largest
software company as it scrambles to catch up in the
mobile-computing era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marking the first time in five years that a Microsoft chief
executive joined a quarterly earnings conference call, veteran
insider Satya Nadella, who took over the helm on Feb. 4, said
his first weeks in the new job were taken up with getting to
know the company afresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he is also dealing with the reality of the new tech
marketplace in which Microsoft has ceded its market dominance to
Apple Inc and Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is important and valuable to see the company with the
fresh perspective, to get grounded both on our current realities
and future opportunities," said Nadella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What you can expect of Microsoft is courage in the face of
reality; we will approach our future with a challenger mindset;
we will be bold in our innovation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella was helped by a quarterly profit decline that wasn't
as bad as feared by many investors, and he got a generally
enthusiastic reception from analysts who have warmed to his
strategy based on mobile and cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He did a Picasso-like job creating more transparency for
Microsoft, as he embarks down this transformational path to the
cloud," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. "He
has created enormous goodwill for Microsoft with the street and

did a good job establishing rapport: "It was interesting in that
if it wasn't for the welcoming greetings by the financial
analysts, it sounded like he has been doing it all his life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella, who has made three major public appearances since
taking over, expanded on his theory of focusing on mobile and
internet-centric computing, which he says is necessary in what
he calls the "mobile-first, cloud-first world".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To back that approach up, Nadella has already introduced
Microsoft's hugely popular Office software for Apple's iPad and
opted to give away Windows to makers of small-screen mobile
devices, moves which show Nadella wants Microsoft's services
widely available without being tethered to the Windows operating
system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not offer up any more concrete plans in the call on
Thursday and answered very broadly when asked if he was
strategically reviewing any parts of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're all the time reviewing and one of the things that I
feel as a leadership team, we have really picked up the pace on
asking the hard questions," Nadella said. "I want to be
accountable to you all, to our customers, to our partners as a
team by executing on our plans."

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world's largest credit and debit card company, said U.S. sanctions on Russia were hurting its card transaction volumes and that revenue growth would slow further this quarter, sending its shares down 5 percent after the bell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa's quarterly revenue growth slid to a single digit in percentage terms for the first time in more than four years, due to a strong U.S. dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company and rival MasterCard Inc (MA.N) stopped providing services to two Russian banks after U.S. President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia in March after a standoff over Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are caught between the politics of the United States and the politics of Russia," Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said on a post-earnings conference call on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're clearly seeing a drop-off in cross-border volume and sanctions are expected to have some impact on volume."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty over the companies' operations in Russia lingers as Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the country would develop its own credit card system to reduce dependence on western companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said it would assess the situation in Russia and was hopeful it would still have a "meaningful opportunity" to continue to do business there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have 100 million cards there (in Russia) and it is not in anyone's best interest, inclusive of the Russians, to make those cards not available to their own citizens," Pollitt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLOWING REVENUE GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said strength in the U.S. dollar was likely to slow its revenue growth further this quarter to "mid-single digits" in percentage terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's revenue growth slowed to 7 percent in the second quarter ended March 31 from 11 percent in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said the impact of the strong dollar would be "slightly more pronounced" this quarter before rebounding in the following three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income attributable to Visa rose 26 percent from a year earlier to $1.60 billion, or $2.52 per Class A share, in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa earned $2.20 per share, excluding a tax benefit of $218 million in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total operating revenue increased to $3.16 billion from $2.96 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected a profit of $2.18 per share on revenue of $3.19 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said it expected full-year revenue to grow 10-11 percent.

 (Adds executive comments from conference call; updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Aman Shah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 24 (Reuters) - Visa Inc, the world's largest
credit and debit card company, said U.S. sanctions on Russia
were hurting its card transaction volumes and that revenue
growth would slow further this quarter, sending its shares down
5 percent after the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa's quarterly revenue growth slid to a single digit in
percentage terms for the first time in more than four years, due
to a strong U.S. dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company and rival MasterCard Inc stopped
providing services to two Russian banks after U.S. President
Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia in March after a
standoff over Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are caught between the politics of the United States and
the politics of Russia," Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt
said on a post-earnings conference call on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're clearly seeing a drop-off in cross-border volume and
sanctions are expected to have some impact on volume."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty over the companies' operations in Russia lingers
as Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the country would
develop its own credit card system to reduce dependence on
western companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said it would assess the situation in Russia and was
hopeful it would still have a "meaningful opportunity" to
continue to do business there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have 100 million cards there (in Russia) and it is not
in anyone's best interest, inclusive of the Russians, to make
those cards not available to their own citizens," Pollitt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLOWING REVENUE GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said strength in the U.S. dollar was likely to slow its
revenue growth further this quarter to "mid-single digits" in
percentage terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's revenue growth slowed to 7 percent in the
second quarter ended March 31 from 11 percent in the first
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said the impact of the strong
dollar would be "slightly more pronounced" this quarter before
rebounding in the following three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income attributable to Visa rose 26 percent from a year
earlier to $1.60 billion, or $2.52 per Class A share, in the
second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa earned $2.20 per share, excluding a tax benefit of $218
million in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total operating revenue increased to $3.16 billion from
$2.96 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected a profit of $2.18 per share
on revenue of $3.19 billion, according to Thomson Reuters
I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said it expected full-year revenue to grow 10-11
percent. The company had earlier said its revenue was expected
to grow in low double digits in percentage terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foster City, California-based company maintained its

information on computer chips rather than on traditional
magnetic strips, making them harder to counterfeit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Visa, which has a market value of about $133
billion, closed at $209.40 on the New York Stock Exchange on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock has risen 13 percent since it was included in the
Dow Jones Industrial Average in September.

&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, April 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's new
chief executive got off to a winning start with Wall Street on
Thursday as the world's largest software company eased past
analysts' profit estimates despite the pressure of falling
computer sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its shares rose almost 3 percent in after-hours trading to
$40.96, keeping the stock at levels not seen since the
turn-of-the-century Internet stock boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares are up about 8 percent since company
veteran Satya Nadella took over as CEO in early February
, and are up 19 percent since his predecessor
Steve Ballmer announced plans to retire last August, easily
outpacing the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are excited about Nadella's focus on mobile and
cloud, or Internet-based, computing, designed to take Microsoft
beyond its traditional PC-based Windows business. Nadella is set
to face analysts' questions for the first time in public on a 
conference call later on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This quarter is a nice step in the right direction for
Nadella and Microsoft," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR
Capital Markets. "We would characterize these results as solid
in a choppy IT spending environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella's emphasis on cloud computing helped its server
software business, while a softer-than-expected decline in PC
sales limited damage to the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company reported quarterly
profit of $5.66 billion, or 68 cents per share, compared with
$6.05 billion or 72 cents in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline was exaggerated by deferred revenue boosting the
year-ago figure, and the latest quarter's profit beat Wall
Street's average estimate of 63 cents per share, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales fell 0.4 percent to $20.4 billion, meeting analysts'
average estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personal computer sales fell by as much as 4.4 percent in
the quarter, according to the two major technology research
firms, making the eighth straight quarter of declines as tablets
and smartphones gain in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That decline was likely muted by the end of Microsoft's
support for its decade-old Windows XP system in early April,
which appears to have prompted many people to buy a new
computer.

			Visa Inc. Reports Fiscal Second Quarter 2014 Net Income of $1.6 
      Billion or $2.52 per Diluted Share
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) today announced financial results for the Company&#8217;s 
      fiscal second quarter 2014. Net income for the quarter was $1.6 billion, 
      an increase of 26% over the prior year, or $2.52 per share, an increase 
      of 31% over the prior year. These results include a tax benefit of $218 
      million of which $201 million relates to prior periods. Excluding the 
      prior periods&#8217; impact, earnings per share was $2.20, an increase of 15% 
      over the prior year. All references to earnings per share assume 
      fully-diluted class A share count unless otherwise noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net operating revenue in the fiscal second quarter of 2014 was $3.2 
      billion, an increase of 7% nominally or 9% on a constant dollar basis 
      over the prior year, driven by solid growth in service revenues, data 
      processing revenues and international transaction revenues. The 
      strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted net operating revenues by 2 
      percentage points of negative growth during the quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our underlying business drivers remained strong during the fiscal 
      second quarter with payments volume continuing to grow at solid levels,&#8221; 
      said Charlie Scharf, Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc. &#8220;As expected, 
      softer net revenue growth was impacted by a strengthening U.S. dollar 
      and difficult year-over-year comparisons due to non-recurring items. We 
      expect this impact to be slightly more pronounced next quarter before 
      rebounding in our fiscal fourth quarter, which will be more reflective 
      of the fundamental strength of the business model. We continue to make 
      substantial investments in products and services that will drive our 
      future growth, while enhancing our financial institution and merchant 
      client relationships.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fiscal Second Quarter 2014 Financial Highlights:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months 
      ended December 31, 2013, on which fiscal second quarter service revenue 
      is recognized, was 12% over the prior year at $1.2 trillion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months 
      ended March 31, 2014, was 12% over the prior year at $1.1 trillion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cross-border volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, was 8% for the 
      three months ended March 31, 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by 
      VisaNet, for the three months ended March 31, 2014, were 15.4 billion, 
      an 11% increase over the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fiscal second quarter 2014 service revenues were $1.5 billion, an 
      increase of 7% over the prior year, and are recognized based on payments 
      volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized 
      based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 7% over 
      the prior year to $1.2 billion. International transaction revenues, 
      which are driven by cross-border volume, grew 5% over the prior year to 
      $871 million. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing 
      fee, were $183 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year. Client 
      incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $587 million and 
      represent 15.6% of gross revenues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total operating expenses were $1.1 billion for the quarter, a 2% 
      increase over the prior year, primarily due to an increase in marketing 
      spend to support the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and 2014 World Cup 
      campaigns, offset by a reduction in personnel and professional fees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The effective tax rate was 22.5% for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. 
      This rate was positively impacted by a $218 million tax benefit 
      recognized during the quarter related to a deduction for U.S. domestic 
      production activities. This benefit was fully contemplated in the 
      Company&#8217;s earnings per share guidance for fiscal full-year 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investment securities 
      were $6.5 billion at March 31, 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The weighted-average number of diluted shares of class A common stock 
      outstanding was 634 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Notable Events:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months ended March 31, 2014, the Company repurchased 
      5.1 million shares of class&#160;A common stock, at an average price of 
      $217.61 per share, using $1.1 billion of cash on hand. At March 31, 
      2014, the Company had $3.0 billion of remaining funds, authorized by the 
      board of directors, available for share repurchase under the current 
      program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On April 23, 2014, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash 
      dividend of $0.40 per share of class A common stock (determined in the 
      case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis) 
      payable on June 3, 2014, to all holders of record of the Company&#8217;s class 
      A, class B and class C common stock as of May 16, 2014.

			Footnote
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The preceding tables present regional total volume, payments volume and 
      cash volume, and the number of payments transactions, cash transactions, 
      accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and 
      Interlink brands. Card counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Nominal 
      and constant dollar growth rates over prior years are provided for 
      volume-based data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made 
      with cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands for the 
      relevant period; and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount 
      of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period 
      and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; but 
      excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total volume represents payments 
      volume plus cash volume.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and 
      data relating to each program is included in the tables. Debit programs 
      include Visa&#8217;s signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The data presented is based on results reported quarterly by Visa&#8217;s 
      financial institution clients on their operating certificates. Estimates 
      may be utilized if data is unavailable. On occasion, previously 
      presented information may be updated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa&#8217;s CEMEA region is comprised of countries in Central Europe, the 
      Middle East and Africa. Effective with the 3 months ended September 
      2013, Croatia moved from the CEMEA region to Visa Europe. Several 
      European Union countries in Central Europe, Israel and Turkey are not 
      included in CEMEA. LAC is comprised of countries in Central and South 
      America and the Caribbean. International includes Asia Pacific, Canada, 
      CEMEA and LAC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an 
      established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local 
      currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported (&#8220;Nominal USD&#8221;). These 
      exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established 
      exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign 
      currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, 
      Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments 
      volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information 
      (&#8220;Constant USD&#8221;). This presentation represents Visa&#8217;s historical 
      methodology which may be subject to review and refinement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2. Cross Border Volume
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The table below represents cross border volume growth for cards carrying 
      the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and PLUS brands. Cross border volume 
      refers to payments and cash volume where the issuing country is 
      different from the merchant country.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms 3 Classes of JPMC 1998-C6
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed three classes of JP Morgan Commercial 
      Mortgage Finance Corp. (JPM) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 1998-C6. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations reflect the sufficient credit enhancement on the 
      remaining classes from amortization as well as the pending resolution of 
      the one specially serviced asset. The performance on the six 
      non-specially serviced loans has been stable since Fitch's last rating 
      action. Expected losses on the original pool balance total 4.1%, 
      including $17.5 million (2.2% of the original pool balance) in realized 
      losses to date. Fitch has designated two loans (71.5%) as Fitch Loans of 
      Concern, which includes one specially serviced asset (70.4%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the March 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 96.1% to $31.1 million from $796.4 million 
      at issuance. No loans are defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently 
      affecting classes G through H.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The specially serviced asset, The Court at Deptford (70.4% of the pool), 
      is a 361,000 square foot retail center in Deptford, NJ. The property has 
      experienced cash flow issues from occupancy declines. The property was 
      previously anchored by a Sam's Club (33% of the property's net rentable 
      area (NRA)), Sports Authority (11% NRA) and Circuit City (9% NRA); all 
      three vacated at or prior to the individual lease expirations between 
      2008 and 2010. Occupancy as of January 2014 was reported at 35%, 
      unchanged from March 2012, with the three anchor spaces still vacant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loan transferred to special servicing in February 2009 for imminent 
      default. A receiver was appointed in April 2010 and the asset has been 
      real estate owned (REO) since May 2012. The asset is under contract with 
      closing scheduled to occur in May 2014. The projected sales proceeds 
      should result in better recoveries than previously expected.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating Outlook on class F is revised to Stable from Negative due to 
      sufficient credit enhancement and continued paydown. Further upgrades 
      are not projected due to the concentration of the remaining pool and 
      losses affecting the subordinate classes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following class and revises Rating Outlook as 
      indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$8.9 million class F at 'BBB-sf', Outlook to Stable from Negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following class but revises REs as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$19.9 million class G at 'Csf', RE 40%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following class as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.4 million class H at 'Dsf', RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The class A1, A2, A3, B, C, D and E certificates have paid in full. 
      Fitch does not rate the class NR certificates. Fitch previously withdrew 
      the rating on the interest-only class X certificates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Wintergreen Believes Coca-Cola Lacks Shareholder Mandate for Equity 
      Plan
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Shareholders in the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) delivered a 
      clear&#160;message at yesterday&#8217;s annual meeting that they do not support 
      Coca-Cola's 2014&#160;equity plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s certified ballot results, filed with the SEC&#160;late yesterday, 
      show that fewer than half of Coca-Cola&#8217;s total outstanding shares (2.19 
      billion out of 4.40 billion) were&#160;voted in favor of the 2014 equity 
      plan. By contrast, 66% of&#160;the total outstanding shares were voted in 
      favor of Coca-Cola's previous plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      David Winters, CEO of Wintergreen Advisers, said &#8220;Coca-Cola&#8217;s plan 
      failed to attract support from a majority of shareholders, including its 
      largest shareholder, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B). Wintergreen 
      believes that no company should implement an equity plan without the 
      support of a majority of its&#160;shareholders, least of all a great company 
      like Coca-Cola. It is clear to us that Coca-Cola failed to earn a 
      shareholder mandate to fully implement the 2014 equity plan and we call 
      on Coca-Cola's Board of Directors to withdraw or scale back the&#160;plan. 
      According to SEC filings, Coca-Cola had more than 66 million shares 
      available for issuance under existing equity plans as of February 20th, 
      which we believe would allow it to continue to issue stock awards while 
      developing a more shareholder friendly plan.&#8221;

      Research and Markets: European Male Toiletries Market 2014-2018 with 
      Beiersdorf AG, Energizer Holdings, Koninklijke Philips, Procter  Gamble 
      Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/xxtw2z/male_toiletries) 
      has announced the addition of the "Male 
      Toiletries Market in Europe 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Male Toiletries market in Europe is driven by several factors, of 
      which beauty and skin consciousness among consumers is one of the major 
      drivers. In the recent past, the awareness created by companies and the 
      increase in the health and wellness trend among consumers led to an 
      increase in consciousness among men about their skin and appearance. 
      This has led to an increase in spending on male toiletries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increased popularity of organic and natural male toiletries is an 
      emerging trend in the market. The usage of natural ingredients in 
      shaving preparations is increasingly becoming popular among European 
      male consumers. Male toiletries are used every day, and regular usage of 
      chemical products may lead to some side effects such as acne and redness 
      of the skin. Hence, consumers have started looking for products with 
      natural and organic ingredients. For instance, organic shaving products 
      are free from parabens, propylene glycol, and synthetic colors and 
      fragrances because they can cause harm to the skin with regular usage. 
      The increasing number of savvy skin-conscious male consumers in the 
      region will drive the demand for natural and organic products in the 
      market. Hence, because of this growth, many large companies are 
      launching natural and organic male toiletries in the market to increase 
      their market share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the impact of economic uncertainties on 
      consumers and vendors is one of the major challenges in the market.

      Research and Markets: United States Facial Care Market 2014-2018 with 
      Johnson  Johnson, L'Or&#233;al, Procter  Gamble  Unilever Group Dominating 
      the $13 Billion Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/qks6sj/facial_care) 
      has announced the addition of the "Facial 
      Care Market in the US 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Facial Care market in the US will grow at a CAGR of 4.26 percent 
      over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The market for such products was estimated to be around US$9.25 billion 
      in 2012 and is expected to reach US$13.6 billion by 2016. Generally, 
      facial care products are made from synthetic ingredients, additives, and 
      fillers. Such products might be harmful to the skin, or even weaken and 
      loosen the skin after a few years. This risk can be avoided by using 
      facial care products made from organic and natural ingredients. The 
      increasing number of savvy consumers and skin-conscious people in the US 
      is driving the demand for natural and organic products. Hence, many 
      large facial care companies are launching natural and organic facial 
      care products to gain more market share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the main challenges hindering 
      market growth is intensifying competition in the market caused by the 
      entry of new players and private labels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Hypertension Drugs Market 2014-2018 with 
      Actelion, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi 
      Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/l64gx7/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Hypertension Drugs Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Hypertension Drugs market is driven by several factors, of 
      which an increase in aging population is one of the major drivers. There 
      is a natural tendency for BP to rise with age due to the reduced 
      elasticity of the arterial system. The promising hypertension drug 
      pipeline is another major driver. The clinical pipeline for hypertension 
      drugs is moderately strong with more emerging therapies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Hypertension Drugs market is experiencing a shift toward 
      combination products, using two or more combination treatments. A 
      combination of hypertension therapy with separate agents or a fixed-dose 
      combination pill lowers BP at a faster pace, helps in reaching the 
      target BP, and decreases adverse effects. Additional benefits may 
      include cost savings and better compliance. Moreover, antihypertensive 
      agents from different classes may balance adverse reactions from each 
      other. For instance, for hypertensive patients with diabetes, the 
      recommended treatment includes diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, 
      ARBs, and/or CCBs. The Joint National Committee guidelines have 
      recommended diuretics and ACE inhibitors for recurrent stroke prevention 
      in patients with hypertension; beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and 
      aldosterone antagonists for hypertensive patients who are post 
      myocardial infarction; and ACE inhibitors and ARBs for hypertensive 
      patients with chronic kidney disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the increasing number of patent 
      expirations is one of the main challenges. The patent expiries of major 
      approved drugs will slow down the market growth, as the shift toward 
      lower-priced drugs will lead to a drop in the market valuation for that 
      drug, thereby reducing the overall market value.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global Hypertension Drugs market can be categorized into 
      eight segments:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Diuretics
      
			
        ACE Inhibitors

      26-Cent Second-Quarter 2014 Dividend
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The board of directors of Pfizer Inc. today declared a 26-cent 
      second-quarter 2014 dividend on the company&#8217;s common stock, payable June 
      3, 2014, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 9, 
      2014. The second-quarter 2014 cash dividend will be the 302nd 
      consecutive quarterly dividend paid by Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We returned almost $23 billion to shareholders in 2013 through 
      dividends and share repurchases,&#8221; said Ian Read, chairman and chief 
      executive officer. &#8220;In 2014, we are continuing to take actions to 
      increase shareholder value, including our dividend increase announced in 
      December 2013 and our continued share- repurchase activity.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Preliminary results from the Annual Meeting of Shareholders indicate 
      that the company&#8217;s 12 directors were re-elected to one-year terms and 
      that shareholders ratified&#160;the selection of KPMG LLP as Pfizer&#8217;s 
      independent registered public accounting firm for the 2014 fiscal year. 
      In addition, shareholders voted in support of board-sponsored proposals 
      to approve the Company&#8217;s 2014 Stock Plan and to approve, on an advisory 
      basis, the compensation of the company&#8217;s named executive officers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In other voting, three shareholder proposals were not approved by the 
      shareholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The final results are subject to verification by the independent 
      election inspectors. The final results will be reported in a Form 8-K to 
      be filed by Pfizer with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 
      next few days.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Technology powerhouses like Microsoft Corp and AOL Inc are flexing their muscles as storytellers, parading TV network-style shows before advertisers at an annual digital content showcase in New York next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an eye on the big bucks such shows can command, Microsoft will trot out a soccer reality show called "Every Street United." Sony Corp's digital network Crackle will serve up Jerry Seinfeld's "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee" and AOL is presenting a documentary drama about five New Yorkers called "Connected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a big shift from the short Web episodes many tech companies have presented for the last two years at the week-long "NewFronts" event - modeled after the annual "upfronts" where broadcast and cable TV channels show their wares to Madison Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Inc is also looking for longer original programming it can unveil at the showcase, three people familiar with those efforts said on condition on of anonymity because the deals have yet to be finalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer said on Yahoo's earnings call last week that the company plans to make fewer, more focused investments in original content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are going to see more original content overall and no doubt everyone is working to package their offerings like TV because they have their eyes on TV dollars," said Kris Magel, chief investment officer at Initiative, the media buying division of Interpublic Group of Cos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But TV-scaled ad spending is unlikely to flow to online video commercials that usually run before and during a program, advertisers and analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Online video just doesn't offer nearly the reach that broadcast does," said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AOL has spent about half a billion dollars over the last three years on shorter content. On Wednesday, it also inked a deal with Miramax to stream the independent studio's films on the AOL network for free, but with ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Internet companies are bucketed into the snackable short form space," Ran Harnevo, president of AOL Video, said. "But we are seeing the growth in the consumption of content on big screens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the NewFronts, which starts on April 28, Microsoft will show longer original shows produced by the company's Xbox Entertainment Studios that exploit the Internet's strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The challenge TV has is it's not very effective in being able to reach a very discrete target audience and measure it and have more interactive components," said Scott Ferris, general manager of TV and video advertising for Microsoft. "We have very engaged, high-quality audiences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online series can get messages in front of people who watch little TV, said Peter Naylor, senior vice president of sales for Hulu.com. The website, owned by Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp and 21st Century Fox, will also pitch shows to advertisers next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a segment of the video universe that is very, very hard to reach through traditional television," Naylor said. "Online video is a way to reach those light TV viewers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because online viewers have to search for content, advertisers may end up paying more to reach them than on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost per thousand (CPM) for a commercial on a cable network, for example, might be between $10 to $30, depending on the show and the demographic, estimates Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. For online video, a CPM for a comparable demographic could be in the range of $20 to $40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of aspiration in the NewFronts initiatives," said Wieser. "The reality is traditional TV budgets are intended for content vehicles that are TV-like. (Content) with short term, low budgets with unknown or even known talent is unlikely to capture anything resembling a meaningful TV budget."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hurdle is that the money that presenters make from the NewFronts is not tracked by the Interactive Advertising Bureau which hosts the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ari Bluman, chief digital investment officer of GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP, notes the TV industry's annual showcase for advertisers exists because they can only buy so many commercial spots on TV, whereas this is not an issue online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it may take some time before online shows become mainstream enough to draw big ad dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, the NewFronts "is more of a showcase for what's new and exciting," Bluman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This story has been fixed rto corrects Internet Advertising Bureau to Interactive Advertising Bureau)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ronald Grover and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Jennifer Saba and Lisa Richwine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES, April 23 (Reuters) - Technology
powerhouses like Microsoft Corp and AOL Inc are
flexing their muscles as storytellers, parading TV network-style
shows before advertisers at an annual digital content showcase

will serve up Jerry Seinfeld's "Comedians in Cars Getting
Coffee" and AOL is presenting a documentary drama about five New
Yorkers called "Connected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a big shift from the short Web episodes many tech
companies have presented for the last two years at the week-long
"NewFronts" event - modeled after the annual "upfronts" where
broadcast and cable TV channels show their wares to Madison
Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Inc is also looking for longer original
programming it can unveil at the showcase, three people familiar
with those efforts said on condition on of anonymity because the
deals have yet to be finalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer said on Yahoo's earnings
call last week that the company plans to make fewer, more
focused investments in original content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are going to see more original content overall and no
doubt everyone is working to package their offerings like TV
because they have their eyes on TV dollars," said Kris Magel,
chief investment officer at Initiative, the media buying
division of Interpublic Group of Cos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But TV-scaled ad spending is unlikely to flow to online
video commercials that usually run before and during a program,

the NewFronts is not tracked by the Interactive Advertising
Bureau which hosts the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ari Bluman, chief digital investment officer of GroupM, the
media buying arm of WPP, notes the TV industry's annual
showcase for advertisers exists because they can only buy so
many commercial spots on TV, whereas this is not an issue
online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it may take some time before online shows become
mainstream enough to draw big ad dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, the NewFronts "is more of a showcase for what's
new and exciting," Bluman said.

      The affirmations and Stable Outlooks reflect the stable to improving 
      performance of the underlying pool. The certificates, which follow a 
      sequential-pay structure, represent the beneficial interest in a pool of 
      four commercial mortgage floating-rate loans backed by 82 properties. 
      The pool is concentrated by property type with two of the loans backed 
      by hotel properties (64.2% of the pool), while the remaining two loans 
      are secured by a portfolio of office properties and retail bank 
      branches, and an office property. Trust-level leverage remains low with 
      weighted average pooled Fitch's stressed LTV and DSCR of 66.70% and 
      1.60x, respectively, compared to 69.90% and 1.44x at issuance. All of 
      the loans have additional debt in the form of mezzanine debt and/or a 
      B-note, with positions that are fully subordinate and subject to 
      standard inter-creditor agreements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest loan in the pool is the Eagle Hospitality Portfolio (52.5%), 
      which is collateralized by 13 full-service hotel properties located 
      across nine states and Puerto Rico. The hotels are all flagged with 
      national brands including Embassy Suites, Marriot, Hilton, and Hyatt. As 
      of year-end (YE) December 2013 occupancy reported at 75.3%, average 
      daily rate (ADR) at $134.24, and revenue per available room (RevPAR) at 
      $101. This compares to YE December 2012 at 74.5% occupancy, $130.09 ADR, 
      and $96.90 RevPAR. The portfolio net operating income for YE 2013 was 
      relatively flat, with approximately a 1% increase over YE 2012. Total 
      portfolio reserves reported at $19.8 million as of April 2014.

			Chevron Issues Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Call 
      to Action for Business
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Company raises its commitment to $130 million for STEM initiatives
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today, as part of National Science Week, 
      issued a call to action to other businesses to join the company in 
      supporting project-based learning methods to increase engagement in STEM 
      and promote engineering design thinking in classrooms across the U.S. In 
      doing so, Chevron supported this call to action by announcing an 
      additional $30 million commitment to create national partnerships with 
      STEM focused organizations, raising its total commitment to $130 million 
      since 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our charge is clear: the U.S. must increase student engagement in STEM 
      subjects, said Steve Green, vice president, Policy, Government, and 
      Public Affairs for Chevron Corporation. &#8220;This is not a small challenge, 
      and the business community has to do its part. If we want to truly make 
      a difference, we must all work together to provide educators with 
      resources to interest students and prepare them for STEM related 
      careers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron's new commitments to project-based learning, which allows 
      students to build on their classroom learning by doing activities and 
      solving problems, include partnerships and investments with:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Achieve- 
        Chevron will partner with Achieve to support adoption and 
        implementation of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and to 
        align programs supported by Chevron to the standards.
      
			
				The 
        Fab Foundation- Chevron will partner with The Fab 
        Foundation to bring fabrication labs (Fab Lab) to areas where Chevron 
        operates. A Fab Lab consists of a suite of digital fabrication and 
        rapid prototyping machines. Working in Fab Labs, students can develop 
        the systems thinking, problem solving and analytical skills needed to 
        innovate.
      
			
				National 
        Academy of Engineering- Chevron is supporting a new 
        National Academy of Engineering initiative that will provide expert, 
        research-based guidance to those involved in overseeing engineering 
        education in kindergarten through grade 12. This effort will create a 
        clearinghouse of curriculum materials and resources and connect 
        engineering education experts with teachers, administrators, and 
        others involved in providing engineering experiences to students.
      
			
				Project 
        Lead the Way- Chevron is partnering with Project Lead The Way 
        (PLTW), the nation&#8217;s leading provider of STEM programs to deliver 
        world-class, activity, project, and problem-based curriculum to help 
        students develop the skills needed to succeed in our global economy.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Few things are more important to our students and the future of 
      American competitiveness than a quality education,&#8221; Green continued. 
      &#8220;Chevron is proud to champion STEM education and is motivated to make a 
      real, tangible difference through our partnerships with these 
      world-class organizations. We hope others will join the cause and help 
      set-up a prosperous framework for both students and society.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron's investments are a model for public-private partnership,&#8221; said 
      Professor Neil Gershenfeld, director, Center for Bits and Atoms, MIT. 
      "Providing widespread access to STEM skills and tools is much more than 
      just an educational program; it's the path to a more inclusive economy."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In forming national partnerships with select education non-profits, 
      Chevron is forging public-private alliances with national, 
      results-oriented organizations to promote STEM interests and increase 
      access to and the quality of education for students. These partnerships 
      will build upon Chevron&#8217;s prior support for STEM initiatives and 
      continue to take a holistic approach to investments in education, 
      including: Supporting educational programs and standards that promote 
      activity and interest in STEM, including project and problem-based 
      learning curriculum; supporting teacher training; providing classroom 
      resources; funding out-of-school activities; and developing partnerships 
      with universities designed to strengthen faculty, curriculum and student 
      development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies, with 
      subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company is involved in 
      virtually every facet of the energy industry. Chevron explores for,

			&lt;p&gt;Newly Formed Core Infrastructure Initiative Is the Industry's Collective Response to the Heartbleed Crisis&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, CA--(Marketwired - Apr 24, 2014) - 
				The Linux Foundation today announced it has formed a new project to fund and support critical elements of the global information infrastructure. The Core Infrastructure Initiative enables technology companies to collaboratively identify and fund open source projects that are in need of assistance, while allowing the developers to continue their work under the community norms that have made open source so successful. Founding backers of the Initiative include Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Dell, Facebook, Fujitsu, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NetApp, RackSpace, VMware and The Linux Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first project under consideration to receive funds from the Initiative will be OpenSSL, which could receive fellowship funding for key developers as well as other resources to assist the project in improving its security, enabling outside reviews, and improving responsiveness to patch requests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Core Infrastructure Initiative is a multi-million dollar project organized by The Linux Foundation to fund open source projects that are in the critical path for core computing and Internet functions. Galvanized by the Heartbleed OpenSSL crisis, the Initiative's funds will be administered by The Linux Foundation and a steering group comprised of backers of the project as well as key open source developers and other industry stakeholders. Support from the initiative will include funding for fellowships for key developers to work full-time on open source projects, security audits, computing and test infrastructure, travel, face-to-face meeting coordination and other support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are expanding the work we already do for the Linux kernel to other projects that may need support," said Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation. "Our global economy is built on top of many open source projects. Just as The Linux Foundation has funded Linus Torvalds to be able to focus 100% on Linux development, we will now be able to support additional developers and maintainers to work full-time supporting other essential open source projects. We are thankful for these industry leaders' commitment to ensuring the continued growth and reliability of critical open source projects such as OpenSSL."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maintaining the health of the community projects that produce software critical to the security and safety of Internet commerce is in everyone's interest," said Professor Eben Moglen of Columbia Law School, Founding Director of the Software Freedom Law Center. "The Linux Foundation, and the companies joining this Initiative, are enabling these dedicated programmers to continue maintaining and improving the free and open source software that makes the Net work safely for us all. This is business and community collaboration in the public interest, and we should all be grateful to The Linux Foundation for making it happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open source historically has produced high quality and highly secure software. For instance, the most recent Coverity Open Scan study of software quality has shown that open source code quality surpasses proprietary code quality. But as all software has grown in complexity&#160;--&#160;with interoperability between highly complex systems now the standard -- the needs for developer support has grown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the computing industry has increasingly come to rely upon shared source code to foster innovation. But as this shared code has become ever more critical to society and more complex to build and maintain, there are certain projects that have not received the level of support to commensurate with their importance. For instance, the OpenSSL project has in past years received about $2,000 per year in donations. The Core Infrastructure Initiative will change funding requests from the reactive post-crisis asks of today to proactive reviews identifying the needs of the most important projects. By raising funds at a neutral organization like The Linux Foundation, the industry will effectively give these projects the support they need while ensuring that open source projects retain their independence and community-based dynamism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone can donate to the Core Infrastructure Initiative fund.

      Regulatory News:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE: CCE)(Euronext Paris: CCE) today 
      reported first-quarter 2014 operating income of $184 million, or $194 
      million on a comparable basis. In the quarter, diluted earnings per 
      share were 44 cents on a reported basis, or 46 cents on a comparable 
      basis. Currency translation had a positive impact of approximately 3 
      cents on comparable diluted earnings per share. Items affecting 
      comparability are detailed on pages 10 through 12 of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the first quarter, net sales totaled $1.9 billion, an increase of 1 
      percent from the same quarter a year ago. On a currency neutral basis, 
      net sales declined 2&#189; percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our results for the first quarter, our smallest of the year, were 
      impacted by a combination of operating and marketplace factors and the 
      timing of the Easter holiday,&#8221; said John F. Brock, chairman and chief 
      executive officer. &#8220;As we move into the important summer season, we 
      believe our solid marketing and operating initiatives, coupled with our 
      disciplined financial approach, will enable us to build on the value of 
      our brands, reach our full-year targets, and continue to focus on 
      building shareowner value.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			OPERATING REVIEW
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first quarter, volume declined 1&#189; percent, including a 
      decline of 9 percent in Great Britain and growth of 3&#189; percent on the 
      Continent. The decline in Great Britain reflected a combination of 
      market factors, including competitive conditions, the transition from 
      2-liter PET bottles to 1.75-liter PET bottles, and wet weather. Volume 
      in continental Europe was led by solid growth in Coca-Cola trademark 
      brands and mid-single-digit growth in still brands.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the first quarter, net pricing per case was up 1 percent and cost of 
      sales per case was flat. Operating expenses declined 3&#189; percent. These 
      figures are comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our first quarter volume performance reflects the impact of key 
      operating strategies, including disciplined pricing and the transition 
      to a new package in Great Britain, as well as dynamic market 
      conditions,&#8221; said Hubert Patricot, executive vice president and 
      president, European Group. &#8220;We continue to believe our solid customer 
      relationships, excellent marketing initiatives, and ability to execute 
      and activate at the highest levels will enable us to deliver volume 
      growth in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We will continue to manage our business to ensure that we invest for 
      the long term while delivering on our current year objectives.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SHARE REPURCHASE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In December 2013, our Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion share 
      repurchase program &#8211; the fourth program since the creation of new CCE. 
      The company continues to expect to repurchase approximately $800 million 
      of its shares by the end of 2014. These plans may be adjusted depending 
      on economic, operating, or other factors, including acquisition 
      opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FULL-YEAR 2014 OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For 2014, CCE continues to expect earnings per diluted share to grow 
      approximately 10 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis. 
      Based on recent rates, currency translation would benefit full-year 2014 
      earnings per share by just over 5 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net sales are expected to grow in a low single-digit range and operating 
      income is expected to grow in a mid-single-digit range. This outlook is 
      comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company now expects 2014 free cash flow of approximately $650 
      million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 
      million. Weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 
      percent and the comparable effective tax rate for 2014 is expected to be 
      in a range of 26 percent to 28 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

          Net Pricing Per Case" and "Currency-Neutral Bottle and Can Cost of 
          Sales per Case" are used to more clearly evaluate bottle and can 
          pricing and cost trends in the marketplace. These measures exclude

			Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. Reports 
      First-Quarter 2014 Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				First-quarter diluted earnings per share were 44 cents on a 
        reported basis, or 46 cents on a comparable basis, including a 
        currency benefit of 3 cents.
			
			
				Net sales were $1.9 billion, up 1 percent on a reported basis or 
        down 2&#189; percent on a currency neutral basis; volume declined 1&#189; 
        percent.
			
			
				Reported operating income was $184 million; comparable operating 
        income was $194 million, up 8 percent or up 2 percent on a currency 
        neutral basis.
			
			
				CCE affirms its full-year guidance for 2014, including comparable 
        and currency neutral earnings per diluted share growth of 
        approximately 10 percent, low single-digit net sales growth, and 
        mid-single-digit operating income growth.
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE: CCE)(Euronext Paris: CCE) today 
      reported first-quarter 2014 operating income of $184 million, or $194 
      million on a comparable basis. In the quarter, diluted earnings per 
      share were 44 cents on a reported basis, or 46 cents on a comparable 
      basis. Currency translation had a positive impact of approximately 3 
      cents on comparable diluted earnings per share. Items affecting 
      comparability are detailed on pages 10 through 12 of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the first quarter, net sales totaled $1.9 billion, an increase of 1 
      percent from the same quarter a year ago. On a currency neutral basis, 
      net sales declined 2&#189; percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our results for the first quarter, our smallest of the year, were 
      impacted by a combination of operating and marketplace factors and the 
      timing of the Easter holiday,&#8221; said John F. Brock, chairman and chief 
      executive officer. &#8220;As we move into the important summer season, we 
      believe our solid marketing and operating initiatives, coupled with our 
      disciplined financial approach, will enable us to build on the value of 
      our brands, reach our full-year targets, and continue to focus on 
      building shareowner value.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			OPERATING REVIEW
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first quarter, volume declined 1&#189; percent, including a 
      decline of 9 percent in Great Britain and growth of 3&#189; percent on the 
      Continent. The decline in Great Britain reflected a combination of 
      market factors, including competitive conditions, the transition from 
      2-liter PET bottles to 1.75-liter PET bottles, and wet weather. Volume 
      in continental Europe was led by solid growth in Coca-Cola trademark 
      brands and mid-single-digit growth in still brands.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the first quarter, net pricing per case was up 1 percent and cost of 
      sales per case was flat. Operating expenses declined 3&#189; percent. These 
      figures are comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our first quarter volume performance reflects the impact of key 
      operating strategies, including disciplined pricing and the transition 
      to a new package in Great Britain, as well as dynamic market 
      conditions,&#8221; said Hubert Patricot, executive vice president and 
      president, European Group. &#8220;We continue to believe our solid customer 
      relationships, excellent marketing initiatives, and ability to execute 
      and activate at the highest levels will enable us to deliver volume 
      growth in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We will continue to manage our business to ensure that we invest for 
      the long term while delivering on our current year objectives.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SHARE REPURCHASE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In December 2013, our Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion share 
      repurchase program &#8211; the fourth program since the creation of new CCE. 
      The company continues to expect to repurchase approximately $800 million 
      of its shares by the end of 2014. These plans may be adjusted depending 
      on economic, operating, or other factors, including acquisition 
      opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FULL-YEAR 2014 OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For 2014, CCE continues to expect earnings per diluted share to grow 
      approximately 10 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis. 
      Based on recent rates, currency translation would benefit full-year 2014 
      earnings per share by just over 5 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net sales are expected to grow in a low single-digit range and operating 
      income is expected to grow in a mid-single-digit range. This outlook is 
      comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company now expects 2014 free cash flow of approximately $650 
      million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 
      million. Weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 
      percent and the comparable effective tax rate for 2014 is expected to be 
      in a range of 26 percent to 28 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      has announced the addition of the "Australia 
      Water Coolers Report 2013" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Australian water cooler market stood at 340,000 units installed at 
      the end of 2012. The market is still dominated by bottled water coolers, 
      with over 65% share, but their number has fallen in the last few years 
      as many customers switched to point of use as a cost saving alternative.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bottled water cooler market is dominated by Coca-Cola Amatil, 
      followed by couple of middle-sized companies. Many traditionally bottled 
      cooler players have included point of use units into their portfolios in 
      order to meet their client's requirements. Overall the point of use 
      market in the country remains very fragmented.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The point of use segment will continue to make further inroads and to 
      increase its market share at the expense of a declining bottled water 
      cooler installed base. Zenith predicts that the point of use market will 
      grow at a steady average rate of 2.6% for the time period 2013-17.

&lt;p&gt;CHENNAI, India (Reuters) - India's opposition Bharatiya Janata Party was set to make gains in two big states in the south and east that began voting on Thursday in the sixth phase of a mammoth general election that could help it build a stable majority in parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final set of opinion polls predicted a strong showing by the BJP and its allies in Tamil Nadu in the south and West Bengal in the east that could make it less dependent on the two women who rule those states and who have in the past proved to be fickle coalition partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hindu nationalist-led opposition, led by prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, is riding a wave of public anger across India against the ruling Congress party over a slew of corruption scandals and a slowing economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little over 180 million people were registered to vote on Thursday in the sixth phase of the world's biggest election that will end on May 16 when votes are counted from across India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Modi has focused on development issues, some of his colleagues on the Hindu far right have sought to rake up divisive issues that rivals say is aimed at polarizing voters in the BJP's northern and western bastions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His party is also looking to make a dent in the south and east to pull off an outright majority, something that no party has been able to achieve in nearly two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This election we are expecting a significant contribution from the south," said former BJP president Venkaiah Naidu, adding that the party wanted to lift its southern tally to 50 seats from 19 in the last election in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A regional party led by Jayaram Jayalalitha, the powerful chief minister of Tamil Nadu, is expected to win the most seats, but not enough to sweep the state as Modi's aggressive campaign for an all-out majority makes inroads, polls by India Today-Cicero and CNN-IBN said this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In West Bengal, a third of voters picked Modi as their first choice for prime minister ahead of state chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who leads a regional group. Her party is expected to win the most seats at stake in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banerjee was an ally of the ruling Congress coalition until late 2012, when she walked out in protest against its decision to allow foreign supermarket chains into India's $500 billion market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Jayalalitha and Banerjee are seen as belonging to parties to which Modi could turn in case he falls short of a majority in the national vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, both are likely to extract their pound of flesh. In Banerjee's case, her left-leaning policies may run counter to Modi's reformist instincts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are trying to get a majority of our own. Otherwise, we will have to take the support of the regional parties and the day-to-day running of government will not be trouble-free," said BJP general secretary J.P.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (AZN.L) highlighted progress with new cancer drugs that may revive its fortunes as it posted a 17 percent fall in core earnings per share on Thursday, reflecting patent losses on profitable older medicines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain's second-biggest drugmaker made no reference to a reported 60 billion pound ($101 billion) bid approach from Pfizer (PFE.N) in its results statement. The firm's new cancer drugs are seen as a big draw for the U.S. group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group said it would advance four important experimental medicines into late-stage clinical testing - two for cancer and two for breathing disorders, including the first of its closely watched immunotherapy cancer drugs, MEDI4736.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to push ahead with the Phase III testing of the drug, which belongs to a class known as anti-PD-L1 treatments that boost the immune system, follows evaluation of Phase I data that will be presented at the May 30-June 3 American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are investing in our rapidly progressing pipeline and the key platforms that are the backbone of our strategy to return to growth," Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To further concentrate organizational focus, we will continue to redeploy our resources in our core priorities and pursue opportunities that maximize the value of our pipeline and portfolio."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca reiterated that 2014 sales were likely to fall by a low-to-mid single digit percentage figure, with earnings declining "in the teens" as generic competition is expected to kick in for Nexium, its popular heartburn and ulcer drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales in the first quarter were flat at $6.42 billion, generating "core" earnings, which exclude certain items, of $1.17 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts, on average, had forecast sales in the quarter of $6.37 billion and earnings of $1.20 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Paul Sandle and Jane Baird)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Sopra (Paris:SOP) announces the proposed acquisition of HR Access 
      Service Line, currently owned by IBM&#160;France, through its subsidiary 
      Sopra HR Software. This acquisition would increase significantly the 
      pace at which Sopra is deploying its strategy for human resources 
      solutions.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM is a recognised market player in the development of HR&#160;Access 
      software providing integration services, maintenance and outsourcing 
      solutions for payroll and human resources administration. Its suite of 
      offerings in this area caters to clients of all sizes and across all 
      industries, covering the HR&#160;Access product life cycle from end to end.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For Sopra, this proposed acquisition, would further the strategic plan 
      which targets a strong presence in software solutions and associated 
      services. It would bring the Group closer to clients, enhance its 
      solutions-oriented approach and provide recognised expertise on the 
      human resources market. The
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      HR Access Service Line would join Sopra HR Software in making Sopra&#8217;s 
      Human Resources&#160;solutions a market standard.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Financial disclosures
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The acquisition would take the form of a partial transfer of business (cession 
      partielle de fonds de commerce). The acquisition price has not been 
      made public.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The proposal has been approved by Sopra&#8217;s Board of Directors. The 
      acquisition, subject to the usual conditions precedent including 
      consultation with employee-representative bodies, is expected to be 
      finalised in July&#160;2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The annual pro forma revenue of Sopra&#8217;s Human Resources&#160;solutions would 
      be approximately &#8364;150m in 2014.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday rejected a bid by a U.S. lawyer to stall the enforcement of a ruling that found he used fraud to secure a $9.5 billion pollution judgment against Chevron Corp in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyer Steven Donziger is appealing a 500-page decision issued by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in March that barred him from collecting on a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron filed a lawsuit against Donziger in New York, claiming he used bribery and fake evidence to win the historic damage award for a group of villagers who claimed the oil giant polluted an area of northeastern Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Ecuadorean judge had awarded the villagers $18 billion in 2011 but the country's high court later cut the judgment in half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan ruled Donziger had bribed a former judge to ghost-write the Ecuadorean judgment and committed other improprieties, finding him liable for fraud and racketeering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger had asked Kaplan to put the decision on hold while a federal appeals court considers the merits of his challenge, a process that will likely take months to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in Friday's order, Kaplan said Donziger's arguments for a stay were largely "without merit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger's "claims of irreparable injury rest on a pastiche of unsupported assertions, contradictions of undisputed evidence and fertile imagination," Kaplan's opinion said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan did grant Donziger narrow relief on one point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He allowed that the shares Donziger holds in a company called Amazonia, organized to collect and distribute any proceeds of Ecuadorean judgment, will be held by the court - not Chevron - pending the final outcome of the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron spokesman Morgan Crinklaw called the attorney's motion to stay "yet another attempt to delay and distract from the unrebutted evidence against him" and said the company was confident it would win in the appeals court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger's attorney said he had no comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-running case centers on an oil field in the Amazon jungle, known as Lago Agrio, where Texaco operated from 1964 to 1992.

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects judgment by Ecuador's high court in paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

claiming he used bribery and fake evidence to win the historic

2011 but the country's high court later cut the judgment in

a federal appeals court considers the merits of his challenge, a

of unsupported assertions, contradictions of undisputed evidence
and fertile imagination," Kaplan's opinion said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan did grant Donziger narrow relief on one point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He allowed that the shares Donziger holds in a company
called Amazonia, organized to collect and distribute any
proceeds of Ecuadorean judgment, will be held by the court - not
Chevron - pending the final outcome of the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron spokesman Morgan Crinklaw called the attorney's
motion to stay "yet another attempt to delay and distract from
the unrebutted evidence against him" and said the company was

			ExxonMobil Marine Affiliate Names Liberty Bay, New U.S.-Flag Tanker 
      in Philadelphia
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        First-in-class vessel to transport Alaska North Slope crude oil to 
        U.S. west coast refineries
      
			
        Proven ship design enhanced for greater reliability and environmental 
        performance
      
			
        Project&#8217;s jobs and revenues added to already positive impact of 
        Marcellus shale development
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation&#8217;s marine affiliate, SeaRiver Maritime, Inc., today 
      named the Liberty Bay, the first of its two new U.S.-flag crude oil 
      tankers, at a ceremony at Aker Philadelphia Shipyard.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first-in-class vessel, constructed at the shipyard, incorporates the 
      latest safety, navigation and engine room technologies and will begin 
      supplying crude oil from Alaska North Slope to refineries along the U.S. 
      west coast later this year. The double hull Liberty Bay is 820-feet long 
      and has capacity to carry 800,000 barrels of oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SeaRiver Maritime&#8217;s contract with Aker for two tankers, valued at $400 
      million, delivered a significant economic boost to the greater 
      Philadelphia region where it generated employment and millions of 
      dollars in revenue. When placed into service, the new tankers&#8217; economic 
      contributions will extend across the United States to Alaska, California 
      and Washington as they begin to support oil production and refining 
      operations. They will replace two existing double hull tankers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We knew that this project would have a positive economic impact, 
      creating more than 1,200 jobs and generating millions of dollars in 
      revenue for the city of Philadelphia, the commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
      and beyond,&#8221; said Darren Woods, president of ExxonMobil Refining  
      Supply Company. &#8220;What we celebrate today is a reminder of what America&#8217;s 
      energy industry can do and is doing &#8211; investing in our country. 
      Expanding supplies of affordable, reliable energy has been a major 
      contributor to our economy, creating jobs and helping meet our 
      government&#8217;s fiscal challenges.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Woods highlighted the key role Pennsylvania is playing in the nation&#8217;s 
      energy and manufacturing renaissance. &#8220;Domestic natural gas production 
      has risen by about 25 percent over a 10-year period. At the same time, 
      U.S. crude oil production has risen by 13 percent,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Today, the 
      Marcellus Shale produces 20 percent of U.S. natural gas supply. The 
      impact this growth in domestic energy production is directly having on 
      the U.S. economy is remarkable.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to double hulls for all cargo and fuel tanks, the Liberty 
      Bay is equipped with redundant components for key systems, including 
      main engine components and controls as well as fuel, lube oil and 
      electrical systems to deliver energy efficiencies and better 
      performance. These features reflect the results of SeaRiver Maritime&#8217;s 
      consultation with independent specialists to complete an extensive 
      evaluation of the vessel&#8217;s design using Failure Mode and Effects 
      Analysis, a methodology used by the aerospace industry and the U.S. 
      Department of Defense. This study analyzed key operating systems under a 
      variety of scenarios at sea. The ship&#8217;s main engine and auxiliary 
      systems will be energy efficient and generate lower air emissions than 
      what regulatory standards currently require.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Delivery of the second Liberty-class vessel is expected by year-end 2014.

&lt;p&gt;* Major indexes on track for second week of gains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft shares rise after results, Amazon down&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Investors concerned over fallout to Ukraine violence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Futures down: Dow 33 pts, S 4.8 pts, Nasdaq 13.25 pts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ryan Vlastelica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures
edged lower on Friday as intensifying  violence in Ukraine and
weakness in Amazon.com overshadowed positive results
from Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* In the latest sign of ongoing geopolitical strife,
Ukrainian forces killed up to five pro-Moscow rebels and Russia
launched army drills near the border in response, raising fears
its troops would invade. Separately, local police said seven
people were injured overnight at a pro-Ukrainian checkpoint near
the Black Sea port of Odessa when an explosive device blew up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* While the situation has taken a backseat to corporate
earnings in recent weeks, investors remain on edge over what the
potential fallout could be to any prolonged tension or violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Amazon fell 2 percent to $330.25 after posting a 
jump in revenue that was offset by sharp increases in spending.
 On the upside, Microsoft's earnings topped
analyst forecasts, while investors were cheered by the software
giant's new emphasis on mobile and cloud computing. Shares rose
1.7 percent to $40.52.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* S 500 futures fell 4.8 points and were below fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 33
points and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 13.25 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* For the week, the Dow is up 0.6 percent, the S
 is up 0.7 percent and the Nasdaq is up 1.3
percent. It is the second straight week of gains for all three,
boosted by strong results, especially from high-profile names
like Apple Inc and Caterpillar Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* While companies are beating a lowered bar, estimates have
been improving. Profits are seen rising 2.9 percent this
quarter, down from the 6.5 percent growth rate estimated at the
start of the year, but above the low of 0.6 percent seen last
week, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Ford Motor Co fell 2.5 percent to $15.91 in
premarket trading after the company reported results, while
Whirlpool Corp reported adjusted earnings that rose from
the prior year, and revenue that was up 4.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Visa Inc, the world's largest credit and debit card
company, said U.S. sanctions on Russia were hurting its card
transaction volumes and that revenue growth would slow further
this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* According to sources familiar with the matter, Allergan
Inc approached Shire Plc in recent months about
a possible takeover but was rebuffed, in the latest example of a
U.S. drugmaker seeking to buy an overseas rival to lower its tax
rate.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Espoo, Finland, April 25, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nokia today announced that it has completed the sale of substantially all of its Devices  Services business to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The transaction, which also includes an agreement to license patents to Microsoft, was originally announced on September 3, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	As earlier communicated, the transaction was subject to potential purchase price adjustments. The estimate of the adjustments made for net working capital and cash earnings was slightly positive for Nokia, and we currently expect the total transaction price to be slightly higher than the earlier-announced transaction price of EUR 5.44 billion after the final adjustments are made based on the verified closing balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, as is customary for transactions of this size, scale and complexity, Nokia and Microsoft made certain adjustments to the scope of the assets originally planned to transfer. These adjustments included Nokia's manufacturing facilities in Chennai in India and Masan in the Republic of Korea not transferring to Microsoft. These adjustments have no impact on the material deal terms of the transaction and Nokia will be materially compensated for any retained liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In India, our manufacturing facility is subject to an asset freeze by the Indian tax authorities as a result of ongoing tax proceedings. Consequently, the facility remains part of Nokia following the closing of the transaction. Nokia and Microsoft have entered into a service agreement whereby Nokia would produce mobile devices for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In Korea, Nokia and Microsoft agreed to exclude the Masan facility from the scope of the transaction. Nokia will now take steps to close the facility, which employs approximately 200 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Amid the uncertainty for our employees in Chennai and because of the planned closure of our facility in Masan, Nokia plans to offer a program of support, including financial assistance which would give our employees the chance to explore opportunities outside Nokia starting from a sound financial base. The company plans to bring to Chennai and Masan elements of its Bridge program, which we have made available for employees affected by company changes in other sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The convertible bonds issued by Nokia to Microsoft following the announcement of the transaction have been redeemed and netted against the deal proceeds by the amount of principal and accrued interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nokia Corporation Stock exchange release April 25, 2014 at 13.55 (CET +1)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Espoo, Finland - Nokia today announced that it has completed the sale of substantially all of its Devices  Services business to Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The transaction, which also includes an agreement to license patents to Microsoft, was originally announced on September 3, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;As earlier communicated, the transaction was subject to potential purchase price adjustments. The estimate of the adjustments made for net working capital and cash earnings was slightly positive for Nokia, and we currently expect the total transaction price to be slightly higher than the earlier-announced transaction price of EUR 5.44 billion after the final adjustments are made based on the verified closing balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as is customary for transactions of this size, scale and complexity, Nokia and Microsoft made certain adjustments to the scope of the assets originally planned to transfer. These adjustments included Nokia's manufacturing facilities in Chennai in India and Masan in the Republic of Korea not transferring to Microsoft. These adjustments have no impact on the material deal terms of the transaction and Nokia will be materially compensated for any retained liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In India, our manufacturing facility is subject to an asset freeze by the Indian tax authorities as a result of ongoing tax proceedings. Consequently, the facility remains part of Nokia following the closing of the transaction. Nokia and Microsoft have entered into a service agreement whereby Nokia would produce mobile devices for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In Korea, Nokia and Microsoft agreed to exclude the Masan facility from the scope of the transaction. Nokia will now take steps to close the facility, which employs approximately 200 people.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Amid the uncertainty for our employees in Chennai and because of the planned closure of our facility in Masan, Nokia plans to offer a program of support, including financial assistance which would give our employees the chance to explore opportunities outside Nokia starting from a sound financial base. The company plans to bring to Chennai and Masan elements of its Bridge program, which we have made available for employees affected by company changes in other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The convertible bonds issued by Nokia to Microsoft following the announcement of the transaction have been redeemed and netted against the deal proceeds by the amount of principal and accrued interest.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;As previously announced, the following Nokia leaders have stepped down from the Nokia Leadership Team and transferred to Microsoft at closing, effective April 25, 2014: Stephen Elop, Jo Harlow, Juha Putkiranta, Timo Toikkanen, and Chris Weber. Until further notice, Nokia's interim governance model announced on September 3, 2013 is in place.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nokia plans to cover in further detail aspects of the closing of the transaction in conjunction with its first quarter 2014 results announcement on April 29, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Now that the closing of this transaction has taken place, Nokia is arranging a Board of Directors meeting for early next week in relation to its strategy assessment which was originally disclosed on September 3, 2013.

			ExxonMobil Marks World Malaria Day With $10 Million in New Grants
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Increased funding to support partnerships with nearly 20 organizations 
        fighting malaria
      
			
        ExxonMobil has committed more than $120 million to fighting malaria, 
        reaching more than 105 million people
      
			
        Partnerships helped distribute more than 13 million bed nets, 
        administer 2 million malaria treatments and train 355,000 health 
        workers
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			ExxonMobil 
      marked World Malaria Day today by participating in events across Africa 
      and announcing more than $10 million in new grants to support lifesaving 
      programs across Africa and in the Pacific Rim, where the disease is a 
      major threat to health and economic development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The grants from ExxonMobil and the ExxonMobil Foundation will support a 
      wide range of research, advocacy, treatment and prevention programs to 
      accelerate progress in the fight against malaria, which still claims 
      more than 627,000 lives each year, mostly children under the age of five.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to funding, ExxonMobil provides business expertise and 
      insights to help strengthen these initiatives. ExxonMobil has been 
      committed to fighting malaria for more than a decade, and has provided 
      more than $120 million to programs that are helping more than 105 
      million people. The new grants build on the company&#8217;s support for 
      innovative programs to control and one day eliminate deaths from this 
      preventable and treatable disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To mark World Malaria Day, ExxonMobil is participating in events across 
      Africa &#8211; including the launch of Malaria No More&#8217;s award-winning 
      NightWatch campaign in Nigeria, La Coalition de la Communaut&#233; des 
      Affaires Contre le Sida, la Tuberculose et le Paludisme&#8217;s Malaria March 
      in Cameroon and CORE Group&#8217;s Malaria Day play in Angola. Through events 
      such as these, combined with advocacy and education efforts, ExxonMobil 
      aims to increase awareness and progress in the fight against malaria in 
      the communities in which it works.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have seen firsthand how the lives of ExxonMobil workers, families 
      and communities are directly harmed by malaria &#8211;&#160;and improved by the 
      efforts of our partners on the front line fighting this disease,&#8221; said 
      Suzanne McCarron, president of the ExxonMobil Foundation. &#8220;Together, we 
      are investing in sustainable solutions to help people live a healthy 
      life without the burden of malaria.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Unprecedented commitment from the global community in the past decade 
      has led to a 45 percent reduction in malaria mortality worldwide since 
      2000. Yet the disease is still a leading cause of death among children. 
      Beyond lives lost, the disease costs sub-Saharan Africa billions of 
      dollars in lost gross domestic product and accounts for as much as 40 
      percent of public health expenditures in some countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "The private sector has a crucial role to play in defeating malaria and 
      alleviating poverty,&#8221; said Dr. Fatoumata Nafo-Traor&#233;, Executive Director 
      of Roll Back Malaria Partnership. &#8220;The engagement of ExxonMobil shows 
      how public-private partnerships provide the resources, knowledge and 
      expertise that drives progress in the global fight against malaria, 
      which in turn drives development.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil&#8217;s grants will help drive a comprehensive response to the 
      disease that generates deeper impact in local communities and around the 
      world. Highlights of ExxonMobil&#8217;s 2014 malaria grantees include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Grassroot Soccer to use the convening power of soccer to 
        educate and mobilize youth in Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania 
        to protect themselves and their communities from malaria.
      
			
				Seed Global Health to place U.S. medical volunteers in tropical 
        disease settings to help train the next generation of health care 
        professionals.

        the ExxonMobil Malaria Scholar-in-Residence at the Harvard School of 
        Public Health, where she is advancing innovative strategies to combat

        for emerging malaria leaders from developing countries.
      
			
				Cameroon&#8217;s Business Coalition against Malaria, Tuberculosis and 
        HIV/AIDS to strengthen coordination between the private-sector 
        response to malaria and other serious diseases.
      
			
				Norwegian Red Cross to conduct a low-cost mobile phone malaria 
        survey on use of bed nets, diagnostics and approved malaria treatments 
        in affected communities in West Africa.
      
			
				PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) to educate and train 
        African health officials and opinion leaders to advocate for effective 
        implementation policies in advance of the potential 2015 introduction 
        of the first vaccine to protect against the disease.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil is one of the leading private-sector investors in malaria. 
      Its Workforce Malaria Control Program offers prevention tools, early 
      diagnosis and treatment to company employees and surrounding 
      communities. Since 2000, ExxonMobil&#8217;s partnerships have helped 
      distribute 13.1 million bed nets, administer 1.9 million malaria 
      treatment doses and train more than 355,000 health workers and 
      counselors working on the front lines of malaria prevention and control.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is rushing to fix a bug in its widely used Internet Explorer web browser after a computer security firm disclosed the flaw over the weekend, saying hackers have already exploited it in attacks on some U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCs running Windows XP will not receive any updates fixing that bug when they are released, however, because Microsoft stopped supporting the 13-year-old operating system earlier this month. Security firms estimate that between 15 and 25 percent of the world's PCs still run Windows XP.    .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft disclosed on Saturday its plans to fix the bug in an advisory to its customers posted on its security website, which it said is present in Internet Explorer versions 6 to 11. Those versions dominate desktop browsing, accounting for 55 percent of the PC browser market, according to tech research firm NetMarketShare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity software maker FireEye Inc said that a sophisticated group of hackers have been exploiting the bug in a campaign dubbed &#8220;Operation Clandestine Fox.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FireEye, whose Mandiant division helps companies respond to cyber attacks, declined to name specific victims or identify the group of hackers, saying that an investigation into the matter is still active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a campaign of targeted attacks seemingly against U.S.-based firms, currently tied to defence and financial sectors,"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FireEye spokesman Vitor De Souza said via email. "It's unclear what the motives of this attack group are, at this point. &#160;It appears to be broad-spectrum intel gathering."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to elaborate, though he said one way to protect against them would be to switch to another browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in the advisory that the vulnerability could allow a hacker to take complete control of an affected system, then do things such as viewing changing, or deleting data, installing malicious programs, or creating accounts that would give hackers full user rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FireEye and Microsoft have not provided much information about the security flaw or the approach that hackers could use to figure out how to exploit it, said Aviv Raff, chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm Seculert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet other groups of hackers are now racing to learn more about it so they can launch similar attacks before Microsoft prepares a security update, Raff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft should move fast," he said. "This will snowball."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he cautioned that Windows XP users will not benefit from that update since Microsoft has just halted support for that product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software maker said in a statement to Reuters that it advises Windows XP users to upgrade to one of two most recently versions of its operating system, Windows 7 or 8. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Diane Craft)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A 24-year-old American man detained in North Korea had arranged a private tour of the country through a U.S. travel company and gave no indication he might try to seek asylum upon arriving in Pyongyang, the company's director said Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

He did not express any special intentions in his tour application," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports that a U.S. citizen had been detained in North Korea and it was in touch with the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea and the interests of American citizens in the country are represented by Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters has so far not been able to contact Miller's family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dantzler-Wolfe said Miller had arranged a private tour of North Korea and requested only local guides, instead of the usual combination of local and foreign tour leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those guides informed Uri Tours that Miller had arrived in the country and "deliberately ripped his visa and had declared that he was 'not a tourist,'" Dantzler-Wolfe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An emergency contact name provided on Miller's tour application could not be reached, Dantzler-Wolfe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American visitor has been identified in Korean media as Miller Matthew Todd, apparently in the Korean convention of putting the last name first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller is the latest American visitor to be detained by North Korean authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, 85-year-old Merrill E. Newman was released after more than a month of detention after being pulled from a flight about to depart Pyongyang and accused of war crimes during the Korean War six decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another American, Kenneth Bae, has been held in North Korea for more than a year. He was arrested as he led a tour group in the country in 2012 and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor on charges of state subversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Korea has twice canceled visits by Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, to discuss Bae's case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Victoria Cavaliere; Editing by Dan Whitcomb and Sandra Maler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is rushing to fix a bug in its widely used Internet Explorer web browser after a computer security firm disclosed the flaw over the weekend, saying hackers have already exploited it in attacks on some U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCs running Windows XP will not receive any updates fixing that bug when they are released, however, because Microsoft stopped supporting the 13-year-old operating system earlier this month. Security firms estimate that between 15 and 25 percent of the world's PCs still run Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft disclosed on Saturday its plans to fix the bug in an advisory to its customers posted on its security website, which it said is present in Internet Explorer versions 6 to 11. Those versions dominate desktop browsing, accounting for 55 percent of the PC browser market, according to tech research firm NetMarketShare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity software maker FireEye Inc said that a sophisticated group of hackers have been exploiting the bug in a campaign dubbed "Operation Clandestine Fox."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FireEye, whose Mandiant division helps companies respond to cyber attacks, declined to name specific victims or identify the group of hackers, saying that an investigation into the matter is still active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a campaign of targeted attacks seemingly against U.S.-based firms, currently tied to defense and financial sectors," FireEye spokesman Vitor De Souza said via email.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Leading advisory firms Deloitte  TSR 
      have revealed that the misunderstood and hard to track asset class of 
      corporate break-ups (Spinoffs) significantly outperforms the major 
      global indices and peer groups in twelve months post the first day of 
      trading (stock listing). What isn&#8217;t known is a vast number of 
      Parents rally in share price prior to separating the Spinoff business. So 
      what should investors consider when investing in an upcoming Spinoff 
      given the next year will see a record 50+ parents breaking in to two 
      companies?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Speaking to Ryan 
      Mendy, COO of TSR who via their subscription 
      service advise over one hundred of the world's most 
      recognized hedge, mutual and family office funds with research on future 
      Spinoffs, he described a few of the major focus points that they 
      deeply research to pre-event recommend and ultimately define which next 
      break-up is the most valuable?
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Fundamentals: What is the killer reason behind the Spinoff? 
        Where and how (if any) is value being created? Can you forecast the 
        future financials with little to zero broker coverage?
      
			
				Technicals: How will the split affect the movement of each 
        stock? How do you quantify it?
      
			
				Who are the insiders? What is their history of buying or 
        selling their own stock?
      
			
				Valuation /
				Forecast Target Prices: What price will or 
        should each new stock open at? Bull to bear case, what is the stock 
        worth 1 to 3 years from now?
      
			
				Investment Timing: What price should you enter the stock? Will 
        either sell-off post listing? Can you quantify whether to buy more now 
        or sell?
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;With a money management background and being used by many private 
      equity style funds, our bottom-up research stands out because we think 
      differently, asking different questions of our analysis. What management 
      changes are happening? Will any member be a catalyst for the stock based 
      on past experience? Will new incentives (remuneration) be positive for 
      the share price?,&#8221; commented Mendy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There&#8217;s been surging interest by asset managers in quality research on 
      upcoming demergers and this year will see the likes of: Agilent 
      Technologies (A), General 
      Electric (GE), Kimberly-Clark 
      Corp (KMB), Pioneer 
      Foods (PFG) and Westfield 
      Group (WDC) break-up valuable segments.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Moldovan citizens will no longer require visas to travel to most of the European Union from Monday, as the bloc presses ahead with deeper ties with east European nations in defiance of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine are all seeking tighter links with the European Union as part of Eastern Partnerships with the bloc, which allow for closer trade and business ties without full EU membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the Ukraine crisis, the European Union has said it will accelerate the partnerships and from Monday, all citizens of Moldova with a biometric passport can travel visa-free to Europe's Schengen zone, the European Commission said on Sunday in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Schengen zone includes most EU countries and some non-members such as Norway and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine's quest for EU ties triggered the current crisis in relations with Moscow, dividing the nation between those seeking to look West and those wanting to stay in Moscow's orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in March, NATO has cited Moldova's disputed Transdniestria region as a possible next target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moldova's pro-European prime minister Iurie Leanca has said EU-inspired reforms and visa-free travel for Moldovans are the best hope of resolving the "frozen conflict" of Transdniestria, arguing they would make Moldova more attractive to those in the rebel region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An official from the European Commission confirmed the visa exemption did not depend on ethnic origins and could include people living in Transdniestria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A narrow strip of land near the Ukrainian border, Transdniestria has not been recognised by any state as independent, but it is home to Russian troops and half-a-million people - 30 percent of them ethnic Russians - who look to Russia as their patron, much like the ethnic Russian majority in Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All EU countries apart from Britain and Ireland are either members of the Schengen area or - in the case of Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania - legally bound to join.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Britain's Home Office said London had no plans to allow visa-free travel to Moldovans visiting Britain, and was not bound by the Schengen decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU partnership deals depend on certain reforms. In its statement, the Commission, the EU executive, said Moldova had reformed its interior ministry, modernised its border police and made progress towards ensuring equality and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Barbara Lewis; Additional reporting by Kylie MacLellan in London; Editing by Andrew Roche)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Repeats column initially published late on Friday)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Rodrigo Campos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - Since late February, when
investors fell out of love with biotechnology and other
high-flying stocks, the market's fuel has been oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy names have been the best-performing sector in the S
500 since Feb. 25 when the selloff in high-growth stocks began.
The sector will look to build on recent gains when bellwethers
Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and
ConocoPhillips report results this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rotation to value has limited the broader market's
selloff. That could continue: Morgan Stanley said in a recent
note that strong rotations to value names are usually followed
by longer periods of value leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy sector funds have attracted inflows in nine of the
past 10 weeks; flows have averaged $488.9 million weekly over
the last four weeks, the most since March 2011, according to
Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a total return basis, energy is up more than 7
percent since Feb. 25, compared with a gain of just over 2
percent for the S 500 and a loss of 1.8 percent on
healthcare, the worst-performing sector in that
period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These big energy companies that pay dividends and have
solid buyback programs are more defensive in nature as long as
the price of the underlying commodity holds up," said Mike
O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich,
Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Exxon and Chevron rank among the top 10 dividend payers
in terms of absolute dollars, according to S Dow Jones
Indices. With a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.2, significantly
below the S 500's 17.8, energy should continue to attract
investors as the rotation to value continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of the major oil companies are entering the next
phase of their life cycle, where there's more of an emphasis on
profitability and cost control," said Faisel Khan, senior oil
equity analyst at Citi in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think that returns have a pretty good chance of growing
from here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halliburton Co, the world's No.2 oilfield services
provider, said last week that their customers are stepping up
spending to drill and complete wells as operating budgets swell.
Schlumberger Ltd and Baker Hughes Inc also spoke
of improved markets in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Federal Reserve, capacity utilization
in the oil extraction sector currently sits at 99.2 percent of
total capacity, far exceeding the average over the previous 40
years of about 92 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far in this earnings period, 14 energy names have
reported results, with 11 - or 79 percent - exceeding estimates,
making energy No. 1 among sectors with more than 10 companies
reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With investors generally underweight Big Oils, there are
early signs that significant negative consensus EPS revisions
are likely leveling off," said Asit Sen, an analyst at Cowen &amp;
Co, referring to earnings per share estimates in a note this
week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Wall St Week Ahead appears every Sunday. Questions or

&lt;p&gt;April 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said it will
increase its cloud storage offering for business users by
40-fold as the world's largest software company makes a case for
businesses buying an all-in-one product from itself rather than
buying technology "piecemeal" from multiple sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The era of making isolated, single-solution decisions is
rapidly coming to a close," wrote John Case, corporate vice
president of Microsoft Office Division. Microsoft on Monday
raised its OneDrive for Business storage to 1TB per user from
25GB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's pitch to be the one-stop destination for
companies looking to buy technology runs against efforts by
smaller rivals such as Box and Dropbox that offer one or two
specialized services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not name its rivals but made a reference to
them in the headline of its blog post titled "Thinking outside
the box." (link.reuters.com/byj88v)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dropbox spokeswoman declined to comment on the Microsoft
move. Box Chief Executive Aaron Levie fired back in a blog post,
criticizing Microsoft for keeping its storage software "closed"
and making it difficult for users to move their data between
different services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By keeping Office 365 users on the closed OneDrive
"island," Microsoft is stranding hundreds of millions of users
and customers that have chosen Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and
others," Levie wrote in response to Microsoft's move. (r.reuters.com/pyj88v)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online document-sharing company Dropbox is a Silicon Valley
startup that has proved a hit with consumers and boasts more
than 200 million users six years after it was started. It has
undergone tremendous growth amid the meteoric rise of cloud,
which is expected to continue booming alongside mobile
computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dropbox won plaudits for its ease-of-use and gained
traction among individual users, Levie focused Box in recent
years toward catering to corporate customers who demanded
greater levels of administrative control and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies are expected to go public in the coming
months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud services have become increasingly popular among both
cash-strapped tech startups and larger companies, which rely on
computers owned and operated by the likes of Amazon.com Inc
 and Google Inc instead of buying the
equipment themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are excited about Microsoft Chief Executive Satya
Nadella's focus on mobile and cloud computing, designed to take
Microsoft beyond its traditional PC-based Windows business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which reported results Thursday, saw Nadella's
emphasis on cloud computing help its server software business in
the third quarter, while a softer-than-expected decline in PC
sales limited damage to the bottom line.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Walt Disney (DIS.N) said on Monday it has struck a deal with its Chinese joint venture partner to increase investment in its upcoming resort and theme park, Shanghai Disney, by an additional $800 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expansion comes with an eye on China's fast-growing entertainment and media market, which is expected to grow to $148 billion by 2015 from around $120 billion in 2013, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers' outlook for the global entertainment and media business 2011-2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increased investment will be used primarily to fund additional attractions to increase capacity at the park, with most targeted to be completed for opening day, Disney said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner of parks and resorts worldwide, including in cities like Tokyo and Paris, on its website says the Shanghai theme park and resort is slated for opening in late 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joint venture's total investment in the theme park, touted as China's answer to Orlando, will now total $5.5 billion after the increased investment, a Disney spokesman confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State-owned Shanghai Shendi will continue to hold 57 percent of the shares of the owner companies, while Disney said it will hold the remaining 43 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, which also operates a theme park in Hong Kong, signed an agreement in 2010 for its first theme park in mainland China.

Shanghai Disney, by an additional $800 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expansion comes with an eye on China's fast-growing
entertainment and media market, which is expected to grow to
$148 billion by 2015 from around $120 billion in 2013, according
to PricewaterhouseCoopers' outlook for the global entertainment
and media business 2011-2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increased investment will be used primarily to fund
additional attractions to increase capacity at the park, with
most targeted to be completed for opening day, Disney said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner of parks and resorts worldwide, including in
cities like Tokyo and Paris, on its website says the Shanghai
theme park and resort is slated for opening in late 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joint venture's total investment in the theme park,
touted as China's answer to Orlando, will now total $5.5 billion
after the increased investment, a Disney spokesman confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State-owned Shanghai Shendi will continue to hold 57 percent
of the shares of the owner companies, while Disney said it will
hold the remaining 43 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, which also operates a theme park in Hong Kong,
signed an agreement in 2010 for its first theme park in mainland
China. (r.reuters.com/vej88v)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financing of the additional investment will be proportionate
to ownership and third-party debt is not expected to pay for the
expansion, Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney in February reported higher profit for the quarter
that ended in December, beating Wall Street expectations due to
growth at its sports network and the blockbuster animated hit
film "Frozen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher guest spending in the United States also helped push
up profit at Disney's theme parks unit.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S 500 ended higher on Monday after a volatile session, as gains in Apple (AAPL.O) and Pfizer (PFE.N) helped offset another round of selling in some high-growth tech shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dow also managed to end the session with a modest gain, while the Nasdaq closed slightly lower after rebounding from a fall of over 1 percent. Leading the Nasdaq down was Amazon.com (AMZN.O), which extended Friday's sharp drop a day after its earnings report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flurry of merger and acquisition activity in the pharmaceutical sector increased speculation of further deal-making. Shares of Pfizer gained 4.2 percent to $32.04 after the U.S. drugmaker was said to be working on its next move in a potential bid to take over Britain's AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we saw earlier was you had more rotation out of the high-beta momentum names, and a lot of those tech players rotated into Apple, which just had positive earnings," said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This whole M aspect of the pharmaceutical healthcare industry has people positively biased for the time being," he said, and "people who had to sell the momentum names are at least finished for the time being."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 87.28 points or 0.53 percent, to end at 16,448.74. The S 500 .SPX gained 6.03 points or 0.32 percent, to 1,869.43. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 1.161 points or 0.03 percent, to 4,074.401.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's stock jumped 3.9 percent to $594.09. The stock has gained 13.2 percent since the close on Wednesday, when Apple reported results after the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com ended down 2.4 percent at $296.58. High-growth stocks have been battered in recent weeks as investors have pulled out of the tech and biotech space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America shares tumbled 6.3 percent to $14.95 after the company said it will suspend a planned increase in its quarterly dividend as well as its latest stock-buyback program because it miscalculated a measure of the capital on its books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese Internet stocks also fell after China's government ordered the removal of four U.S. television shows from video websites. The U.S.-listed shares of Baidu (BIDU.O) slid 7.4 percent to $150.93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other M activity, Forest Laboratories Inc FRX.N said it would buy Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc FURX.O for up to $1.46 billion. Furiex Pharmaceuticals shares surged 28.6 percent to $103.05 while Forest Laboratories shares shed 0.4 percent to $89.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agenus (AGEN.O) shares jumped 19.5 percent to $3.06 after the biotechnology company said it signed a deal with Merck &amp; Co Inc (MRK.N) to discover and develop antibody-based treatments against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bell, shares of in-flight wireless Internet services provider Gogo (GOGO.O) dropped 19.2 percent to $14.85 after AT (T.N) said it plans to launch an in-flight connectivity service. ID:WNBB047WB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the session, about 7.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.5 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bernadette Baum and Jan Paschal)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A wave of tax-driven overseas deal-making by U.S. companies gained momentum with drugmaker Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) announcement on Monday that it had made takeover bids for UK rival AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), fueling political concerns about tax "reflagging" strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it wants to buy AstraZeneca and merge the two companies into a UK holding company with a UK tax domicile, while maintaining its operational headquarters in New York. It would likely be the largest deal ever done that included such a so-called tax "inversion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a deal goes through - which is far from certain given AstraZeneca has so far rejected Pfizer's overtures - it would likely mean a loss of corporate tax revenue for the United States, and a lower effective tax rate for the combined entity than the two companies pay now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 2013, Pfizer disclosed an effective rate of 27.5 percent and global cash income tax paid of $2.87 billion, including income taxes paid to the U.S. government and other state and foreign tax authorities, based on company filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer proposal triggered concern in Washington. "This further demonstrates the urgency for tax reform," said a spokeswoman for Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, chairman of the tax-writing U.S. Senate Finance Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now is the time to undertake comprehensive reform to ensure our country stays competitive on a global stage and continues to be the best place for corporate investment," the spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments worldwide are increasingly wary of corporate tax avoidance. The Obama administration earlier this year included a proposal in its 2015 budget to clamp down on deals like the one Pfizer is pursuing. The administration's proposal is unlikely to go anywhere though with Congress deadlocked on tax issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Internal Revenue Service on Friday issued a separate notice limiting shareholders' tax-free treatment in inversion transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAX-DRIVEN DEALS RAMP UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the 2008 global financial crisis, about two dozen U.S. companies have shifted their legal tax residences to lower-tax countries via corporate deals, versus about the same number over the previous 25 years, a Reuters review of transactions showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada and Britain lately have been the most common destinations of U.S. companies seeking new tax domiciles, replacing preferred havens of years past such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying AstraZeneca would allow Pfizer to escape the comparatively high 35-percent U.S. corporate income tax rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has one of the highest such tax rates in the world, though most multinational companies pay less than that due to plentiful loopholes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said the UK holding company structure being contemplated "provides for a more efficient tax structure that doesn't subject AstraZeneca's non-U.S. profits to U.S. tax." Campion declined further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inversions allow U.S. corporations to escape that high rate by moving to a lower-tax country, via an acquisition, a merger or the creation of a new holding company. They can also reduce overall U.S. profits in a process known as "earnings stripping" that involves loading up the legacy U.S. business with tax-deductible debt, said academics and private tax watchdog groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AstraZeneca transaction would also give Pfizer a way to spend some of an estimated $69 billion it is holding abroad under a law that lets U.S. companies shelter overseas earnings from U.S. taxes by keeping them out of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OMNICOM-PUBLICIS DEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another large inversion deal is New York advertising firm Omnicom Group Inc's (OMC.N) proposed $35-billion merger with Paris rival Publicis Groupe SA PUBP.PA). This transaction is encountering approval delays among European tax authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omnicom and Publicis announced in mid-2013 they planned to merge into a new corporate holding company to be based in the Netherlands, with operating units staying in New York and Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The merger was described then as tax-free to shareholders of both companies, with each side getting about 50 percent of the shares in the new Dutch holding company. The deal was then expected to close in late 2013 or early 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Omnicom said Dutch and UK tax authorities had not yet approved the deal, which Omnicom had previously said would save $80 million a year in taxes. A plan to make the company tax resident in the UK while being domiciled in the Netherlands had become a particular stumbling block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omnicom-Publicis is more like a merger of equals than it is an inversion, but "the practical impact of this transaction is that the company is achieving a corporate inversion," said Bret Wells, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center who has studied corporate inversions for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the Obama budget proposal is unlikely to become law anytime soon, it does indicate that the U.S. government is trying to grapple with the question of inversions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been a decade since the first inversion legislation was enacted and Obama is now trying to tighten the rules," said Steven Rosenthal, a tax expert and senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a policy think tank in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot of concern about losing U.S. companies to these reflagging operations," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IRS TAKES STEP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS's move last week "further evidences the government's narrow reading of the inversion rules and dovetails with the Obama administration's 2015 budget proposal to narrow the scope of permitted inversions," said international law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft LLP in an emailed update to clients on tax-related merger and acquisition developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More companies are currently considering inversions by merger, including mergers involving two or more foreign jurisdictions," said Linda Swartz, chair of Cadwalader's tax group. "Companies have become more comfortable with the prospect of inverting as the number of announced deals has steadily increased this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, a Paris-based club of major industrial economies, is studying tax base erosion and the related issue of profit shifting by multinational corporations among units in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States was among members of the G20 nations that endorsed the OECD project. "Profits should be taxed where economic activities deriving the profits are performed and where value is created," said a declaration of the G20 leaders in September after a summit meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS has addressed inversions, which are generally thought to have first emerged in 1982, by trying to define what is and is not a foreign business, and by trying to curb opportunities for earnings stripping, but with little success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flurry of deals from 1997 through 2002 saw several major U.S. companies reflag in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. Congress cracked down with a stricter law in 2004 and the flow of deals dried up for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest wave of deals got under way in 2008 after the financial crisis abated. The wave has continued amid inconclusive IRS efforts to define how much presence a corporation must have in the United States and abroad to be treated as a foreign company for U.S. tax purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Tom Bergin and Ben Hirschler in London; Nicola Leske, Olivia Oran, Nadia Damouni, Leila Abboud and Ransdell Pierson in New York; Editing by Martin Howell)&lt;/p&gt;

			Shanghai Disney Resort Accelerates Resort Expansion
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) today announced that it has reached 
      an agreement with Shanghai Shendi Group, its joint venture partner in 
      China, to accelerate the expansion of Shanghai Disney Resort. The 
      increased investment of approximately 5 billion yuan (US$0.8 billion) 
      will be used primarily for additional&#160;attractions, entertainment and 
      other offerings to increase capacity at the theme park, with the 
      majority targeted to be completed for opening day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Since we first broke ground in Shanghai we&#8217;ve been very impressed with 
      the growth of China&#8217;s economy, especially the rapid expansion of the 
      middle class and the significant increase in travel and tourism,&#8221; said 
      Robert A. Iger, chairman and chief executive officer of The Walt Disney 
      Company. &#8220;Our accelerated expansion, including additional attractions 
      and entertainment, will allow us to welcome more guests for a 
      spectacular Disney experience on opening day.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Like all of our parks, Shanghai Disney Resort was designed to expand 
      over time, and this investment allows us to bring some of those 
      additions online earlier,&#8221; said Thomas O. Staggs, chairman of Walt 
      Disney Parks and Resorts.&#160;&#8220;The expansion underscores the tremendous 
      opportunity we see in Shanghai and demonstrates our long-term commitment 
      to and confidence in China.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The announcement of this accelerated expansion comes during a boom in 
      China&#8217;s travel and tourism market, which is expected to continue its 
      rapid growth. An income qualified population of 330 million people are 
      within a three-hour travel radius of Shanghai Disney Resort. From 2012 
      to 2015, the Chinese travel market is projected to grow 34 percent, 
      according to PhoCusWright. The number of upper-middle class and affluent 
      households in China is expected to grow 18 percent annually between 2012 
      and 2022, according to McKinsey.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Shanghai Shendi Group will continue to hold 57 percent of the shares of 
      the owner companies while Disney will hold the remaining 43 percent. 
      Financing of the additional investment will be proportionate to 
      ownership and, as with the original shareholder investment, it is not 
      anticipated that third-party debt will be incurred to finance the 
      expansion. In addition, Disney is the majority shareholder in the 
      management company responsible for creating, developing and operating 
      the Resort.

&lt;p&gt;(New throughout, adds details and share price)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 28 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said a $19
billion project in Papua New Guinea had started production of
liquefied natural gas (LNG) ahead of schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said at its analyst meeting in March that the project
was due to start during the middle of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first cargo from the project, which would also produce
piped natural gas (PNG), is expected to be shipped to Asia
markets before the middle of this year, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said the project, operated by affiliate ExxonMobil PNG
Ltd, was expected to produce more than 9 trillion cubic feet of
gas over 30 years of operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon is relying on projects like the one in Papua New
Guinea to fuel much-needed production growth at the world's
largest publicly traded oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon ended at $101.17 on the New York Stock
Exchange. So far this year, the company's stock is flat,
compared with a 1 percent gain in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index

Monday after a volatile session, as gains in Apple and
Pfizer helped offset another round of selling in some
high-growth tech shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow also managed to end the session with a modest gain,
while the Nasdaq closed slightly lower after rebounding from a
fall of over 1 percent. Leading the Nasdaq down was Amazon.com
, which extended Friday's sharp drop a day after its
earnings report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flurry of merger and acquisition activity in the
pharmaceutical sector increased speculation of further
deal-making. Shares of Pfizer gained 4.2 percent to $32.04 after
the U.S. drugmaker was said to be working on its next move in a
potential bid to take over Britain's AstraZeneca Plc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we saw earlier was you had more rotation out of the
high-beta momentum names, and a lot of those tech players
rotated into Apple, which just had positive earnings," said
Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in
Greenwich, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This whole M aspect of the pharmaceutical healthcare
industry has people positively biased for the time being," he
said, and "people who had to sell the momentum names are at
least finished for the time being."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average rose 87.28 points or
0.53 percent, to end at 16,448.74. The S 500 gained
6.03 points or 0.32 percent, to 1,869.43. The Nasdaq Composite
 dropped 1.161 points or 0.03 percent, to 4,074.401.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's stock jumped 3.9 percent to $594.09. The stock has
gained 13.2 percent since the close on Wednesday, when Apple
reported results after the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com ended down 2.4 percent at $296.58. High-growth
stocks have been battered in recent weeks as investors have
pulled out of the tech and biotech space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America shares tumbled 6.3 percent to $14.95 after
the company said it will suspend a planned increase in its
quarterly dividend as well as its latest stock-buyback program
because it miscalculated a measure of the capital on its books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese Internet stocks also fell after China's government
ordered the removal of four U.S. television shows from video
websites. The U.S.-listed shares of Baidu slid 7.4
percent to $150.93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other M activity, Forest Laboratories Inc said
it would buy Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc for up to $1.46

28.6 percent to $103.05 while Forest Laboratories shares shed
0.4 percent to $89.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agenus shares jumped 19.5 percent to $3.06 after
the biotechnology company said it signed a deal with Merck &amp; Co
Inc to discover and develop antibody-based treatments
against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bell, shares of in-flight wireless Internet
services provider Gogo dropped 19.2 percent to $14.85
after AT said it plans to launch an in-flight

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc approached Britain's AstraZeneca Plc two days ago to reignite a potential $100 billion takeover and was rebuffed, raising investor expectations it will have to increase its offer to close the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said on Monday it proposed a takeover to AstraZeneca in January worth 58.8 billion pounds ($98.9 billion), or nearly 47 pounds per share. It had contacted its British rival again on Saturday, seeking to discuss further a takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chase was welcomed by investors in both companies, as deal-making grips the healthcare industry. AstraZeneca shares were up 11.7 percent at $76.69 in New York on news of the latest offer, which would be the biggest foreign acquisition of a British company and one of the largest pharmaceutical deals. Pfizer shares were up 3.8 percent at $31.92 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca said Pfizer's suggested offer undervalued the company "very significantly," adding that Pfizer wanted to pay 70 percent in shares and only 30 percent in cash. AstraZeneca urged its shareholders to take no action and said it remained confident of its independent strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel pretty confident of a higher bid coming," said Neil Veitch, global and UK investment director at SVM Asset Management, which owns AstraZeneca shares. "I think it's more likely than not that we'll see an agreed deal somewhere in that 52 to 53 pound range."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying AstraZeneca would boost Pfizer's pipeline of cancer drugs and create significant cost and tax savings. Under British takeover rules, Pfizer has until May 26 to announce a firm intention to make an offer or back away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The renewed approach comes amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the sector, pushing the value of deals to $153 billion so far this year, as the industry restructures amid healthcare spending cuts and competition from cheap generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Society wants products faster, they want more products and they want value," Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read told reporters. "Industry is responding to society's request for increased efficiencies and productivity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read said AstraZeneca had declined to engage in talks and the U.S. group was now considering how to proceed, but he remained convinced that combining the two companies made strategic sense and would benefit AstraZeneca investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW DRUG PIPELINES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's original proposal, made to the board of AstraZeneca on January 5, would have valued AstraZeneca shares at 46.61 pounds each - a premium of around 30 percent at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca said the proposal comprised 13.98 pounds in cash and 1.758 Pfizer shares for each AstraZeneca share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My guess is it will go for somewhere between 50 and 55 (pounds a share)," said Dan Mahony, a fund manager at Polar Capital, who raised his stake in AstraZeneca in February last year. "I doubt Pfizer will want to go completely hostile."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of Pfizer's past deals have been conducted on a friendly basis, including its 2009 purchase of Wyeth for $68 billion. But it has been willing to play hardball if needed, as it did in 2000 with its $90 billion purchase of U.S. rival Warner-Lambert, with which it won full ownership of cholesterol fighter Lipitor, the best-selling drug of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read told U.S. analysts that since the initial approach to AstraZeneca, both companies had seen experimental drugs fare well in trials. At the same time, Pfizer concluded it was too difficult to pursue big deals domestically while being on the hook for higher U.S. tax rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're coming from a position of strength, on our near-term pipeline" of experimental drugs, Read said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent favorable data includes results for Pfizer's experimental breast cancer medicine palbociclib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INDEPENDENT FUTURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's declaration turns up the heat under AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, who has been in the job since October 2012 and who made clear last week he saw an independent future for the group, flagging spin-offs of two noncore units as one option to create more value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soriot has been credited with reviving AstraZeneca's previously thin pipeline of new drugs, badly needed to offset a wave of patent expiries on older drugs, and shares in the group have now risen more than 60 percent under his tenure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, his overhaul - including an ambitious plan to move the company's research and corporate headquarters to Cambridge, England - is still a work in progress and he has also come under fire from some shareholders over executive pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read said it was premature to say who would lead a combined company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying AstraZeneca would give Pfizer a number of promising - though still risky - experimental cancer medicines known as immunotherapies that boost the body's immune system to fight tumors. It could also generate significant cost savings for the U.S. group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquiring a foreign company also makes sense for Pfizer as it has tens of billions of dollars accumulated through foreign subsidiaries, which, if repatriated, would be heavily taxed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker has more recently been divesting certain operations, while mega-mergers had fallen out of fashion in the pharmaceuticals industry following skepticism about how well some of them have worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEFTY RETURN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But CEO Read said large deals could also make good sense and buying AstraZeneca would "maintain the flexibility for the potential future separation of our businesses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transaction would complement both Pfizer's innovative drug businesses and also its established products business - comprising older and off-patent medicines - which many analysts expect to be eventually spun off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to using offshore cash, buying AstraZeneca would be tax-efficient since Pfizer could redomicile to Britain and enjoy lower tax rates, thanks to attractive incentives to companies that manufacture and hold patents in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer envisages combining the two drugmakers under a new UK-incorporated holding company, although the head office and stock market listing would remain in New York. But the suggested deal has triggered worries about jobs in Britain's drug sector, viewed as a key industry by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca has already laid off thousands of staff as it shrinks its cost base to cope with a fall in sales due to patent losses on blockbuster medicines, while Pfizer has shuttered a research site in Sandwich, southern England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read said Pfizer had contacted the British government about its plans on Monday, after Finance Minister George Osborne said on Friday that any deal was "a commercial matter between the companies".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters on Monday that any Pfizer takeover bid would be assessed by "independent procedures and frameworks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Guggenheim Securities are advising Pfizer, while Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Evercore Partners are working for AstraZeneca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ransdell Pierson in New York and Simon Jessop in London; editing by Mark Potter, David Holmes, Bernadette Baum and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

			Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today announced the $19 billion PNG LNG 
      project has started producing liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Papua New 
      Guinea ahead of schedule.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Production from the first LNG train will increase over the coming weeks 
      and the first cargo is expected to be shipped to Asia markets before 
      midyear.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Work on the second train is progressing and LNG production from this 
      unit is expected to start in the next several weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The project, which is operated by ExxonMobil affiliate ExxonMobil PNG 
      Limited, is expected to produce more than 9 trillion cubic feet of gas 
      over an estimated 30 years of operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The PNG LNG project exemplifies ExxonMobil&#8217;s leadership in project 
      execution, advanced technologies and marketing capabilities,&#8221; said Neil 
      W. Duffin, president of ExxonMobil Development Company. &#8220;Project revenue 
      and profitability are underpinned by long-term LNG sales contracts 
      covering more than 95 percent of the plant&#8217;s capacity.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The project is an integrated development that includes gas production 
      and processing facilities in the Southern Highlands, Hela, Western, Gulf 
      and Central provinces of Papua New Guinea. Approximately 435 miles of 
      pipeline connect the facilities, which include a gas conditioning plant 
      and liquefaction and storage facilities with capacity of 6.9 million 
      tonnes of LNG per year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Flooding, minimal pre-existing infrastructure and extremely steep slopes 
      were among obstacles that were overcome in constructing the project. 
      Pipe had to be airlifted in some areas because the soil could not 
      support heavy machinery and lack of infrastructure required construction 
      of supplemental roads, communication lines and a new airfield.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The project is optimally located to serve growing Asia markets where 
      LNG demand is expected to rise by approximately 165 percent between 2010 
      and 2025, to 370 million tonnes per year,&#8221; said Duffin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      (representing landowners) and Petromin PNG Holdings Limited.

&lt;p&gt;(Updates to close)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Pfizer works on next move in takeover bid for Astrazeneca&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Amazon.com leads Nasdaq's loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Bank of America drops after suspending dividend increase,
buyback plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dow up 0.5 pct; S 500 up 0.3 pct; Nasdaq down 0.03 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Caroline Valetkevitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - The S 500 ended higher on
Monday after a volatile session, as gains in Apple and
Pfizer helped offset another round of selling in some
high-growth tech shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq ended slightly lower but rebounded late in the
session from a fall of over 1 percent. Leading the Nasdaq down
was Amazon.com, which extended Friday's sharp decline a
day after its earnings report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flurry of merger and acquisition activity in the
pharmaceutical sector lifted shares. Shares of Pfizer Inc
 gained 4.2 percent to $32.04 after the U.S. drugmaker
was said to be working on its next move in a potential $100
billion bid to take over Britain's AstraZeneca Plc,
after two earlier bids were rejected. Pfizer's
gains helped to lift the Dow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we saw earlier was you had more rotation out of the
high-beta momentum names, and I think a lot of those tech
players rotated into Apple, which just had positive earnings and
the buyback and dividend boost," said Michael O'Rourke, chief
market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously, this whole M aspect of the pharmaceutical
healthcare industry has people positively biased for the time
being."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average rose 87.28 points or
0.53 percent, to end at 16,448.74. The S 500 gained
6.03 points or 0.32 percent, to 1,869.43. The Nasdaq Composite
 dropped 1.161 points or 0.03 percent, to 4,074.401.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's stock jumped 3.9 percent to $594.09. The stock has
gained 13.2 percent since the close on Wednesday, when Apple
reported results after the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com ended down 2.4 percent at $296.58, while Facebook
 fell 2.7 percent to close at $56.14. High-growth stocks
such as those have been battered in recent weeks as investors
have pulled out of the tech and biotech space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America shares tumbled 6.3 percent to $14.95 after
the company said it will suspend a planned increase in its
quarterly dividend as well as its latest stock-buyback program
because it miscalculated a measure of the capital on its books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three major U.S. stock indexes lost ground during the
session after Reuters, citing sources, reported that European
Central Bank President Mario Draghi sees quantitative easing as
still a ways away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese Internet stocks fell after China's government
ordered the removal of four U.S. television shows, including
"The Big Bang Theory," from video websites during the weekend.
The U.S.-listed shares of Baidu slid 7.4 percent to
$150.93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another M deal, Forest Laboratories Inc said it
would buy Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc for up to $1.46
billion, including milestone payments to add Furiex's promising
treatment for irritable bowel syndrome to Forest's portfolio of
gastrointestinal drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furiex Pharmaceuticals shares surged 28.6 percent to $103.05
while Forest Laboratories shares shed 0.4 percent to $89.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 7.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges,
above the 6.5 billion average so far this month, according to
data from BATS Global Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advancers outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange by a ratio of 8 to 7. On the Nasdaq, eight stocks fell
for every five that rose.

			&lt;p&gt;With a Few Clicks, Developers and Businesses Can Add Biometric Security to Their IBM BlueMix Applications&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO, CA--(Marketwired - Apr 28, 2014) -  ImageWare Systems, Inc. (OTCQB: IWSY) ("ImageWare" or "IWS"), a leader in mobile and cloud-based, multi-modal biometric identity management solutions, has formed a partnership with IBM that brings the power of IWS' patented, multi-modal biometrics user authentication and cloud-based identity management platform to the IBM Cloud Platform, code name: BlueMix.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;IBM BlueMix customers can now leverage ImageWare's Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), a cloud-based, multi-modal biometric identity management and user authentication platform, to easily provide user authentication solutions that meet their specific business needs. IBM clients can rapidly deploy IWS solutions when building applications in IBM BlueMix, which may include out-of-band authentication, mobile biometrics, mobile payment, desktop security, patient engagement, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;ImageWare Systems fundamentally changes the way businesses build biometric authentication by bringing it into the realm of mobile technology and the cloud. A key component is IWS' GoCloudID&#8482;, a patented cloud-based biometric IDaaS platform that manages access to biometric enrollment and verification. The IWS system, in addition to being algorithm and hardware agnostic, enables plug-n-play and can be deployed globally as an enterprise end-to-end or modular solution. GoCloudID also includes a software development kit (SDK), which enables rapid integration into existing company programs and applications.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's AstraZeneca urged its shareholders to take no action over the approach by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc on Monday and said it remained confident in its independent strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said earlier on Monday it had made a 58.8 billion pounds ($98.9 billion) bid approach to AstraZeneca in January and had contacted its British rival again on April 26 seeking further discussions about a takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this discussion, the Chairman of Pfizer did not make a specific proposal regarding an offer to acquire AstraZeneca," Astra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British company said it had considered the request for talks, but without a specific and attractive proposal, it had deemed it inappropriate to engage in discussions with Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The board remains confident in the ongoing execution of AstraZeneca's strategy as an independent company and that its successful delivery will create significant value for shareholders," it said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Kate Holton; Editing by Brenda Goh)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Recasts first paragraph, adds fund manager, analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ben Hirschler and Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON/NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer
Inc approached Britain's AstraZeneca Plc  
two days ago to reignite a potential $100 billion takeover and
was rebuffed, raising investor expectations it will have to
increase its offer to close the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said on Monday it proposed a takeover to AstraZeneca
in January worth 58.8 billion pounds ($98.9 billion), or nearly
47 pounds per share. It had contacted its British rival again on
Saturday, seeking to discuss further a takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chase was welcomed by investors in both companies, as
deal-making grips the healthcare industry. AstraZeneca shares
were up 11.7 percent at $76.69 in New York on news of the latest
offer, which would be the biggest foreign acquisition of a
British company and one of the largest pharmaceutical deals.
Pfizer shares were up 3.8 percent at $31.92 on the New York
Stock Exchange on Monday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca said Pfizer's suggested offer undervalued the
company "very significantly," adding that Pfizer wanted to pay
70 percent in shares and only 30 percent in cash. AstraZeneca
urged its shareholders to take no action and said it remained
confident of its independent strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel pretty confident of a higher bid coming," said Neil
Veitch, global and UK investment director at SVM Asset
Management, which owns AstraZeneca shares. "I think it's more
likely than not that we'll see an agreed deal somewhere in that
52 to 53 pound range."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying AstraZeneca would boost Pfizer's pipeline of cancer
drugs and create significant cost and tax savings. Under British
takeover rules, Pfizer has until May 26 to announce a firm
intention to make an offer or back away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The renewed approach comes amid a wave of mergers and
acquisitions in the sector, pushing the value of deals to $153
billion so far this year, as the industry restructures amid
healthcare spending cuts and competition from cheap generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Society wants products faster, they want more products and
they want value," Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read told
reporters. "Industry is responding to society's request for
increased efficiencies and productivity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read said AstraZeneca had declined to engage in talks and
the U.S. group was now considering how to proceed, but he
remained convinced that combining the two companies made
strategic sense and would benefit AstraZeneca investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW DRUG PIPELINES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's original proposal, made to the board of AstraZeneca
on Jan. 5, would have valued AstraZeneca shares at 46.61 pounds
each - a premium of around 30 percent at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca said the proposal comprised 13.98 pounds in cash
and 1.758 Pfizer shares for each AstraZeneca share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My guess is it will go for somewhere between 50 and 55
(pounds a share)," said Dan Mahony, a fund manager at Polar
Capital, who raised his stake in AstraZeneca in February last
year. "I doubt Pfizer will want to go completely hostile."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of Pfizer's past deals have been conducted on a
friendly basis, including its 2009 purchase of Wyeth for $68
billion. But it has been willing to play hardball if needed, as
it did in 2000 with its $90 billion purchase of U.S. rival
Warner-Lambert, with which it won full ownership of cholesterol
fighter Lipitor, the best-selling drug of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read told U.S. analysts that since the initial approach to
AstraZeneca, both companies had seen experimental drugs fare
well in trials. At the same time, Pfizer concluded it was too
difficult to pursue big deals domestically while being on the
hook for higher U.S. tax rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're coming from a position of strength, on our near-term
pipeline" of experimental drugs, Read said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent favorable data includes results for Pfizer's
experimental breast cancer medicine palbociclib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INDEPENDENT FUTURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's declaration turns up the heat under AstraZeneca
Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, who has been in the job since
October 2012 and who made clear last week he saw an independent
future for the group, flagging spin-offs of two noncore units as
one option to create more value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soriot has been credited with reviving AstraZeneca's
previously thin pipeline of new drugs, badly needed to offset a
wave of patent expiries on older drugs, and shares in the group
have now risen more than 60 percent under his tenure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, his overhaul - including an ambitious plan to move
the company's research and corporate headquarters to Cambridge,
England - is still a work in progress and he has also come under
fire from some shareholders over executive pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read said it was premature to say who would lead a combined
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying AstraZeneca would give Pfizer a number of promising -
though still risky - experimental cancer medicines known as
immunotherapies that boost the body's immune system to fight
tumors. It could also generate significant cost savings for the
U.S. group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquiring a foreign company also makes sense for Pfizer as
it has tens of billions of dollars accumulated through foreign
subsidiaries, which, if repatriated, would be heavily taxed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker has more recently been divesting certain
operations, while mega-mergers had fallen out of fashion in the
pharmaceuticals industry following scepticism about how well
some of them have worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEFTY RETURN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But CEO Read said large deals could also make good sense and
buying AstraZeneca would "maintain the flexibility for the
potential future separation of our businesses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transaction would complement both Pfizer's innovative
drug businesses and also its established products business -
comprising older and off-patent medicines - which many analysts
expect to be eventually spun off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to using offshore cash, buying AstraZeneca would
be tax-efficient since Pfizer could redomicile to Britain and
enjoy lower tax rates, thanks to attractive incentives to
companies that manufacture and hold patents in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer envisages combining the two drugmakers under a new
UK-incorporated holding company, although the head office and
stock market listing would remain in New York. But the suggested
deal has triggered worries about jobs in Britain's drug sector,
viewed as a key industry by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca has already laid off thousands of staff as it
shrinks its cost base to cope with a fall in sales due to patent
losses on blockbuster medicines, while Pfizer has shuttered a
research site in Sandwich, southern England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read said Pfizer had contacted the British government about
its plans on Monday, after Finance Minister George Osborne said
on Friday that any deal was "a commercial matter between the
companies".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters
on Monday that any Pfizer takeover bid would be assessed by
"independent procedures and frameworks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Guggenheim
Securities are advising Pfizer, while Goldman Sachs, Morgan
Stanley and Evercore Partners are working for AstraZeneca.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates Coca-Cola Enterprise's EUR250MM Issuance 'BBB+'; Outlook 
      Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to Coca-Cola Enterprises, 
      Inc.'s (CCE) 12-year 2.75% EUR250 million senior notes. The Rating 
      Outlook is Stable. CCE expects to use the net proceeds for general 
      corporate purposes, which may include refinancing of commercial paper, 
      share repurchases and the repayment of indebtedness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The notes are issued by CCE and will rank equally with the company's 
      existing senior unsecured obligations. Significant covenants include 
      limitations on secured debt including a carve-out that allows for 
      secured debt that does not exceed 15% of CCE's consolidated net tangible 
      assets. CCE is not bound by any financial covenants. The notes are 
      callable by CCE subject to a make-whole provision.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE's ratings reflect its stable cash flows, strong market position, and 
      exclusive right to manufacture, sell and distribute Coca-Cola brand 
      beverages in Western Europe. Coca-Cola products have leading market 
      share that allows for premium pricing of the Coca-Cola brands within 
      CCE's non-alcoholic ready-to-drink portfolio for each of its 
      territories. In the LTM period ended March 28, 2014, CCE generated 
      approximately $8.2 billion of net sales with almost 65% coming from its 
      largest two markets, Great Britain and France.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings incorporate CCE's financial leverage, which is currently at 
      the top end of Fitch's expectation for the rating category, and the 
      firm's good free cash flow (FCF) generation. Fitch views the low- to 
      mid-end of CCE's net leverage target of 2.5x to 3.0x as appropriate for 
      the 'BBB+' rating. CCE is managing through the lackluster economic 
      environment in Western Europe which has been characterized by lower 
      consumer spending, higher unemployment and the negative effects of 
      austerity programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first quarter ended March 28, 2014, net sales decreased 2.5% 
      on a currency-neutral basis to $1.9 billion. Volumes, which decreased 
      1.5% during the first quarter driven by the competitive environment and 
      negative impact of a key operating strategy change in Great Britain, are 
      expected to improve during the remainder of the year reflecting better 
      weather and the successful execution of summer marketing programs. For 
      the full year, CCE expects volume will be up modestly which Fitch 
      believes is reasonable. Cost of sales per case was flat in the first 
      quarter and net pricing per case rose 1.0% after adjusting for currency 
      rate changes. CCE's long-term pricing target is 2%- 3% and the company 
      expects pricing to cover cost of goods sold increases in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liquidity
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At March 28, 2014, CCE had good liquidity of $1.3 billion including $286 
      million of cash and full availability under the firm's $1 billion 
      multi-currency credit facility expiring in September 2017. Free cash 
      flow (FCF) for the LTM period ended March 28, 2014 was $352 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch views CCE's 2014 guidance of low single-digit sales growth, 
      mid-single-digit operating income growth, and FCF (before dividend) of 
      $650 million as achievable. CCE has operated below its long-term targets 
      of 4%-6% sales growth and 6%-8% operating income growth for the past 
      several years. FCF, which Fitch defines as cash flow from operations 
      less capital expenditures and dividends, has averaged $338 million for 
      the past three years. CCE's FCF for 2013 of $307 million was moderately 
      below historical levels due to a $117 million cash restructuring charge 
      in 2013. Fitch expects FCF to be approximately $400 million in 2014 with 
      cash restructuring costs being materially lower.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE has aggressively increased the dividend the past four years from 
      $0.12 to $1.00, with the latest increase of 25% per share for 2014. 
      Consequently, Fitch expects annual dividend payments approaching $250 
      million for the year translating to an approximate 40% dividend payout 
      ratio. This compares to a payout of approximately 33% in 2012. Capital 
      expenditures are expected at $350 million during 2014, a moderate 
      increase from the $313 million spent in 2013. CCE also has aggressively 
      repurchased an average of $858 million shares annually during the last 
      three years. The company plans to repurchase $800 million of shares for 
      2014 with $289 million shares repurchased during the first quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Credit Metrics
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE's credit metrics are in line with Fitch's expectations, but as 
      mentioned previously, are at the high end, resulting in limited room in 
      the rating. At March 28, 2014, total debt-to-operating EBITDA was 3.0x 
      and operating EBITDA-to-gross interest expense in excess of 13x. Fitch 
      currently expects total debt-to-operating EBITDA to remain in the high 
      2x range for 2014. This translates to the midpoint of CCE's 2.5x - 3.0x 
      net leverage target. Longer-term Fitch expects CCE will sustain and 
      manage within the midpoint of its net leverage targets. Sustained gross 
      leverage of approximately 3.0x or less is acceptable for the current 
      ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Increased share repurchases and dividends have caused net leverage to 
      increase materially from historical levels of less than 2.0x. Higher 
      long-term leverage is a concern as Fitch anticipates that acquisitions 
      could occur, but in the near term are not likely. Ratings would be 
      pressured in the event of a large debt-financed transaction as leverage 
      (total debt-to-EBITDA) would increase above 3x.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes CCE greatly values its current 'BBB+' and 'F2' long-term 
      and short-term ratings. Therefore, in the case of a large debt-financed 
      acquisition, expectations are that CCE would use FCF to quickly reduce 
      leverage back to its targeted range in a 12-to-18-month timeframe. In 
      addition, Fitch expects CCE would limit share buybacks if leverage 
      increased as a result of an acquisition and/or if any material 
      deterioration in future operating performance occurred.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At March 28, 2014, CCE had no material long-term debt maturing over the 
      next 12 months and had issued $402 million in commercial paper. Material 
      maturities in 2015 and 2016 include $475 million of 2.125% notes and 
      $250 million of 2% notes. A material portion of CCE's debt obligations 
      remain dollar-denominated. However, with this Euro-based offering, Fitch 
      expects the company will continue to narrow the currency mismatch 
      between the firm's debt balances and its cash flow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
CHICAGO, April 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+'
rating to 
Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.'s (CCE) 12-year 2.75% EUR250 million
senior notes. 
The Rating Outlook is Stable. CCE expects to use the net
proceeds for general 
corporate purposes, which may include refinancing of commercial
paper, share 
repurchases and the repayment of indebtedness. 
The notes are issued by CCE and will rank equally with the
company's existing 
senior unsecured obligations. Significant covenants include
limitations on 
secured debt including a carve-out that allows for secured debt
that does not 
exceed 15% of CCE's consolidated net tangible assets. CCE is not
bound by any 
financial covenants. The notes are callable by CCE subject to a
make-whole 
provision. 
KEY RATING DRIVERS 
CCE's ratings reflect its stable cash flows, strong market
position, and 
exclusive right to manufacture, sell and distribute Coca-Cola
brand beverages in 
Western Europe. Coca-Cola products have leading market share
that allows for 
premium pricing of the Coca-Cola brands within CCE's
non-alcoholic 
ready-to-drink portfolio for each of its territories. In the LTM
period ended 
March 28, 2014, CCE generated approximately $8.2 billion of net
sales with 
almost 65% coming from its largest two markets, Great Britain
and France. 
The ratings incorporate CCE's financial leverage, which is
currently at the top 
end of Fitch's expectation for the rating category, and the
firm's good free 
cash flow (FCF) generation. Fitch views the low- to mid-end of
CCE's net 
leverage target of 2.5x  to 3.0x as appropriate for the 'BBB+'
rating. CCE is 
managing through the lackluster economic environment in Western
Europe which has 
been characterized by lower consumer spending, higher
unemployment and the 
negative effects of austerity programs. 
During the first quarter ended March 28, 2014, net sales
decreased 2.5% on a 
currency-neutral basis to $1.9 billion. Volumes, which decreased
1.5% during the 
first quarter driven by the competitive environment and negative
impact of a key 
operating strategy change in Great Britain, are expected to
improve during the 
remainder of the year reflecting better weather and the
successful execution of 
summer marketing programs. For the full year, CCE expects volume
will be up 
modestly which Fitch believes is reasonable. Cost of sales per
case was flat in 
the first quarter and net pricing per case rose 1.0% after
adjusting for 
currency rate changes. CCE's long-term pricing target is 2%- 3%
and the company 
expects pricing to cover cost of goods sold increases in 2014. 
Liquidity 
At March 28, 2014, CCE had good liquidity of $1.3 billion
including $286 million 
of cash and full availability under the firm's $1 billion
multi-currency credit 
facility expiring in September 2017. Free cash flow (FCF) for
the LTM period 
ended March 28, 2014 was $352 million. 
Fitch views CCE's 2014 guidance of low single-digit sales
growth, 
mid-single-digit operating income growth, and FCF (before
dividend) of $650 
million as achievable. CCE has operated below its long-term
targets of 4%-6% 
sales growth and 6%-8% operating income growth for the past
several years. FCF, 
which Fitch defines as cash flow from operations less capital
expenditures and 
dividends, has averaged $338 million for the past three years.
CCE's FCF for 
2013 of $307 million was moderately below historical levels due
to a $117 
million cash restructuring charge in 2013. Fitch expects FCF to
be approximately 
$400 million in 2014 with cash restructuring costs being
materially lower.
CCE has aggressively increased the dividend the past four years
from $0.12 to 
$1.00, with the latest increase of 25% per share for 2014.
Consequently, Fitch 
expects annual dividend payments approaching $250 million for
the year 
translating to an approximate 40% dividend payout ratio. This
compares to a 
payout of approximately 33% in 2012. Capital expenditures are
expected at $350 
million during 2014, a moderate increase from the $313 million
spent in 2013.  
CCE also has aggressively repurchased an average of $858 million
shares annually 
during the last three years. The company  plans to repurchase
$800 million of 
shares for 2014 with $289 million shares repurchased during the
first quarter.
Credit Metrics 
CCE's credit metrics are in line with Fitch's expectations, but
as mentioned 
previously, are at the high end, resulting in limited room in
the rating. At 
March 28, 2014, total debt-to-operating EBITDA was 3.0x and
operating 
EBITDA-to-gross interest expense in excess of 13x. Fitch
currently expects total 
debt-to-operating EBITDA to remain in the high 2x range for
2014. This 
translates to the midpoint of CCE's 2.5x - 3.0x net leverage
target. Longer-term 
Fitch expects CCE will sustain and manage within the midpoint of
its net 
leverage targets. Sustained gross leverage of approximately 3.0x
or less is 
acceptable for the current ratings. 
Increased share repurchases and dividends have caused net
leverage to increase 
materially from historical levels of less than 2.0x. Higher
long-term leverage 
is a concern as Fitch anticipates that acquisitions could occur,
but in the near 
term are not likely. Ratings would be pressured in the event of
a large 
debt-financed transaction as leverage (total debt-to-EBITDA)
would increase 
above 3x. 
Fitch believes CCE greatly values its current 'BBB+' and 'F2'
long-term and 
short-term ratings. Therefore, in the case of a large
debt-financed acquisition, 
expectations are that CCE would use FCF to quickly reduce
leverage back to its 
targeted range in a 12-to-18-month timeframe. In addition, Fitch
expects CCE 
would limit share buybacks if leverage increased as a result of
an acquisition 
and/or if any material deterioration in future operating
performance occurred. 
At March 28, 2014, CCE had no material long-term debt maturing
over the next 12 
months and had issued $402 million in commercial paper. Material
maturities in 
2015 and 2016 include $475 million of 2.125% notes and $250
million of 2% notes. 
A material portion of CCE's debt obligations remain
dollar-denominated. However, 
with this Euro-based offering, Fitch expects the company will
continue to narrow 
the currency mismatch between the firm's debt balances and its
cash flow. 
RATING SENSITIVITIES 
Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead
to a positive 
rating action include: 
--Gross debt-to-operating EBITDA consistently below 2.3x or net
leverage below 
management's targeted range of 2.5x to 3.0x due to operating
income growth and 
continued strong FCF generation that results in debt reduction;
--Significant additional geographic diversification concurrent
with lower 
leverage and/or an equity stake and board representation by The
Coca-Cola 
Company. 
Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead
to a negative 
rating action include: 
--Gross debt-to-operating EBITDA sustained above 3.0x;
--Persistent declines in volumes concurrent with material margin
compression and 
significantly lower FCF that could be driven by additional
material dividend 
increases, the mature economies, increased excise taxes and/or
obesity concerns;
--Continued debt-financed share repurchases concurrent with
materially weaker 
volumes and margin contraction;
--Material debt-financed acquisitions, given declining room in
current ratings.

&lt;p&gt;By Neil Unmack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will need to pile on more pressure if it wants to buy AstraZeneca. The U.S. pharma group has confirmed that it made a $99 billion cash-and-stock approach for its UK peer in January, and is now renewing its suit. Astra Chief Executive Pascal Soriot may ultimately struggle to resist a takeover, but he ought to be able to extract a better proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value being mooted by Pfizer looks ungenerous. Its initial approach was at 4,661 pence per share, denominated 70 percent in Pfizer stock with the remainder in cash. The premium equated to 30 percent over Astra&#8217;s market value in January  low for a major company in recovery mode. The savings from a combination would comfortably exceed the $22 billion premium then being offered  synergies in Pfizer&#8217;s purchase of Pharmacia a decade ago would be worth as much as $50 billion. Astra shareholders would also baulk at receiving shares in a company whose performance, and MA record, is mixed at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed deal&#8217;s tax structuring is another weakness. This would require U.S. authorities to let Pfizer stay largely American, but shift its tax base across the Atlantic. This would be controversial. Every percentage point lower tax rate will add $200 million to Pfizer&#8217;s net income, Barclays estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astra has predictably already cited these issues in rebutting Pfizer. But as rejections go, the language is temperate. What&#8217;s more, Astra&#8217;s hand is somewhat weakened by the revelation it had fleeting discussions about a deal. Merger arbitrageurs will be switching into Astra stock ready to flip it to Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having gone public, Pfizer will want to see this through. It could come back with more value and more cash, provided it can keep within U.S. tax rules for inversions, which require 20 percent foreign ownership. Soriot could do with a white knight bidder. But, like Cadbury when it faced unsolicited interest from Kraft in 2009, that doesn&#8217;t look easy. Potential candidates for tie-ups include Sanofi, Amgen or Merck, although few may be willing to match Pfizer&#8217;s aggressive tax structuring, or take the punt on Astra&#8217;s restructuring with just a month before Pfizer&#8217;s likely bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer says the next bid will be based on Astra&#8217;s price on April 17. Applying a 30 percent premium to that would imply an offer of 49 pounds per share. Citigroup argues that is only in line with Astra&#8217;s fair value, while Barclays estimates that tax benefits and synergies could justify Pfizer increasing its offer as high as 56 pounds. If Soriot cannot make Pfizer go away, he can make it pay.&lt;/p&gt;

merger and acquisition activity in the pharmaceutical sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceuticals outperformed other sectors after U.S.
drugmaker Pfizer Inc was said to be working on its next
move in a potential $100 billion bid to take over Britain's
AstraZeneca Plc, after two earlier bids were rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer was the biggest gainer on the Dow Jones industrial
average, up 3.9 percent at $31.94.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Forest Laboratories Inc said it would
buy Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc for up to $1.46 billion,
including milestone payments to access Furiex's promising
treatment for irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furiex Pharmaceuticals shares jumped 30 percent to $104.12
while Forest Laboratories shares were up 0.4 percent at $90.27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding optimism about the economy, data showed contracts to
buy previously owned U.S. homes rose in March for the first time
in nine months, in the latest sign that the housing market was
stabilizing after a recent wobble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly investors are shifting focus to the rich economic
calendar we have this week and other events like the FOMC
meeting and away from geopolitical concerns," said Peter
Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in
New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday announced new
sanctions against some Russians to stop President Vladimir Putin
from fomenting a rebellion in eastern Ukraine, but said he was
holding broader measures against Russia's economy "in reserve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average rose 110.08 points,
or 0.67 percent, to 16,471.54, the S 500 gained 8.48
points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,871.88 and the Nasdaq Composite
 added 12.654 points, or 0.31 percent, to 4,088.215.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the benchmark S index, financial stocks were among the
worst performers, with the sector down 0.2 percent. Bank
of America shares were down 4.6 percent at $15.22 while Goldman
Sachs fell 0.9 percent to $156.81.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp said it would suspend a $4
billion stock buyback program and a planned increase in its
quarterly dividend after it miscalculated the treatment of
certain structured notes related to its acquisition of Merrill
Lynch in 2009. The company also said it would resubmit its 2014
capital plan to the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Nasdaq, Amazon.com Inc was one of the
biggest losers, extending Friday's sharp decline following its
earnings statement. The stock was off 2.2 percent at $296.90.
Netflix Inc was down 2.5 percent at $313.98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp offered to sell 1.4 million pay TV
subscribers to Charter Communications Inc for $7.3
billion as part of a transaction aimed at winning regulatory
approval for its proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner
Cable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter Communications shares rose 7.3 percent to $139.56
after the company also reported a 15 percent jump in
first-quarter revenue.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Pfizer's plan to snap up its smaller rival AstraZeneca has stoked concerns about Britain's ability to remain a leader in life sciences, even as the U.S. drugmaker insists that it highly values UK research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds further reaction from scientists, politicians)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ben Hirschler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - Pfizer's plan to snap
up its smaller rival AstraZeneca has stoked concerns
about Britain's ability to remain a leader in life sciences,
even as the U.S. drugmaker insists that it highly values UK
research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical industry represents a rare manufacturing
success story for Britain and its two flagship drugmakers -
AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline - provide thousands of
highly skilled, well-paid jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca alone employs some 7,000 staff in Britain, even
after recent hefty job cuts, and it exports almost 7 billion
pounds ($11.8 billion) of drugs each year, representing around
2.3 percent of all British exports of goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AstraZeneca and GSK are the two pillars of the UK's

bring an injection of about $100 billion into the UK economy,"
Read said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read said he saw Britain as an attractive location for both
pharmaceutical research and manufacturing - helped by recent
government tax incentives - but added he could not make any firm
commitments on future investment or jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOB CUTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous controversial British company takeover in
2010, U.S.-based foods group Kraft promised to keep
open one of its target Cadbury's factories, only to go back on
the pledge soon after the deal was completed - drawing criticism
for acting irresponsibly from one group of legislators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer already has a tarnished reputation in the eyes of
some British scientists after it announced plans in 2011 to
shutter a large drug research site in Sandwich, southern
England, with the loss of around 2,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca has also laid off thousands of scientists and

Pfizer should be judged on whether it promoted jobs and growth,
Britain's research base, and guaranteed long-term investment in
Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unite, Britain's biggest labour union, called for guarantees
of no job losses and for the protection of the UK's research and
 base in the event that Pfizer succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect the UK government to pay special attention to
this bid and do everything possible to protect jobs and to
support the UK's knowledge base," said Unite National Officer

&lt;p&gt;April 28 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc:

particlarly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enhance pfizer's oncology, immunology, inflammation,
diabetes, cardiology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;programs
 * Pfizer CEO says merger would boost Pfizer earnings the first

 * Pfizer CEO says EPS growth would accelerate in subsequent
years
 * Pfizer CEO says company will be "disciplined" in regard to
price it would pay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;for Astrazeneca
 * Pfizer CFO reaffirms that potential breakup of pfizer's three
main existing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;businesses would not be possible until 2017
 * Pfizer CFO says 70 to 90 percent of its cash is usually
located outside U.S.;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;some would be used to purchase Astrazeneca
 * Pfizer CEO says merger with astrzeneca would "exactly" fit
pfizer's recent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;strategy

&lt;p&gt;April 28 (Reuters) - JPMorgan, one of two large
clearing banks in the tri-party repurchase agreement market,
said on Monday that it had met targets to reduce risks of

		&lt;h1&gt;Swiftpage Advances Strategy for "Your CRM Inside" With Debut of New Saleslogix Xbar for Microsoft Outlook&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Unique Solution Embeds the Functionality and Benefits of Saleslogix Inside the Enterprise E-Mail Client Millions of Users* Already Know and Work With Every Day&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;DENVER, CO--(Marketwired - Apr 28, 2014) - &#160;Swiftpage, a leading provider of integrated marketing and CRM solutions for individuals, growing businesses and mobile sales teams, today unveiled a new add-in to its Saleslogix CRM solution that seamlessly embeds the functionality of Saleslogix into Microsoft&#174; Outlook&#174; 2010 or newer versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Titled the Saleslogix Xbar, the add-in enables users to access their most important Saleslogix information and functionality through an intuitive, context-aware window that is "docked" within the Outlook interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a contact is accessed in Outlook&#174; through opening e-mail correspondence or calendar activities, the Xbar instantly displays key information, activities and opportunities for that contact stored in Saleslogix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wide range of information and activities can be accessed, including interaction history, follow-up action items, leads generated from e-marketing campaigns, opportunity management, and more. Users can freely work with and modify the Saleslogix information, taking actions and updating the information as necessary, all from within Outlook and without ever losing sight of their inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can also quickly create entirely new contacts, accounts and opportunities through the Xbar. This can often be done quickly and conveniently by dragging and dropping existing information from e-mails into the Xbar interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact, calendar and interaction history changes made in Xbar automatically update within Saleslogix in real-time, ensuring other team members can immediately see and access the updated information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your CRM Inside
				The Saleslogix Xbar is the next major milestone in an overarching product and business strategy Swiftpage has titled "Your CRM Inside." The strategy is designed to help customers maximize employee adoption and usage of CRM in their daily work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a major part of this strategy, Swiftpage has continued developing a unique data interchange standard coupled with an adaptive architecture for Saleslogix.&#160;Combined, these enable third-party applications and devices to more efficiently exchange information with the solution, making it easier to embed Saleslogix functionality into other platforms.&#160;As with the Xbar for Outlook&#174;, this allows users to gain all the benefits of Saleslogix, but accessed and managed within the applications and devices users already know and prefer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The trend we're seeing in the market right now is that although many companies have implemented competing CRM solutions, actual adoption and usage among employees often remains low.&#160;We've made it a top priority to help companies solve this challenge, and the 'Your CRM Inside' strategy is one key piece to making that happen," said Lorcan Malone, general manager and senior vice president for Saleslogix.&#160;"With 'Your CRM Inside,' our goal is to give users all the benefits of Saleslogix, but with minimal complexity, maximum flexibility, and a far lower learning curve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Availability, Pricing and Webcast Demonstration
				The Saleslogix Xbar for Outlook will be available to customers as a pre-release beta in May.&#160;General availability will be in June. It will be offered as a complimentary new feature add-in for all North American users of Saleslogix 8.0 and 8.1, including both cloud-based and on-premises deployments, and those who are active support subscribers.&#160;International versions are planned for release in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiftpage will host an online webinar to officially unveil and fully demonstrate the Saleslogix Xbar on May 19, 2014. All are welcome to sign up for the webcast now at CRMThreads.com.&#160;Existing Saleslogix customers are encouraged to contact their respective Saleslogix Business Partner for more information on installing and using the Xbar within their current configuration, or inquire about upgrading to the version 8 platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Information&lt;/p&gt;

			J.P. Morgan Materially Reduces Intraday Credit Exposure to Achieve 
      Tri-Party Repo Market Reforms
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Changes to Meet Target End State of Reforms Make System Safer and 
      More Efficient
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan today announced that it has achieved the reduction of 
      Tri-Party credit set forth in the target end state of U.S. Tri-Party 
      Repo Market Reforms. J.P. Morgan is the first clearing bank to 
      successfully eliminate the unwind as part of the reforms proposed by a 
      New York Fed-sponsored, industry-wide working group, which focused on 
      reducing systemic risk and improving operational efficiency for market 
      participants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In November 2013, J.P. Morgan introduced three final interlinked 
      initiatives: rolling settlement, simultaneous exchange of cash and 
      collateral, and the creation of a new secured committed clearance 
      advance facility. As of today, J.P. Morgan has successfully transitioned 
      all clients to the new model.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Together with our clients, we&#8217;ve completed a multi-year journey that 
      delivers greater transparency, removes uncapped intraday credit, 
      introduces a capped committed credit facility, and gives dealers and 
      their lenders innovative tools that increase their operational 
      efficiency,&#8221; notes Michael Albanese, head of U.S. tri-party repo 
      clearing and collateral management at J.P. Morgan. &#8220;Step by step, every 
      new piece of functionality introduced over the last four years has 
      allowed us to reduce materially the systemic risk previously created by 
      overreliance on clearing bank credit.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mark Trivedi, J.P. Morgan&#8217;s head of collateral management product and a 
      member of the tri-party working group sponsored by the New York Federal 
      Reserve Bank, said: &#8220;From the beginning, the working group&#8217;s first and 
      most significant recommendation was to achieve the practical elimination 
      of intraday credit. With that now achieved, J.P. Morgan will continue to 
      invest in its tri-party repo platform as part of our complete collateral 
      portfolio solutions. One of our key priorities is to continue working 
      closely with market partners on the final steps of further credit 
      reduction for General Collateral Finance repo.&#8221;

		&lt;h1&gt;SoftWatch Launches Unique Analytics Application Providing Real Usage Analysis for Effective Transitioning From Microsoft Office to Google Apps&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;SoftWatch Releases Benchmark Study Showing Microsoft Usage Is Typically 80% Light Users and Most Enterprises Could Save Substantially on Microsoft Licenses by Transitioning to Google Apps&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;TEL AVIV, ISRAEL--(Marketwired - Apr 28, 2014) -  Called one of the biggest IT trends for enterprise software in 2014, the transition to cloud-based solutions from on-premise applications requires sophisticated management tools and methodologies.&#160;Now, with the launch of the analytic application SoftWatch, for the first time CXOs and IT executives can obtain actual usage data on the omnipresent Microsoft Office so they can determine the benefits and ROI for transitioning to Google Apps. SoftWatch is the only solution to provide this accurate data on company-wide Microsoft Office usage patterns, enabling enterprises to make informed decisions about moving to Google Apps and provide management tools for a smooth transition and decommissioning of excessive Microsoft licenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also today, SoftWatch is releasing its benchmark study which analyzes real usage of Microsoft (MS) Office in dozens of enterprises comprising over 150,000 total users.&#160;The benchmark shows that on average an employee only spends 48 minutes a day on MS Office applications, most of it on Outlook for email. It also reveals high numbers of inactive users in the organizations; in particular PowerPoint was not being used at all by half of the employees. In addition, most of the users of the other applications used them primarily for viewing and light editing purposes, with only a small number of heavy users: 2% in PowerPoint, 9% in Word and 19% in Excel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results are in line with what industry analysts have stated that companies overspend on licenses that are not being used.&#160;According to SoftWatch estimates, by transitioning light users from MS Office to Google Apps, companies can save up to 90% on their Microsoft licensing fees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A SaaS-based solution, SoftWatch helps enterprises manage and optimize their business applications usage as they embark on a move to a cloud environment.&#160;Its patent-pending technology detects to what extent employees are actually using MS Office applications -- not just who has opened an app, and provides user segmentation to light and heavy users for both on premise and web-based apps.&#160;Data is displayed in a dashboard, making it easy to determine what an enterprise really needs in terms of MS licenses, how to effectively transition to Google Apps, and how much money can be saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By uncovering the fact that MS Office applications are actually used much less than had been thought, SoftWatch removes the fear and doubt that traps decision makers when it comes to transitioning from Microsoft to Google Apps.&#160;For the first time they will have real data enabling them to make intelligent decisions about transitioning to Google Apps, enjoy the benefits of an alternative cloud-based solution and significantly cut their software license spending," said Uri Arad, co-CEO, SoftWatch.&#160;"The analytics provided by SoftWatch are a real game-changer in the competition between Google and Microsoft over enterprise office and collaboration tools." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoftWatch is already teaming with a number of premier Google Apps resellers worldwide including Onix (www.onixnet.com),&#160;gPartner (www.gpartner.eu), Infoanalitica (www.infoanalitica.com) and Ancoris (www.ancoris.com). The company expects to engage with most major Google Apps resellers in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In addition to helping enterprises navigate a transition from Microsoft Office to Google Apps, SoftWatch can help enterprises optimize additional applications as well as cloud based services such as SalesForce.com, Google Apps and more. This will enable enterprises to reduce IT costs and maximize their investments in software applications," said&#160;Moshe Kozlovski, co-CEO, SoftWatch. "We strongly believe that when transforming IT to a hybrid cloud environment, usage information is mandatory to effectively manage and optimize this complex evolving environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About SoftWatch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoftWatch is a leader in Application Usage analytics. With its SaaS solution, it enables enterprises to effectively manage the transition of business applications to the cloud, optimize their hybrid cloud environment and reduce software spending. The Israel-based company has patents pending for its software usage and user segmentation solutions. For more information, visit www.softwatch.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - Pfizer Chief Executive
Ian Read said the U.S. drugmaker had contacted the British
government on Monday about its desire to acquire AstraZeneca
 in a potential $100 billion deal to create a new drugs
giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We reached out to the UK government this morning. We've
have some initial preliminary discussions," Read told reporters
in a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to have a conversation with the government about
the excitement we have about combining these portfolios, the
excitement we have about the strength of UK research," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This combination, if it occurs, would create domiciled in
the UK the largest pharmaceutical company in the world and would
bring an injection of about $100 billion into the UK economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suggested deal has triggered worries about jobs in
Britain's drug sector, viewed by the government as a key
industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read said he saw Britain as an attractive location for
pharmaceutical research and manufacturing - helped by recent
government tax incentives - but added he could not make any firm
commitments on future investment or jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's finance minister George Osborne has indicated a
hands-off approach to any deal between the two drugmakers, which
he described on Friday as "a commercial matter between the
companies".

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Technology powerhouses like Microsoft Corp and AOL Inc are flexing their muscles as storytellers, parading TV network-style shows before advertisers at an annual digital content showcase in New York next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an eye on the big bucks such shows can command, Microsoft will trot out a soccer reality show called "Every Street United." Sony Corp's digital network Crackle will serve up Jerry Seinfeld's "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee" and AOL is presenting a documentary drama about five New Yorkers called "Connected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a big shift from the short Web episodes many tech companies have presented for the last two years at the week-long "NewFronts" event - modeled after the annual "upfronts" where broadcast and cable TV channels show their wares to Madison Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Inc is also looking for longer original programming it can unveil at the showcase, three people familiar with those efforts said on condition on of anonymity because the deals have yet to be finalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer said on Yahoo's earnings call last week that the company plans to make fewer, more focused investments in original content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are going to see more original content overall and no doubt everyone is working to package their offerings like TV because they have their eyes on TV dollars," said Kris Magel, chief investment officer at Initiative, the media buying division of Interpublic Group of Cos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But TV-scaled ad spending is unlikely to flow to online video commercials that usually run before and during a program, advertisers and analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Online video just doesn't offer nearly the reach that broadcast does," said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AOL has spent about half a billion dollars over the last three years on shorter content. On Wednesday, it also inked a deal with Miramax to stream the independent studio's films on the AOL network for free, but with ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Internet companies are bucketed into the snackable short form space," Ran Harnevo, president of AOL Video, said. "But we are seeing the growth in the consumption of content on big screens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the NewFronts, which starts on April 28, Microsoft will show longer original shows produced by the company's Xbox Entertainment Studios that exploit the Internet's strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The challenge TV has is it's not very effective in being able to reach a very discrete target audience and measure it and have more interactive components," said Scott Ferris, general manager of TV and video advertising for Microsoft. "We have very engaged, high-quality audiences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online series can get messages in front of people who watch little TV, said Peter Naylor, senior vice president of sales for Hulu.com. The website, owned by Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp and 21st Century Fox, will also pitch shows to advertisers next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a segment of the video universe that is very, very hard to reach through traditional television," Naylor said. "Online video is a way to reach those light TV viewers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because online viewers have to search for content, advertisers may end up paying more to reach them than on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost per thousand (CPM) for a commercial on a cable network, for example, might be between $10 to $30, depending on the show and the demographic, estimates Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. For online video, a CPM for a comparable demographic could be in the range of $20 to $40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of aspiration in the NewFronts initiatives," said Wieser. "The reality is traditional TV budgets are intended for content vehicles that are TV-like. (Content) with short term, low budgets with unknown or even known talent is unlikely to capture anything resembling a meaningful TV budget."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hurdle is that the money that presenters make from the NewFronts is not tracked by the Interactive Advertising Bureau which hosts the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ari Bluman, chief digital investment officer of GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP, notes the TV industry's annual showcase for advertisers exists because they can only buy so many commercial spots on TV, whereas this is not an issue online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it may take some time before online shows become mainstream enough to draw big ad dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, the NewFronts "is more of a showcase for what's new and exciting," Bluman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Ronald Grover and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2014 recipients come from India, Indonesia, Peru, Russia, South 
      Africa and USA
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Prize recognizes grassroots environmental achievements stopping

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Goldman Environmental Foundation today announced the six recipients 
      of the 2014 Goldman Environmental Prize, a group of fearless leaders 
      working against all odds to protect the environment and their 
      communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Currently celebrating its 25th anniversary year, the Goldman 
      Prize is awarded annually to environmental heroes from each of the 
      world&#8217;s six inhabited continental regions. With an individual cash prize 
      of $175,000, it is the largest award for grassroots environmental 
      activism. The Prize amount reflects an increase from previous years&#8217; 
      $150,000, and brings the annual total to more than $1 million. Over 25 
      years, the Goldman Prize has awarded nearly $18 million to 163 winners 
      in 82 countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For the past 25 years, the Goldman Environmental Prize has honored 
      heroic grassroots environmentalists for their achievements around the 
      world and this year is no exception,&#8221; said David Gordon, executive 
      director, Goldman Environmental Prize. &#8220;From fracking to palm oil 
      development, the 2014 Goldman Prize recipients are not only tackling 
      some of the world&#8217;s most pressing environmental problems; they are also 
      achieving impressive environmental victories and inspiring others to do 
      the same.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The winners will be awarded the Prize at an invitation-only ceremony on 
      Monday, April 28 at 5:30 p.m. at the San Francisco Opera House. The 
      event will be streamed live online on the Goldman Prize&#8217;s YouTube 
      channel (www.youtube.com/goldmanprize). 
      A ceremony at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center 
      in Washington, D.C. will follow on Wednesday, April 30 at 7:30 p.m.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer 
confirmed on Monday it made a bid approach to AstraZeneca
 in January and had contacted its British rival again on
April 26 seeking to renew discussions about a takeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pfizer bid for AstraZeneca would be one of the largest
ever pharmaceuticals deals. The renewed approach comes amid a
wave of M in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; editing by James Davey)&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer Confirms Prior Discussions with AstraZeneca Regarding a 
      Possible Combination and Its Continuing Interest in a Possible Merger 
      Transaction 
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION IN WHOLE OR IN PART IN, 
      INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A 
      VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OR REGULATIONS OF THAT JURISDICTION.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			STATEMENT FROM PFIZER INC. (&#8220;PFIZER&#8221;)POSSIBLE OFFER FOR 
      ASTRAZENECA PLC (&#8220;ASTRAZENECA&#8221;)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This is an announcement of a possible offer falling under Rule 2.4 of 
      the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). It does not 
      represent a firm intention to make an offer under Rule 2.7 of the Code. 
      Accordingly, there can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be 
      made even if the pre-conditions referred to below are satisfied or 
      waived.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				A transaction would bring together highly complementary 
        Innovative and Established Pharmaceutical Businesses, enhancing the 
        combined company&#8217;s ability to meet patients&#8217; needs 
			
			
				Both AstraZeneca and Pfizer shareholders would be expected to 
        participate in short, medium and long-term value creation through 
        enhanced pipeline development opportunities, premier global operations 
        and the anticipated realisation of operational and financial synergies 
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. confirms that it previously submitted a preliminary, 
      non-binding indication of interest to the board of directors of 
      AstraZeneca in January 2014 regarding a possible merger transaction. 
      After limited high-level discussions, AstraZeneca declined to pursue 
      negotiations. The discussions were discontinued on 14 January 2014 and 
      Pfizer then ceased to consider a possible transaction. In light of 
      recent market developments, Pfizer contacted AstraZeneca on 26 April 
      2014 seeking to renew discussions in order to develop a proposal that 
      could be recommended by both companies to their shareholders. 
      AstraZeneca again declined to engage. Pfizer is currently considering 
      its options with respect to AstraZeneca.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer&#8217;s previous proposal made to the board of AstraZeneca on 5 January 
      2014 included a combination of cash and shares in the combined entity 
      which represented an indicative value of &#163;46.61 ($76.62)1 per 
      AstraZeneca share and a substantial premium of approximately 30% to 
      AstraZeneca&#8217;s closing share price of &#163;35.86 on 3 January 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As in its previous proposal, Pfizer is considering a possible 
      transaction in which AstraZeneca shareholders would receive a 
      significant premium for their AstraZeneca shares, to be paid in a 
      combination of cash and shares in the combined entity. Pfizer believes 
      that a transaction, if proposed and consummated, would offer AstraZeneca 
      shareholders a highly compelling opportunity to realise a significant 
      premium to the undisturbed AstraZeneca share price as of 17 April 2014, 
      which includes a substantial cash payment. AstraZeneca shareholders 
      would become significant shareholders in the combined company and 
      participate in significant value creation opportunities, including 
      benefiting from the potential growth opportunities and operational and 
      financial synergies that the combination of two complementary global 
      pharmaceutical companies would be expected to generate. Pfizer is 
      confident a combination is capable of being consummated. The 
      transaction, if consummated, is expected to result in the combination of 
      the two companies under a new U.K.-incorporated holding company. As a 
      global corporation, Pfizer would expect the combined company to have 
      management in both the United States and the United Kingdom, and to 
      maintain head offices in New York and list its shares on the New York 
      Stock Exchange.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The making of any firm offer by Pfizer would be subject to the following 
      pre-conditions (which may be waived in whole or in part by Pfizer):
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        satisfactory completion of a customary due diligence review by Pfizer;
      
			
        unanimous recommendation by the directors of AstraZeneca to vote in 
        favour of the combination; and
      
			
        the directors of AstraZeneca giving irrevocable undertakings to accept 
        any offer in respect of their AstraZeneca shares.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the possible transaction, Ian Read, Chairman and CEO of 
      Pfizer, said:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have great respect for AstraZeneca and its proud heritage as an 
      innovation-driven biopharmaceutical business with a rich science-based 
      foundation in both the United Kingdom and Sweden. In addition, the 
      United Kingdom has created attractive incentives for companies to 
      manufacture products and maintain and protect intellectual property, and 
      we have seen that capital and jobs have followed these types of 
      incentives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We believe patients all over the globe would benefit from our shared 
      commitment to RD, which is critical to the future success of the 
      pharmaceutical industry, in the form of potential new therapies that 
      help to fight some of the world&#8217;s most feared diseases, such as cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The combination of Pfizer and AstraZeneca could further enhance the 
      ability to create value for shareholders of both companies and bring an 
      expanded portfolio of important treatments to patients. A potential 
      combination with AstraZeneca aligns with Pfizer&#8217;s current structure and 
      fully supports its existing strategy to build world-class businesses. 
      The combination would complement our two innovative businesses and our 
      Global Established Pharmaceutical business, allowing us to maintain the 
      flexibility for the potential future separation of our businesses whilst 
      at the same time broadening our pipeline breadth and potential new 
      product launches over coming years. We believe that a transaction would 
      further strengthen our ability to generate strong and consistent cash 
      flow, targeted for both investment in our business and return to 
      shareholders, while at the same time offering an efficient operating 
      structure and the anticipated realization of attractive synergies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As always, we continue to focus on value creation and will be 
      disciplined in our approach to capital deployment. Pfizer has a proven 
      track record of successful acquisitions and, if a transaction were 
      consummated, would use its extensive integration experience to support a 
      successful combination of the businesses and focus on delivering value 
      to shareholders.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer believes the strategic, business and financial rationale for a 
      transaction is compelling. Pfizer believes the possible combination 
      would create a highly complementary mapping of products, pipeline and 
      operating assets to Pfizer&#8217;s new operating structure, providing 
      additional critical mass to all business segments and strong cash flow 
      through:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        an industry-leading combined portfolio of molecularly targeted 
        medicines for lung cancer, including novel agents for ALK, EGFR and 
        KRas subtypes;
      
			
        strengthened presence in breast cancer, including the ongoing phase 3 
        trial which combines palbociclib with Faslodex for women with 
        recurrent, metastatic hormone-sensitive disease;
      
			
        opportunities for greater depth in immuno-oncology, including the 
        option to combine anti-PD-L1 with palbociclib, Xalkori or Inlyta for 
        breast, lung and renal cancer respectively. Additionally, molecules 
        targeting PD-L1, CTLA4 and 41BB offer attractive opportunities for 
        combination immuno-oncology therapy in several cancer indications, 
        including lung cancer and melanoma;
      
			
        a strong complementary portfolio of important cardiovascular 
        medicines, such as Brilinta and Eliquis and promising development 
        stage programs, such as bococizumab (PCSK9);
      
			
        a broad, innovative commercial offering of non-insulin anti-diabetic 
        medicines that complements Pfizer&#8217;s early-stage research initiatives 
        and capabilities in diabetes;
      
			
        a Global Established Pharmaceutical business with integrated 
        distribution capabilities, expanded reach to healthcare providers and 
        a broad portfolio of market-leading products generating strong and 
        consistent cash flow; and
      
			
        a strengthened global footprint and enhanced opportunities in 
        developing markets.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The possible transaction is expected to be accretive to Pfizer&#8217;s 
      adjusted diluted earnings per share2 in the first full year 
      following the combination3. In addition, Pfizer has a track 
      record of realising operational synergies and delivering meaningful 
      value accretion for shareholders in prior transactions of a similar type 
      and scale. Pfizer believes that synergies would be achieved through the 
      combination of the two companies&#8217; operations and that the combination 
      would enable greater capital efficiency and a more efficient tax 
      structure. In particular, the currently contemplated structure under a 
      new U.K.-incorporated holding company would not subject AstraZeneca&#8217;s 
      non-U.S. profits to U.S. tax, which would be in the best interests of 
      the combined company&#8217;s shareholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The completion of a possible transaction is subject to the approval of 
      Pfizer&#8217;s shareholders and is expected to be a taxable event to Pfizer&#8217;s 
      shareholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer reserves the right to introduce other forms of consideration 
      and/or vary the mix of consideration and waive in whole or in part any 
      of the pre-conditions to making an offer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer reserves the right to make an offer for AstraZeneca at any time 
      for less than the equivalent of &#163;46.61 ($76.62) for each AstraZeneca 
      share:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (i) with the agreement or recommendation of the AstraZeneca board;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (ii) if a third party announces a firm intention to make an offer for 
      AstraZeneca which, as at the date Pfizer announces a firm intention to 
      make an offer for AstraZeneca, is valued at a lower price than the 
      equivalent of &#163;46.61 ($76.62) for each AstraZeneca share;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (iii) following the announcement by AstraZeneca of a whitewash 
      transaction4 pursuant to the Code; or
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (iv) in the event that any AstraZeneca dividend is declared, made or 
      paid in excess of what is expected by the consensus analyst forecasted 
      dividends of 53.6 pence5 per share due to be announced by 
      AstraZeneca on 31 July 2014, a &#163; for &#163; adjustment reduction equal to the 
      excess amount.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The deadline set by Rule 2.6(a) of the Code (the &#8220;Deadline&#8221;) requires 
      Pfizer either:
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Disclosure requirements of the Takeover Code (the &#8220;Code&#8221;)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Under Rule 8.3(a) of the Code, any person who is interested in 1% or 
      more of any class of relevant securities of an offeree company or of any 
      securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an offeror in 
      respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely 
      to be, solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure 
      following the commencement of the offer period and, if later, following 
      the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first 
      identified. An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the 
      person&#8217;s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, 
      any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any 
      securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a 
      person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm 
      (London time) on the 10th business day following the commencement of the 
      offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) 
      on the 10th business day following the announcement in which any 
      securities exchange offeror is first identified. Relevant persons who 
      deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a 
      securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening 
      Position Disclosure must instead make a Dealing Disclosure.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Under Rule 8.3(b) of the Code, any person who is, or becomes, 
      interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the 
      offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror must make a 
      Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the 
      offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing 
      Disclosure must contain details of the dealing concerned and of the 
      person&#8217;s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, 
      any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any 
      securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have 
      previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person 
      to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm 
      (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant 
      dealing.

			Disclosures are therefore required in the shares of Pfizer and 
      AstraZeneca.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or 
      understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an 
      interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities 
      exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the 
      purpose of Rule 8.3.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company 
      and by any offeror and Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the 
      offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons acting in concert 
      with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4).
		&lt;/p&gt;

			Details of the offeree and offeror companies in respect of whose 
      relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing Disclosures 
      must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Takeover 
      Panel&#8217;s website at www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk,

			Forward-Looking Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements with 
      respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business 
      of Pfizer and the combined businesses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer and 
      certain plans and objectives of Pfizer with respect thereto, including 
      the expected benefits of a potential combination as well as whether a 
      potential combination will be pursued. These forward-looking statements 
      can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical 
      or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use future dates or 
      words such as &#8220;anticipate&#8221;, &#8220;target&#8221;, &#8220;expect&#8221;, &#8220;estimate&#8221;, &#8220;intend&#8221;, 
      &#8220;plan&#8221;, &#8220;goal&#8221;, &#8220;believe&#8221;, &#8220;hope&#8221;, &#8220;aim&#8221;, &#8220;continue&#8221;, &#8220;will&#8221;, &#8220;may&#8221;, 
      &#8220;would&#8221;, &#8220;could&#8221; or &#8220;should&#8221; or other words of similar meaning or the 
      negative thereof. There are several factors which could cause actual 
      plans and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied 
      in forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited 
      to, the possibility that a possible offer will not be pursued or will be 
      pursued on different terms and conditions, failure to obtain necessary 
      regulatory approvals or any required financing or to satisfy any of the 
      other conditions to a possible combination, adverse effects on the 
      market price of Pfizer&#8217;s common stock and on Pfizer&#8217;s operating results 
      because of a failure to complete the possible combination, failure to 
      realise the expected benefits of the possible combination, negative 
      effects of this announcement or the consummation of the possible 
      combination on the market price of Pfizer&#8217;s common stock, significant 
      transaction costs and/or unknown liabilities, general economic and 
      business conditions that affect the combined companies following a 
      possible combination, changes in global, political, economic, business, 
      competitive, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest 
      rates, changes in tax laws, regulations, rates and policies, future 
      business combinations or disposals and competitive developments. These 
      forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions and 
      assessments made by Pfizer in light of its experience and perception of 
      historical trends, current conditions, business strategies, operating 
      environment, future developments and other factors it believes 
      appropriate. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known 
      and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and 
      depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. The factors 
      described in the context of such forward-looking statements in this 
      announcement could cause Pfizer&#8217;s plans with respect to AstraZeneca, 
      actual results, performance or achievements, industry results and 
      developments to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by 
      such forward-looking statements. Although it is believed that the 
      expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are 
      reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove 
      to have been correct and persons reading this announcement are therefore 
      cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking 
      statements which speak only as at the date of this announcement. Pfizer 
      assumes no obligation to update or revise the information contained in 
      this announcement (whether as a result of new information, future events 
      or otherwise), except as required by applicable law. A further list and 
      description of risks and uncertainties can be found in Pfizer&#8217;s Annual 
      Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 31 December 2013 and in 
      its subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, the contents of which 
      are not incorporated by reference into, nor do they form part of, this 
      announcement.

      U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) in connection with a 
      possible combination. Pfizer and AstraZeneca shareholders should read 
      those filings, and any other filings made by Pfizer with the SEC in

      reported diluted EPS excluding purchase accounting adjustments, 
      acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain 
      significant items. Pfizer&#8217;s management uses adjusted income, among other 
      factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the 
      overall company. Pfizer believes that investors&#8217; understanding of its 
      performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. The adjusted income 
      and its components and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should 
      not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its 
      components and diluted EPS.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by Patton Boggs accusing Chevron Corp of "bad faith" litigation tactics while the Washington law firm tried to enforce a multibillion-dollar pollution judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In granting Chevron's motion to dismiss the case, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan on Tuesday agreed with a 2013 recommendation by U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis that Patton Boggs did not have legal standing to sue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was the most recent of three that Patton Boggs had filed against Chevron in connection with its efforts to enforce an $18 billion judgment obtained in Ecuador in 2011. Plaintiffs lawyers led by Steven Donziger had claimed Chevron polluted Ecuador's rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two other lawsuits by Patton Boggs, both in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, were dismissed in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest case dates to 2012, when Patton Boggs sued Chevron in Manhattan federal court for what it called "bad faith" litigation. It accused the oil company "cutting off (Ecuadorian plaintiffs') ability to obtain funding" for legal counsel, and of making misrepresentations in obtaining a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the plaintiffs as Patton Boggs sought to enforce the $18 billion judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Chevron asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed, saying that each of Patton Boggs' claims "fail as a matter-of-law." Judge Francis recommended that Kaplan grant Chevron's motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Patton Boggs spokesman said in a statement on Tuesday, "We disagree with the Court's ruling" but noted that "the decision was expected and does not materially impact the posture of the case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokesman said in a statement, "Chevron now looks forward to proving its claims against Patton Boggs and to hold it accountable for its role in perpetrating this scheme."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was referring to the alleged fraud, bribery and extortion used by plaintiffs' lawyers under Donziger in obtaining the Ecuadorian judgment, and the fact that Kaplan had ruled on March 4 that there was "clear and convincing evidence" of this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four weeks later, on March 31, Kaplan allowed Chevron to pursue a case against Patton Boggs accusing the law firm of knowing and concealing allegedly fraudulent tactics used by Donziger's legal team but opting to take the case enforcing the multibillion-dollar judgment anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to that lawsuit on Tuesday, Kaplan said both sides should submit a joint report and proposed schedule for the case going forward by May 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is: Patton Boggs v.

Judge Francis recommended that Kaplan grant Chevron's motion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Patton Boggs spokesman said in a statement on Tuesday, "We disagree with the Court's ruling" but noted that "the decision was expected and does not materially impact the posture of the case." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokesman said in a statement, "Chevron now looks forward to proving its claims against Patton Boggs and to hold it accountable for its role in perpetrating this scheme."     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was referring to the alleged fraud, bribery and extortion used by plaintiffs' lawyers under Donziger in obtaining the Ecuadorian judgment, and the fact that Kaplan had ruled on March 4 that there was "clear and convincing evidence" of this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four weeks later, on March 31, Kaplan allowed Chevron to pursue a case against Patton Boggs accusing the law firm of knowing and concealing allegedly fraudulent tactics used by Donziger's legal team but opting to take the case enforcing the multibillion-dollar judgment anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to that lawsuit on Tuesday, Kaplan said both sides should submit a joint report and proposed schedule for the case going forward by May 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is: Patton Boggs v. Chevron Corporation, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 12-cv-09176.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting By Casey Sullivan; Editing by Ted Botha)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - Pfizer Chief Executive
Ian Read flew into London on Tuesday to pitch his planned $100
billion takeover of rival British drugmaker AstraZeneca 
to government ministers and urge them not to obstruct the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British government has so far adopted a neutral stance
on the matter - in part because Pfizer has yet to make a firm
bid - but behind the scenes officials are warning Pfizer against
making draconian research job cuts, industry sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the U.S. company said Read was meeting a
number of key "stakeholders" in Britain, but declined to give
further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person familiar with the situation said Read's agenda on
Tuesday had included a visit to the Treasury, or finance
ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister George Osborne has said any deal between
Pfizer and AstraZeneca would be a "commercial matter between the
companies", but he stressed the importance of science to Britain
during a television interview on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to see more British science," Osborne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read, who studied chemical engineering in London in the
early 1970s, knows he is stepping into politically dangerous
territory with a deal that is designed to generate both big cost
savings and lower tax bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unions, the opposition Labour party and some scientists have
already raised the alarm about a potential Pfizer takeover of
Britain's second-biggest drugmaker, which employs nearly 7,000
people in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read, however, said it would be a mistake for Britain to go
down an interventionist path by trying to block the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The UK faces a choice," he told the Financial Times in an
interview. "Do they focus on ensuring there is an educated
workforce with the right incentives in place to attract
investment or do they pick winners and losers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying AstraZeneca would be the biggest ever foreign
acquisition of a British company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer insists it views Britain as an attractive location
for both pharmaceutical research and manufacturing - helped by
recent government tax incentives - but that it cannot make any
firm commitments on future investment or jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer already has a tarnished reputation in the eyes of
some scientists after shuttering a large drug research site in
Sandwich, southern England, where Viagra was invented with the
loss of nearly 2,000 jobs three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. drugs giant also faces political headwinds on the
other side of the Atlantic, where U.S. politicians are unhappy
about its plans to move its tax base to Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's plan to merge the two companies into a UK holding
company, while maintaining its operational headquarters in New
York, would likely be the largest deal ever done that included
such a so-called tax "inversion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the financial front, meanwhile, investors believe Pfizer
will need to raise its suggested bid for AstraZeneca to more
than $105 billion and increase the proportion of cash in the
offer to win its prize.

      Research and Markets: Global Glaucoma Therapeutics Market 2014-2018: 
      Allergan Inc., Merck  Co. Inc., Novartis AG  Pfizer Dominate the 
      Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/l62h48/global_glaucoma) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Glaucoma Therapeutics Market 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There is a high degree of RD in the early stages of development in the 
      glaucoma therapeutics pipeline. Some of the new pipeline products in the 
      early stages of development possess novel mechanisms of action such as 
      ROCK inhibitors or the VEGF inhibitors. The new drugs in the early stage 
      pipeline with novel mechanisms of action are targeting the cause of the 
      disease rather than providing symptomatic relief. These drugs could 
      significantly cater to the existing unmet needs of the market but are 
      not expected to be launched and to have any influence during the 
      forecast period. For instance, Muscarinic (phase I), a small molecule by 
      ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc., AR-13324 (phase II), a ROCK inhibitor by 
      Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc., are novel molecules and are expected to 
      fulfill the existing unmet needs of the Global Glaucoma Therapeutics 
      market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the Global Glaucoma Therapeutics market is 
      driven by several factors, of which the increasing prevalence of eye 
      disorders is one of the major drivers. An increase in the prevalence of 
      eye disorders around the world has consequently led to a rise in the 
      incidence of age-related eye diseases. Glaucoma is the most common type 
      of age-related eye disorder.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the increasing number of patent 
      expirations is one of the main challenges. The patent expiries of major 
      approved drugs will slow down the market growth during the forecast 
      period, thereby reducing the overall market value.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			INVESTOR ALERT: Law Offices of Howard G. Smith Announces Lead 
      Plaintiff Deadline in the Class Action Lawsuit Against Walter Investment 
      Management Corp.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Law Offices of Howard G. Smith reminds investors that all purchasers of 
      the securities of Walter Investment Management Corp. (&#8220;Walter 
      Investment&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) (NYSE:WAC) between May 9, 2012 and 
      February 26, 2014, inclusive (the &#8220;Class Period&#8221;), have until May 6, 
      2014, to file a motion to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the 
      shareholder lawsuit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walter Investment, together with its subsidiaries, provides business 
      services to the residential mortgage industry in the United States. The 
      Complaint alleges that during the Class Period the Company 
      misrepresented or failed to disclose material facts concerning Walter 
      Investment&#8217;s operations and financial prospects. Specifically, 
      defendants misrepresented or failed to disclose that:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The Company lacked adequate or effective internal controls over 
        financial accounting and compliance with applicable laws.
      
			
        The Company had overstated the value of its acquisition of Reverse 
        Mortgage Solutions, Inc., and failed to disclose material weaknesses 
        in the internal controls of Reverse Mortgage Solutions.
      
			
        The Company&#8217;s business practices violated consumer financial 
        protection laws and jeopardized the Company&#8217;s revenues and profits.
      
			
        The Company&#8217;s financial statements contained false and misleading 
        statements.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      If you are a member of the Class described above, you may move the Court 
      no later than May 6, 2014, to serve as lead plaintiff, if you meet 
      certain legal requirements. To be a member of the Class, you need not 
      take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or 
      take no action and remain an absent member of the Class. If you wish to 
      learn more about this action, please contact Howard G. Smith, Esquire,

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N) will need to raise its bid for AstraZeneca (AZN.L) to around $105-110 billion and increase the proportion of cash in the offer to win its British rival, investors believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After showing his hand and pressuring his smaller competitor on Monday by disclosing two bid approaches, both of which were rebuffed, Pfizer CEO Ian Read has until May 26 to "put up or shut up" under UK takeover rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, after a jump in Pfizer shares, Read knows he has the backing of many of his own shareholders, while the threat of a counterbid does not appear imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read and his team will be using the time available to consider how they can sweeten an offer made in January worth 58.8 billion pounds ($98.8 billion), or 46.61 pounds a share, comprising 30 percent cash and 70 percent shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca said that offer fell "very significantly" short and it specifically flagged the small cash component, which would leave investors exposed to the risks faced by Pfizer in executing an ambitious mega-merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the British group has refused to talk to Pfizer - but it has not ruled out discussions altogether and one person close to the company said the cash component of any fresh offer would be key in determining if there was engagement in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cash is uppermost in the minds of AstraZeneca shareholders, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For it to move forward from here, they (Pfizer) need to find a way of getting Astra management engaged and that feels like it needs a specific value being applied to the group, and it needs the cash element to be higher," said Alastair Gunn of Jupiter Fund Management (JUP.L), which is a top-20 investor in AstraZeneca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Jefferies believe a deal could get done with Pfizer offering a 50/50 split between cash and shares at a price of at least 50 pounds a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several investors contacted by Reuters confirmed they were looking for 50 pounds a share or more, with Neil Veitch of SVM Asset Management predicting an agreed deal somewhere between 52 and 53 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because a key goal of the planned takeover is to get the tax advantages of re-domiciling the enlarged group in Britain, there is a limit to how much cash Pfizer can offer, since at least 20 percent of its shareholders are required to be UK-based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We estimate Pfizer will need to issue a minimum of around $55 billion in shares to comfortably meet this requirement," Jefferies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the original 30 percent cash element, Moody's analyst Michael Levesque said Pfizer could fund the whole of the cash portion with offshore funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pushing the cash element to 50 percent, however, would require taking on some incremental debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SORIOT CANVASSES INVESTORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot, whose efforts to revive the firm's drug pipeline have proved a key draw for Pfizer, will now be canvassing the views of shareholders as a "priority", with machinery in place for meetings with big and small investors, two people close to the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soriot and chairman Leif Johansson will also be weighing strategic alternatives for the drugmaker, including the potential spin-off of non-core therapy areas like infection and neuroscience, as well as possible acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But "white knight" counterbidders ready to take on Pfizer are likely to be thin on the ground - not least because few other companies would enjoy the same cost and tax benefits from acquiring AstraZeneca as Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amgen (AMGN.O) is one player for whom an AstraZeneca deal might make sense, since the two companies are co-developing a number of drugs, but a person familiar with the U.S. biotech firm said on Tuesday it was not interested in entering the fray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French drugmaker Sanofi (SASY.PA) is another company with the heft and M experience to consider intervening, yet its CEO Chris Viehbacher said on Tuesday he planned to stick to smaller bolt-on acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), the British company with arguably the greatest potential to extract synergies from buying AstraZeneca, has meanwhile said for several years it is not interested in large deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.5950 British Pounds)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies; Editing by Mark Potter)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Initial 30 pct cash component too low for AZ investors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Pfizer may give more cash but limited by UK domicile move&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* "White knights" thin on ground, Amgen said not interested&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ben Hirschler and Simon Jessop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer 
will need to raise its bid for AstraZeneca to around
$105-110 billion and increase the proportion of cash in the
offer to win its British rival, investors believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After showing his hand and pressuring his smaller competitor
on Monday by disclosing two bid approaches, both of which were
rebuffed, Pfizer CEO Ian Read has until May 26 to "put up or
shut up" under UK takeover rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, after a jump in Pfizer shares, Read knows he
has the backing of many of his own shareholders, while the
threat of a counterbid does not appear imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read and his team will be using the time available to
consider how they can sweeten an offer made in January worth
58.8 billion pounds ($98.8 billion), or 46.61 pounds a share,
comprising 30 percent cash and 70 percent shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca said that offer fell "very significantly" short
and it specifically flagged the small cash component, which
would leave investors exposed to the risks faced by Pfizer in
executing an ambitious mega-merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the British group has refused to talk to Pfizer -
but it has not ruled out discussions altogether and one person
close to the company said the cash component of any fresh offer
would be key in determining if there was engagement in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cash is uppermost in the minds of AstraZeneca shareholders,
too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For it to move forward from here, they (Pfizer) need to
find a way of getting Astra management engaged and that feels
like it needs a specific value being applied to the group, and
it needs the cash element to be higher," said Alastair Gunn of
Jupiter Fund Management, which is a top-20 investor in
AstraZeneca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Jefferies believe a deal could get done with
Pfizer offering a 50/50 split between cash and shares at a price
of at least 50 pounds a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several investors contacted by Reuters confirmed they were
looking for 50 pounds a share or more, with Neil Veitch of SVM
Asset Management predicting an agreed deal somewhere between 52
and 53 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because a key goal of the planned takeover is to get the tax
advantages of re-domiciling the enlarged group in Britain, there
is a limit to how much cash Pfizer can offer, since at least 20
percent of its shareholders are required to be UK-based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We estimate Pfizer will need to issue a minimum of around
$55 billion in shares to comfortably meet this requirement,"
Jefferies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the original 30 percent cash element, Moody's
analyst Michael Levesque said Pfizer could fund the whole of the
cash portion with offshore funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pushing the cash element to 50 percent, however, would
require taking on some incremental debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SORIOT CANVASSES INVESTORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot, whose efforts to revive the
firm's drug pipeline have proved a key draw for Pfizer, will now
be canvassing the views of shareholders as a "priority", with
machinery in place for meetings with big and small investors,
two people close to the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soriot and chairman Leif Johansson will also be weighing
strategic alternatives for the drugmaker, including the
potential spin-off of non-core therapy areas like infection and
neuroscience, as well as possible acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But "white knight" counterbidders ready to take on Pfizer
are likely to be thin on the ground - not least because few
other companies would enjoy the same cost and tax benefits from
acquiring AstraZeneca as Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amgen is one player for whom an AstraZeneca deal
might make sense, since the two companies are co-developing a
number of drugs, but a person familiar with the U.S. biotech
firm said on Tuesday it was not interested in entering the fray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French drugmaker Sanofi is another company with
the heft and M experience to consider intervening, yet its CEO
Chris Viehbacher said on Tuesday he planned to stick to smaller
bolt-on acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline, the British company with arguably
the greatest potential to extract synergies from buying
AstraZeneca, has meanwhile said for several years it is not
interested in large deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.5950 British Pounds)

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch: Pfizer, AstraZeneca Combo Would Achieve Strategic Aims
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The acquisition of AstraZeneca Plc (AZ) would achieve Pfizer, Inc.'s 
      strategic aims as the deal promises significant benefits for the 
      combined entity, according to Fitch Ratings. The transaction would amass 
      scale for Pfizer, broaden the company's portfolio and pipeline and could 
      provide some tax advantages.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer, which is headquartered in New York, Monday confirmed it had 
      approached London-based AZ in January 2014 regarding a possible merger, 
      and again this month. AZ confirmed discussions with Pfizer but said 
      there was no specific offer to acquire the company. Pfizer contends a 
      completed transaction would combine highly complementary innovative and 
      established pharmaceutical businesses, enhancing its ability to meet 
      patients' needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer's interest in AZ represents a possible return to mega-deals not 
      seen since the last decade. Recent consolidation in the pharmaceutical 
      industry has been more targeted in nature. An AZ buy would broaden 
      Pfizer's portfolio and pipeline, just as when the company acquired Wyeth 
      in October of 2009. The AZ acquisition would cost Pfizer approximately 
      $99 billion (compared to $68 billion for Wyeth), and underscores 
      Pfizer's experience with larger acquisitions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer's January proposal to the board of AZ included a combination of 
      cash and shares in the combined entity which represented an indicative 
      value of $76.62 per AZ share and a premium of approximately 30%. Pfizer 
      said in a statement that it is considering its options with respect to 
      AZ.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Importantly, a company of Pfizer's size with approximately $70 billion 
      of cash tied up abroad would likely consider acquisition alternatives 
      that are accompanied by some sort of tax advantage. A completed 
      Pfizer/AZ transaction would likely result in a new U.K.-incorporated 
      holding company, according to Pfizer, and would translate to a lower tax 
      rate than in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An AZ acquisition would likely have a negative to neutral effect on 
      Pfizer's credit profile. However, the potential impact remains unclear 
      until more specific transaction details become available. Fitch affirmed 
      Pfizer's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' on April 4. The Rating 
      Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We anticipate Pfizer will continue to generate strong free cash flow and 
      maintain solid liquidity during the intermediate term, with significant 
      international cash balances and adequate access to the credit markets. 
      Fitch believes Pfizer will continue to aggressively deploy cash toward 
      acquisitions and share repurchases.

			IBM Board Approves 16 Percent Increase in Quarterly Cash Dividend
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IBM (NYSE:IBM) board of directors today declared a regular quarterly 
      cash dividend of $1.10 per common share, payable June 10, 2014 to 
      stockholders of record May 9, 2014. Today&#8217;s dividend declaration 
      represents an increase of $0.15, or 16 percent higher than the prior 
      quarterly dividend of $0.95 per common share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is the 19th
			year in a row that IBM has increased its 
      quarterly cash dividend, and the eleventh year in a row of double-digit 
      percent increases. IBM has increased its dividend by over 800 percent 
      since the beginning of 2000 and doubled the dividend in the past five 
      years. With the payment of the June 10 dividend, IBM will have paid 
      consecutive quarterly dividends every year since 1916.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer said, 
      "Today&#8217;s announcement reinforces our commitment to delivering value to 
      shareholders. We will continue to invest aggressively in our strategic 
      growth areas including cloud, big data analytics, social, mobile and 
      security to position the company to drive growth and higher value for

      NJ LEEP Honors Prudential General Counsel Susan Blount and Goldman Sachs 
      General Counsel Gregory Palm
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      What: The New Jersey Law and Education Empowerment Project, (NJ LEEP) 
      will honor Prudential Executive Vice President and General Counsel Susan 
      Blount and Gregory K. Palm, Executive Vice President and General Counsel 
      at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. for Stellar Corporate Leadership in 
      the Promotion of Diversity at its sixth annual Diversity in the 
      Legal Profession, Diversity in Leadership gala on April 30. The 
      event will be held at the Westin Jersey City Newport, Jersey City, N.J. 
      The event is sold-out.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Craig Livermore, Executive Director and Founder of NJ LEEP, said that 
      &#8220;We seek to honor strong partners who help ensure we have the resources 
      we need to send 100% of our graduates to college each year.&#8221; Mr. 
      Livermore went on to add that, &#8220;If not for our Gala raising over 
      $900,000 this year, a record for our organization, we would not be able 
      continue to expand our proven college-access model to serve greater 
      numbers of urban New Jersey high school students.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am very honored to be recognized by NJ LEEP,&#8221; Blount said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a 
      program that I&#8217;ve been involved with for a number of years, and one that 
      I&#8217;ve considered among my personal priorities. To the extent that through 
      this event, we can raise both awareness and resources for the program, 
      then we can help more kids get firmly on the pathway not just to 
      college, but to success in college and beyond.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each summer, Prudential hosts NJ LEEP high school students who have 
      expressed an interest in developing the skills and discipline for a 
      career in law. These NJ LEEP high school students work as interns for a 
      two week period and partner with LCBE associates on mock trials and 
      similar projects involving legal reasoning and analysis. Many members of 
      the Prudential team provide mentoring and support the internship 
      opportunities provided to NJ LEEP students each year. Blount is also a 
      member of the NJ LEEP board of trustees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jeffrey Isaacs, Managing Director and Global Chief Operating Officer of 
      the Legal Department at Goldman, Sachs  Co. and a Board Member of NJ 
      LEEP, said that &#8220;Goldman Sachs has consistently demonstrated a broad 
      commitment to diversity and educational enrichment programs for youth in 
      our local communities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Isaacs went on to emphasize the significant ties Goldman Sachs has 
      to the organization. &#8220;For several years, many of our professionals have 
      worked with and volunteered their time to NJ LEEP. We believe that 
      through programs such as this initiative, we can provide students an 
      opportunity to shine and to enhance important skill sets.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      NJ LEEP is a college access program that exposes urban minority youth in 
      Newark, Trenton and Jersey City to the legal profession, and helps them 
      build the skills necessary to enter and graduate from college. In 
      addition to school-based partnerships, NJ LEEP facilitates a four-year 
      out-of-school-time College Bound Program in Newark for urban high school 
      youth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Among NJ LEEP&#8217;s College Bound Program&#8217;s first three graduating classes 
      of 2011, 2012 and 2013, 100 percent have gone on to college and 85 
      percent are currently enrolled in college. Universities and colleges 
      currently attended by NJ LEEP alumni include Georgetown University, 
      Bowdoin College, Rutgers University, Drew University, The College of New 
      Jersey, Bryn Mawr College, Princeton University, Mt. Holyoke College, 
      Trinity College and many others. NJ LEEP urban high school student 
      participants and alumni will be present at the event and featured 
      throughout the evening.

&lt;p&gt;(Repeat for additional subscribers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 29 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of AstraZeneca Plc (AZ) would achieve 
Pfizer, Inc.'s strategic aims as the deal promises significant benefits for  the 
combined entity, according to Fitch Ratings. The transaction would amass scale 
for Pfizer, broaden the company's portfolio and pipeline and could provide some 
tax advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which is headquartered in New York, Monday confirmed it had approached 
London-based AZ in January 2014 regarding a possible merger, and again this 
month. AZ confirmed discussions with Pfizer but said there was no specific offer 
to acquire the company. Pfizer contends a completed transaction would combine 
highly complementary innovative and established pharmaceutical businesses, 
enhancing its ability to meet patients' needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's interest in AZ represents a possible return to mega-deals not seen 
since the last decade. Recent consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry has 
been more targeted in nature. An AZ buy would broaden Pfizer's portfolio and 
pipeline, just as when the company acquired Wyeth in October of 2009. The AZ 
acquisition would cost Pfizer approximately $99 billion (compared to $68 billion 
for Wyeth), and underscores Pfizer's experience with larger acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's January proposal to the board of AZ included a combination of cash and 
shares in the combined entity which represented an indicative value of $76.62 
per AZ share and a premium of approximately 30%. Pfizer said in a statement that 
it is considering its options with respect to AZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, a company of Pfizer's size with approximately $70 billion of cash 
tied up abroad would likely consider acquisition alternatives that are 
accompanied by some sort of tax advantage. A completed Pfizer/AZ transaction 
would likely result in a new U.K.-incorporated holding company, according to 
Pfizer, and would translate to a lower tax rate than in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An AZ acquisition would likely have a negative to neutral effect on Pfizer's 
credit profile. However, the potential impact remains unclear until more 
specific transaction details become available. Fitch affirmed Pfizer's Issuer 
Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' on April 4. The Rating Outlook is Stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We anticipate Pfizer will continue to generate strong free cash flow and 
maintain solid liquidity during the intermediate term, with significant 
international cash balances and adequate access to the credit markets. Fitch 
believes Pfizer will continue to aggressively deploy cash toward acquisitions 
and share repurchases.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			IBM customers can now deliver the right content to the right users at 
      the right time and location on their unified mobile platform
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			bigtincan, 
      a leader in mobile content enablement, today announced a partnership 
      with IBM that brings the power of bigtincan hub to the IBM Cloud 
      marketplace. Starting today, IBM clients can leverage the bigtincan Hub 
      to securely access and engage with all types of content (files, 
      documents, PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, HTML5 content, videos, RSS 
      feeds, forms, social media) no matter where it resides, through a single 
      point of access, providing an intuitive and compelling user experience 
      on any mobile device.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      interactions, utilization and the value of mobile content.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re honored to be a part of IBM&#8217;s Cloud marketplace to deliver the 
      power of mobile content enablement to its customers,&#8221; said Jonathan 
      Fischer, Executive Vice President of Business Development and Field 
      Services of bigtincan. &#8220;Traditionally, mobile work has been reduced to 
      basic, limited actions, inhibiting any real productivity. According to 
      IDC research, the world&#8217;s mobile worker population will expand to 1.3 
      billion by 2015, representing 37% of the total workforce. With the 
      mobile workforce expanding daily, bigtincan hub is delivering a mobile 
      solution that enables productivity anywhere, at any time, on any device.&#8221;

      experience that is secure, intelligent, relevant, and social. bigtincan

      meet the demands of high performance enterprises. Unlike file, sync and 
      share solutions, bigtincan hub eliminates the endless hours spent 
      searching for content, the frustration of finding valuable content, and 
      the uncertainty of version control, by pushing the most relevant content 
      to users through a single application.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IBM Cloud marketplace offers clients access to more than 100 SaaS

      Landmark Conservation Finance Initiative
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Nature Conservancy and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE:JPM) announced 
      today the establishment of NatureVest, a new initiative of The 
      Conservancy. The program will seek to transform the way we protect 
      natural capital &#8211; the soil, clean air and water, and other valuable 
      resources that nature provides. NatureVest will capitalize on the 
      growing impact investment sector to create a platform to advance 
      investment in conservation. As part of that effort, NatureVest will 
      convene investors; develop and execute innovative financial 
      transactions; and continue to build an investment pipeline across 
      multiple sectors, including agriculture, fisheries and environmental 
      markets. JPMorgan Chase is the founding sponsor of NatureVest and has 
      committed to provide multi-year support for its launch and development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;NatureVest is a natural extension of The Nature Conservancy&#8217;s work &#8211; it 
      will open up entirely new avenues for investments that protect nature,&#8221; 
      said Mark Tercek, President and CEO of The Nature Conservancy. 
      "By bringing together leaders in natural resource management and 
      investment, we will unlock new sources of capital to deliver important 
      conservation results."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the global population estimated to peak at 9 billion by 2050, there 
      is a growing need to maximize the pace, scale and effectiveness of 
      efforts to protect natural ecosystems &#8211; along with the cities and 
      communities that rely on them. At the same time, there is clearly 
      insufficient investment in conservation. According to the Global 
      Canopy Programme, the current financial need to support global 
      conservation efforts is approximately $290 billion per year. However, 
      only about $51 billion is devoted to these activities annually, 
      primarily from public and philanthropic sources. NatureVest will work to 
      close this funding gap by creating new opportunities for the private 
      sector to invest capital in conservation projects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;There is an urgent need to step up the scale and creativity of 
      financial resources dedicated to the protection of natural ecosystems,&#8221; 
      said Doug Petno, CEO of Commercial Banking at JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;We 
      are delighted to collaborate with The Nature Conservancy to build 
      NatureVest and demonstrate that profitability and sustainability can 
      work hand in hand.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			EKO Asset Management Partners (EKO) helped to design NatureVest 
      and will serve as an ongoing adviser to The Conservancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This year, NatureVest will publish the first piece of research to 
      comprehensively size and characterize segments within the natural 
      capital marketplace. Developed collaboratively with input from The 
      Conservancy, JPMorgan Chase, EKO, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, 
      and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation the research is designed to 
      help investors and other stakeholders better understand current 
      opportunities and identify potential future prospects.

		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, CA--(Marketwired - Apr 29, 2014) - 
				Armor5, creator of Zero-Touch Cloud Security, today announced a partnership with IBM that brings the power of Armor5's innovative Cloud Services Security solution to the IBM Cloud marketplace. Starting today, IBM clients can learn about the Armor5 service, see a demo and sign up for a free trial directly from the IBM Cloud marketplace at http://ibm.com/cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armor5 uniquely protects enterprises from data leakage, compliance exposures and privacy breaches during the 'last mile' connection between the cloud and the device, when employees and contractors access cloud services. The service dynamically creates a secure cloud session isolating the content and applications in the cloud without requiring installs or configurations on the device or within the enterprise DMZ. Potential data leakage is eliminated because no data/content ever hits the device and is not cached. Additional role-based policy controls can be instantly extended from a corporate active directory server to control access to 1000s of public or private cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cloud/SaaS service providers are now aggregating significant amounts of data/content that once lived behind corporate firewalls," said Suresh Balasubramanian, CEO of Armor5. "Today's users often bypass corporate security controls to access or download data in the cloud -- many times from devices that are unmanaged by corporate IT. Armor5 places the security function in the cloud, where it is isolated from the device and the network. Enterprise policy controls are seamlessly extended from the network perimeter to enforce access to cloud services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armor5 delivers real-time analytics, activity monitoring and alerts to aid in data leak prevention, privacy control and ensure compliance. The service is only 'on' when users choose to access corporate data through cloud services, relieving enterprises of privacy exposure during personal use. Corporations can also avoid privacy breaches resulting from remote wipes, which are unnecessary with Armor5 since data is not resident on the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM Cloud marketplace offers clients' access to more than 100 SaaS applications, IBM's BlueMix platform-as-a-service with its suite of composable services, the powerful SoftLayer infrastructure-as-a-service and IBM's rich intellectual capital and deep industry expertise.&#160;This single online destination with a suite of cloud services delivers a new buying experience for clients that enables line of business professionals to deploy new services faster; allows developers to build them with greater speed; and offers IT departments more creative, efficient and lower-cost ways to deliver these services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is Armor5 Zero Touch?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Armor5 Zero Touch approach requires zero installs or configuration on the device or DMZ, operates with a zero performance deficit, and leaves zero data on mobile devices -- completely eliminating the risk of data loss. Armor5's on-demand cloud service uses a unique URL and leverages existing authentication mechanisms to ensure a smooth and instantaneous roll out to the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Armor5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armor5, creator of Zero Touch Cloud Security, is a worldwide leader in on-demand cloud services security that gives users instant access to cloud services, corporate apps, data and content on any device, while simultaneously protecting enterprises against data loss, privacy and compliance liabilities. The Armor5 Zero Touch approach requires zero installs or configuration, operates with a zero performance deficit, and leaves zero data on mobile devices -- completely eliminating the risk of data loss. Founded in 2012 by former executives from Adobe, Motorola and Yahoo, the company is privately held with patent-pending technology and investment from leading venture capital firms and Citrix Startup Accelerator.

      investment in conservation. As part of that effort, NatureVest will 
      convene investors; develop and execute innovative financial 
      transactions; and continue to build an investment pipeline across 
      multiple sectors, including agriculture, fisheries and environmental 
      markets. JPMorgan Chase is the founding sponsor of NatureVest and has 
      committed to provide multi-year support for its launch and development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;NatureVest is a natural extension of The Nature Conservancy&#8217;s work &#8211; it 
      will open up entirely new avenues for investments that protect nature,&#8221; 
      said Mark Tercek, President and CEO of The Nature Conservancy. 
      "By bringing together leaders in natural resource management and 
      investment, we will unlock new sources of capital to deliver important 
      conservation results."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the global population estimated to peak at 9 billion by 2050, there 
      is a growing need to maximize the pace, scale and effectiveness of 
      efforts to protect natural ecosystems &#8211; along with the cities and 
      communities that rely on them. At the same time, there is clearly 
      insufficient investment in conservation. According to the Global 
      Canopy Programme, the current financial need to support global 
      conservation efforts is approximately $290 billion per year. However, 
      only about $51 billion is devoted to these activities annually, 
      primarily from public and philanthropic sources. NatureVest will work to 
      close this funding gap by creating new opportunities for the private 
      sector to invest capital in conservation projects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;There is an urgent need to step up the scale and creativity of 
      financial resources dedicated to the protection of natural ecosystems,&#8221; 
      said Doug Petno, CEO of Commercial Banking at JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;We 
      are delighted to collaborate with The Nature Conservancy to build 
      NatureVest and demonstrate that profitability and sustainability can 
      work hand in hand.&#8221;

      and will serve as an ongoing adviser to The Conservancy.

      This year, NatureVest will publish the first piece of research to 
      comprehensively size and characterize segments within the natural 
      capital marketplace. Developed collaboratively with input from The 
      Conservancy, JPMorgan Chase, EKO, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, 
      and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation the research is designed to 
      help investors and other stakeholders better understand current 
      opportunities and identify potential future prospects.

			Portland General Electric Announces First Quarter Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR)
			today reported net 
      income of $58 million, or 73 cents per diluted share, for the first 
      quarter of 2014. This compares with net income of $49 million, or 65 
      cents per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2013. The increase in 
      earnings reflects the alignment of revenues and operating expenses as 
      authorized in the 2014 general rate case and increased allowance of 
      funds used during construction for the three new generating resources.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing strong operational performance across the company in 
      2014,&#8221; said Jim Piro, president and chief executive officer. 
      &#8220;Construction of our three new generating resources is proceeding on 
      time and on budget, our 2015 general rate case is under way, and our 
      continued focus on operational excellence is delivering benefits for our 
      customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Company updates
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Generation projects: Construction is progressing smoothly on 
        all three generation projects selected last year through the 
        competitive RFP processes.

        
					
            Port Westward Unit 2&#8212;Support structures are being completed at 
            Port Westward Unit 2, a 220 megawatt natural gas-fired capacity 
            resource, and with the recent delivery of the twelfth engine, all 
            major equipment is now on site. The plant is expected to be placed 
            in service in the first quarter of 2015 at an estimated cost of 
            $300 million, excluding allowances for funds used during 
            construction.
          
					
            Tucannon River Wind Farm&#8212;Design work is almost complete for 
            Tucannon River Wind Farm, a 267 megawatt wind farm in Southeastern 
            Washington, and turbine foundations are being poured. The wind 
            farm is expected to be placed in service between December 2014 and 
            March 2015 at an estimated cost of $500 million, excluding AFDC.
          
					
            Carty Generating Station&#8212;Land has been leveled at Carty Generating 
            Station, a 440 megawatt natural gas-fired baseload plant, and 
            foundations will be poured over the next three months. The plant 
            is expected to be placed in service mid-2016 at an estimated cost 
            of $450 million, excluding AFDC.
          
				
			
		
		
			
				General rate case filing: In February of this year, PGE filed a 
        general rate case requesting an overall customer price increase of 4.6 
        percent effective early 2015. The rate case primarily requests 
        recovery of incremental costs to bring Port Westward Unit 2 and 
        Tucannon River Wind Farm into service. The request is based on a 
        return on equity of 10 percent, a capital structure of 50 percent debt 
        and 50 percent equity, and an average rate base of $3.9 billion. PGE 
        expects the Oregon Public Utility Commission to issue a final order 
        with approved price changes before the end of 2014.

			First quarter operating results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues increased $20 million, or 4 percent, to $493 million in 
      the first quarter of 2014 from $473 million in the first quarter of 2013 
      primarily due to the net effect of the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        A $21 million increase in the average retail price resulting from the 
        January 1, 2014 price increase authorized by the OPUC in the company&#8217;s 
        2014 general rate case; and
      
			
        A $5 million increase related to the collection of costs deferred in 
        2012 related to four capital projects beginning January 1, 2014 
        (offset in depreciation and amortization expense); and
      
			
        $1 million, or 6 percent, increase in wholesale revenues consisting of 
        $6 million related to a 51 percent increase in the average price of 
        wholesale power largely offset by $5 million related to a 29 percent 
        decrease in the volume sold; partially offset by
      
			
        A $7 million decrease related to lower volumes of energy delivered 
        largely driven by the 2.5 percent decline in residential energy 
        deliveries. During the first quarters of 2014 and 2013, PGE recorded 
        an estimated $4 million collection from customers pursuant to the 
        decoupling mechanism, as weather-adjusted use per customer was lower 
        than that approved in the applicable general rate case.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Purchased power and fuel expense decreased $8 million, or 4 percent, for 
      the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, which 
      consisted of $6 million related to a 3 percent decrease in total system 
      load and $2 million related to a 1 percent decrease in the average 
      variable power cost per megawatt hour.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Production and distribution expense increased $3 million, or 6 percent, 
      in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the first quarter of 2013, 
      primarily due to higher storm and service restoration costs and an 
      increase in costs associated with the company&#8217;s ownership of Boardman. 
      On December 31, 2013, PGE&#8217;s ownership of Boardman increased from 65 
      percent to 80 percent. Partially offsetting the increases was a $3 
      million reserve recorded in the first quarter of 2013 related to the 
      company&#8217;s benchmark bid, which was not selected as a winning bid in the 
      request for proposal for renewable resources.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Depreciation and amortization expense increased $13 million, or 21 
      percent, in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the first quarter of 
      2013, with $8 million related to timing of the deferral and amortization 
      of costs of four capital projects as authorized in the company&#8217;s 2011 
      general rate case. In the first quarter of 2013, PGE deferred $4 million 
      of costs related to these four projects and in the first quarter of 
      2014, the company recorded $4 million of amortization expense related to 
      the recovery of these costs (offset in retail revenues). In addition, 
      capital additions increased depreciation and amortization expense by $5 
      million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interest expense in the first quarter of 2014 was comparable with the 
      first quarter of 2013, with a $3 million increase related to a higher 
      average balance of debt outstanding which was largely offset by an 
      increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction 
      resulting from a higher average construction work-in-progress balance 
      from the construction of three new generation projects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other income, net increased $2 million in the first quarter of 2014 
      compared with the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to an increase in 
      the allowance for equity funds used during construction from the higher 
      average CWIP balance, partially offset by lower earnings on the 
      non-qualified benefit plan trust assets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Income tax expense was $20 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared 
      with $17 million in the first quarter of 2013. The increase is primarily 
      due to the increase in pre-tax income for 2014 compared to 2013 combined 
      with a decrease in estimated annual production tax credits, partially 
      offset by a favorable income tax benefit in 2014 related to an increase 
      in the allowance for equity funds used during construction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2014 earnings guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PGE is increasing full-year 2014 earnings guidance by 5 cents to $2.05 
      to $2.20 per diluted share. This is driven by a delay in issuance of 
      equity under the equity forward sale agreement as a result of updated 
      financing plans. In May, PGE expects to enter into an 18-month unsecured 
      loan agreement to borrow approximately $305 million and to execute a 
      bond purchase agreement to issue approximately $280 million of First 
      Mortgage Bonds with draws delayed to the second half of 2014. Other 
      guidance assumptions are as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Wind generation based on historical levels;

        Depreciation and amortization expense between $295 and $305 million; 
        and
      
			
        Capital expenditures slightly over $1 billion.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN, April 29 (Reuters) - Irish telecoms firm eircom has
appointed Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to
advise it on a possible stock market listing two weeks after
announcing it was considering a third flotation in 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two banks will "explore strategic options for the
company including a potential international offering and
listing," eircom said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month eircom said it had hired bank Rothschild
to advise on a possible flotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former state telecoms operator filed for protection from
its creditors two years ago to restructure 3.75 billion euros
($5.2 billion) of debt and was taken over by its senior lenders
after cutting its debt by 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The examinership - akin to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process
in the United States and administration in Britain - was the
largest in Irish corporate history and saw nearly all of the
company's junior debt wiped out.

&lt;p&gt;By Robert Cyran&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s $99 billion tax arbitrage bid will encourage copycats. The biggest charm of the U.S. drug giant&#8217;s offer for AstraZeneca of the UK lies in switching to a lower-tax domicile. The latest and largest such deal to hit the headlines raises the odds Congress will tighten rules &#8211; but not yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inversions, by which companies relocate to cut their taxes, constitute a big merger theme. Mylan is seeking to take over Swedish Meda, which could relatively easily move to Ireland, and Allergan &#8211; itself the target of Canada&#8217;s Valeant Pharmaceuticals &#8211; is eyeing Irish-domiciled Shire, according to Reuters sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big Valeant selling point in its serial acquisition strategy, including its offer for Allergan, is its own low tax rate, achieved through the earlier acquisition of a Barbados operating subsidiary. Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals and Actavis have maneuvered into similarly advantageous positions as buyers. Activist investors are on the case too, pressuring pharmacy Walgreen to move its headquarters overseas. More deals are in the works, advisers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Pfizer takes over AstraZeneca, it would have three beneficial effects on Pfizer&#8217;s 27 percent tax rate. First, UK companies don&#8217;t pay taxes on overseas earnings. Second, the headline rate of tax on earnings is lower than in the United States &#8211; it will be 20 percent next year. And third, Pfizer could take advantage of the so-called &#8220;patent box&#8221; scheme, which will be fully phased in by 2017. The tax rate on profit made on UK-patented products will be only 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inversion-related deals have come in waves in recent decades. Each wave has attracted new rules making them harder. Now, for example, a U.S. company must have substantial business activities in a country if it wants to move its domicile there &#8211; hence the use of mergers. Also, the overseas partner&#8217;s owners must hold between 20 percent and 40 percent of the value and votes of the combined group. The mix of cash and stock in Pfizer&#8217;s offer for AstraZeneca would achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a huge deal by a well-known company, and the big loss of tax revenue, could provoke U.S. lawmakers. Although President Barack Obama has proposed rules that would almost eliminate inversions, his proposal stands little chance of becoming law. Congress is also unlikely to act during this election year. The rules may well change again later &#8211; but in the meantime, Pfizer has validated the inversion tactic and more deals will probably follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - At the heart of Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) pursuit of British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) is a shortage of attractive products in its own research pipeline, aggravated by a recent series of disappointing drug launches, according to some industry analysts and money managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They view the $100-billion gambit for AstraZeneca as a return by Pfizer to the "mega-mergers" of the previous decade that allowed the U.S. company to benefit from huge cost savings and divert shareholder concern over low returns from its research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As recently as last year, Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read had virtually sworn off major dealmaking, wary of the criticism that huge transactions, such as the $90 billion purchase of Warner-Lambert in 2000, had not improved the company's prospects for innovative products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer is doing this from a position of weakness," said Michael Liss, a portfolio manager at American Century Investments who holds Pfizer shares. "If they had enough in their own pipeline, they wouldn't need to buy a big company; they'd be doing smaller collaborations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liss still believes the deal makes sense because it could create $4 billion in annual cost-savings for Pfizer, knock down its tax rate by rebasing the biggest U.S. drugmaker to Britain, and bring Pfizer potentially lucrative cancer drugs from AstraZeneca that work by stimulating the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer's problem is they have a very thin drug pipeline," said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. "And this is a very clear admission of that," he said, referring to Pfizer's two rebuffed efforts since January to buy AstraZeneca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read appeared to head off the criticism on Monday in discussing his efforts to reignite talks with Astra. He told investors that Pfizer had redoubled its efforts to buy AstraZeneca after favorable data from trials of new and experimental company drugs allowed it to act from "a position of strength."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But industry watchers questioned that description. Pfizer had hoped to turn a corner on its research when it won regulatory approvals over the past three years for kidney cancer treatment Inlyta and Xalkori for lung cancer after a decade without any significant new drugs. But both have seen weak sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two newer treatments that had been deemed potential blockbusters with billions of dollars in sales, Xeljanz for rheumatoid arthritis and Eliquis to prevent blood clots that can cause strokes, have failed to take flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental breast cancer drug palbociclib, which has been deemed Pfizer's most exciting product in development, is now expected to face stiff competition from more effective and safer drugs in the same class being developed by rivals, Boris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOLES IN THE PIPELINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has chased down and swallowed three other major drugmakers in the past 15 years, beginning with its hostile acquisition of Warner Lambert.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - At the heart of Pfizer Inc's pursuit of British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc is a shortage of attractive products in its own research pipeline, aggravated by a recent series of disappointing drug launches, according to some industry analysts and money managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They view the $100-billion gambit for AstraZeneca as a return by Pfizer to the "mega-mergers" of the previous decade that allowed the U.S. company to benefit from huge cost savings and divert shareholder concern over low returns from its research and development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As recently as last year, Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read had virtually sworn off major dealmaking, wary of the criticism that huge transactions, such as the $90 billion purchase of Warner-Lambert in 2000, had not improved the company's prospects for innovative products.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer is doing this from a position of weakness," said Michael Liss, a portfolio manager at American Century Investments who holds Pfizer shares. "If they had enough in their own pipeline, they wouldn't need to buy a big company; they'd be doing smaller collaborations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liss still believes the deal makes sense because it could create $4 billion in annual cost-savings for Pfizer, knock down its tax rate by rebasing the biggest U.S. drugmaker to Britain, and bring Pfizer potentially lucrative cancer drugs from AstraZeneca that work by stimulating the immune system.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer's problem is they have a very thin drug pipeline," said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. "And this is a very clear admission of that," he said, referring to Pfizer's two rebuffed efforts since January to buy AstraZeneca. [ID:nL6N0NK194]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read appeared to head off the criticism on Monday in discussing his efforts to reignite talks with Astra. He told investors that Pfizer had redoubled its efforts to buy AstraZeneca after favorable data from trials of new and experimental company drugs allowed it to act from "a position of strength."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But industry watchers questioned that description. Pfizer had hoped to turn a corner on its research when it won regulatory approvals over the past three years for kidney cancer treatment Inlyta and Xalkori for lung cancer after a decade without any significant new drugs. But both have seen weak sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two newer treatments that had been deemed potential blockbusters with billions of dollars in sales, Xeljanz for rheumatoid arthritis and Eliquis to prevent blood clots that can cause strokes, have failed to take flight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental breast cancer drug palbociclib, which has been deemed Pfizer's most exciting product in development, is now expected to face stiff competition from more effective and safer drugs in the same class being developed by rivals, Boris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOLES IN THE PIPELINE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has chased down and swallowed three other major drugmakers in the past 15 years, beginning with its hostile acquisition of Warner Lambert. The deal gave it full ownership of cholesterol fighter Lipitor, which went on to become the world's biggest medicine, and created opportunity for deep cost cuts that propped up earnings for several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pfizer's profits were on the downswing by 2003, after the company failed to come up with new products to replace aging blockbusters. So Pfizer spent $60 billion that year to acquire Pharmacia Corp, counting on thousands of job cuts and other cost savings to get its earnings growing again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Pfizer's laboratories remained unproductive, and the company was faced with impending generic competition for Lipitor, Pfizer paid $68 billion in 2009 for Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said Pfizer is not facing impending patent expirations on big medicines, with the exception of painkiller Celebrex, so is not desperate for a merger as it was with the Wyeth deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Conover said Pfizer needs cost cuts because it will likely generate average annual earnings growth of only 2 percent over the next five years with its existing products, half the average likely growth for other large drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have a few potential blockbusters, but not of the magnitude of Merck or Bristol-Myers," Conover said, which have strong immuno-oncology programs.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers intend to investigate U.S. drugmaker Pfizer's planned $100 billion takeover of British rival AstraZeneca in a bid to ensure scientific research and jobs are protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the parliamentary business, innovation and skills committee are worried that the deal, which would be the biggest-ever foreign acquisition of a British company, could threaten the country's strategic interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are keen to look closely at it," committee member Ann McKechin told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will see how events pan out over the next few days, but clearly given the scale of the proposed merger it is important that we consider the impact not just on shareholders but also on employees and the wider interests of the UK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca, Britain's second-biggest drugmaker behind GlaxoSmithKline, is an important part of the life sciences sector and employs nearly 7,000 staff in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee's chairman Andrew Bailey said it would be looking to hold an inquiry "pretty quickly", and those called to give evidence were likely to include ministers such as Business Secretary Vince Cable and representatives from the Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British government has so far adopted a neutral stance on the matter, with finance minister George Osborne saying any deal between the two companies would be a commercial matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The line that this is a straightforward commercial issue that the government has no role in is too laid back," said Bailey. "In AstraZeneca we have a company that amounts to 2.3 percent of our total exports, is a world leader in research in pharmaceuticals and is very strategically positioned in this country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committee member Katy Clark said Pfizer's management would also probably be among those called to any inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times, citing a senior Whitehall official, reported late on Wednesday that Prime Minister David Cameron had appointed two of his most senior officials to lead government negotiations with Pfizer on his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians are wary of foreign takeovers in the light of Kraft's 2010 acquisition of Cadbury, when the U.S. food group promised to keep open a key factory, only to go back on the pledge soon after the deal was completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The committee previously had a great deal of concern over the Cadbury takeover, so I think this is one we will really have to closely analyse what is on offer," McKechin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer already has a tarnished reputation in Britain after it announced plans in 2011 to shut a major drug research site in Sandwich, southern England, where Viagra was invented, with the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. firm says it views Britain as an attractive location for both pharmaceutical research and manufacturing - helped by recent government tax incentives - but cannot make any firm commitments on future investment or jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read is in Britain to lobby politicians and investors about the company's plans.

 (Adds FT report on David Cameron's representatives in talks)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Kylie MacLellan and Ben Hirschler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - British lawmakers intend to
investigate U.S. drugmaker Pfizer's planned $100 billion
takeover of British rival AstraZeneca in a bid to ensure
scientific research and jobs are protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the parliamentary business, innovation and skills

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Upgrades 1 Class of JPMCCM 2004-C3
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has upgraded one and affirmed 17 classes of JP Morgan 
      Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMCC) commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates series 2004-C3. A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The upgrade is due to additional defeasance and paydown since Fitch's 
      last rating action. The affirmations reflect the pool's stable 
      performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 3.3% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 6.3%, including $67.2 million (4.4% of 
      the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has 
      designated 17 loans (19.4%) as Fitch Loans of Concern. Presently, there 
      are no specially serviced loans in the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the April 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 42.3% to $875.5 million from $1.52 billion 
      at issuance. Per the servicer reporting, 18 loans (27.9% of the pool) 
      are defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes N 
      through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is the Lakeshore Club 
      Apartments loan (3.1%), which is secured by a multifamily property 
      consisting of 613 units located in Tampa, FL. The property is 96% 
      occupied as of January 2014 with an average rental rate of $635 per 
      month. The loan was modified in November 2012 and the borrower continues 
      to pay as agreed. The loan is interest only through the remaining term, 
      which was extended to November 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is the Crossroads 
      Shopping Center loan (6.6% of the pool), which is secured by a 310,753 
      square foot (sf) anchored retail center located in White Plains, NY. The 
      largest tenants are KMART (32%), lease expiration January 2017; 
      HomeGoods (8%), expiration November 2018; and Modell's (8%), which 
      recently extended their lease thru 2024. The property's performance 
      significantly declined in 2011 as a result of AP Supermarket (12%) 
      vacating its space. As of December 2013, the property is 82.4% occupied; 
      however two new leases were signed with tenants DSW Shoe Warehouse and 
      PetSmart for the vacant AP space in the 3rd quarter 2013. Once the 
      tenants are in place, occupancy should increase to 96%. There is minimal 
      upcoming rollover over the next two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is the Cambridge Court 
      Phase I  II loan (2.2%), which is secured by a 254,698 sf medical 
      office property located in Auburn Hills, MI. As of December 2012 the 
      property was 55% occupied. The tenant Genesy's Regional Medical (5%) 
      vacated the property at lease expiration in March 2013; however, a 
      related entity leased the space as of April 2013 at a rental rate of 
      $17.75 sf through April 2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating Outlooks on classes A-1, A-4, A-5 and C thru D remain Stable due 
      to increasing credit enhancement and continued paydown. The Positive 
      outlook on class B reflects the future expected paydown from loan 
      maturities in 2014. In the current review, approximately 49% of the pool 
      was modeled to pay off at the respective loan maturities, as these loans 
      pass both refinance tests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch upgrades the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/2rcbk8/global_childrens) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Children's Wear Market 2014-2018 with Benetton, Carter's Inc., 
      Children's Place Retail Store, Espirit Holdings, Gap  The Walt Disney 
      Co Dominating" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the past few years, children in developed economies in the Americas 
      and Europe have become highly fashion-conscious. These children are 
      treated like adults and they are continually exposed to fashion media 
      and branded clothing. In addition, increased international travel and 
      awareness about branded clothing among their peers is also contributing 
      to awareness about luxury and designer brands among children. Wealthy 
      parents, celebrities, and high-profile businesspeople also prefer to 
      clothe their children in luxury brands for numerous reasons. The growing 
      desire among children to dress like adults and experience the newest 
      fashion trends is inspiring several luxury brands to create miniature 
      versions of adult clothing for children. Therefore, the increasing 
      demand for luxury children's wear in developed economies is a trend that 
      is expected to lead to the growth of the Global Children's Wear market 
      during the forecast period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, parents are increasingly spending more on their 
      children's wear due to reasons such as peer pressure and the need to 
      maintain their social status. Currently, across the globe, an average 
      family spends approximately US$105 annually on their child's clothing. 
      Spending extravagantly on children has become an important consideration 
      in their upbringing. Higher disposable income is another reason for the 
      increasing spending on children's wear by families. The availability of 
      newer designer children's clothing and footwear has also increased 
      consumer spending on children's wear, which is adding to the market 
      growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that vendors in the Global Children's Wear 
      market are witnessing a decline in their profit margins owing to the 
      increasing competition among vendors and the rising cost of raw 
      materials. The market has also been attracting new vendors owing to its 
      continual growth. These vendors are more focused on customer 
      requirements and are developing new designs/varieties of children's wear 
      based on their requirements. In addition, cost-driven customers prefer 
      to spend money on low-cost apparel and footwear than designer and luxury 
      brands. This further reduces the sales potential and profit margins of 
      vendors selling premium brands. Hence, the increasing vendor competition 
      is a key challenge that is hindering the growth of the Global Children's 
      Wear market.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers intend to investigate U.S. drugmaker Pfizer's (PFE.N) planned $100 billion takeover of British rival AstraZeneca (AZN.L) in a bid to ensure scientific research and jobs are protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the parliamentary business, innovation and skills committee are worried that the deal, which would be the biggest-ever foreign acquisition of a British company, could threaten the country's strategic interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are keen to look closely at it," committee member Ann McKechin told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will see how events pan out over the next few days, but clearly given the scale of the proposed merger it is important that we consider the impact not just on shareholders but also on employees and the wider interests of the UK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca, Britain's second-biggest drugmaker behind GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), is an important part of the life sciences sector and employs nearly 7,000 staff in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee's chairman Andrew Bailey said it would be looking to hold an inquiry "pretty quickly", and those called to give evidence were likely to include ministers such as Business Secretary Vince Cable and representatives from the Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British government has so far adopted a neutral stance on the matter, with finance minister George Osborne saying any deal between the two companies would be a commercial matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The line that this is a straightforward commercial issue that the government has no role in is too laid back," said Bailey. "In AstraZeneca we have a company that amounts to 2.3 percent of our total exports, is a world leader in research in pharmaceuticals and is very strategically positioned in this country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committee member Katy Clark said Pfizer's management would also probably be among those called to any inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians are wary of foreign takeovers in the light of Kraft's (KRFT.O) 2010 acquisition of Cadbury, when the U.S. food group promised to keep open a key factory, only to go back on the pledge soon after the deal was completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The committee previously had a great deal of concern over the Cadbury takeover, so I think this is one we will really have to closely analyse what is on offer," McKechin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer already has a tarnished reputation in Britain after it announced plans in 2011 to shut a major drug research site in Sandwich, southern England, where Viagra was invented, with the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. firm says it views Britain as an attractive location for both pharmaceutical research and manufacturing - helped by recent government tax incentives - but cannot make any firm commitments on future investment or jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read is in Britain to lobby politicians and investors about the company's plans. Despite the government's neutral stance, behind the scenes officials are warning Pfizer against making draconian research job cuts, industry sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has made two approaches to AstraZeneca, both of which have been rebuffed. The company is widely expected to come back with a revised offer before a May 26 deadline for it to "put up or shut up" under UK takeover rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by William James, Editing by David Holmes and Susan Fenton)&lt;/p&gt;

			JPMorgan Chase Pledges $20 Million to Support U.S. Military Veterans 
      and Their Families
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Firm expands its commitment to the military and veteran communities, 
      partners with philanthropic leaders across the country in new 
      Philanthropy-Joining Forces Impact Pledge
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE:JPM) today pledged to invest $20 million over 
      the next five years to support&#160;U.S. military veterans and their 
      families. This pledge builds upon the firm&#8217;s existing programs and 
      initiatives for military veterans focused on employment, education and 
      housing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s expanded pledge endorses the new collaborative effort 
      of the White House&#8217;s Joining Forces Initiative and philanthropic leaders 
      across the nation known as the Philanthropy-Joining Forces Impact 
      Pledge. The Philanthropy-Joining Forces Impact Pledge &#8211; initiated by the 
      Blue Shield of California Foundation, the Bristol Meyers Squibb 
      Foundation, the Lincoln Community Foundation and the McCormick 
      Foundation &#8211; creates a community of funders and builds momentum for 
      programs that will support service members, veterans and their families, 
      in local communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are honored to join with other leaders to support our nation&#8217;s 
      veterans and military families as they transition to civilian life,&#8221; 
      said Peter Scher, head of&#160;Corporate Responsibility for JPMorgan Chase. 
      &#8220;We believe this collaboration will make a dramatic difference for the 
      servicemembers and their families who have given so much for our nation.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase will earmark the $20 million for programs and initiatives 
      focused on employment, education and housing, which are designed to help 
      veterans and their families succeed after their military service ends. 
      The pledge includes a commitment to community partners that provide 
      direct services to the military and veteran populations through both 
      national and regional programming &#8211; as well as a continued commitment to 
      fund higher education programs for veterans and Syracuse University&#8217;s 
      Institute for Veterans and Military Families, which the firm co-founded 
      in 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen dramatic progress over the last three years since we 
      launched our military and veterans program and believe our renewed 
      promise will encourage more employers and institutions to join us in 
      supporting our nation&#8217;s best,&#8221; said Jim Cummings, global head of 
      Infrastructure Protection, Business Continuity and Military Affairs for 
      JPMorgan Chase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the firm&#8217;s philanthropic work,&#160;JPMorgan Chase in 2011 
      worked with 10 other companies to launch the 100,000 Jobs Mission, 
      promising to hire 100,000 veterans by 2020. Since then, the coalition 
      has grown to more than 150 companies, which have collectively hired more 
      than 117,000 veterans. That prompted the companies to double their 
      commitment &#8211; to hire a total of 200,000 veterans &#8211; and to expand their 
      efforts to include military spouses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase has hired more than 6,700 veterans since 2011. It has 
      also provided nearly 700 mortgage-free homes, amounting to more than 
      $104 million, to military families &#8211; often those with serious injuries &#8211; 
      through its nonprofit partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) is just an "interested observer" as U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N) battles to win British rival AstraZeneca (AZN.L) in a potential $100 billion deal, GSK's chief executive said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Witty said he hoped Pfizer would take a "rational" decision to keep drug research in Britain if the deal went through, but he played down the idea that GSK might intervene as a "white knight" counterbidder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not appropriate for me to get into commentary on this particular transaction that is potentially going on around us, but obviously if there was anything specific that we were thinking of I would absolutely be obliged to tell you about it," he told reporters on a conference call for first-quarter results on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witty has insisted for several years that he has no desire to engage in mega-mergers, which he sees as disruptive, and he reiterated that he much preferred targeted transactions, such as last week's asset swap with Novartis (NOVN.VX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we're focused on is ensuring that our organization is not distracted in the core R business," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca, Britain's second-biggest drugmaker behind GSK, is an important part of Britain's life sciences sector, employing nearly 7,000 staff in the country, and the prospect of it being acquired by Pfizer has sparked political concerns about big job cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has made two approaches to AstraZeneca, both of which have been rebuffed. The company is widely expected to come back with a revised offer before a May 26 deadline for it to "put up or shut up" under UK takeover rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. firm says it views Britain as an attractive location for both pharmaceutical research and manufacturing - helped by recent government tax incentives - but cannot make any firm commitments on future investment or jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witty, a long-time cheerleader for British science, who has also advised Prime Minister David Cameron on the country's university system, said Britain had established a particularly attractive environment for life sciences companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of that reflects efforts to reduce overall corporation tax rates, but the pharmaceuticals sector also enjoys a further boost thanks to the so-called "patent box" system, which came into effect last year and offers a special 10 percent tax rate on profits earned from patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would really hope that rational people under any circumstance would choose to invest or continue to invest where there is great talent and there is a great environment for that investment," Witty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's why we invest in Britain.

an "interested observer" as U.S. drugmaker Pfizer

tax rates, but the pharmaceuticals sector also enjoys a further

			Load DynamiX Storage Validation Solutions Adopted by Tolly Group to 
      Benchmark Performance Superiority of IBM FlexSystem and Sophos Products
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tolly Group relies on Load DynamiX for in-depth workload modeling and 
      unprecedented load generation capabilities to test new product 
      performance in virtualized environments
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Load DynamiX, the leader in storage infrastructure 
      performance validation, and Tolly Group, a leading provider of 
      independent IT product testing and validation services today announced 
      they have completed two performance validation reports, for IBM 
      Corporation and Sophos, that showcase the performance advantages of 
      their respective products. Using LoadDynamiX storage performance 
      validation appliances, Tolly recently tested the VM migration and 
      aggregate network performance of the IBM FlexSystem&#174; Network 
      Architecture and the VMware Server and VDI client application 
      performance of the Sophos Antivirus for vShield v1.0.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM commissioned the Tolly Group to benchmark the network capacity and 
      VM migration performance of its IBM Flex System. Testing was conducted 
      in a fully-loaded IBM Flex Server chassis running a VMware virtualized 
      environment and compared that solution with a similar configuration 
      using Cisco Systems Unified Computing System (UCS).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sophos commissioned the Tolly Group to evaluate its Antivirus for 
      vShield v1.0 solution and compare its performance to two other vShield 
      offerings: McAfee MOVE Agentless 3.0 and Trend Micro Deep Security 9. 
      Tests encompassed a range of VMware ESXi 5.5 and Microsoft Server 2008 
      virtual server applications including web, database and CIFS file 
      services. A virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environment with 120 
      Windows 7 enterprise virtual machines on was also evaluated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are seeing a strong trend toward testing the performance of storage 
      and network products when deployed in virtualized and cloud 
      infrastructures,&#8221; said Kevin Tolly, founder of The Tolly Group. &#8220;With 
      Load DynamiX storage workload modeling and performance validation 
      appliances, we can easily create apples-to-apples comparisons of 
      competitive solutions that will provide a new level of insight for IT 
      managers. Load DynamiX is the gold standard in the industry for 
      performance testing and validation and has become invaluable in testing 
      this new generation of products.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Load DynamiX is rapidly becoming the performance validation solution of 
      choice for both technology vendors and IT organizations within the 
      Global 2000,&#8221; stated Len Rosenthal, vice-president of marketing, Load 
      DynamiX. &#8220;The Tolly Group&#8217;s use of Load DynamiX to validate the 
      performance and scalability of solutions from IBM, Cisco, and Sophos is 
      further evidence of the versatility and broad adoption of Load DynamiX.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Load DynamiX will be exhibiting their products at EMC World 2014 in Las 
      Vegas May 5-8 in booth #642.

      NJ LEEP Honors Prudential General Counsel Susan Blount and Goldman Sachs 
      General Counsel Gregory Palm
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      What: The New Jersey Law and Education Empowerment Project, (NJ LEEP) 
      will honor Prudential Executive Vice President and General Counsel Susan 
      Blount and Gregory K. Palm, Executive Vice President and General Counsel 
      at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. for Stellar Corporate Leadership in 
      the Promotion of Diversity at its sixth annual Diversity in the 
      Legal Profession, Diversity in Leadership gala on April 30. The 
      event will be held at the Westin Jersey City Newport, Jersey City, N.J. 
      The event is sold-out.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Craig Livermore, Executive Director and Founder of NJ LEEP, said that 
      &#8220;We seek to honor strong partners who help ensure we have the resources 
      we need to send 100% of our graduates to college each year.&#8221; Mr. 
      Livermore went on to add that, &#8220;If not for our Gala raising over 
      $900,000 this year, a record for our organization, we would not be able 
      continue to expand our proven college-access model to serve greater 
      numbers of urban New Jersey high school students.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am very honored to be recognized by NJ LEEP,&#8221; Blount said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a 
      program that I&#8217;ve been involved with for a number of years, and one that 
      I&#8217;ve considered among my personal priorities. To the extent that through 
      this event, we can raise both awareness and resources for the program, 
      then we can help more kids get firmly on the pathway not just to 
      college, but to success in college and beyond.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each summer, Prudential hosts NJ LEEP high school students who have 
      expressed an interest in developing the skills and discipline for a 
      career in law. These NJ LEEP high school students work as interns for a 
      two week period and partner with LCBE associates on mock trials and 
      similar projects involving legal reasoning and analysis. Many members of 
      the Prudential team provide mentoring and support the internship 
      opportunities provided to NJ LEEP students each year. Blount is also a 
      member of the NJ LEEP board of trustees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jeffrey Isaacs, Managing Director and Global Chief Operating Officer of 
      the Legal Department at Goldman, Sachs  Co. and a Board Member of NJ 
      LEEP, said that &#8220;Goldman Sachs has consistently demonstrated a broad 
      commitment to diversity and educational enrichment programs for youth in 
      our local communities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Isaacs went on to emphasize the significant ties Goldman Sachs has 
      to the organization. &#8220;For several years, many of our professionals have

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - British lawmakers intend to
investigate U.S. drugmaker Pfizer's planned $100 billion
takeover of British rival AstraZeneca in a bid to ensure
scientific research and jobs are protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the parliamentary business, innovation and skills
committee are worried that the deal, which would be the
biggest-ever foreign acquisition of a British company, could
threaten the country's strategic interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are keen to look closely at it," committee member Ann
McKechin told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will see how events pan out over the next few days, but
clearly given the scale of the proposed merger it is important
that we consider the impact not just on shareholders but also on
employees and the wider interests of the UK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca, Britain's second-biggest drugmaker behind
GlaxoSmithKline, is an important part of the life
sciences sector and employs nearly 7,000 staff in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians are wary of foreign takeovers in the light of
Kraft's 2010 acquisition of Cadbury, when the U.S. food
group promised to keep open a key factory, only to go back on
the pledge soon after the deal was completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The committee previously had a great deal of concern over
the Cadbury takeover, so I think this is one we will really have
to closely analyse what is on offer," McKechin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer already has a tarnished reputation in Britain after
it announced plans in 2011 to shutter a major drug research site
in Sandwich, southern England, where Viagra was invented, with
the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. firm says it views Britain as an attractive
location for both pharmaceutical research and manufacturing -
helped by recent government tax incentives - but cannot make any
firm commitments on future investment or jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read is in Britain to lobby
politicians and investors about his plans. The government has so
far adopted a neutral stance on the matter, but behind the
scenes officials are warning Pfizer against making draconian
research job cuts, industry sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has made two approaches to AstraZeneca, both of which
have been rebuffed. The company is widely expected to come back
with a revised offer before a May 26 deadline for it to "put up
or shut up" under UK takeover rules.

      Research and Markets: Global Business Intelligence (BI) and Analytics 
      Platforms Market 2014-2018: IBM Corp., Oracle Corp., SAP AG, and SAS 
      Institute Dominate
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/kmxzsd/global_business) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Business Intelligence (BI) and Analytics Platforms Market 2014-2018" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global BI and Analytics Platform market to grow at a CAGR of 8% to 
      2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The adoption of SaaS-based BI and analytics platform applications is 
      expected to grow rapidly in the near future. The traditional on-premise 
      deployment of BI tools is slowly being taken over by single and 
      multi-tenant hosted SaaS. These solutions are increasingly becoming 
      popular options for deploying enterprise software. In addition to the 
      increased adoption of SaaS-based solutions by SMEs, they are gradually 
      being used by large enterprises. The software available over the 
      internet in a subscription model provides increased flexibility to 
      organizations using SaaS-based software. Furthermore, many vendors in 
      the market have begun to offer their BI and analytics platform tools 
      through the SaaS model to expand their services and enter new markets. 
      In addition, the difficult economic times have required organizations to 
      adopt SaaS as a cost-cutting alternative.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one major driver is the increasing volume of 
      information generated from enterprise applications. This data must be 
      accessible as part of or as an extension to the corporate information 
      framework and be made available for analysis and decision making. BI and 
      analytics platform tools are useful in the retrieval and analysis of 
      this growing amount of diverse data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the difficulty in validating the 
      accuracy of the underlying data is one of the major challenges 
      confronting this market. The data which enterprises use for extracting 
      information is gathered in different times, from different scenarios 
      causing difficulty in validating its accuracy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROCHELLE PARK, N.J., April 30, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - The RFU (Rugby Football Union) is the governing body of rugby in England and, with a Rugby World Cup on home soil fast approaching in 2015, they recognised an opportunity to invest in their technology, improve internal communications and support their work in creating a lasting legacy from the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The RFU has a 550-strong workforce helping to grow rugby within clubs, schools and universities, right the way through to professional level. With its headquarters in the 82,000-seater Twickenham Stadium and a large team operating from geographically dispersed locations around the country, they needed a new robust intranet platform that would bring colleagues, information and resources together in a single digital location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	With a strong understanding of what they wanted to achieve through a new intranet solution, the RFU had to find the right partners to collaborate with on such an ambitious project. After assessing their needs and options, the RFU decided to work with BrightStarr and Microsoft to deploy SharePoint 2013 and Yammer. The final solution of this collaboration can be viewed now on the Microsoft EU website via the Executive Video Case Study. "The initial Customer Immersion Experience gave us a great opportunity to get to know our partners and what they could deliver for us in our project. It was really useful to get round a table and see how the technology would work in our intranet, through an exploration of some realistic working scenarios." Tom Brewis &#8211; RFU Project Manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The RFU selected SharePoint 2013 as their trusted platform of choice, and they chose BrightStarr to help them take the out of the box functionality and transform it into a bespoke collaboration solution, specifically tailored to their needs. With their close working relationship with Microsoft, BrightStarr were able to not only carry out effective requirement gathering to discover deep insights, but were also able to match up these requirements to powerful SharePoint capabilities. It was this collaboration that led to the creation of the RFU's new HR portal, document library and all company news feed, which formed the core of their new intranet solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The solution was also created with Enterprise Social tools at its heart, to match the RFU's culture, which in turn reflects the core values of the sport itself: Teamwork, Respect, Enjoyment, Discipline and Sportsmanship. The social features of Yammer gave both office and field-based staff new ways to share information with each other. Their intranet used embedded feeds from key Yammer groups to surface social content alongside the more traditional static information. Together with a new internal phonebook, the platform has really supported greater information sharing, collaboration and an increasingly connected workforce. BrightStarr has produced a brand new whitepaper on the productive nature of Corporate Social Networks and how they can deliver real return on investment, which can be downloaded for free here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Working with the right partners was essential to the success of RFU's intranet project and gave them the right balance of knowledge, expertise and technology to build 'RFU Connected,' an intranet solution fit for purpose. The quality of this solution is what led to the production of an Executive Video Case Study on how project success was achieved through this partnership. "It is incredibly useful to be able to work so closely with Microsoft's Office and Yammer teams as we implement their technologies for our clients. We gain key insights collaborating with them that guide us in delivering world class solutions time and time again, and this is why BrightStarr is a Microsoft Gold Partner.' &#8211; Will Saville &#8211; BrightStarr CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
