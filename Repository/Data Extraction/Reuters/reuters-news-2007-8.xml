&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. said on Wednesday it will offer a free, advertising-supported version of its basic productivity software, Microsoft Works, as part of a test program with computers manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker has been pondering the future of Microsoft Works, its basic spreadsheet and word processing software, in the face of rising competition from Google Inc.'s suite of business software services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Google Docs and Spreadsheets, which are delivered through an Internet browser, Microsoft plans to pre-install Works on computers and display advertisements stored in cache. The software normally retails for $39.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a user connects to the Internet while using Works, that cache of ads will refresh, said Melissa Stern, a Microsoft senior product manager in the Office group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company plans to roll out the advertising-supported Microsoft Works SE 9 in a few months. Microsoft would not disclose either the PC makers with which it was working or the markets for the test program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and other Internet rivals are threatening to topple Microsoft's dominant position in desktop software with software services delivered over the Web supported by advertising or subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has said the company needs to embrace the "software as a service" movement without abandoning its bread-and-butter desktop products. The company has invested heavily in its Web advertising business with the goal of building a powerhouse to rival Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the goals of the test program is to figure out if there is a viable business model for advertising supported software, Stern said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comments, details from conference call)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Aug 1 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N)
reported a 4.7 percent increase in net profit on Wednesday, driven
by strong television program sales and higher receipts at its
theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also announced on Wednesday it had purchased kids'
virtual world Club Penguin for $350 million in cash plus up to
$350 million more depending on the Web site's earnings in 2008 and
2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger said he expects the Club,
in which children control, dress and communicate through animated
penguin avatars who live in an icy virtual world, to begin
contributing to the company's bottom line in its first year as
Disney's Club Penguin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney, which runs the ABC and ESPN TV networks and produces
shows through its ABC Studios division, said its fiscal third
quarter net income from continuing operations rose to $1.196
billion, or 58 cents a share, from $1.095 billion, or 51 cents a
share one year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 58 cents per share topped the average analyst forecast of
55 cents according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue rose 7 percent to $9.045 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst David Miller of SMH Capital said Disney shares often
fall following a pre-earnings run up. Shares had closed up 2.5
percent for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The company is firing on all cylinders. The fundamentals
remain very good. If you believe in the earnings power for the
media networks in fiscal '08 then the stock looks very cheap,"
Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares were off slightly in after-hours trading at
$33.66 from a close of $33.83 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pali Capital analyst Rich Greenfield also described the
quarterly results as better than expected but questioned whether
the company could continue to grow at the pace it set in fiscal
2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Still unanswered coming out of the conference call ... is how
it plans to deal with increasingly difficult comparisons going
into 2008," Greenfield said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he said the Club Penguin acquisition "fits perfectly ...
from a strategic standpoint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Burbank, California-based Disney said operating income in its
Media Networks group, which includes ABC, ESPN and cable TV
networks such as The Disney Channel, grew 6 percent to $3.8
billion and operating income was up 23 percent to $1.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cable TV networks group saw operating income gain $88
million to $1.1 billion primarily due to growth at all-sports
network ESPN and domestic cable TV networks. ESPN produced higher
revenues from affiliates and better subscriber growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Operating income from TV broadcasting increased $165 million
to $295 million. Much of the gain came from sales of ABC Studios
programs, as well as lower production expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said ESPN will
recognize $185 million more in deferred revenue in the fourth
quarter than a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PARKS PERK UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parks and Resorts, which includes the Walt Disney World park
in Florida, saw revenue rise 6 percent to $2.9 billion and
operating income gain 13 percent to $621 million. Walt Disney
World saw higher spending and attendance gains, mainly from
domestic visitors. Higher ticket prices helped boost Disneyland
revenues in Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the fourth quarter, attendance trends at the domestic parks
so far were "roughly flat" and room reservations were pacing
low-double digit percentages ahead of last year's fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's movie studio, which released hit "Pirates of the
Caribbean: At World's End" and animated comedy "Ratatouille"
toward the end of the quarter, saw revenues rise 4 percent to $1.8
billion but operating income plunged 20 percent to $192 million
due mostly to lower DVD sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs noted that studio faces fourth-quarter comparisons with
"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest", which is the
third-best selling film in box office history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumer products sales rose 23 percent to $549 million and
operating income was up 12 percent at $118 million, driven by
revenue from self-published video games and "Cars" merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the quarter, Disney repurchased about 55 million shares
for $1.9 billion, bringing its fiscal year buybacks to 180 million
shares at $6.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares traded between $36.55 and $33.40 during its
fiscal third quarter, at a price-to-earnings ratio of 15.8 times
estimated fiscal 2008 earnings. Shares of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N)
traded at 16.5 times estimated 2008 earnings, and Viacom Inc
VIA.N traded at a multiple of 14.7.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Aug 1 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) Chief

&lt;p&gt; "Looking ahead to fourth quarter, combined domestic

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Rights to O.J. Simpson's hypothetical 
book "If I Did It" passed to relatives of murder victim Ron 
Goldman on Monday as a federal judge approved their settlement 
with a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lawyers for the Goldmans said they would seek to capitalize 
on the book by arranging new publishing, film or TV deals to 
help satisfy a $33.5 million wrongful death judgment won by the 
family against Simpson in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The book was billed as a hypothetical account of how the 
former football star could have carried out the 1994 slayings 
of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The News Corp.-owned publishing house, HarperCollins, 
scrapped the book in November before its planned release amid a 
torrent of public outrage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, who originally joined in 
condemning "If I Did It" as the shameful exploitation of his 
son's murder, has since waged a campaign to collect any money 
generated by the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simpson was acquitted of criminal charges at the end of a 
sensational murder trial in 1995 but was found liable for the 
deaths his ex-wife and Goldman two years later in a civil case 
brought by the victims' families. He has vowed to never 
voluntarily pay the damages rendered against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, a California judge ordered rights to his 
book put up for public bidding to benefit the Goldmans' claims. 
The auction was canceled in April when Lorraine Brooke 
Associates, a company set up in the name of Simpson's children 
to collect his reported $1 million book advance, declared 
bankruptcy in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Jay Cristol ruled in June 
that Lorraine Brooke Associates was a shell company formed to 
conceal Simpson's book earnings from the Goldmans, paving the 
way for them to pursue their claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the settlement hammered out by lawyers earlier this 
month and approved by Cristol on Monday, the Goldmans obtained 
all rights to the book, and to Simpson's name and likeness in 
connection with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those rights will now be held in the name of Ron Goldman 
LLC, a new entity that "will market the book under the true 
crime genre," family lawyer David Cook told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cook said he has received several inquiries about the book 
from literary agents in recent weeks, and the Goldmans were 
considering changing the title to "I Did It," or possibly 
"Confessions of a Double Murderer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Relatives of Simpson's ex-wife, who had not previously 
pursued a claim to his book, made an 11th-hour request for a 
share of proceeds gained by Ron Goldman LLC, but the judge 
denied their plea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the settlement, the Goldmans must pay the 
court-appointed bankruptcy trustee for Lorraine Brooke 
Associates 10 percent of the first $4 million in gross proceeds 
and a percentage of all proceeds beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of that money will go toward the $24 million 
settlement the Brown family won from Simpson on behalf of his 
two children with Nicole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I guess this is the start of the book tour," Cook said. 
"You'll find justice in the true crime section of the local 
bookstore."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Purported excerpts from the manuscript surfaced in recent 
months in Newsweek magazine and on the celebrity Web site 
TMZ.com, but Cook said it remained to be seen how that would 
affect the book's commercial appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On one hand we suffered an impact of dilution, but the 
story was also disseminated to a large audience who had not 
heard of any of the contents," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Nielsen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A weak dollar, confident consumers 
and a new television ratings system could buttress Walt Disney 
Co's (DIS.N) performance this year, analysts said ahead of the 
company's third quarter results announcement on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Most analysts expect Disney's broadcast and cable business, 
the largest contributor to revenue and operating income, to 
fuel a fifth straight year of double-digit growth in operating 
income, and for its theme parks to contribute at least modestly 
to the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, expect net earnings of 56 cents per 
share and revenue of $9.04 billion for the quarter, according 
to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The weak dollar could be attracting greater numbers of 
European travelers to Walt Disney World Resort, which generates 
about 80 percent of the theme parks division's revenue and 
operating income, said SMH Capital analyst David Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would say that folks are going to be pleasantly 
surprised by the performance of parks in the June quarter," 
Miller said. "It wouldn't surprise us to see Disney clock in 
with mid-single digit revenue growth at the parks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect big things from Disney Consumer Products, 
its smallest business, which said earlier this year it would 
see record-breaking global retail sales of $26 billion in 
fiscal 2007. Disney receives royalties and other revenue equal 
to a low double-digit percentage of retail sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This segment should be up nicely," Bank of America analyst 
Jonathan Jacoby said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite generally upbeat expectations for fiscal 2007, 
which ends September 30, some, including UBS analyst Michael 
Morris, cautioned Disney was "highly exposed" to risk from a 
slowing economy or consumer weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miller also said three of the company's business were 
"highly tethered to the economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The stock price could be affected by any measurable 
economic downturn ... but aside from housing, the economy is 
good," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Data released on Tuesday by the Confidence Board showed 
U.S. consumer confidence in July rising to a near-six-year high 
and that most U.S. consumers expect business conditions, income 
and employment to remain the same in the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the third quarter, Walt Disney Studios faces tough 
comparisons with last year, which included the top-selling DVD 
release of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and 
the Wardrobe." But the studio's performance should benefit 
later this year when their costs are accounted for, from 
"Ratatouille" and the third "Pirates of the Caribbean," and on 
lower costs from a smaller film slate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two films, released in May and June, have racked up 
$1.16 billion so far at global box offices and are expected to 
be released on DVD in Disney's fiscal 2008 first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the ABC network could enjoy momentum in the 
quarter and back half of the year from hit shows such as 
"Grey's Anatomy" and "Ugly Betty," which continue to deliver 
strong advertising and syndication revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cable networks, especially ESPN and the Disney Channel, 
were seen as strong drivers of affiliate fees and subscriber 
growth, with ESPN delivering deferred revenue in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's TV business could see an upside starting this fall 
from political advertising and from a new audience measuring 
system that counts viewers who record shows and watch them 
later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman Bros. analyst Anthony DiClemente said Disney appears 
to have benefited from the new ratings system, which pushed up 
prices during this year's advance advertising sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 2 (Reuters) - The top two executives at Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc (CCE.N) have increased their holdings in the company, just days after the bottler posted strong quarterly results and raised its outlook for the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company's president and chief executive, John Brock, purchased 5,260 shares of the company, while chief financial officer William Douglas purchased 10,000 shares, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Both executives made their purchases on Tuesday, according to the filings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Brock took over as CEO of the largest bottler of Coca-Cola drinks last year and has been buying stock ever since. The purchase was his third since early March and brought his holdings in the company to more than 30,000 shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For Douglas, who joined the company in 2004, the purchase was his first on the open market, according to filing tracking Web site InsiderScore.com. His prior holdings had been in the form of restricted stock, according to InsiderScore.com. The purchase this week brought Douglas' stake in the company to about 94,000 shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last week, the company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, citing cost controls, price increases in North America and a weaker dollar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is about 36 percent owned by Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), were little changed at $22.60 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (Reporting by Emily Chasan) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Andre Grenon; Reuters Messaging: rm://emily.chasan.reuters.com@reuters.net +1 646 223 6114)) Keywords: COCACOLAENTERPRISES STOCK/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 2 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N)
Sakhalin-1 oil and gas production facility suffered no damage
from a series of three earthquakes at the island off Russia's
eastern coast, the company said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "From the information we have received to date, there has
been no impact on Sakhalin-1 personnel or facilities," an Exxon
Mobil spokeswoman said in an email response to a query.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two people were reported dead after the quakes, and the
Japanese Meteorological Agency registered the first quake with
a preliminary magnitude of 6.4 off Sakhalin Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil previously said the facility was near to
producing at its capacity of 250,000 barrels of oil per day.
The U.S.-based oil giant's partners in the project are Russian
state-controlled oil firm Rosneft (ROSN.MM), India's ONGC
(ONGC.BO) and Japanese consortium Sodeco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Matt Daily)

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. said on Wednesday it will offer a free, advertising-supported version of its basic productivity software, Microsoft Works, as part of a test program with computers manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker has been pondering the future of Microsoft Works, its basic spreadsheet and word processing software, in the face of rising competition from Google Inc.'s suite of business software services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Google Docs and Spreadsheets, which are delivered through an Internet browser, Microsoft plans to pre-install Works on computers and display advertisements stored in cache. The software normally retails for $39.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a user connects to the Internet while using Works, that cache of ads will refresh, said Melissa Stern, a Microsoft senior product manager in the Office group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company plans to roll out the advertising-supported Microsoft Works SE 9 in a few months. Microsoft would not disclose either the PC makers with which it was working or the markets for the test program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and other Internet rivals are threatening to topple Microsoft's dominant position in desktop software with software services delivered over the Web supported by advertising or subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has said the company needs to embrace the "software as a service" movement without abandoning its bread-and-butter desktop products. The company has invested heavily in its Web advertising business with the goal of building a powerhouse to rival Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the goals of the test program is to figure out if there is a viable business model for advertising supported software, Stern said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds analysts, details in paragraphs 7-12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tanya Mosolova&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW Aug 2 (Reuters) - Moscow wants Exxon Mobil (XOM.N)
to ship gas from Sakhalin to Russia rather than Asian markets,
the energy ministry said on Thursday, signalling a new round of
pressure on the country's last big foreign-led energy project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The state representatives informed the investors'
consortium about Russia's priority to supply gas from Sakhalin-1
to the domestic market," the ministry said in a statement
following a meeting of Sakhalin-1's supervisory committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon signed a preliminary agreement in 2004 to supply 8
billion cubic metres (bcm) of Sakhalin-1 gas to China's CNPC but
it has also held talks with Japan and India, which want to
import Sakhalin's gas as liquefied natural gas (LNG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM), which has monopoly right to
export Russian gas, asked the government in June to block the
plan saying it would create shortage on the Russian domestic
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given Gazprom's strong positions on Sakhalin, I would not
be surprised if it gets what it wants," said Igor Kurinnyy from
ING.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom boosted its positions on Sakhalin last year when it
obtained control over the nearby Sakhalin-2 project, forcing the
previous leader Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) to cede control
following months of state pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That deal was followed this year by Gazprom's purchase of
control in Kovykta, a huge East Siberian gas field, previously
led by BP's (BP.L) Russian vehicle. Both moves are seen as part
of a broader Kremlin drive to strengthen its grip over economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's Sakhalin is a rare production sharing project
between foreign investors and the Russia state, which are not
governed by Gazprom's export monopoly, which prompted the two
firms to start talks over the future gas flows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have speculated Gazprom may want to force Exxon to
sell gas at knock down prices to bring it to the LNG plant and
liquefy for exports to Asia. Gazprom has said it is in talks
with Exxon about buying all of Sakhalin-1 gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has repeatedly said it wanted to focus on exports but
Kurinnyy said that switching to domestic sales would not be a
huge blow given Russian government's plan to gradually
liberalise gas prices by 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It (exports) is better in terms of prices, of course, but
given that gas prices will rise in Russia gradually, losses
should not be too big," Kurinnyy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russia wants to allow prices to more than double to $110 per
1,000 cubic metres for industrial customers by 2011, which would
roughly correspond to Gazprom's current export prices net of
export fees and transportation costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom, which supplies a quarter of Europe's gas needs,
charges its Western customers an average of $260 per 1,000 cubic
metres. It also wants to build two major pipelines to China and
grab a substantial share of U.S. and Pacific LNG markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sakhalin-1 also involves Russian state-controlled Rosneft
(ROSN.MM), India's ONGC (ONGC.BO) and Japan's Sodeco.

&lt;p&gt;DHAKA Aug 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Chevron (CVX.N) has doubled
its gas production capacity at the Bibiyana gas field in
northeast Bangladesh, a senior official of the firm said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Although our present production capacity is 300 million
cubic feet per day (MMCFD), our real production ranges between
250 mmcfd and 270 mmcfd, subject  to the demand from the
state-run Petrobangla," Steve Wilson, president of Chevron in
Bangladesh, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron started gas exploration at its newly discovered
field last March, initially boosting daily supply by around 250
million cubic feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibiyana is the country's second biggest gas field, with an
estimated reserve of 5.5 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of gas and
30.7 million barrels of condensate, energy officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bangladesh's biggest gas field Titas, east of the capital
Dhaka, has 8.0 TCF estimated reserve, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron also produces from two other gas fields in Jalalabad
and Moulavi Bazar, also in Bangladesh's northeast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has invested $820 million in Bangladesh, making it the
biggest investor in the energy sector there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Over the next five years we have significant plans to
invest more. We will further expand our business in all the gas
fields along with new ventures," a Chevron official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has already carried out a seismic survey in block 7
in the southwest region of Bangladesh, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other partners of the block is British Cairn Energy
(CNE.L) and state-owned oil company BAPEX. Both Cairn and
Chevron own 45 percent stakes each, with BAPEX holding the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have completed our seismic survey safely, but more work
needs to be done to value the whole opportunity," Wilson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is the block's operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron now favours selling its gas into the local market,
rather than exporting it to India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are happy with the domestic market since over the last
seven years the demand (of energy) grew up to 17 percent,"
Wilson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see a vibrant economy in Bangladesh," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dhaka says it has saved about $5.49 billion in the fiscal
year to June 2006 by using own natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bangladesh produces 1.66 billion cubic feet of gas per day,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its current proven gas reserves are 8.26 trillion cubic feet
(TCF) and total reserves are 13.54 TCF, including the probable
reserves, energy officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=68.50)

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Aug 2 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the top
oil producer in Indonesia, said on Thursday its oil output in
the country may decline by 6 percent in 2008 from an average of
415,000 barrel per day in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Indonesia's president director, Suwito Anggoro,
told reporters the decline would come after a 7-8 percent fall
in production this year compared to 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our fields are old, we are just trying to slow down the
decline in the output by increasing investment. It is difficult
to increase our output," Anggoro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia has struggled to maintain production and became a
net crude oil importer for the first time last year, an energy
ministry official had said, as OPEC's second-smallest member in
terms of output has failed to tap new oilfields fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said in June it planned to launch an enhanced oil
recovery project in the Minas field in a bid to boost
production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's plan over the next decade is of particular
interest to the market given the status of Minas crude as a

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABUJA Aug 3 (Reuters) - Pfizer (PFE.N) has asked a Nigerian court to disregard an experts' report into drug tests it conducted on Nigerian children in 1996 and which are now the subject of four court cases, the company said on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Nigerian federal government and the northern state of Kano are suing Pfizer for a total of about $8.5 billion in damages and also pressing criminal charges over what they say was unethical testing of Trovan, an antibiotic drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nigerian authorities allege that the tests, conducted in Kano during a meningitis outbreak, caused the deaths of 11 children and permanent health problems for many others. Pfizer denies the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The two civil and two criminal cases launched since May in federal and Kano state courts have so far gone from one adjournment to the next without tackling the substantive issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said on Friday it had filed an application at the Federal High Court in Abuja seeking to quash the report of a Nigerian investigating committee on the Trovan tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The thrust of the application is that the committee report, on which the federal and Kano state governments based all their four suits against Pfizer, (is) illegal and inaccurate," said a statement issued on Pfizer's behalf by a public relations firm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The statement said the committee was not independent from government and was chaired by a Federal Ministry of Health doctor who had objected to the tests at the time and was therefore biased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It also said Pfizer's representatives had not been given a chance to hear the witnesses who testified before the committee and had not been shown the report when it was completed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Government lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer had already filed a statement of defence at the Kano High Court last month which said the investigating committee had disregarded important points about the Trovan tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Pfizer maintains that before conducting the Trovan study in Kano, it sought and obtained all necessary approvals from relevant federal and state government agencies," Friday's statement said, adding that the firm had 12 letters to prove it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Pfizer also states that the results of the study plainly proved that Trovan helped save lives," the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "With a survival rate of 94.4 percent, Trovan was at least as effective as the best treatment available at Kano's Infectious Disease Hospital.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. reported a 4.7 
percent increase in net profit on Wednesday, driven by strong 
television program sales and higher receipts at its theme 
parks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company also announced on Wednesday it had purchased 
kids' virtual world Club Penguin for $350 million in cash plus 
up to $350 million more depending on the Web site's earnings in 
2008 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger said he expects the 
Club, in which children control, dress and communicate through 
animated penguin avatars who live in an icy virtual world, to 
begin contributing to the company's bottom line in its first 
year as Disney's Club Penguin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney, which runs the ABC and ESPN TV networks and 
produces shows through its ABC Studios division, said its 
fiscal third quarter net income from continuing operations rose 
to $1.196 billion, or 58 cents a share, from $1.095 billion, or 
51 cents a share one year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 58 cents per share topped the average analyst forecast 
of 55 cents according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue rose 7 percent to $9.045 billion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst David Miller of SMH Capital said Disney shares 
often fall following a pre-earnings run up. Shares had closed 
up 2.5 percent for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The company is firing on all cylinders. The fundamentals 
remain very good. If you believe in the earnings power for the 
media networks in fiscal '08 then the stock looks very cheap," 
Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares were off slightly in after-hours trading at 
$33.66 from a close of $33.83 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pali Capital analyst Rich Greenfield also described the 
quarterly results as better than expected but questioned 
whether the company could continue to grow at the pace it set 
in fiscal 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Still unanswered coming out of the conference call ... is 
how it plans to deal with increasingly difficult comparisons 
going into 2008," Greenfield said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he said the Club Penguin acquisition "fits perfectly 
... from a strategic standpoint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Burbank, California-based Disney said operating income in 
its Media Networks group, which includes ABC, ESPN and cable TV 
networks such as The Disney Channel, grew 6 percent to $3.8 
billion and operating income was up 23 percent to $1.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cable TV networks group saw operating income gain $88 
million to $1.1 billion primarily due to growth at all-sports 
network ESPN and domestic cable TV networks. ESPN produced 
higher revenues from affiliates and better subscriber growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Operating income from TV broadcasting increased $165 
million to $295 million. Much of the gain came from sales of 
ABC Studios programs, as well as lower production expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said ESPN will 
recognize $185 million more in deferred revenue in the fourth 
quarter than a year earlier.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PARKS PERK UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parks and Resorts, which includes the Walt Disney World 
park in Florida, saw revenue rise 6 percent to $2.9 billion and 
operating income gain 13 percent to $621 million. Walt Disney 
World saw higher spending and attendance gains, mainly from 
domestic visitors. Higher ticket prices helped boost Disneyland 
revenues in Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the fourth quarter, attendance trends at the domestic 
parks so far were "roughly flat" and room reservations were 
pacing low-double digit percentages ahead of last year's fourth 
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's movie studio, which released hit "Pirates of 
the Caribbean: At World's End" and animated comedy 
"Ratatouille" toward the end of the quarter, saw revenues rise 
4 percent to $1.8 billion but operating income plunged 20 
percent to $192 million due mostly to lower DVD sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs noted that studio faces fourth-quarter comparisons 
with "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," which is the 
third-best selling film in box office history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumer products sales rose 23 percent to $549 million and 
operating income was up 12 percent at $118 million, driven by 
revenue from self-published video games and "Cars" merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the quarter, Disney repurchased about 55 million 
shares for $1.9 billion, bringing its fiscal year buybacks to 
180 million shares at $6.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares traded between $36.55 and $33.40 during its 
fiscal third quarter, at a price-to-earnings ratio of 15.8 
times estimated fiscal 2008 earnings. Shares of Time Warner Inc 
traded at 16.5 times estimated 2008 earnings, and Viacom Inc 
traded at a multiple of 14.7.&lt;/p&gt;

Pfizer said on Friday it had filed an application at the Federal High Court in Abuja seeking to quash the report of a Nigerian investigating committee on the Trovan tests.          The thrust of the application is that the committee report, on which the federal and Kano state governments based all their four suits against Pfizer, (is) illegal and inaccurate, said a statement issued on Pfizer's behalf by a public relations firm.          The statement said the committee was not independent from government and was chaired by a Federal Ministry of Health doctor who had objected to the tests at the time and was therefore biased.          It also said Pfizer's representatives had not been given a chance to hear the witnesses who testified before the committee and had not been shown the report when it was completed.          Government lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.          Pfizer had already filed a statement of defence at the Kano High Court last month which said the investigating committee had disregarded important points about the Trovan tests.          Pfizer maintains that before conducting the Trovan study in Kano, it sought and obtained all necessary approvals from relevant federal and state government agencies, Friday's statement said, adding that the firm had 12 letters to prove it.          Pfizer also states that the results of the study plainly proved that Trovan helped save lives, the statement said.          With a survival rate of 94.4 percent, Trovan was at least as effective as the best treatment available at Kano's Infectious Disease Hospital. The overall survival rate in Nigeria was less than 90 percent, it said.

&lt;p&gt;WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski on Saturday brushed off news the United States had dropped visa requirements for Estonians and Czechs but not Poles, some of Washington's closest allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight ex-communist countries, which joined the European Union in 2004, have long pressed Washington to include their citizens in a visa waiver program enjoyed by western European states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States currently waives its visa requirements only for foreign travelers from countries that have met benchmarks, including a low rate of people overstaying visas, which Kaczynski emphasized Poles have not achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Poles are still not coming back from the United States on time and we're all paying for this," Kaczynski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poland and the Czech Republic, which sent troops to Iraq and are considering hosting a part of a U.S. missile defense shield. Both have seen visa-free status as one benefit of closer ties with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not right," said Michal Szukala, a 21-year-old history student. "In view of our allied support of the Untied States, Poles should be treated a bit differently."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not fair. If the Czechs are admitted then we should be too," said Halina Kozlowska, 40, a supermarket cashier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister Przemyslaw Gosiewski also played down Poland's exclusion from the visa waiver program, saying Poles weren't interested in going to the U.S. any longer now they can work legally in many European Union states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't really concern me," said Darek Maciejewski, a 22-year-old lorry driver. "I'm not planning to go there. If I did go abroad it would be to England or Ireland."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, Fla. Aug 5 (Reuters) - Walt Disney World in
Orlando hiked ticket prices on Sunday and raised the cost of a
one-day, one-park admission to $71 plus tax, a 6 percent
increase, according to the company's Web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The change came almost a year to the day after the last
price increase at the Walt Disney Co.'s (DIS.N) Florida parks
in August 2006, when the basic admission ticket sold for $67
plus tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The price increase varied for customized ticket packages
purchased under Disney's "Magic Your Way" program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney World spokesmen did not return calls for comment
during the weekend. Traditionally, price hikes at Disney are
followed quickly by increases at nearby SeaWorld, which is
owned by Anheuser-Busch (BUD.N), and Universal Orlando, which
is part of the NBC Universal company controlled by General
Electric (GE.N).

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday threw out a record $1.5 billion verdict against Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), ruling the world's largest software had not infringed on audio technology patents held by France's Alcatel-LucentALU.PA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the reversal was a victory for other technology companies who could have been at risk to patent infringement charges if Alcatel won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal jury in San Diego ruled in February that Microsoft had violated two patents related to MP3 audio files and handed Alcatel-Lucent the largest-ever damages award in a U.S. patent case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MP3 is the standard digital music format, which allows audio to be compressed so that it can be easily played on computers, mobile phones or digital music players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court heard a post-trial motion on July 25 and 26 when Microsoft asked for the verdict to be reversed, a new trial or dramatic reduction in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Rudi Brewster said in a 43-page order that the jury's damages could not stand because Microsoft had not violated one of the two patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge also called into question the second patent claim in the case, saying that Microsoft licensed the technology from German research organization Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, a co-owner of the patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Court finds that the jury's verdict of infringement was against the clear weight of evidence," Brewster wrote in his opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcatel-Lucent spokeswoman Mary Ward said the reversal was "shocking and disturbing" and the company planned to appeal the latest decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said there will no new trial unless the French networking company appeals the decision to the U.S. Federal Circuit Court and succeeds in overturning the San Diego court's ruling. Even if that is the case, damages from the original ruling will not be reinstated, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts and lawyers said the jury's ruling had left other providers of hardware and software that support MP3 files vulnerable to claims from Alcatel-Lucent. Those companies included Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) and Sony Corp. (6758.T)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's ruling by the judge reversing the jury's $1.52 billion verdict against Microsoft is a victory for consumers of digital music and a triumph for common sense in the patent system," said Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PATENT BATTLES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intellectual property lawyers said the jury's $1.5 billion ruling -- based on an award of 0.5 percent of global personal computer sales since around mid-2003 -- was bound to be lowered after a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By a 7-1 vote, the justices overturned a ruling that Microsoft should be held liable for patent infringement on copies of the Windows operating system sold overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some modification to the jury verdict was inevitable in light of the recent landmark Supreme Court decision," said Alan Fisch, an intellectual-property attorney at Kaye Scholer LLP in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Alcatel-Lucent are locked in a number of patent disputes, including a suit over the video-decoding technology in Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game console&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software maker also joined Dell Inc. DELL.O and Gateway GTW.N to fight a suit brought by Lucent over a group of four patent cases involving user interface technology in Windows technology licensed by those hardware manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on Microsoft's 9.4 billion shares outstanding, the original damages ruling could have cost the company about 16 cents per share. Shares of Microsoft closed up 58 cents at $29.54 in Monday Nasdaq trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando in New York and Peter Henderson in Los Angeles)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns, the fifth largest Wall Street broker dealer by market value, has been cited as a potential takeover target after its leading position in mortgage trading has proven to be a liability as the subprime home loan market suffers from big delinquencies. Bear's shares have fallen 30 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bear Stearns BSC.N would likely prefer not to sell itself when its shares trade at such a low valuation, and there are few obvious buyers that would be a perfect cultural or business fit, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the company's stock down ... and liquidity concerns swirling around it, the senior management and board of directors could be contemplating how to quickly stabilize the situation," wrote CreditSights analyst David Hendler in a note. Selling could be an option, Hendler added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia Corp WB.N would "probably jump at this opportunity," Hendler wrote, yet it is tied up with its acquisition of mid-sized brokerage AG Edwards Inc AGE.N, which is slated to close in the fourth quarter, and California thrift Golden West, which closed in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) might also be interested, analysts said. JPMorgan Chase might be interested in Bear Stearns' global clearing business, which includes one of the top-ranked prime brokerage businesses in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is much smaller in the prime brokerage business -- or financing and clearing trades for hedge funds -- than many of its peers and acquiring the Bear Stearns unit could be a way to quickly boost that business, said Lee Delaporte, analyst at Dreman Value Management, which has $22 billion of assets under management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America might also be interested in bolstering its investment banking operations, which are less robust than Citigroup's or JPMorgan Chase's, said an investor who asked not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wachovia declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Bear-managed hedge funds that invested in subprime- linked securities have shut down and a third had to close redemptions from investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company held a conference call on Friday to assure investors of its viability, but said the shock waves hitting lending markets were the worst in more than 20 years. Bear also announced the departure of its co-president Warren Spector, on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WATCHING EVERY CLIP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internationally, HSBC might be a good cultural fit for Bear, because both are run by managers keen on cost control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're talking about two companies where management saves every paper clip," said James Ellman, a portfolio manager at financial services hedge fund Seacliff Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But HSBC is also wrestling with its own exposure to the U.S. subprime market. The bank took a charge for bad debts of $6.35 billion in the first half of the year, up 63 percent. A spokeswoman for HSBC declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns has spoken to China-based investors about buying an equity stake or setting up a joint venture, according to the Wall Street Journal. But multiple U.S. banks are pursuing that avenue now, and Bear may not be the most attractive to the Chinese, the paper added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about Bear's subprime exposure will likely keep most U.S. investment banks away and may keep everyone away until more clarity emerges about the full cost of Bear's exposure to subprime mortgages, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selling at this juncture also might be difficult for Bear's managers to stomach. As of March, Chairman and Chief Executive James Cayne owned about 6 percent of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares rose 5 percent on Monday to close at $113.81, or about 1.2 times their May 31 book value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why would they sell at one times book if they can wait a few years and sell at two times book?" Ellman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dreman's Delaporte noted that book values may be declining if Bear writes down subprime assets, making price-to-book ratios higher than they appear now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The unknown right now is, what is their book value?" Delaporte said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Monday that 
U.S. regulators approved its AIDS drug, Selzentry, the first in 
a new class of oral HIV medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Selzentry is the first drug designed to keep the HIV virus 
that causes AIDS from entering healthy immune cells. Older AIDS 
medicines attack the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug, also known as maraviroc, blocks the CCR5 
co-receptor that serves as a main doorway for the HIV virus 
into immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Selzentry 
for use in patients who have tried other medicines and for 
those for whom a diagnostic test has confirmed their HIV strain 
is linked to the CCR5 receptor. About 50 percent to 60 percent 
of patients who have been treated with other AIDS drugs meet 
that definition, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Selzentry will come with a "black box" warning, the 
strongest for prescription drugs, about the risk of liver 
toxicity, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug's label also will mention the possibility of heart 
attacks under a list of warnings and precautions, the agency 
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most common problems reported in studies of patients 
who took Selzentry included cough, fever, upper respiratory 
tract infections, rash, abdominal pain and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, the world's largest drug maker, expects Selzentry 
to be available next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the company's studies, about 45 percent of patients who 
took maraviroc had their HIV virus suppressed to undetectable 
levels. The same was true for 23 percent who got a placebo. All 
patients also were treated with a cocktail of the best 
available drugs and had tried other regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Selzentry's safety and effectiveness have not been 
established in adults or children who have never been treated 
with other HIV drugs, the FDA said, adding the drug has not 
been studied in pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said in June that the FDA would approve the drug 
once certain conditions were met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-based company is counting on new medicines 
such as Selzentry to help drive profits as several blockbuster 
medicines lose patent protection and its top-selling Lipitor 
cholesterol treatment faces strong competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry analysts have projected annual Selzentry sales of 
about $500 million by 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares rose 2.6 percent to close at $24.11 on the

after a disappointing development outlook sent its share price to
multiyear lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it now has 47 potential treatments in
mid-stage development. In December, it reported 32 drugs in that
category. Four drugs in so-called Phase II testing have been
discontinued, though the company did not name them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it plans to resubmit its application for
lasofoxifene, a drug for osteoporosis, with new data in December
2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected two earlier
2005 and 2006 applications for that drug, to prevent osteoporosis
and treat vaginal atrophy, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An investigational compound for obesity, dubbed CP-945598, is
in the final testing stage, Pfizer said. That drug is in the same
class as Sanofi-Aventis' (SASY.PA) Zimulti obesity drug, widely
hyped but then roundly rejected by advisers to U.S. regulators in
June because of concerns it may be linked to thoughts of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Kim Dixon)

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, quotes, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Chris Aspin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Aug 6 (Reuters) - Mexico's ICA, the country's
largest construction company, and a fund of Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS.N) won the right to run four existing toll roads with
a $4.1 billion offer, the government said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is the first package of roads among those that the
government of President Felipe Calderon plans to auction off in
coming months and years, with plans to use the cash to build
more highways to beef up of the country's poor infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICA (ICA.N)(ICA.MX) and Goldman Sachs Infrastructure
Partners I beat out five other bids for the 30-year concession
to operate the more than 310 miles (500 km) of highways in
central Mexico, the Transport Ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The consortium formed by ICA and Goldman Sachs is the
winner of the auction, given it offered most money to the
government," the ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICA's shares, which had been trading lower, rebounded on
the news. Goldman Sachs shares ended 4.5 percent higher at
$187.79.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The concession also calls for the construction of
connecting roads between the highways, which link the cities of
Guadalajara, Aguascalientes and Leon, and upgrades on various
stretches of the toll roads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Transport Minister Luis Tellez said 40 percent of the funds
would go to paying down the debt of other government-held
highways, just under 40 percent will be used to finish a public
works highway between Durango and Mazatlan in northern Mexico,
with the rest spent on other road projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tellez said the government planned to auction off another
group of highways toward the end of this year, given the
investor appetite for these "long-term, high quality assets".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It would be a smaller package than we are auctioning off
today," Tellez told a news conference to announce the winner,
adding his ministry was still working out the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SPAIN MISSES OUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Losing bids included ones made by IDEAL (IDEALB1.MX), a
Mexican construction company owned by billionaire tycoon Carlos
Slim; Spanish toll road firm Abertis (ABE.MC); a consortium of
Spain's FCC (FCC.MC) and private savings bank Caja Madrid; and
Spanish building firm Obrascon Huarte Lain (OHL.MC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The toll roads that ICA and Goldman Sachs will take over,
after making the payment to the government in October, had
revenue from quotas last year of about $185 million, according
to Deputy Infrastructure Minister Oscar de Buen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Calderon last month announced an ambitious $37 billion
transportation face-lift that includes the construction of
three new airports serving beach resorts and building thousands
of miles of new roads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICA shares closed up 0.5 percent at 71 pesos, after at one
stage during the session being down more than 1 percent. Its
New York-traded shares rose 1.6 percent to $78.01.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds information from Wall Street Journal report, Chevron
comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Aug 6 (Reuters) - PetroChina (0857.HK) chose U.S.
oil and gas company Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to help produce
natural gas from a field where nearly four years ago a gas
blow-out killed hundreds, the Wall Street Journal reported on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PetroChina had asked other foreign companies including
Norway's Statoil (STL.OL) and France's Total (TOTF.PA) to
submit bids to develop medium-sized Luojiazhai field in Sichuan
province, according to industry officials. To achieve that,
technology must be used to extract toxic sulphur contained in
the gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "PetroChina does not have the technology to tackle a field
with such high sulphur content," said a PetroChina official
familiar with the field's production plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A U.S.-based spokesman for Chevron said the company would
not provide information about business it may or may not be
pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chinese energy company is keen to repair its badly
tarnished image after a gas well explosion at the same field
claimed 234 lives in December 2003 in one of China's worst
industrial disasters. The incident also forced the company's
former Chairman Ma Fucai to step down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PetroChina proved in 2003 about 58 billion cubic metres of
gas reserve in the field in the northeastern part of Sichuan,
and had planned to build a field with annual production
capacity of two billion cubic metres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The field contains 150 grams of sulphur in one cubic metres
of gas, said the PetroChina official. This is extra high
sulphur content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A second PetroChina official said one of these companies
would be picked as a partner under a production sharing
contract, but declined to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China, the world's second-largest oil consumer, has been
aggressively boosting natural gas production to combat
declining oil reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike its offshore sector, which was open to foreign
investors 25 years ago, state oil firms have carefully guarded
the onshore oil and gas business because it is seen as being
more strategic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only a handful of companies such as Shell (RDSa.L) and
Total are operating in China's onshore sector, which is mostly
natural gas instead of crude oil.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. authorities arrested a U.N. translator on suspicion of visa fraud on Monday, accusing him of using U.N. letterhead to bring foreigners into the United States for nonexistent conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vyacheslav Manokhin, a Russian translator of documents at the New York headquarters, was arrested on Monday along with Vladimir Derevianko, who is accused of scheming with Manokhin to prepare false documents submitted to U.S. immigration officials, federal prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third man, Kamiljan Tursunov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, is accused of paying $15,000 for a fraudulent visa. He also faces conspiracy and fraud charges, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tursunov already had been in custody for failing to appear at an immigration proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheme began in 2005 and was able to bring in nine out of 14 people who had falsified letters written on their behalf, authorities allege in a 32-page criminal complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letters were signed by fictitious U.N. officials "Leonardo Brackett" and "Greg Smith," the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manokhin used his position at the United Nations to make it appear as though the world body supported visa applications for certain foreigners so they could attend U.N. meetings in New York. But the meetings either did not exist or those invited had no intention attending, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations informed U.S. authorities on July 27 that it had waived Manokhin's diplomatic immunity, associate spokesman Farhan Haq said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haq said the U.N. office for Internal Oversight Services, the investigative arm of the world body, and U.N. legal affairs worked with U.S. authorities "at their request and helped to provide any information that was needed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Sikorski, a lawyer for Manokhin, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case follows a couple of larger corruption scandals that have tarnished the reputation of the United Nations, such as mismanagement in the $64 billion oil-for-food program and in the U.N. procurement office which buys $1.9 billion in goods annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Evelyn Leopold at the United Nations)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 6 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said on Monday
it had started producing fuel at its 326,000 barrels per day
Fawley oil refinery in the UK after an unplanned shutdown
following fire in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have restarted producing oil at the refinery," a
spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She declined to specify when Exxon began fuel production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A company statement issued on Friday said: "Fawley Refinery
has completed the restart of operations and production is under
way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon began to restart refining units on July 30 after a
fire broke out at a steam generator on July 25, shutting
Britain's largest refinery for several days.

&lt;p&gt;Co announces that the FDA has approved SelzentryTM (maraviroc) tablets, the first in a new class of oral HIV medicines in more than 10 years. Selzentry blocks viral entry into white blood cells, significantly reducing viral load and increasing T-cell counts in treatment-experienced patients infected with a specific type of HIV. The FDA granted accelerated approval to Selzentry for combination antiretroviral treatment of adults infected with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable, who have evidence of viral replication and have HIV-1 strains resistant to multiple antiretroviral agents. A diagnostic test confirms whether a patient is infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1, which is also known as "R5 virus." Selzentry is expected to be available in the U.S. by the middle of September.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes, details and background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By George Chen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Aug 6 (Reuters) - JPMorgan's (JPM.N) China fund
management joint venture said on Monday it aims to raise $1
billion for its first overseas investment fund under China's
Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund will focus its investments on financial markets in
Asia, excluding Japan and Taiwan, said Avelyn Yang, deputy head
of investment management of Shanghai-based China International
Fund Management Co. Ltd., in which JPMorgan holds a 49 percent
stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The more, the better, but I think $1 billion can be a
reasonable level for our first QDII fund product," said Yang,
when asked the expected size of the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe there is such demand for QDII fund products in
China, as investing in overseas markets can be a very good way to
hedge your risks," she told a group of reporters.
 JPMorgan's China fund venture won regulatory approval for its
QDII licence last week, although it still must apply to Beijing
for approval of the fund's product structure and for a foreign
exchange quota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm plans to invest in major Asian stock markets such as
South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong, and will seek investment
opportunities in Australian markets, Yang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's China fund venture was the second Sino-foreign
venture to win a QDII licence, after China's Harvest Fund
Management Co., 20 percent-owned by Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE),
received approval in late July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two of the country's 10 biggest fund firms, China Asset
Management Co. and China Southern Fund Management Co., have also
obtained a QDII licence and are set to launch QDII fund products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only one Chinese fund management company, Huaan, has already
launched a QDII product since Beijing adopted the scheme last
year, aimed at encouraging capital outflows and broadening
investment alternatives for local investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beijing has so far granted QDII investment quotas of about
$14.8 billion for 19 banks, $5.2 billion for insurance companies
and $500 million for Huaan, and about one-third of the approved
quotas have been used.

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Aug 6 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major, Chevron Corp
(CVX.N), has put forward a development plan for its natural gas
fields offshore East Kalimantan, part of Borneo island,
Indonesia's oil watchdog said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron said last year it planned to invest about $6
billion to develop gas fields off the coast of Borneo, part of
efforts to crank up flagging Indonesia gas output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are still considering whether to recommend Chevron's
plan of development for offshore East Kalimantan gas fields,"
Achmad Luthfi, deputy chief of watchdog BPMIGAS said by
telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It should be no problem for us to agree to the plan, but
it is for the minister to approve it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Santi Manuhutu, a spokeswoman for Chevron Indonesia, said
the firm planned to develop several gas fields in East
Kalimantan, including Gehem, Gendalo and Bangka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This development will require significant capital
investment. It will be the deepest in Indonesia, in water
depths ranging from 2,500 to 6,000 feet (760-1,800 metres),"
she said by email, without elaborating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combined natural gas reserves in the area covered by
the plan are estimated at more than 3 trillion cubic feet, said
another BPMIGAS official, who declined to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia, Asia Pacific's only OPEC member, which has far
more gas than oil, has pushed companies to move faster in
developing areas as the country badly needs the gas for
domestic industries and exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron currently produces gas from several other fields in
East Kalimantan, but the output is in decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia, the world's second-biggest liquefied natural gas
(LNG) exporter after Qatar, has been struggling to meet export
commitments due to declining gas output being diverted to the
domestic market.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABUJA Aug 3 (Reuters) - Pfizer (PFE.N) has asked a Nigerian court to disregard an experts' report into drug tests it conducted on Nigerian children in 1996 and which are now the subject of four court cases, the company said on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Nigerian federal government and the northern state of Kano are suing Pfizer for a total of about $8.5 billion in damages and also pressing criminal charges over what they say was unethical testing of Trovan, an antibiotic drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nigerian authorities allege that the tests, conducted in Kano during a meningitis outbreak, caused the deaths of 11 children and permanent health problems for many others. Pfizer denies the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The two civil and two criminal cases launched since May in federal and Kano state courts have so far gone from one adjournment to the next without tackling the substantive issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said on Friday it had filed an application at the Federal High Court in Abuja seeking to quash the report of a Nigerian investigating committee on the Trovan tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The thrust of the application is that the committee report, on which the federal and Kano state governments based all their four suits against Pfizer, (is) illegal and inaccurate," said a statement issued on Pfizer's behalf by a public relations firm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The statement said the committee was not independent from government and was chaired by a Federal Ministry of Health doctor who had objected to the tests at the time and was therefore biased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It also said Pfizer's representatives had not been given a chance to hear the witnesses who testified before the committee and had not been shown the report when it was completed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Government lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer had already filed a statement of defence at the Kano High Court last month which said the investigating committee had disregarded important points about the Trovan tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Pfizer maintains that before conducting the Trovan study in Kano, it sought and obtained all necessary approvals from relevant federal and state government agencies," Friday's statement said, adding that the firm had 12 letters to prove it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Pfizer also states that the results of the study plainly proved that Trovan helped save lives," the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "With a survival rate of 94.4 percent, Trovan was at least as effective as the best treatment available at Kano's Infectious Disease Hospital. The overall survival rate in Nigeria was less than 90 percent," it said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Matthew Jones, Abuja newsroom; +234 9461 3214; estelle.shirbon@reuters.com))   Keywords: PFIZER NIGERIA/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Osteoporosis screening to measure bone density, followed by bone-strengthening medication if indicated, appears to be worthwhile for many elderly men, US researchers report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. John T. Schousboe, from Park Nicollet Health Services in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and colleagues assessed the cost and effectiveness of screening and treating hypothetical groups of men aged 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screening process involved bone density measurement, followed by 5 years of treatment with a drug to strengthen bone if there was evidence of osteoporosis. This approach was compared with no screening. Each analysis was performed assuming the patient did or did not have a prior fracture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among men 80 years of age or older, and for younger men with a previous or fracture, the cost of the screening strategy did not exceed $50,000 for every quality-adjusted life year gained. That cost figure is usually deemed acceptable for most medical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results suggest that the screening strategy is generally not worth the cost for men younger than 80 who haven't sustained a fracture, there may be certain circumstances for which it is. For instance, the strategy may be cost effective for men in their 70s if the annual cost of bone-strengthening drug therapy is less than $500, or if society is willing to pay $100,000 for each quality-adjusted life year gained, the authors note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOURCE: Journal of the American Medical Association, August 8, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 7 (Reuters) - A U.S. court dismissed three
lawsuits by Ecuadoreans who admitted allegations that pollution
by Chevron Corp (CVX.N) had caused them or their relatives'
cancer were false.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suits were part of a group of claims alleging the
company's dumping in the Ecuadorean rain forest caused cancer

Ecuador, which seeks $6 billion in damages from the U.S. oil
company on charges it contaminated the rain forest from 1972 to
1992. Chevron denies the claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gloria Chamba, a plaintiff in the case, had alleged that
Chevron pollution had given her son leukemia. But she admitted
during deposition her son never had the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, Luisa Gonzales said at her deposition that she

her husband was also dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In our mind, this reflects the kind and quality of

will not affect their case in an Ecuadorean court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are only suing for clean up costs, while the San
Francisco case is about health impact on individuals," Donziger
said. "Chevron is using their public relations spin against the
thousands of legitimate Ecuadorean victims of their policies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California, brought up the possibility of
misconduct by the plaintiff's lawyers in his ruling handed down
on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is clear to the Court that this case was manufactured

&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES Aug 7 (Reuters) - Venezuela is continuing to
hold talks with ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips over compensation
for their recently nationalized assets, the Venezuelan oil
minister said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "That process has not finished," said Rafael Ramirez,
speaking in Buenos Aires during a two-day state visit by
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) quit their
oil operations in Venezuela in June after Chavez decreed the
country was taking control over the companies' operations in
the Orinoco heavy oil belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four other oil majors -- Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), Norway's
Statoil (STL.OL), Britain's BP Plc (BP.L) and France's Total
(TOTF.PA) -- signed pacts with Venezuela allowing the country
to take stakes of up to 83 percent in their Orinoco projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips can negotiate compensation
from Venezuela for their lost operations or even seek legal
action that could potentially end up in international
arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked if the possibility of arbitration had been ruled out,
Ramirez said: "You'd have to asked them," referring to the
companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramirez also said the Venezuelan government was planning a
$500 million investment in oil exploration in Bolivia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chavez, a close ideological ally of Bolivia's leftist
leader, Evo Morales, is on a four-country South American tour
announcing energy investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chavez was expected to arrive in Bolivia on Thursday.

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds comment from Goldman in New York, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON Aug 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) on Tuesday denied market talk that it was liquidating its Global Alpha hedge fund, amid a report that the fund had fallen 12 percent in two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier, several traders said there was persistent market talk that the fund was being wound down, and that it was selling large amounts of stock in German car parts supplier Continental (CONG.DE), aerospace company EADS EAD.PA and Italian carmaker Fiat FIA.MI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bloomberg reported that the Alpha fund had fallen 12 percent in the two week period ended August 3, and was down 16 percent for the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Alpha fund aims to generate returns that are not correlated to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. But the risk the fund takes on, as measured by the volatility of its returns, is supposed to be similar to the S 500, a fund of funds investor said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The fund invests mainly in liquid assets, and should be able to sell assets to meet investor redemption demands, the investor said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A Goldman spokesperson in London declined to comment on the fund's position in those individual stocks. Goldman spokesman Peter Rose in New York declined to answer any questions about the fund, citing U.S. regulations surrounding hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Underperformance by Global Alpha's managers put a dent in Goldman's first-quarter results. Fund management incentive fees for the asset management group fell 78 percent to $23 million from $105 million a year earlier, and much of that was driven by Alpha, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Reporting by Dan Wilchins and Joseph Giannone in New York and Sitaraman Shankar and Michael Taylor in London) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Leslie Gevirtz; Reuters Messaging: dan.wilchins.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6320)) Keywords: GOLDMAN ALPHA/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SANTA MONICA, California (Reuters) - Relatives of murder victim Ron Goldman won a court order on Tuesday seizing any money O.J. Simpson earns for lending his name and likeness to a football video game with a fictional team called the Assassins and a knife-wielding mascot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legal victory was part of an effort by Goldman's estate to satisfy a $33.5 million judgment won against Simpson in a wrongful death suit brought against him in the 1994 stabbing deaths of Goldman and Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former star running back was acquitted of criminal charges in 1995 at the end of a sensational murder trial but was found legally responsible for their deaths by a civil court jury two years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simpson has maintained his innocence and vowed never to pay the jury award voluntarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Goldman's estate, led by his father Fred Goldman, secured rights to Simpson's aborted book, "If I Did It," containing his hypothetical first-person account of the murders, after a long legal fight with the now-bankrupt company set up to collect Simpson's reported $1 million advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their latest bid to collect on the civil judgment, the Goldmans went after any licensing fees, royalties or other compensation Simpson was paid or will be paid for his name and likeness in the new video game, "All-Pro Football 2K8."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game is published by Take-Two Interactive Software, the company behind such controversial video game titles as "Grand Theft Auto" and "Manhunt 2," which was banned in Britain and given the equivalent of an adults-only rating in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TEAM OF "ASSASSINS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All-Pro Football" features the likenesses of 240 retired National Football League players, including Simpson, whom game users can assign to fictional teams with preset names, one of which is "The Assassins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As previewed on a Web site for video game promotional trailers, the team mascot is a hooded figure who makes stabbing motions with a large knife in the end zone when the Assassins score. Simpson does not have to be assigned to that team, but he was in a clip shown on the Game Trailers Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take-Two has declined to say how it obtained rights to Simpson's name and likeness but said he was compensated. The company also has issued a statement saying the knife-wielding Assassins mascot is "not specifically associated with O.J. Simpson, and the game does not promote any such connection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the order issued by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Gerald Rosenberg, any earnings to Simpson that "have been paid, are due or may be due in the future" for use of his image and likeness in the video game must be turned over to the Goldman estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Simpson was ordered to turn over copies of his Take-Two contract and related documents, as well as any other financial deals he has yet to disclose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically he (the judge) said to Mr. Simpson, 'Pay up,'" Goldman attorney David Cook said after the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ronald Slates, a lawyer for Simpson, argued against the order, saying the California court lacked jurisdiction over his client, who has lived in Florida for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Aug 7 (Reuters) - Mexican stocks rose in early
trading on Tuesday, helped by gains in broadcaster Televisa, as
investors awaited a key policy statement from the U.S. Federal
Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The benchmark IPC stock index .MXX rose 0.38 percent to
29,834 points, while the peso currency MXN= MEX01 firmed
0.09 percent to 10.9601 per dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The price of the benchmark 10-year government peso bond
MX10YT=RR was off 0.173 points to bid 100.964, pushing its
yield up 3 basis points to 7.84 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IPC index has been on an extended losing streak,
dropping more than 8 percent over the last three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said U.S. investors were snapping up Mexican shares
after the Dow Jones industrial average posted its biggest daily
percentage advance on Monday since June 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are catching up with respects to the big rebound
yesterday in U.S. bourses," said a stock trader in Mexico
City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Televisa (TLVACPO.MX), the world's top producer
of Spanish language programming, jumped 1.58 percent to 56.45
pesos, while its New York-traded shares (TV.N) were up 1.65
percent at $25.80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dominant cell phone operator America Movil (AMXL.MX) gained
0.72 percent to 32.20 pesos, while its New York-traded shares
(AMX.N) were up 0.82 percent at $58.86.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors expect the Fed to keep its benchmark federal
funds rate at 5.25 percent, but will look to see if its policy
statement, due around 1:15 p.m. (1815 GMT), mentions the past
month's turmoil in credit markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Concern about a turn for the worse in the economy of the
United States, which buys most Mexican exports, have injected
pessimism into Mexican markets in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "(Mexican stocks) would now appear vulnerable to a deeper
bear phase," IDEAglobal said in a research report.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Monday it will cut the price of its main Xbox 360 video game console model by about 13 percent in the United States, hoping to boost sales ahead of the crucial holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move reduces the price of the Xbox 360 Premium model by $50, to $350, and follows a move last month by rival Sony Corp to cut the price of its PlayStation 3 machine by 17 percent, to $500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with unexpectedly strong competition from Nintendo Co Ltd's cheaper Wii console, Microsoft is aiming at expanding the appeal of the Xbox 360 to an audience outside its core fan base of young men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we look to the holidays we want to bring in more gamers and lower the price for those customers," the Xbox 360's group product manager, Aaron Greenberg, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're always trying to bring down cost of the box and ... we always try to pass on the savings to our consumers. We feel like this is the right time to do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price of the Xbox 360 Core, which does not include a hard drive, will fall $20 to $280 while the Elite model, which features a 120-gigabyte drive, six times the size of the Premium's, will fall $30 to $450. The cuts will take effect from August 8, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched in November 2005, the Xbox 360 has gone 20 months without a price cut, the longest of any console in history. Sony's PlayStation 2 held its $300 price for 18 months after launching in the United States in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It surprised me a little bit because there's not a whole lot of market pressure on them to lower the price," said Van Baker, an analyst with market research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is it going to make an enormous difference? No, because when it comes to consoles, it's not the price that sells the console, it's the games that sells the console and from that perspective, Microsoft's in pretty good shape," Baker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rising sophistication of consoles, which boast graphics performance that rivals personal computers costing several times as much, means manufacturers are more reluctant to drop prices. That's particularly true for Microsoft, which has yet to turn a profit on the Xbox business it launched in 2001 in a bid to challenge Sony's growing dominance in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of June, Microsoft had sold 5.6 million Xbox 360s in the United States, compared with 2.8 million Wiis and 1.4 million PS3s -- the latter two launched a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft forecasts its entertainment and devices division, home to the Xbox, Windows Mobile and Zune digital music player businesses, to turn profitable in its current fiscal year after two years of losses totaling more than $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company has forecast revenue at the division to grow by between 10 percent and 19 percent this year from sales of $6.08 billion in fiscal 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenberg said Microsoft timed the price cut to coincide with the release of Electronic Arts Inc's "Madden NFL 08", the latest installment of the publisher's top-selling football franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Summer tends to be seasonally slow, but we definitely see a big uptick starting with 'Madden', and accelerating through the end of the year," Greenberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also banking on the highly anticipated final episode of "Halo", its flagship game franchise, to be a major profit driver this year. The game hits stores on September 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, shares) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 6 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Monday that U.S. regulators approved its AIDS drug Selzentry, the first in an new class of oral HIV medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Selzentry is the first drug designed to keep the HIV virus that causes AIDS from entering healthy immune cells. Older AIDS medicines attack the virus itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The drug, also known as maraviroc, blocks the CCR5 co-receptor that serves as a main doorway for the HIV virus into immune cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Selzentry for use in patients who have tried other medicines and for those for whom a diagnostic test has confirmed their HIV strain is linked to the CCR5 receptor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's largest drugmaker said it expects the drug to be available next month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said in June that the FDA would approve the drug once certain conditions had been met. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The New York-based company is counting on new medicines like Selzentry to help drive profits as several blockbuster medicines lose patent protection and its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol treatment faces strong competition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Industry analysts have projected annual Selzentry sales of about $500 million by 2011. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer shares rose 44 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $23.95 at mid-afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Richard Chang; Reuters Messaging: Lewis.Krauskopf.reuters.com@reuters.net; lewis.krauskopf@reuters.com; 646-223-6082)) Keywords: PFIZER HIV/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO Aug 6 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N), the world's biggest pharmaceutical company, on Monday said it boosted the number of experimental drugs in the final testing stages and pledged to triple its late-stage portfolio by 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said it now has 11 compounds in so-called Phase 3 testing, the final period before submission to regulators for clearance. When the company last provided its development progress in December 2006, it had 8 drugs in Phase 3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    New York-based Pfizer is among several major pharmaceutical companies struggling to replace key drugs as they've lost patent protection. At the same time, many are suffering declining sales on best-selling drugs as generic versions gain traction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Reporting by Kim Dixon) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Phil Berlowitz; Reuters Messaging; kim.dixon.reuters.com@reuters.net; email; kim.dixon@reuters.com, 1-312 408 8561)) Keywords: PFIZER/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, stock quotes) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Aug 6 (Reuters) - Mexico's ICA, the country's largest construction company, and a fund of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) won the right to run four existing toll roads with a $4.1 billion offer, the government said on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In a press release, the Transport Ministry said ICA (ICA.N)(ICA.MX) and Goldman Sachs Infrastructure Partners I won the 30-year concession to operate the highways in central Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The concession calls for the expansion of existing roads as well as the modernization of some others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    President Felipe Calderon last month announced an ambitious $37 billion transportation face-lift that includes the construction of three new airports serving beach resorts and building thousands of miles of new roads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    After the announcement, ICA shares were down 0.40 percent at 70.50 pesos in afternoon dealings, while its New York-traded shares were nearly flat at $76.81. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Chris Aspin and Tomas Sarmiento, editing by Maureen Bavdek; Reuters Messaging: chris.aspin.reuters.com@reuters.net +52 55 5282-7153)) Keywords: MEXICO ROADS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and HSBC might be interested in buying Bear Stearns Cos at the right price, but there would be real obstacles to a deal happening anytime soon, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns, the fifth largest Wall Street broker dealer by market value, has been cited as a potential takeover target after its leading position in mortgage trading has proven to be a liability as the subprime home loan market suffers from big delinquencies. Bear's shares have fallen 30 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bear Stearns BSC.N would likely prefer not to sell itself when its shares trade at such a low valuation, and there are few obvious buyers that would be a perfect cultural or business fit, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the company's stock down ... and liquidity concerns swirling around it, the senior management and board of directors could be contemplating how to quickly stabilize the situation," wrote CreditSights analyst David Hendler in a note. Selling could be an option, Hendler added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia Corp WB.N would "probably jump at this opportunity," Hendler wrote, yet it is tied up with its acquisition of mid-sized brokerage AG Edwards Inc AGE.N, which is slated to close in the fourth quarter, and California thrift Golden West, which closed in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) might also be interested, analysts said. JPMorgan Chase might be interested in Bear Stearns' global clearing business, which includes one of the top-ranked prime brokerage businesses in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is much smaller in the prime brokerage business -- or financing and clearing trades for hedge funds -- than many of its peers and acquiring the Bear Stearns unit could be a way to quickly boost that business, said Lee Delaporte, analyst at Dreman Value Management, which has $22 billion of assets under management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America might also be interested in bolstering its investment banking operations, which are less robust than Citigroup's or JPMorgan Chase's, said an investor who asked not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wachovia declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Bear-managed hedge funds that invested in subprime- linked securities have shut down and a third had to close redemptions from investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company held a conference call on Friday to assure investors of its viability, but said the shock waves hitting lending markets were the worst in more than 20 years. Bear also announced the departure of its co-president Warren Spector, on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WATCHING EVERY CLIP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internationally, HSBC might be a good cultural fit for Bear, because both are run by managers keen on cost control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're talking about two companies where management saves every paper clip," said James Ellman, a portfolio manager at financial services hedge fund Seacliff Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But HSBC is also wrestling with its own exposure to the U.S. subprime market. The bank took a charge for bad debts of $6.35 billion in the first half of the year, up 63 percent. A spokeswoman for HSBC declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns has spoken to China-based investors about buying an equity stake or setting up a joint venture, according to the Wall Street Journal. But multiple U.S. banks are pursuing that avenue now, and Bear may not be the most attractive to the Chinese, the paper added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about Bear's subprime exposure will likely keep most U.S. investment banks away and may keep everyone away until more clarity emerges about the full cost of Bear's exposure to subprime mortgages, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selling at this juncture also might be difficult for Bear's managers to stomach. As of March, Chairman and Chief Executive James Cayne owned about 6 percent of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares rose 5 percent on Monday to close at $113.81, or about 1.2 times their May 31 book value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why would they sell at one times book if they can wait a few years and sell at two times book?" Ellman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dreman's Delaporte noted that book values may be declining if Bear writes down subprime assets, making price-to-book ratios higher than they appear now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The unknown right now is, what is their book value?" Delaporte said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds no injuries, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Aug 8 (Reuters) - Los Angeles wholesale gasoline
prices jumped 6.5 cents on Wednesday after Chevron Corp.'s
(CVX.N) 260,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery
in El Segundo, California, was hit by a partial power outage
shortly before noon PDT (1900 GMT), traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No injuries were reported due to the upset, a Chevron
spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said "hydrotreating facilities" at the refinery
were affected by the power outage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're working diligently to bring them back on line," the
spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; West Coast refined products traders said they also heard
the refinery's hydrocracker was affected by the outage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources familiar with refinery operations said Chevron
hopes to restart the units within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Electrical power provider Southern California Edison was
working to determine the cause of the power failure, according
to a notice filed with the California Office of Emergency
Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Southern California Edison representative was not
immediately available to discuss electrical power supplies to
the refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron receives power from Southern California Edison and
has the ability to generate its own power, which is supposed to
kick in if there is a problem with the external supply, sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before the upset, gasoline had fallen as much as 5.75 cents
from Tuesday's closing offer price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early in the day on Wednesday, refiners and buyers had
jumped into the market to snap up bargains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The buying became a frenzy after the Chevron news hit the
market, rapidly driving prices up to 11.5 cents over the NYMEX
September contract for RBOB gasoline, which settled at $1.977
per gallon Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Relative value opportunities are

&lt;p&gt; Recent sell-offs in collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)

overdone, said Christopher Flanagan, analyst at JP Morgan 
Securities, during a conference call on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think the fundamentals for the loan market in the 
corporate sector in general remain quite good and the sell-off 
has created a value situation in CLOs, particularly in the 'BB' 
to 'A' part of the capital structure," said Flanagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He noted risks between the loan and CLO markets relative to 
subprime debt are very different but have become somewhat 
intertwined amid the recent market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Essentially, the LCDX sold off at about the time of the 
Bear Stearns hedge fund announcements, which we regard as the 
liquidity event. That was the true source of contagion from 
subprime into the loan market," Flanagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear Stearns has struggled with redemptions at three hedge 
funds units invested in risky debt. Two of the funds run by 
Bears' asset management unit made bad bets on bonds linked to 
subprime mortgages, a sector offering high-interest loans to 
borrowers with poor credit where defaults have surged. The 
funds were left with very little value, Bear said in mid-July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, since then, the sell-off in LCDX has been highly 
correlated with the sell-off in the ABX "BBB-" 07-1 index, an 
index used by investors to hedge their subprime mortgage risks. 
The LCDX has become extremely oversold as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Last week, the index (LCDX) even decoupled and went beyond 
what was happening in ABX. That, created an extraordinary buy 
opportunity in LCDX," Flanagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mispricing within higher-tier segments of the U.S. 
asset-backed securities capital structure, as well as the ABX 
subprime derivatives index, has also led to attractive buy 
opportunities for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Triple-As and 'AAs' are oversold and the home price 
scenarios baked into those prices we just don't think have any 
chance of materializing. There's fairly good value in both ABS 
and ABX, at the 'AA' and 'AAA' parts of the capital structure," 
said Flanagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the cash subprime ABS market and the single-name credit 
default swaps markets, where investors buy protection against 
default on one specific issuer, he said some of the same themes 
have emerged. He saw good value in the "AA" cash home equity 
ABS sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the opposite end of the credit spectrum, Flanagan said, 
ABS and ABX prices remained overvalued, leaving more room for a 
downward trade in "BBB" and "BBB-" segments. "We still believe 
the pricing reflects a fairly optimistic home price scenario. 
We think the next 12-18 months will be quite severe in terms of 
a price correction in housing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said the significant spread widening in the 
cash ABS market over the last month or so was long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The recent widening while very abrupt and very sharp, I 
would suggest was quite overdue. Based on where we are in the 
economic cycle, there is likely more to come over the next 18 
months," said Flanagan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details from ruling, background about case) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Paritosh Bansal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge denied a request by Visa USA on Wednesday to stay an order that granted termination rights to some Visa member banks, saying doing so would cause substantial harm to MasterCard Inc. (MA.N). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan said in a  written ruling that a stay pending appeal "all but guarantees that issuers with contracts subject to termination will never have an opportunity to exercise their termination rights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Because nearly all the agreements subject to termination will expire during the next year, termination rights will serve no practical value unless the court's remedy becomes effective immediately," Jones said in the ruling, which was dated Tuesday but made public on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Visa could not be reached immediately for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The dispute involved a fee that Visa had been charging to issuers that moved their portfolios to MasterCard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In June, Jones agreed with a court-appointed adviser that Visa's "settlement service fee" was anti-competitive. She ordered Visa to allow any of its top 100 debit card issuers to terminate its agreement with the card association, so long as the issuer separately agreed to issue MasterCard debit cards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Visa filed a motion requesting a stay of the portion of the order that gave its member banks termination rights, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It argued that it would suffer irreparable harm, because if its debit issuers terminated their agreements early and it prevailed on appeal, the court would be not be able to restore those agreements to Visa, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The fee was intended to cover part of Visa's $2 billion settlement in 2003 of an antitrust class-action lawsuit by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) and other retailers. MasterCard settled that case for $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The settlement related to claims that retailers had incurred billions of dollars of processing costs to meet card association requirements that they accept signature-verified debit cards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    MasterCard is based in Purchase, New York, and Visa in San Francisco. MasterCard conducted its initial public offering in May 2006. Visa last October said it planned to go public within 12 to 18 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    MasterCard's shares were up $1.44 at $145.71 during afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Aug 8 (Reuters) - Linspire Inc., one of three Linux
software makers that broke with the open source community by
signing patent deals with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), disclosed on
Wednesday that its chief executive has left the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Linspire did not issue a formal statement to announce the
departure of Kevin Carmony. Instead, a product announcement
released on Wednesday referred to the company's CEO as Larry
Kettler, who was Linspire's former head of sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carmony could not be reached for comment. A Linspire
spokeswoman declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Linspire sells versions of Linux and is one of dozens of
companies that have sprung out of the open-source software
movement, which develops alternative programs to those from
Microsoft and other established vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's Windows operating system sits on more than 90
percent of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These companies sell versions of the Linux operating system,
as well as compatible programs and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Users of open-source programs have the right to download the
code to those programs, change it and distribute the changes.
Proprietary software companies like Microsoft, International
Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and Oracle Corp ORCL.O generally
forbid customers from making such changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rivalry between the open source community and Microsoft
has grown increasingly bitter over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In November, Microsoft signed a patent agreement with Linux
software maker Novell Inc NOVL.O, in which the two companies
agreed not to sue each others' customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In May, Microsoft said that open-source software programs
including Linux violate 235 of its patents and urged other
companies to sign agreements similar to the one with Novell. So
far only two of them, Linspire and Xandros Inc., have done so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Web site Linux-Watch on Sunday reported that Carmony said
he was leaving the company to work on business projects and
support the U.S. presidential campaign of Republican Mitt Romney.
Officials with the Romney campaign were not available for
comment.

&lt;p&gt;SANTA MONICA, California (Reuters) - Relatives of murder 
victim Ron Goldman won a court order on Tuesday seizing any 
money O.J. Simpson earns for lending his name and likeness to a 
football video game with a fictional team called the Assassins 
and a knife-wielding mascot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The legal victory was part of an effort by Goldman's estate 
to satisfy a $33.5 million judgment won against Simpson in a 
wrongful death suit brought against him in the 1994 stabbing 
deaths of Goldman and Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The former star running back was acquitted of criminal 
charges in 1995 at the end of a sensational murder trial but 
was found legally responsible for their deaths by a civil court 
jury two years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simpson has maintained his innocence and vowed never to pay 
the jury award voluntarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Goldman's estate, led by his father Fred 
Goldman, secured rights to Simpson's aborted book, "If I Did 
It," containing his hypothetical first-person account of the 
murders, after a long legal fight with the now-bankrupt company 
set up to collect Simpson's reported $1 million advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In their latest bid to collect on the civil judgment, the 
Goldmans went after any licensing fees, royalties or other 
compensation Simpson was paid or will be paid for his name and 
likeness in the new video game, "All-Pro Football 2K8."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The game is published by Take-Two Interactive Software, the 
company behind such controversial video game titles as "Grand 
Theft Auto" and "Manhunt 2," which was banned in Britain and 
given the equivalent of an adults-only rating in the United 
States.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TEAM OF "ASSASSINS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All-Pro Football" features the likenesses of 240 retired 
National Football League players, including Simpson, whom game 
users can assign to fictional teams with preset names, one of 
which is "The Assassins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As previewed on a Web site for video game promotional 
trailers, the team mascot is a hooded figure who makes stabbing 
motions with a large knife in the end zone when the Assassins 
score. Simpson does not have to be assigned to that team, but 
he was in a clip shown on the Game Trailers Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take-Two has declined to say how it obtained rights to 
Simpson's name and likeness but said he was compensated. The 
company also has issued a statement saying the knife-wielding 
Assassins mascot is "not specifically associated with O.J. 
Simpson, and the game does not promote any such connection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the order issued by Los Angeles County Superior Court 
Judge Gerald Rosenberg, any earnings to Simpson that "have been 
paid, are due or may be due in the future" for use of his image 
and likeness in the video game must be turned over to the 
Goldman estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, Simpson was ordered to turn over copies of his 
Take-Two contract and related documents, as well as any other 
financial deals he has yet to disclose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Basically he (the judge) said to Mr. Simpson, 'Pay up,"' 
Goldman attorney David Cook said after the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ronald Slates, a lawyer for Simpson, argued against the 
order, saying the California court lacked jurisdiction over his 
client, who has lived in Florida for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

She is due to perform at the award show in Las Vegas on September 9 and also plans to tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen, whose song "Smile" was a hit last year, had been due to tour the United States in May and June.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  (Adds comment from Goldman in New York, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON Aug 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) on Tuesday denied market talk that it was liquidating its Global Alpha hedge fund, amid a report that the fund had fallen 12 percent in two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier, several traders said there was persistent market talk that the fund was being wound down, and that it was selling large amounts of stock in German car parts supplier Continental (CONG.DE), aerospace company EADS EAD.PA and Italian carmaker Fiat FIA.MI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bloomberg reported that the Alpha fund had fallen 12 percent in the two week period ended August 3, and was down 16 percent for the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Alpha fund aims to generate returns that are not correlated to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. But the risk the fund takes on, as measured by the volatility of its returns, is supposed to be similar to the S 500, a fund of funds investor said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The fund invests mainly in liquid assets, and should be able to sell assets to meet investor redemption demands, the investor said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A Goldman spokesperson in London declined to comment on the fund's position in those individual stocks. Goldman spokesman Peter Rose in New York declined to answer any questions about the fund, citing U.S. regulations surrounding hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Underperformance by Global Alpha's managers put a dent in Goldman's first-quarter results. Fund management incentive fees for the asset management group fell 78 percent to $23 million from $105 million a year earlier, and much of that was driven by Alpha, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Reporting by Dan Wilchins and Joseph Giannone in New York and Sitaraman Shankar and Michael Taylor in London) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Leslie Gevirtz; Reuters Messaging: dan.wilchins.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6320)) Keywords: GOLDMAN ALPHA/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

speculation," Chalmers said of the reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An O-1 visa allows people with extraordinary skills within 
the field of sciences, arts, education, business, athletics, or 
within the field of motion picture or television industry to 
work temporarily in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allen's manager, Neale Easterby of Empire Management, told 
Billboard magazine that the singer was allowed to enter the 
United States and will remain in the country -- where she is 
shooting a music video -- until Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday Allen, who has a reputation as a wild child in 
Britain, was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award. She is due 
to perform at the award show in Las Vegas on September 9 and 
also plans to tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allen, whose song "Smile" was a hit last year, had been due 
to tour the United States in May and June. But she canceled the 
concerts in April, saying she was tired and not performing as 
well as she could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group shares fell nearly 6 percent on Thursday after another of its hedge funds posted losses and reportedly sold positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North American Equity Opportunities, which started the year with about $767 million in assets, was down more than 15 percent this year through July 27, a person familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declines at that fund follow a 12 percent drop in the last two weeks at Global Alpha, Goldman's flagship $9 billion macro hedge fund. That fund is down 16 percent for the year and traders have said the fund is selling parts of its portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman denied talk on Wednesday it was liquidating the fund and declined further comment. On Thursday, the bank declined to comment on the North American Equity Opportunities fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equity Opportunities is a market neutral stock fund that takes long and short bets. The smaller fund, like Global Alpha, relies on computer-driven "quantitative" trading models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares fell $11.05, or 5.7 percent, to $182.25 on Thursday. Since June 13, Goldman has fallen 22 percent, compared with a 4.1 percent decline for the Standard  Poor's 500 index .SPX and a 15.4 percent decline for the Amex Securities Broker Dealer index. .XBD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman joins other investment banks managing hedge funds that have struggled during the recent market turbulence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiss bank UBS AG (UBSN.VX) was forced to shut down Dillon Read Capital Management less than two years after its launch following losses on mortgage markets. Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N shares, and its reputation, were slammed as two of its mortgage funds suffered losses, outflows and then filed for bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Thursday, French bank BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) froze 1.6 billion euros ($2.21 billion) worth of funds, citing problems over U.S. subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said hedge fund declines will not have a major impact on earnings at a firm as large and diversified as Goldman. Still, the declines raise worrying questions about Goldman's largest and most mysterious business: securities trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The main threat is on the trading side. That has always been the black box at Goldman that keeps their multiple down," said Les Satlow, a portfolio manager who helps invest $450 million at Cabot Asset Management. "That's the kind of thing that makes investors anxious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALPHA PALES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global Alpha has long been a top performer, fueling growth in Goldman Sachs Asset Management and making the bank one of the world's largest hedge fund managers. Over the years, the fund fattened the wallets of Goldman insiders who invested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run by 40-year-olds Mark Carhart and Raymond Iwanowski, Global Alpha uses computer models to make bold bets on stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities worldwide. The fund has had wild swings -- it returned nearly 40 percent in 2005 -- but has delivered positive returns since its inception in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weak performance at Alpha has put a dent in Goldman's results in recent quarters. In the first quarter, Goldman's incentive fees from asset management fell 78 percent from a year earlier, to $23 million, reflecting poor performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, incentive fees fell 87 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside investors responded by pulling out. Goldman's net flows of money into alternative investments were nil in the second quarter, compared with $6 billion received a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sitaraman Shankar in London and Dan Wilchins in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SANTA MONICA, California (Reuters) - Relatives of murder 
victim Ron Goldman won a court order on Tuesday seizing any 
money O.J. Simpson earns for lending his name and likeness to a 
football video game with a fictional team called the Assassins 
and a knife-wielding mascot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The legal victory was part of an effort by Goldman's estate 
to satisfy a $33.5 million judgment won against Simpson in a 
wrongful death suit brought against him in the 1994 stabbing 
deaths of Goldman and Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The former star running back was acquitted of criminal 
charges in 1995 at the end of a sensational murder trial but 
was found legally responsible for their deaths by a civil court 
jury two years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simpson has maintained his innocence and vowed never to pay 
the jury award voluntarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Goldman's estate, led by his father Fred 
Goldman, secured rights to Simpson's aborted book, "If I Did 
It," containing his hypothetical first-person account of the 
murders, after a long legal fight with the now-bankrupt company 
set up to collect Simpson's reported $1 million advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In their latest bid to collect on the civil judgment, the 
Goldmans went after any licensing fees, royalties or other 
compensation Simpson was paid or will be paid for his name and 
likeness in the new video game, "All-Pro Football 2K8."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The game is published by Take-Two Interactive Software, the 
company behind such controversial video game titles as "Grand 
Theft Auto" and "Manhunt 2," which was banned in Britain and 
given the equivalent of an adults-only rating in the United 
States.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TEAM OF "ASSASSINS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All-Pro Football" features the likenesses of 240 retired 
National Football League players, including Simpson, whom game 
users can assign to fictional teams with preset names, one of 
which is "The Assassins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As previewed on a Web site for video game promotional 
trailers, the team mascot is a hooded figure who makes stabbing 
motions with a large knife in the end zone when the Assassins 
score. Simpson does not have to be assigned to that team, but 
he was in a clip shown on the Game Trailers Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take-Two has declined to say how it obtained rights to 
Simpson's name and likeness but said he was compensated. The 
company also has issued a statement saying the knife-wielding 
Assassins mascot is "not specifically associated with O.J. 
Simpson, and the game does not promote any such connection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the order issued by Los Angeles County Superior Court 
Judge Gerald Rosenberg, any earnings to Simpson that "have been 
paid, are due or may be due in the future" for use of his image 
and likeness in the video game must be turned over to the 
Goldman estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, Simpson was ordered to turn over copies of his 
Take-Two contract and related documents, as well as any other 
financial deals he has yet to disclose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Basically he (the judge) said to Mr. Simpson, 'Pay up,"' 
Goldman attorney David Cook said after the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ronald Slates, a lawyer for Simpson, argued against the 
order, saying the California court lacked jurisdiction over his 
client, who has lived in Florida for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Aug 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) anticipates a Los
Angeles-area refinery hydrocracking unit will return to full production
within 12 to 24 hours, a spokesman said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron was working Thursday to restore production on the hydrocracker
at the 260,000 barrel per day refinery in El Segundo, California, which was
hit by a partial electrical power outage on Wednesday, spokesman Rod
Spackman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wednesday power outage had a limited impact on total refinery
operations and affected one of several hydrocracking units at the El
Segundo plant, Spackman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The refinery generally hasn't been impacted," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the hydrocracker outage had some effect on refinery production,
the refinery will still be able to "supply our market," Spackman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He declined to say by how much refinery output was reduced, but noted
the power loss and recovery was expected to be of short duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Los Angeles wholesale gasoline prices fell 1.5 cents on Thursday, West
Coast refined products traders said as word circulated of the
hydrocracker's quick recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unleaded gasoline blended to meet California's strict tailpipe emission
standards sold as high as 11.5 cents over NYMEX September RBOB gasoline
Thursday morning and last traded at 10 cents over NYMEX RBOB.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details from ruling, background about case) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Paritosh Bansal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge denied a request by Visa USA on Wednesday to stay an order that granted termination rights to some Visa member banks, saying doing so would cause substantial harm to MasterCard Inc. (MA.N). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan said in a  written ruling that a stay pending appeal "all but guarantees that issuers with contracts subject to termination will never have an opportunity to exercise their termination rights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Because nearly all the agreements subject to termination will expire during the next year, termination rights will serve no practical value unless the court's remedy becomes effective immediately," Jones said in the ruling, which was dated Tuesday but made public on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Visa could not be reached immediately for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The dispute involved a fee that Visa had been charging to issuers that moved their portfolios to MasterCard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In June, Jones agreed with a court-appointed adviser that Visa's "settlement service fee" was anti-competitive. She ordered Visa to allow any of its top 100 debit card issuers to terminate its agreement with the card association, so long as the issuer separately agreed to issue MasterCard debit cards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Visa filed a motion requesting a stay of the portion of the order that gave its member banks termination rights, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It argued that it would suffer irreparable harm, because if its debit issuers terminated their agreements early and it prevailed on appeal, the court would be not be able to restore those agreements to Visa, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The fee was intended to cover part of Visa's $2 billion settlement in 2003 of an antitrust class-action lawsuit by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) and other retailers. MasterCard settled that case for $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The settlement related to claims that retailers had incurred billions of dollars of processing costs to meet card association requirements that they accept signature-verified debit cards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    MasterCard is based in Purchase, New York, and Visa in San Francisco. MasterCard conducted its initial public offering in May 2006. Visa last October said it planned to go public within 12 to 18 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    MasterCard's shares were up $1.44 at $145.71 during afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Relative value opportunities are 
emerging in asset classes tainted by the U.S. subprime mortgage 
crisis, according to JP Morgan Securities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Recent sell-offs in collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) 
and the LCDX, a U.S. leveraged loan derivatives index, were 
overdone, said Christopher Flanagan, analyst at JP Morgan 
Securities, during a conference call on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think the fundamentals for the loan market in the 
corporate sector in general remain quite good and the sell-off 
has created a value situation in CLOs, particularly in the 'BB' 
to 'A' part of the capital structure," said Flanagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He noted risks between the loan and CLO markets relative to 
subprime debt are very different but have become somewhat 
intertwined amid the recent market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Essentially, the LCDX sold off at about the time of the 
Bear Stearns hedge fund announcements, which we regard as the 
liquidity event. That was the true source of contagion from 
subprime into the loan market," Flanagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear Stearns has struggled with redemptions at three hedge 
funds units invested in risky debt. Two of the funds run by 
Bears' asset management unit made bad bets on bonds linked to 
subprime mortgages, a sector offering high-interest loans to 
borrowers with poor credit where defaults have surged. The 
funds were left with very little value, Bear said in mid-July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, since then, the sell-off in LCDX has been highly 
correlated with the sell-off in the ABX "BBB-" 07-1 index, an 
index used by investors to hedge their subprime mortgage risks. 
The LCDX has become extremely oversold as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Last week, the index (LCDX) even decoupled and went beyond 
what was happening in ABX. That, created an extraordinary buy 
opportunity in LCDX," Flanagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mispricing within higher-tier segments of the U.S. 
asset-backed securities capital structure, as well as the ABX 
subprime derivatives index, has also led to attractive buy 
opportunities for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Triple-As and 'AAs' are oversold and the home price 
scenarios baked into those prices we just don't think have any 
chance of materializing. There's fairly good value in both ABS 
and ABX, at the 'AA' and 'AAA' parts of the capital structure," 
said Flanagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the cash subprime ABS market and the single-name credit 
default swaps markets, where investors buy protection against 
default on one specific issuer, he said some of the same themes 
have emerged. He saw good value in the "AA" cash home equity 
ABS sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the opposite end of the credit spectrum, Flanagan said, 
ABS and ABX prices remained overvalued, leaving more room for a 
downward trade in "BBB" and "BBB-" segments. "We still believe 
the pricing reflects a fairly optimistic home price scenario. 
We think the next 12-18 months will be quite severe in terms of 
a price correction in housing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said the significant spread widening in the 
cash ABS market over the last month or so was long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The recent widening while very abrupt and very sharp, I 
would suggest was quite overdue. Based on where we are in the 
economic cycle, there is likely more to come over the next 18 
months," said Flanagan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Cyntia Barrera Diaz &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Aug 10 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa has jumped into the fast-growing online social networking market, competing for Latin American visitors against heavyweights MySpace and hi5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa (TV.N)(TLVACPO.MX), the world's biggest producer of Spanish-language content, will pipe exclusive videos and interviews with talent from its hit television shows into its newly created Gyggs.com, aiming for users aged 13 to 24. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa wants to attract teenagers who will chat online about their favorite shows, soap operas and pop singers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The site has lined up 50,000 registrations since its launch three weeks ago. Most of its Spanish-only content is Mexico-specific, but visitors from anywhere in the world can create a profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are growing at a fast pace. I think that we could reach between 250,000 and 300,000 registrations" after 12 months, Juan Saldivar, chief executive of Televisa's online businesses, said in an interview on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Online social networks, which allow users to share images, video, text and music among friends, are one of the hottest trends online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N bought social networking site MySpace.com, one of the Web's fastest growing properties, for about $580 million in 2005. It is now considered to be worth about $10 billion by some Wall Street analysts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In January, MySpace launched a Web site tailored to the Mexican market, and as of July it had more than 1.5 million active users per month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Almost a fifth of Mexico's 103 million people use the Internet, the government believes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa has gained international recognition for its tear-jerking soap operas, which are often translated into other languages and broadcast abroad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In recent years, Televisa has notched record ratings with shows for young viewers, such as "Rebelde," a trend-setting remake about fashionable teenagers, and "La Fea Mas Bella," Televisa's take on a Colombian TV phenomenon that spun off versions from India to Germany. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Saldivar said Televisa's knowledge of the local market will give it an edge on rivals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We have a platform that is 100 percent Mexican, focusing on local premium content," he said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 10 (Reuters) - Abby Joseph Cohen, chief
investment strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s, said on
Friday that U.S. stocks are underpriced by about 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Cohen, speaking on CNBC, said that the benchmark Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX is trading about 10 percent off its
fair value, which she put at about 1,600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 was up 0.55 of a point, or 0.04 percent, to
finish unofficially at 1,453.64, off a session low at 1,429.74
earlier on Friday.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds market reaction, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, Aug 10 (Reuters) Chevron Corp.'s (CVX.N) Los
Angeles-area refinery was returning a hydrocracking unit to
full production on Friday, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hydrocracker at the 260,000 barrel per day (bpd)
refinery in El Segundo, California, was expected to be at
planned production rates Friday in accordance with the time
frame announced for recovery from a Wednesday power outage,
Chevron spokesman Rod Spackman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wholesale gasoline prices were weaker on Friday with
unleaded gasoline blended to meet California's strict
environmental standards shown in a bid-offer spread at 4
cents/8.5 cents over NYMEX RBOB gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; California gasoline last traded in the Los Angeles market
at 10 cents over NYMEX RBOB on Thursday and was seen at 10.5
cents over when the Los Angeles market opened on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spackman said all of the refinery's major units were up and
running on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There have been no changes from what we said yesterday,"
he said. "We're bringing everything up to full rates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, Chevron said the hydrocracker, one of several
at the refinery, was anticipated to return to full production
within 12 to 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source familiar with refinery operations said the restart
could last into the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spackman said some auxiliary units to the hydrocracker
could take "a few hours" longer to return to production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Los Angeles market sources said California gasoline had not
traded on Friday, indicating no need by refiners to replace
what they could not make and a lack of desire by some to buy on
the expectation the Chevron restart would take longer than the
company planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A hydrocracker uses hydrogen under high heat and pressure
to increase the amount of refinable material from a barrel of
crude oil.

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta Aug 10 (Reuters) - The eastern Canadian
province of Newfoundland and a group of oil companies led by
Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) have restarted formal negotiations to set
financial terms for the stalled Hebron offshore oil field,
officials on both sides said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Talks are back on, but that's the only comment -- we're
not giving any further comment at this time," a spokeswoman in
the office of Premier Danny Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron and its partners walked away from the table last
year when Williams demanded the province get a 4.9 percent
equity stake in the 731 million barrel Hebron Ben Nevis field
in the North Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Williams said in June that, under planned legislation, the
province would seek interests of more than 5 percent in new oil
projects. Details of the new energy plan are expected later
this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the outspoken premier said at the time that
Chevron could still get its project approved on the previous
terms if it reached an agreement with the province before the
legislation passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither Chevron nor Newfoundland would say if either side
had offered to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We had indicated in the latter part of June that the lines
of communication were open between the Hebron co-venturers and
the government and now we've started to talk," said Tim Murphy,
a Chevron spokesman in the provincial capital St. John's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other partners in the project are Petro-Canada
PCA.TO, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) and Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds performance data, pre-market stock data) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON Aug 9 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) said on Thursday it was "business as usual" at its flagship hedge fund Global Alpha, amid speculation the investment bank was liquidating large parts of its portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The fund, which lost 6 percent of its value last year, has been the subject of persistent speculation for several days. Goldman on Wednesday denied market talk that it was liquidating the fund and declined further comment on it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In pre-market trade, Goldman shares fell to $185.36, down 4.1 percent from its Wednesday closing price of $193.30 and nearly 21 percent below its 52-week high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A few days ago, the fund had about $9 billion in assets under management, according to a person familiar with the situation. The hedge fund, run by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, is down about 16 percent this year after an 8 percent drop last month, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Several traders on Tuesday said Alpha had been selling certain risky positions, including German car parts supplier Continental (CONG.DE), aerospace company EADS EAD.PA, and Italian carmaker Fiat FIA.MI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman on Tuesday said the rumours of liquidation were false and denied talk that it was preparing an announcement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Alpha fund had been a top performer for years, fuelling growth in Goldman's money management business and making the bank the world's largest manager of hedge funds. Alpha promised to generate returns not correlated to the S 500 but with the same level of risk as the U.S. stocks benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Underperformance at Alpha has already put a dent into Goldman's otherwise stellar performance in recent quarters. In the first quarter, Goldman's incentive fees from asset management fell 78 percent to $23 million from a year earlier, a decline driven by Alpha's weak performance last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    And in the second quarter, Goldman said incentive fees fell again, by 87 percent. Net inflows of money into alternative investments dropped to nil during the quarter, compared with $6 billion received a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Before rebounding this week, Goldman's shares were down 10 percent this year, compared with a 1 percent gain by the S 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The recent turmoil in credit markets worldwide have played havoc on investors, including hedge funds, that made extensive bets on mortgages and related securities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier on Thursday, French bank BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) froze 1.6 billion euros ($2.21 billion) worth of funds, citing problems over U.S. subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Reporting by Joseph Giannone in New York and Sitaraman Shankar in London) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Matthew Tostevin; joseph.giannone.reuters.com@reuters.net;+1 646 223 6184)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ($1=.7257 Euro)   Keywords: GOLDMAN ALPHAFUND/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - British pop singer Lily Allen has no 
idea why her U.S. working visa was revoked, but she hopes she 
will be granted a new one for her planned September tour, her 
record company EMI Music said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Allen was detained at Los Angeles International Airport on 
Sunday for five hours after she arrived from Australia. She was 
searched, but not strip searched as reported, Murray Chalmers, 
spokesman for EMI Music in London, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The authorities decided to revoke her American O-1 work 
visa. She has no idea why she was singled out for such 
treatment," Chalmers said. "We are sure we have enough time to 
sort the situation before her next visit in September."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A report on the BBC Web site (www.bbc.co.uk) said Allen, 
22, had been detained by U.S. authorities in connection with 
her arrest in June following an incident outside a London 
nightclub in March. She received a warning from police but was 
not charged with any crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No one knows (why she lost her visa). That was just 
speculation," Chalmers said of the reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An O-1 visa allows people with extraordinary skills within 
the field of sciences, arts, education, business, athletics, or 
within the field of motion picture or television industry to 
work temporarily in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allen's manager, Neale Easterby of Empire Management, told 
Billboard magazine that the singer was allowed to enter the 
United States and will remain in the country -- where she is 
shooting a music video -- until Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday Allen, who has a reputation as a wild child in 
Britain, was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award. She is due 
to perform at the award show in Las Vegas on September 9 and 
also plans to tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allen, whose song "Smile" was a hit last year, had been due 
to tour the United States in May and June. But she canceled the 
concerts in April, saying she was tired and not performing as 
well as she could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Rewrites with quotes, adds Fortune SGAM replacing CIO)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Charlie Zhu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Aug 10 (Reuters) - Lu Jun, a top Chinese fund
manager, has resigned as chief investment officer of JPMorgan's
(JPM.N) China fund management joint venture, the venture said on
Friday, marking the latest series of high-profile moves in the
industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lu has quit for "personal reasons", China International Fund
Management Co. said in a statement. Lu is widely known in China's
1.8 trillion yuan ($238 billion) mutual fund sector for his
stock-picking skills and aggressive trading style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an apparent bid to soothe investors holding fund units
issued by China International, the company's chief executive
Mandy Wang said the performance of a mutual fund depended more on
teamwork, although Lu's departure was a loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have been through this before. Fund managers left our
company but facts have proved that our funds can still maintain
good performance despite those changes," Wang wrote in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China International in May fired Tang Jian, a senior fund
manager, over an official probe into stock trades, as Beijing
cracks down on irregularities in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wang quoted Lu as saying in her note: "I hope investors would
shift their confidence in me to China International Fund's
investment team."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is unclear yet whether Lu's resignation has triggered any
redemption of funds previously under his management.
A spokesman at China International -- which is preparing to
launch a fund to invest clients' money in overseas financial
markets -- declined to comment. Lu, who had just been promoted to
a deputy general manager of the company, could not be reached for
comment.
China International said it had accepted Lu's resignation,
and had hired Yang Anle and Liang Jun to manage Lu's main fund,
China Advantage, which recently won an award from fund
intelligence firm Lipper for being the best mixed-asset, flexible
equity fund over two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Senior fund managers at other fund houses contacted by
Reuters speculated that Lu quit probably because he found it
difficult to carry out his investment strategy after his firm
moved to centralise investment process following the recent
scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The official Shanghai Securities News reported on Friday that
Lu had left the company to pursue his own business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many Chinese fund managers, including Xiao Hua, a former star
fund manager for China's Bosera Asset Management Co., have quit
the mutual fund sector over the past two years to set up private
investment funds to tap the bullish Chinese market .SSEC, which
has risen around 78 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A mutual fund manager in China now typically earns several
hundred thousand to several million yuan a year. Chinese fund
managers are officially barred from putting their own money in
stocks, and until about a month ago, they were not allowed to buy
mutual funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Job hopping is on the rise in China's booming fund sector. In
the first quarter, 72 fund managers switched jobs, compared with
130 in the whole of 2006, state media have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fortune SGAM, China fund arm of French lender Societe
Generale (SOGN.PA), is replacing its chief investment officer, Yu
Rongquan, who is joining a rival company, sources told Reuters.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Aug 10 (Reuters) - Japanese real estate firm Ardepro

($253 million) by issuing new shares and convertible bonds to
Goldman Sachs (GS.N), sending its shares lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ardepro, which buys used apartment and office buildings and

worth of new shares on Aug. 28, taking a 17.9 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Tokyo-based company also plans to issue about 10 billion
yen in convertible bonds on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If converted into shares, that would raise Goldman's stake
in Ardepro to 23.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ardepro plans to use the proceeds to procure properties for
renovation and reselling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Ardepro were down 8.9 percent at 24,090 yen in
afternoon trade on concerns of dilution of per-share value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new share issue and conversion will boost Ardepro's
total shares outstanding by as much as 30 percent.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) and investors including former American International Group Inc. (AIG.N) Chairman Maurice "Hank" Greenberg will pump $3 billion into a hedge fund that plunged about 30 percent last week, the investment bank said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund, which had a net asset value of $3.6 billion before the infusion, is the third managed by Goldman that has been hurt by recent market turmoil. Down about 3 percent before last week, the fund has lost more than $2 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a sort of preemptive rescue," said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer for North Star Investment Management Corp. in Chicago. "They are trying to act sooner rather than later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a potential for crisis of confidence and these are very smart people," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman's Chief Financial Officer David Viniar denied that the cash infusion into the Global Equity Opportunities fund was a bailout. Rather, it was intended to raise cash to buy stocks in a market where valuations are "way out of whack," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not a rescue. Given the dislocation, we saw a good investment opportunity for us and other investors," Viniar said in a rare conference call between quarterly earnings reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is investing $2 billion of its own capital into the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional $1 billion will come from such investors as Greenberg's investment firm and insurance broker, C.V. Starr  Co.; Eli Broad, the billionaire founder of KB Home (KBH.N) and SunAmerica; and Perry Capital LLC, a hedge fund run by Goldman alumnus Richard Perry. Existing investors also can add money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global Equity has fallen "in the low 30s" in percentage terms this year, Viniar said, adding that the losses all happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares reversed early gains and fell nearly 1.7 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to close at $177.50, a 10-month low.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds closing stock price, fund manager quote)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
(GS.N) and investors including former American International
Group Inc. (AIG.N) Chairman Maurice "Hank" Greenberg will pump
$3 billion into a hedge fund that plunged about 30 percent last
week, the investment bank said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hedge fund, which had a net asset value of $3.6 billion
before the infusion, is the third managed by Goldman that has
been hurt by recent market turmoil. Down about 3 percent before
last week, the fund has lost more than $2 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a sort of preemptive rescue," said Eric Kuby,
chief investment officer for North Star Investment Management
Corp. in Chicago. "They are trying to act sooner rather than
later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a potential for crisis of confidence and these
are very smart people," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Goldman's Chief Financial Officer David Viniar denied
that the cash infusion into the Global Equity Opportunities
fund was a bailout. Rather, it was intended to raise cash to
buy stocks in a market where valuations are "way out of whack,"
Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is not a rescue. Given the dislocation, we saw a good
investment opportunity for us and other investors," Viniar said
in a rare conference call between quarterly earnings reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is investing $2 billion of its own capital into the
fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An additional $1 billion will come from such investors as
Greenberg's investment firm and insurance broker, C.V. Starr 
Co.; Eli Broad, the billionaire founder of KB Home (KBH.N) and
SunAmerica; and Perry Capital LLC, a hedge fund run by Goldman
alumnus Richard Perry. Existing investors also can add money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global Equity has fallen "in the low 30s" in percentage
terms this year, Viniar said, adding that the losses all
happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares reversed early gains and fell nearly 1.7
percent on the New York Stock Exchange to close at $177.50, a
10-month low. Goldman shares are down 11 percent so far this
year, slightly worse than the 10.3 percent decline in the
sectoral KBW Securities Broker Dealer index .XBD over the
same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a black eye for a company that has such a strong
track record for delivering good returns for investors,"
Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOT A RESCUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In recent weeks, volatile markets have wreaked havoc on
"quantitative" funds, pools of money that use computer programs

about 27 percent this year, with about one-half of that decline
in the past week. As of Monday the fund had about $7.25 billion

is also being taken to protect (Goldman's) image in the market,
pointing up moral hazard risks related to (Goldman) that go
beyond what we had assumed in our analysis," credit analysts at
Standard  Poor's said in a report.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. said on Monday it formed a new business group to work with advertisers and publishers and gain a foothold in an online advertising market expected to grow to $80 billion by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of the Advertiser and Publisher Solutions group comes on completion of its $6 billion acquisition of Web advertising firm aQuantive Inc., the software maker's largest acquisition ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft named Brian McAndrews, the former chief executive of aQuantive, to head the new advertising group, which will be responsible for building and marketing all of the company's advertising businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McAndrews will report directly to Kevin Johnson, president of Microsoft's platforms and services group. In an interview with Reuters, Johnson would not rule out future acquisitions, but said Microsoft has a complete advertising offering for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My view is that we have assembled all the components we need," said Johnson, who is also responsible for Microsoft's core Windows business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker announced its plan to purchase Seattle-based aQuantive in May, a key acquisition in its strategy to an online advertising powerhouse to compete against Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aQuantive deal is the largest in a recent wave of consolidation within the Internet advertising sector as the Web's largest players try to shore up their market positions in a rapidly growing industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just have the opportunity to trade gasoline for rocket fuel in terms of how fast we can grow," McAndrews said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal cleared regulatory hurdles last month, and aQuantive shareholders approved the acquisition on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web search leader Google is waiting for regulatory approval of its proposed $3.1 billion purchase of DoubleClick Inc., which helps advertisers serve and track ads online, in a move to enter the market for graphical display ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. antitrust officials are studying the deal after Microsoft and other Google rivals complained it could give Google too much control over online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEARCH ON "POSITIVE TRAJECTORY"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the transaction should not have a significant impact on the company's fiscal 2008 earnings projections.

Google, the market leader with about 50 percent share, has built a multibillion dollar business from search, while Microsoft's online services group has been in the red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay-per-click ads tied to search results has been the main driver of online advertising growth in recent years, but McAndrews sees other forms of Web advertising playing a larger role as new forms of media like online video gain acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Search was a key part of the growth in the last several years," said McAndrews. "With more emerging media, we'll continue to see search be very important, but just a part of the mix and a less significant part of the mix over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft were down 8 cents at $28.63 in afternoon Nasdaq trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michele Gershberg in New York, editing by Gerald E.

been hammered by recent market turmoil. For details see
[ID:nN13324144].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman had been proactive during the past year in
curtailing its exposure to the deteriorating U.S. subprime
mortgage market, and we believe that its current related
balance sheet exposures and financing commitments are
modest," SP said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is holding substantial debt in the wake of
failed corporate underwritings, and has "significant
additional underwriting commitments," SP said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charges related to such exposures will likely weigh on
Goldman's financial performance during the second half of
fiscal 2007, as will the impact of recent market turmoil on
Goldman's business activity, SP said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, we had never assumed that the trend of margin
improvement and earnings growth that marked Goldman's
performance during 2002 through early 2007 would
continue indefinitely, and we expect Goldman's
profitability to remain satisfactory," SP said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  SP affirmed its "AA-minus" counterparty rating on
Goldman, the fourth-highest investment grade. Counterparty
credit ratings reflect how well a company can meet its
financial obligations with customers, trading partners or
other parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spreads on Goldman's 5.95 percent bonds due in 2027
narrowed to 169 basis points on Monday, in from 176 basis
points on Friday, according to MarketAxess.

As well, the said: "Many funds employing quantitative strategies are currently under pressure as recent conditions have resulted in significant market dislocation. Across most sectors, there has been an increase in overlapping trades, a surge in volatility and an increase in correlations. These factors have combined to challenge many of the trading algorithms used in quantitative strategies. We believe the current values that the market is assigning to the assets underlying various funds represent a discount that is not supported by the fundamentals."

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Cyntia Barrera Diaz &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Aug 10 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa has jumped into the fast-growing online social networking market, competing for Latin American visitors against heavyweights MySpace and hi5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa (TV.N)(TLVACPO.MX), the world's biggest producer of Spanish-language content, will pipe exclusive videos and interviews with talent from its hit television shows into its newly created Gyggs.com, aiming for users aged 13 to 24. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa wants to attract teenagers who will chat online about their favorite shows, soap operas and pop singers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The site has lined up 50,000 registrations since its launch three weeks ago. Most of its Spanish-only content is Mexico-specific, but visitors from anywhere in the world can create a profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are growing at a fast pace. I think that we could reach between 250,000 and 300,000 registrations" after 12 months, Juan Saldivar, chief executive of Televisa's online businesses, said in an interview on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Online social networks, which allow users to share images, video, text and music among friends, are one of the hottest trends online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N bought social networking site MySpace.com, one of the Web's fastest growing properties, for about $580 million in 2005. It is now considered to be worth about $10 billion by some Wall Street analysts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In January, MySpace launched a Web site tailored to the Mexican market, and as of July it had more than 1.5 million active users per month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Almost a fifth of Mexico's 103 million people use the Internet, the government believes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa has gained international recognition for its tear-jerking soap operas, which are often translated into other languages and broadcast abroad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In recent years, Televisa has notched record ratings with shows for young viewers, such as "Rebelde," a trend-setting remake about fashionable teenagers, and "La Fea Mas Bella," Televisa's take on a Colombian TV phenomenon that spun off versions from India to Germany. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Saldivar said Televisa's knowledge of the local market will give it an edge on rivals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We have a platform that is 100 percent Mexican, focusing on local premium content," he said. "Unlike others ... we are going to focus on the Mexican and Hispanic culture. We will have all the official sites for (Televisa) talent and brands." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Gyggs.com will be available to users in the United States, where Televisa's plan to expand among the Hispanic community stalled in recent years due to legal fights with Univision Communications Inc UVN.N, its main partner there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa has invested at least $2.5 million in the Gyggs.com development and advertising, Saldivar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Braden Reddall; Mexico City newsroom 52 55 5282 7161, cyntia.barrera.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: MEXICO TELEVISA/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

and Chevron Corp.'s (CVX.N) 54,000-bpd Honolulu refinery sit
224 miles (360 km) from the magnitude 5.4 earthquake's
epicenter, which was off the coast of the island of Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Flossie as of 3 p.m. Tuesday Hawaii time was not affecting
operations at Tesoro's marketing terminal in Hilo on the island
of Hawaii, said a company representative. The harbor at Hilo
was closed by the U.S. Coast Guard, but there is enough supply
in storage to supply Tesoro customers, the representative
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron also said its marketing terminal in Hilo was
unaffected by the earthquake. Hilo is 25 miles from the quake's
epicenter, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The strategy of using debt like a steroid to boost returns on investments came back to haunt some hedge funds in a big way last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was made clear to investors on Monday when the Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) said two of its hedge funds had sustained losses of about 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The so-called quant funds used strategies based on computer models to seize upon market anomalies and boost returns through high leverage, or investing with borrowed money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"First and foremost, these were all leveraged bets," said S.P. Kothari, a professor at MIT's Sloan School of Management. "If you're leveraged at six times, a loss of 5 percent is magnified into 30 percent. But that's also why some hedge funds have made 100 percent returns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's Global Equity Opportunities (GEO) fund -- which last week shed over a third of its value -- employed leverage of about six times equity capital, Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told analysts on a conference call on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That fund was left with about $3.6 billion in net asset value after last week's losses, according to Viniar, suggesting the hit to GEO was at least $1.9 billion of a prior net asset value of at least $5.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the loss was humongous, the amount was only about 5 percent of GEO's leveraged market exposure of at least $30 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and others have since stepped in to inject $3 billion of new equity into the struggling fund. Goldman declined to comment further following the Monday call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leverage was also a big culprit in the recent meltdown of two Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N funds that invested in bonds linked to subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Leverage is a double-edged sword," said Merrill Lynch analyst Richard Bernstein in a research note. "It enhances returns on the upside, but also makes underperformance more rapid and severe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'WAY OUT OF WHACK'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adverse markets can easily cost funds which are as highly leveraged as GEO, one-third of their asset value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's Viniar said last week's market events were "unprecedented and characterized by remarkable speed and intensity" -- and called stock values "way out of whack."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly harmful to quant funds at Goldman and elsewhere may have been trading strategies that were governed by similar programs. Those similarities could exacerbate unexpected market turns with a flood of buy or sell orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All these quant funds seem to be running the same core models," said Brad Alford, a portfolio manager at Alpha Capital Management in Atlanta, whose clients' investments include hedge funds. "None of them seemed to work when the market had trouble."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quant funds were whiplashed by technically driven events last week, putting them on the wrong side of a series of market bets, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in the week equities rallied when short sellers covered their positions, a fund manager said, while later in the week some stocks fell as funds sold off liquid positions to build cash reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Models were telling them to do one thing and for several days in a row they should have pretty much done the opposite," the manager added, asking to remain anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'IT'S ACROSS THE BOARD'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far hedge fund losses have been showcased through disclosures by public companies like Goldman or Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these funds are subject to more disclosure regulations than those managed by private companies, meaning similar losses in private funds may not yet be visible to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the $26 billion-plus Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund, managed by quantitative trading pioneer Renaissance Technologies Corp, was down about 7 percent as of last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think the losses here are the result of a few funds making unusually large bets," said MIT's Kothari. "It's across the board."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Dan Wilchins)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp told the U.S. Federal 
Communications Commission on Monday it was confident that 
vacant television airwaves can be used for wireless services 
without interfering with broadcast signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The unused U.S. television airwaves would be available for 
other services by early 2009, when broadcasters are due to 
switch from analog to digital signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a document filed with the FCC, Microsoft disputed the 
agency's recent finding that prototype Internet devices caused 
static on existing broadcasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said its first prototype had a defective 
internal component but that a new model worked successfully in 
a demonstration for FCC technical experts last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We remain confident that the unused channels in the 
television spectrum band can successfully be used without 
harmful interference to incumbent licensees such as television 
and wireless microphone services," Microsoft said in a 
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, computer chipmaker Intel Corp and other 
companies have been pressing the FCC to make the vacant 
airwaves available for use without a license, while 
broadcasters have expressed concerns about potential 
interference with their signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies hope the unlicensed airwaves could be used 
for a variety of wireless services, including high-speed 
Internet access, particularly in rural areas where such 
offerings can be scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2004, the FCC proposed creating two categories of users 
for the airwaves: one for low-power, personal, portable devices 
like Wi-Fi and a second group for fixed commercial operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCC also proposed requiring that the devices include 
technology to identify unused spectrum and avoid interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCC has said it would set final technical requirements 
for devices to use those airwaves without a license by October.&lt;/p&gt;

U.S. Geological Survey.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 14 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), the
second-largest U.S. oil company, said on Tuesday it will split
its global upstream operations into four operating companies
along regional lines to better manage its growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also named John Watson its executive vice
president of strategy and development -- a newly created
position that will oversee business development, mergers and
acquisition and development of major capital projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watson, currently president of Chevron's international
exploration and production division, will move to the new job
on Jan. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said its worldwide exploration and production group
will expand from two entities to four -- Africa and Latin
America; Asia Pacific; Eurasia, Europe and Middle East; and
North America. It currently has companies just for North
American and for international exploration and production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, the company said it was making progress on more
than 30 oil and natural gas development projects around the
world in which it was investing at least $1 billion apiece.

&lt;p&gt;Aug 14 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) to "neutral" from "overweight",
after the world's largest retailer posted lower-than-expected
quarterly profit and cut its full-year earnings forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said it was concerned about falling EBIT

was surprised by the drop in international margins with trends
weak in Mexico, Canada and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said although the company was taking appropriate
measures to fix its core domestic business, its turnaround has
been extended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see its eventual recovery further down the road as
macro factors, internal transitions and no near-term catalysts

(PFE.N) advertisement for Geodon omitted important risk information and contained unsupported claims that the schizophrenia drug was better than another drug, U.S. regulators said in a letter released on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Food and Drug Administration asked Pfizer to stop running the ad, which appeared in a medical journal. The agency's letter to Pfizer was dated July 16 but posted on the FDA Web site on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The FDA said the Pfizer ad included some information about potential side effects from injectable Geodon but failed to list "other serious warnings and precautions." Specifically, the promotion failed to mention the possibility of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, hyperglycemia and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In addition, the ad implied Geodon was more effective than a generic drug, haloperidol, "when this has not been demonstrated by substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience," the FDA said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This piece is false or misleading because it omits important risk information and contains unsubstantiated superiority claims," the FDA letter said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A Pfizer spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The FDA letter was posted here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Lisa Richwine) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Braden Reddall; Reuters Messaging: lisa.richwine.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 202 310-5691)) Keywords: PFIZER GEODON/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) and 
investors including former American International Group Inc. 
(AIG.N) Chairman Maurice "Hank" Greenberg will pump $3 billion 
into a hedge fund that plunged about 30 percent last week, the 
investment bank said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The hedge fund, which had a net asset value of $3.6 billion 
before the infusion, is the third managed by Goldman that has 
been hurt by recent market turmoil. Down about 3 percent before 
last week, the fund has lost more than $2 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a sort of preemptive rescue," said Eric Kuby, 
chief investment officer for North Star Investment Management 
Corp. in Chicago. "They are trying to act sooner rather than 
later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a potential for crisis of confidence and these 
are very smart people," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Goldman's Chief Financial Officer David Viniar denied 
that the cash infusion into the Global Equity Opportunities 
fund was a bailout. Rather, it was intended to raise cash to 
buy stocks in a market where valuations are "way out of whack," 
Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is not a rescue. Given the dislocation, we saw a good 
investment opportunity for us and other investors," Viniar said 
in a rare conference call between quarterly earnings reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is investing $2 billion of its own capital into the 
fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An additional $1 billion will come from such investors as 
Greenberg's investment firm and insurance broker, C.V. Starr  
Co.; Eli Broad, the billionaire founder of KB Home (KBH.N) and 
SunAmerica; and Perry Capital LLC, a hedge fund run by Goldman 
alumnus Richard Perry. Existing investors also can add money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global Equity has fallen "in the low 30s" in percentage 
terms this year, Viniar said, adding that the losses all 
happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares reversed early gains and fell nearly 1.7 
percent on the New York Stock Exchange to close at $177.50, a 
10-month low. Goldman shares are down 11 percent so far this 
year, slightly worse than the 10.3 percent decline in the 
sectoral KBW Securities Broker Dealer index .XBD over the 
same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a black eye for a company that has such a strong 
track record for delivering good returns for investors," 
Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo said in a research note.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOT A RESCUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In recent weeks, volatile markets have wreaked havoc on 
"quantitative" funds, pools of money that use computer programs 
to identify and execute trades. Stock markets bounced up or 
down by 1 percent in each of the past 13 days, while credit 
spreads widened to their largest gap in two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund, a $26 billion fund 
managed by James Simons, said last week it is down about 7 
percent this year amid selling by other quant funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quant funds exacerbated the problem by selling off 
otherwise solid stocks all at once, Goldman said. By the end of 
last week, with the fund's value falling, Goldman decided to 
pour money in and convinced outside investors to write checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Goldman shares tumbled amid speculation of major 
losses at two Goldman-managed funds: the flagship Global Alpha, 
which uses quant and other investing strategies, and the North 
American Equity Opportunities fund, a quant fund that makes 
both long and short bets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, Goldman said the value of Global Alpha was down 
about 27 percent this year, with about one-half of that decline 
in the past week. As of Monday the fund had about $7.25 billion 
in assets under management, down from $10 billion at the end of 
last year, a person briefed on the fund said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; North American Equity Opportunities, a quant fund that 
started the year with about $767 million in assets, is down "in 
the high 30s" percent this year to less than $500 million, the 
source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The recent struggles represent an embarrassing setback for 
Goldman, which until recently had compiled a strong track 
record managing hedge funds. The poor performance has also 
translated into lower asset management fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar denied market talk that Goldman was unwinding the 
Alpha and North American funds. He said the funds did not 
require new cash to pursue opportunities, though executives did 
not rule out infusions for its other funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, some analysts raised concerns that Goldman was using 
its capital to shore up an affiliated fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are concerned that this action on the part of Goldman 
is also being taken to protect (Goldman's) image in the market, 
pointing up moral hazard risks related to (Goldman) that go 
beyond what we had assumed in our analysis," credit analysts at 
Standard  Poor's said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Herb Lash and Kristina Cooke,

&lt;p&gt;         By Patrick Markey          EL PENOL, Colombia, Aug 15 (Reuters) - With a machete and a long-handled spade, Colombian farmers like Claudio Gualtero are trying to succeed where seven years of aerial coca fumigation struggled in the battle to slash the country's drug exports.          After receiving billions of dollars in U.S. aid to spray coca crops from the air, Colombia is shifting strategy to intensify manual eradication on the ground to attack the leaves used to make cocaine that ends up on U.S. and European streets.          Once a small-time coca farmer, Gualtero now captains a work gang uprooting illicit crops along the dry hillsides of southern Narino province, where guerrillas, traffickers and paramilitaries battle over cocaine routes to the Pacific.          This is what creates so much chaos, the 52-year-old farmer said as his team, including four of his sons, dug up coca bushes speckled with red seeds under heavy police guard. Every plant we destroy is another problem gone.          Critics say the U.S.-backed fumigation plan has failed to live up to its promise to slash cocaine output or provide sufficient alternatives for farmers who have learned how to protect coca crops after pilots dump trails of withering herbicides.          While U.S. military and counter-narcotics aid helped Colombia reduce violence from its 40-year conflict, cocaine production remains stubbornly above 600 tonnes a year, or more than 60 percent of the world's total production, the United Nations says.          Last month President Alvaro Uribe acknowledged mistakes made with fumigation after farmers complained legal crops were hit by herbicides, and he said the three-year-old eradication program was more efficient in killing coca at the root.          But the shift came after U.S. Democrats, critical of the results of aerial herbicides, pushed to cut military and fumigation aid in favor of more funding for development programs to ween farmers away from the lucrative drug crop.          Spray planes will still buzz over dangerous areas, but the government sees eradication teams more permanently rooting out coca, creating jobs for poor farmers and bolstering state presence in areas under rebel influence.          A hectare eradicated by hand is 100 percent eradicated, said Victoria Restrepo, head of the presidential illicit crop program. When you spray a hectare, that doesn't mean 100 percent will be eradicated.          REBEL THREATS, MINES          From a makeshift camp of tents and black plastic sheeting near the impoverished town of El Penol in Narino, work gangs hike out with a police patrol shortly after dawn to destroy coca sown among a patchwork of maize and plantain plots.          Many are poor farmers struggling for work and most are shipped in from other parts of Colombia for two-month contracts to guard against guerrillas or paramilitaries seeking revenge on the local population for lost coca.          Narino, with its easy access to the Pacific coast, has become a major center for coca production and turf wars among rival armed groups looking to secure control of smuggling.          Colombia sprays more than 320,000 acres (130,000 hectares) of land each year, but the U.N. estimates the country still has about 200,000 acres (80,000 hectares) of coca. Washington puts that figure higher.          Authorities hope more than 100 work gangs hacking up an average of 3 acres (1.2 hectares) a day nationwide can destroy 120,000 acres (50,000 hectares) in 2007.          But the program has risks. Six eradicators were killed last year when they set off a bomb attached to a coca plant and rebels killed 13 soldiers assigned to protect workers. Rebels often lay home-made land mines.          Rafael Nieto, an analyst and former deputy justice minister, said eradication would effectively compliment spraying, but other experts questioned the long-term impact on coca output.          The eradicators leave, the troops leave and a vacuum opens up again for the illegal armed  groups, said Vicente Torrijos, an analyst at Bogota's Rosario University. The outlook for this strategy looks bleak.

This is what creates so much chaos, the 52-year-old farmer said as his team, including four of his sons, dug up coca bushes speckled with red seeds under heavy police guard. Every plant we destroy is another problem gone.          Critics say the U.S.-backed fumigation plan has failed to live up to its promise to slash cocaine output or provide sufficient alternatives for farmers who have learned how to protect coca crops after pilots dump trails of withering herbicides.          While U.S. military and counter-narcotics aid helped Colombia reduce violence from its 40-year conflict, cocaine production remains stubbornly above 600 tonnes a year, or more than 60 percent of the world's total production, the United Nations says.          Last month President Alvaro Uribe acknowledged mistakes made with fumigation after farmers complained legal crops were hit by herbicides, and he said the three-year-old eradication program was more efficient in killing coca at the root.          But the shift came after U.S. Democrats, critical of the results of aerial herbicides, pushed to cut military and fumigation aid in favor of more funding for development programs to ween farmers away from the lucrative drug crop.          Spray planes will still buzz over dangerous areas, but the government sees eradication teams more permanently rooting out coca, creating jobs for poor farmers and bolstering state presence in areas under rebel influence.          A hectare eradicated by hand is 100 percent eradicated, said Victoria Restrepo, head of the presidential illicit crop program. When you spray a hectare, that doesn't mean 100 percent will be eradicated.          REBEL THREATS, MINES          From a makeshift camp of tents and black plastic sheeting near the impoverished town of El Penol in Narino, work gangs hike out with a police patrol shortly after dawn to destroy coca sown among a patchwork of maize and plantain plots.          Many are poor farmers struggling for work and most are shipped in from other parts of Colombia for two-month contracts to guard against guerrillas or paramilitaries seeking revenge on the local population for lost coca.          Narino, with its easy access to the Pacific coast, has become a major center for coca production and turf wars among rival armed groups looking to secure control of smuggling.          Colombia sprays more than 320,000 acres (130,000 hectares) of land each year, but the U.N. estimates the country still has about 200,000 acres (80,000 hectares) of coca. Washington puts that figure higher.          Authorities hope more than 100 work gangs hacking up an average of 3 acres (1.2 hectares) a day nationwide can destroy 120,000 acres (50,000 hectares) in 2007.          But the program has risks. Six eradicators were killed last year when they set off a bomb attached to a coca plant and rebels killed 13 soldiers assigned to protect workers. Rebels often lay home-made land mines.          Rafael Nieto, an analyst and former deputy justice minister, said eradication would effectively compliment spraying, but other experts questioned the long-term impact on coca output.          The eradicators leave, the troops leave and a vacuum opens up again for the illegal armed  groups, said Vicente Torrijos, an analyst at Bogota's Rosario University. The outlook for this strategy looks bleak.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 15 (Reuters) - Chevron (CVX.N) has evacuated a

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp told the U.S. Federal 
Communications Commission on Monday it was confident that 
vacant television airwaves can be used for wireless services 
without interfering with broadcast signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The unused U.S. television airwaves would be available for 
other services by early 2009, when broadcasters are due to 
switch from analog to digital signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a document filed with the FCC, Microsoft disputed the 
agency's recent finding that prototype Internet devices caused 
static on existing broadcasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said its first prototype had a defective 
internal component but that a new model worked successfully in 
a demonstration for FCC technical experts last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We remain confident that the unused channels in the 
television spectrum band can successfully be used without 
harmful interference to incumbent licensees such as television 
and wireless microphone services," Microsoft said in a 
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, computer chipmaker Intel Corp and other 
companies have been pressing the FCC to make the vacant 
airwaves available for use without a license, while 
broadcasters have expressed concerns about potential 
interference with their signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies hope the unlicensed airwaves could be used 
for a variety of wireless services, including high-speed 
Internet access, particularly in rural areas where such 
offerings can be scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2004, the FCC proposed creating two categories of users 
for the airwaves: one for low-power, personal, portable devices 
like Wi-Fi and a second group for fixed commercial operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCC also proposed requiring that the devices include 
technology to identify unused spectrum and avoid interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCC has said it would set final technical requirements 
for devices to use those airwaves without a license by October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 15 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled that a
lawsuit claiming Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) violated human rights in
Nigeria should proceed, throwing out some charges against the
U.S. oil company but leaving the centerpiece of the plaintiffs'
case intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A group of Nigerians filed suit against Chevron in May
1999, charging that Chevron Nigeria recruited Nigerian military
and police personnel to fire weapons on Nigerians staging a
protest at a Chevron oil platform in 1998, killing two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also claim the company was complicit in an attack on
two villages in the Niger Delta, during which at least four
villagers were killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judge Susan Illston of the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California gave summary judgment on
Tuesday in favor of Chevron on some issues -- throwing out, for
instance, claims of property damages by the villagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the judge allowed wrongful death and other suits to
proceed and reinstated some human rights claims against
Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A jury could conclude that Chevron Nigeria Ltd. had the
power to hire, supervise, and train the government security
forces, and that Chevron Nigeria Ltd. did so, or failed to do
so, negligently," Illston said in one order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She said that a jury could also conclude that the company's
hiring and failure to train the security forces were a
proximate cause of the alleged injuries of the victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The court correctly refused to let narrow legalistic
excuses allow Chevron to escape responsibility for these brutal
attacks," Rick Herz, litigation coordinator at EarthRights
International and a lawyer for the Nigerians, said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The court's ruling reaffirms that corporations who are
complicit in human rights abuses can be held accountable,
regardless of where those abuses occur."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cindy Cohn, another lawyer for the plaintiffs, said no date
has been set for the trial, but she expects it to begin within
a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron was not immediately available for comment.

&lt;p&gt; (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

 Aug 15 - DBRS has today confirmed all ratings for The Goldman Sachs Group,
Inc. (GS.N) (Goldman or the Company) and related entities, including the
Company's long-term Issuer  Senior Debt rating of AA (low) and its Short-Term
Instruments rating of R-1 (middle). The trend on all ratings was confirmed at
Stable.

 This confirmation follows a statement by Goldman that it, together with
other parties, has agreed to invest $3 billion in the Global Equity
Opportunities Fund (GEO), a long/short equity strategy fund managed by its
asset management division, Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM).

 With a net asset value of $3.6 billion prior to this investment, the GEO
fund has suffered significant losses in its net asset value (NAV) last week as
a result of the current market turmoil that drove adverse patterns in
correlations, volatility and the volume of trades. According to the Company,
the motivation behind the investment was to invest in the GEO fund at what
Goldman perceives as an attractive price given the decline in NAV, while at the
same time providing some support for existing investors in the GEO fund by
alleviating pressure to further reduce leverage in the fund.

 In confirming the rating, DBRS recognizes that Goldman's contribution to
the investment of approximately $2 billion is very manageable relative to the
Company's total assets of $943 billion and total shareholders' equity of $38.5
billion as of May 2007, and pre-tax earnings of $3.4 billion in Q2 2007. Given
Goldman's skillful management of risk, DBRS anticipates that the Company has
carefully weighed the opportunities for gain against the risk of loss, within
the same framework used to evaluate other investment decisions.

 Accordingly, DBRS does not perceive that the transaction by itself adds
significantly more risk than other investments the Company might make.
DBRS also recognizes that this investment does raise the question of the extent
to which Goldman would support other GSAM funds that may experience stress and
the implication that this poses a contingency risk for the Company, which may
have a bearing on its rating in the future, if similar actions were repeated.
DBRS views this contingency risk as limited, given the circumstances of the
investment in the GEO fund.

 The Company stressed that it was not establishing a precedent. Moreover, it
did not provide support to two other GSAM funds that have also had losses, the
Global Alpha fund and the North American Equity Opportunities Fund.

 Some unique aspects of this investment suggest that Goldman might
contemplate such actions only under a limited set of circumstances. According
to the Company, the decline in the GEO fund's NAV appears to have been caused
by current market dislocation rather than a permanent loss. Therefore, the
Company expects to generate an appropriate return on its capital commitment,
when markets stabilize. DBRS would be concerned about the extent of implied
support, if Goldman were to take similar actions in a situation that does not
offer an appropriate potential return for the risk taken.

 DBRS notes that Goldman's ratings are underpinned by its formidable global
investment banking franchise, its powerful diversified global fixed-income and
equities businesses, as well as its strong financial profile and skillful risk
management, Goldman has a substantial earnings cushion that would enable it to
absorb significant adverse events out of current earnings.

 DBRS views Goldman's liquidity as strong, enabling the Company to meet its
obligations even in a stress scenario. Nevertheless, DBRS will continue to
monitor how the current turmoil in financial markets affects Goldman's
liquidity.

 Moreover, the Company has capital resources commensurate with its strong
earnings power and its diversified franchise. DBRS also notes that Goldman has
a long track record of skillful risk management with the ability to generate
substantial rewards relative to risks taken.

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada could put
interest rates on hold indefinitely if the domestic market for
commercial paper stays turbulent and dysfunctional, J.P. Morgan
analyst Ted Carmichael said in a report on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "As long as the commercial paper market remains seized up,
the Bank of Canada is highly unlikely to raise the policy rate
on the Sept. 5 decision date," he said, warning that financing
delays could delay economic activity and reduce growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Should the current market situation persist (or worsen)
through August 24, the JPMorgan BoC rate forecast will be
changed to "on hold indefinitely"."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a Canadian rate cut was unlikely, unless it was part of
concerted rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other
central banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carmichael said it was not clear if the Bank of Canada
would or could find a way to inject funds into the market for
asset-backed commercial paper, which has seized up since major
player Coventree Inc COF.TO said it was unable to place new
paper in a fallout from the U.S. subprime mortgage woes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Only if short-term financing markets return to some
semblance of normalcy soon will the BoC be able to focus on
normal macroeconomic factors in making its interest rate
decision on Sept. 5," Carmichael said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Up to the turmoil in the commercial paper market most
analysts had expected the Bank of Canada to raise interest
rates on Sept. 5 to cool the economy and keep inflation under
control.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, share movement) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aug 14 (Reuters) - Icagen Inc. ICGN.O said it entered into a collaboration and licensing agreement with Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) for potential treatments for pain and related disorders and announced an equity investment of up to $15 million by Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The companies will develop and commercialize compounds which target three specific sodium ion channels, which are important in the generation of electrical signals in nerve fibers that mediate the initiation, transmission and sensation of pain, Icagen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer will fund the entire collaboration and will have exclusive rights to commercialize products developed under the alliance, Icagen added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Icagen rose more than 69 percent to $3.25 in early electronic trade, after closing at $1.92 on Monday on the Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Under the terms of the deal, Icagen will receive $38 million in committed funding from Pfizer over the first two years of the collaboration, including an initial upfront license fee of $12 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer's equity investment, which is also in connection to the alliance, consists of an initial $5 million investment in Icagen common stock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Icagen has an option to sell up to an additional $10 million common shares to Pfizer at any time during the first 18 months following the date of the purchase agreement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Icagen is also eligible to receive $359 million in development, regulatory and commercialization milestones for each product developed, and tiered royalties depending on sales achieved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Deepti Chaudhary and Niveditha Ravi in Bangalore) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Himani Sarkar; Reuters Messaging: deepti.chaudhary.reuters.com@reuters.net; within U.S. +1 646 2238780; outside U.S. +91 80 4135 5800)) Keywords: ICAGEN PFIZER/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with fire under control, details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Bernie Woodall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Aug 16 (Reuters) - A fire struck one of two
crude units at Chevron's (CVX.N) 325,000 barrels per day
Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery on Thursday, injuring no one
but helping send gasoline prices nearly 2 percent higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A "major portion" of the plant, Chevron's biggest in the
United States, continues to operate, company officals told
Reuters. The blaze was noticed at 2:15 p.m. Central Time and
contained a couple of hours later, but still was burning at
8:30 p.m. CDT. (0030 GMT)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were unable to say what caused the fire, how much
damage it had caused or when full operations would be restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There were no injuries," said Steve Renfroe, the refinery
public affairs official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Renfroe said that the fire was at the No. 2 crude unit at
Pascagoula, and that the No. 1 crude unit at the refinery was
operating. A crude unit is at the core of the refining process,
breaking down crude for processing into refined fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The smoke was visible four miles away," said a local fire
department official, who said the fire was being fought by
private refinery firefighters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pascagoula is one of the 10 largest refineries in the
United States and fears that the fire would reduce fuel
supplies lifted futures prices, with September gasoline RBc1
up 1.75 percent to $2.0130 per gallon in after hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those gains and a 60-cent rise in the benchmark crude
contract CLc1 helped markets recover their poise following
much deeper losses on Thursday, when the energy complex
suffered another wave of selling linked to global credit market
turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and heating oil produced
at Pascagoula flow into the Colonial Pipeline, the biggest U.S.
pipeline, which runs from Texas up to the New York area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another Chevron spokesman said crews for the Thursday night
shift reported as usual and that Friday morning's crews were
being told to report for work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plant has suffered extended outages twice in the past
decade, most recently in 2005, after Hurricanes Rita and
Katrina forced it to shut down for six weeks. It was also
closed for three months in 1998 when heavy rains and a storm
surge from Hurricane Georges flooded the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike 1998, when world oil markets were awash in crude and
U.S. oil cost a sixth of its current price, traders are on high
alert for any supply disruption that could erode gasoline
stocks, which have only recently recovered to normal levels, or
curtail heating fuel supplies ahead of the winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil traders are also anxious about the possibility that
seasonal hurricanes could deal another blow to Gulf Coast
refineries, which account for nearly half total U.S. capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The season's first big storm, Hurricane Dean, is expected
to strengthen into a Category 4 storm over the next few days,
although recent forecasts show it crossing the Yucatan
peninsula and entering the southern Gulf, possibly sparing
coastal plants.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details and background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE Aug 16 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) and PriceWaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL] agreed to pay about $5.29 million to settle charges of kickbacks for technology contracts with government agencies, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    International Business Machines Corp. has agreed to pay about $2.97 million, while auditing firm PwC will pay about $2.32 million, the DoJ said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The complaints were filed by Norman Rille and Neal Robert under the whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The provisions allow those who file successful complaints on fraud against the government to receive a share of the resulting recovery. Rille and Roberts will receive an amount to be determined in the near future, the department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    PwC said the allegations were related to work performed by its former consulting business, since sold in October 2002. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "PwC believes that the allegations of the complaint characterizing conduct as 'kickbacks' are completely without merit ... but (the company) chose to settle the case, without any admission of wrongdoing, in order to avoid the expense, distraction and uncertainty of litigation," spokesman David Nestor said in an e-mail to Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM could not immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The DoJ said the actions were part of a larger ongoing investigation of government technology vendors and consultants that has already resulted in complaints being filed in Arkansas against Accenture Ltd.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 16 (Reuters) - A Credit Suisse analyst said
Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) Chairman Rex Tillerson told a group of
analysts that the huge Gorgon gas project offshore Australia
won't proceed at current prices, but Exxon called the report
inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In a research note released on Wednesday afternoon, Credit
Suisse analyst Mark Flannery paraphrased Tillerson as saying
that "all partners are agreed that the project cannot go ahead
at current cost levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The greater Gorgon area project has an estimated gas
reserve of about 40 trillion cubic feet (tcf) -- a quarter of
Australia's known gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Gorgon partners plan to build a gas processing plant on
the island that would have a total liquefaction capacity of 10
million tonnes per year, but soaring costs have delayed the
project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Gorgon's operator, holds a 50 percent
stake in the Gorgon project while Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSa.L) each have a 25 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon disputed Flannery's account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Credit Suisse report includes inaccuracies and
speculation on which we cannot comment," said Exxon spokesman
Gantt Walton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson also said all aspects of Gorgon are being
examined, up to and including moving the site from Barrow
Island, according to both Flannery and Bear Stearns analyst
Nicole Decker. Flannery presumed the move would be onshore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson met with analysts in New York to celebrate the
company's 125th anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They said in their research notes that Tillerson seemed
relatively bearish on oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon Mobil does not take a view on oil prices, though Mr.
Tillerson commented on the disconnect between the current oil
price and supply/demand fundamentals," Bear Stearns' Decker
wrote in her note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He believes current prices reflect 'a layer of something'
that, if a correction in oil prices should occur, would not
come back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three research notes released by analysts who attended the
meeting offered different takes on Tillerson's views on
acquisitions, ranging from "don't expect MA" to "Exxon Mobil
is ready to do a deal, a big deal."

 (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By George Chen and Tony Munroe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI/HONG KONG Aug 16 (Reuters) - Chongqing City
Commercial Bank, a small lender in western China, tapped Goldman
Sachs' (GS.N) mainland joint venture to sponsor a domestic IPO
worth up to 5 billion yuan (US$658 million), sources familiar
with the deal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The A-share initial public offering is expected to take
place by the end of this year, the sources said, in a mainland
Chinese market .SSEC that has quadrupled since the start of
2006 and seen a voracious appetite for new issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chongqing Bank scrapped plans earlier this year for a Hong
Kong listing after a deal to sell a 7.99 percent stake to U.S.
private equity firm the Carlyle Group [CYL.UL] fell through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mainland China's soaring markets have made it a popular
destination for local firms that might otherwise have listed in
Hong Kong -- worrying global investment banks that, unlike
Goldman Sachs (GS.N), UBS (UBSN.VX) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N),
do not have domestic brokerage tie-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chongqing Bank's domestic listing is expected to raise
between 4 billion and 5 billion yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong's Dah Sing Banking Corp. (2356.HK) owns 17 percent
of the lender and may try to raise that to 20 percent, Chongqing
Bank Chairman Zhang Fu told Reuters last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Gaohua Securities, the Wall Street giant's
mainland Chinese joint venture, last month sponsored the
Shenzhen IPO of another Chinese city lender, Bank of Ningbo
002142.SZ, which raised 4.14 billion yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of Ningbo's shares have nearly tripled since listing.
Bank of Ningbo and Bank of Nanjing, which made its debut on the
same day, were the first two city banks to go public in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banking stocks have performed strongly thanks to surging
economic growth, an appreciating yuan CNY=CFXS, growing fee
income from products such as credit cards, and a booming overall
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chinese banks listed in Hong Kong and mainland China are
among the most expensive in the world, as investors view them as
a proxy for the country's breakneck economic growth. Bank of
Nanjing trades at more than 55 times forecast 2007 earnings,
while Bank of Ningbo trades at 79 times expected results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong-listed shares in the country's biggest lender,
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (1398.HK) 601398.HK,
trade at 20.5 times forecast earnings. Its Shanghai-listed
shares trade at a 61-percent premium to the Hong Kong counter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By comparison, London-based global bank HSBC Holdings
(0005.HK) (HSBA.L) has a forward P/E of 11 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other Chinese city banks are expected to tap the stock
market in coming years including Bank of Shanghai, Bank of
Dalian and Bank of Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs and Chongqing Bank declined to comment.

global equity strategist at JPMorgan, has left the firm, a
spokesman said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chakrabortti had been "quite cautious" on U.S. stocks for
about two years until earlier this year. In the second quarter
he moved to an overweight position in U.S. equities relative to
international stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He told a Reuters Summit in June that the acceleration in
U.S. economic growth and weakness in the dollar had led him to
shift his recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the shift, Chakrabortti said at the time he was
still not bullish on stocks, fearing that rising bond yields
would cut profit margins from recent all-time highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has not yet named a replacement, said Brian
Marchiony, a spokesman in New York. Marchiony declined further
comment.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Janet McGurty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 17 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) said on
Friday it had no timetable to restart the crude unit at its
325,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi, as
it assesses damage from a fire Thursday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The fire was extinguished around 8:30 last night," Steve
Renfroe, a spokesman for the refinery, said Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Equipment in the immediate area of the fire, including
crude unit No. 2, is not in operation, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, much of the refinery was unaffected by the fire
and remains operational," said Stephanie Price, a spokeswoman
for Chevron, who said that crews reported to work as planned
last night and this morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said that damage to the refinery is still being
assessed and a plan is being developed to repair the damage and
bring the affected plants on line as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trade sources said the downed crude unit had a capacity of
160,000 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said that it is investigating the cause of the
fire in coordination with local, state and federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will urgently correct any deficiencies we may uncover,"
Price said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We take such incidents very seriously and are extremely
grateful there were no fire-related injuries to report and all
our employees and contractors are accounted for last night,"
the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pascagoula is one of the 10 largest refineries in the
United States. Fears that the fire would reduce fuel supplies
sent ripples through cash and futures markets, sending prices
up in after-hours trade.

&lt;p&gt;Should the ruling stand, Pfizer would face U.S. generic competition to Lipitor in March 2010, when the basic patent for the drug expires, rather than in June 2011, when the patent at issue would expire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pfizer spokesman confirmed the company had seen a posting on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Web site of the non-final rejection but has not yet received a letter from the patent office informing the company of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company spokesman Bryant Haskins said it is not unusual in such situations for a company to receive an initial rejection from the patent office only to later get the patent reissued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not at all unusual," Haskins said. "As soon as we receive the information from the patent office, we will address the concerns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's sales for Lipitor, the world's top-selling drug, reached $12.9 billion last year, including $7.8 billion in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit invalidated one of two Lipitor patents at issue in a legal fight with generic competitor Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ritsuko Ando&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 20 (Reuters) - The top executives of Cisco
Systems Inc. (CSCO.O) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on
Monday that they would ensure their products work together,
seeking to prevent customers from delaying buying decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Cisco and Microsoft are the undisputed leaders in
their respective fields of network equipment and software, they
are competing to deliver a single, "unified communications"
system that ties together e-mail, phones and other tools over
Internet networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In their first joint public discussion, Cisco Chief
Executive John Chambers and Microsoft Chief Executive Steve
Ballmer said they would compete in some areas, but also meet
demands from customers who want to pick and choose from both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They're saying, 'Give me the choice. Don't give me the all
or nothing choice,'" Ballmer said, adding that he sought
"respectful competition" with Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are plenty of competitors that you just don't talk
to, or things get acrimonious," he said. "That's not where we
want to go with Cisco."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chambers said he and Ballmer would visit customers together
later in the day, and they would try to clarify how the two
companies would compete and work together simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even where we're going to compete, what the customer wants
to know is, 'Tell me how to interoperate. Don't make me throw
away one relationship because of the other,'" Chambers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The comments came as both companies introduced new products
and formed alliances that point to a growing rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and network equipment maker Nortel Networks
NT.TO, a Cisco competitor, announced a broad alliance in
unified communications last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cisco, meanwhile, has been expanding its association with
IBM (IBM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each company is also seen trying to bolster its unified
communications offerings through recent acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft bought Tellme Networks Inc., a privately held
speech technology company in March. The move was announced a
day before Cisco said it would buy online video conferencing
company WebEx Communications Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cisco, along with IBM, bought a stake in software maker
VMware Inc. (VMW.N) just before it went public last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VMware's software programs can create, run and manage
multiple "virtual" machines on a single computer, allowing
businesses to spend less on hardware and other costs. Analysts
Said it was set to compete with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jan Dawson, an analyst with technology research firm Ovum
wrote a note, "Cisco and Microsoft hold hands while kicking
each other under the table", saying interoperability would be a
challenge for the companies which are known for building
proprietary systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Hopefully, they will both move a little further in the
direction of interoperability, but they will both also continue
to do their best to create a world where the other isn't
needed," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said Microsoft's relationship with Cisco was likely
to evolve in coming years, although the size of the overlap
should remain relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "John's going to wake up one morning and say he wants to do
something that overlaps with us, and that's his prerogative,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The public discussion also comes amid concerns that
recently volatile financial markets and tighter credit could
discourage companies from investing in technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi)

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Aug 20 (Reuters) - Social networking site Bebo said
on Monday it will partner with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to use the
software maker's Windows Live instant messaging service on its
site and simplify the exchange of contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, is
aggressively seeking partnerships with social networking Web
sites as a way to become a major player in the growing market
for Internet services and online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Social networking sites have attracted millions of users
who spend hours creating their own pages and finding friends.
They have become among the hottest names in the technology
industry because they own a loyal and engaged audience,
offering rich advertising opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bebo, the largest social networking site in the UK, will allow
its 36 million global users to export and import contacts between
its site and contacts lists maintained on Microsoft's Windows Live
online services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also plans to introduce a service run by Windows Live to
to allow its users to instant message one another with one
click from their profile page. Those users with Windows Live
accounts can add a "IM Me" icon on their profile pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our core strength is not building applications. We're more
of an open platform and much more likely to partner than build
it ourselves," said Joanna Shields, president of Bebo's
international business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 90 percent of Bebo users already use Windows Live IM
services, according to Shields, making Microsoft the most
logical partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The alliance with Bebo, a social network centered around
music, marks the first time Microsoft has partnered with a
social networking site to run communication services like
instant messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has more than 300 million Windows Live users, who
frequently log in to check e-mail and instant messages. Those
users represent Microsoft's most valuable asset in catching Web
leaders Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Yahoo! Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICROSOFT TARGETS WEB 2.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In recent months, Microsoft has announced deals to broker
display advertising with fast-growing social network Facebook
and news site Digg -- two of the hottest names in the "Web 2.0"
phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Web 2.0 is a catch-phrase for the new generation of
Internet services that run interactive software accessed
through a Web browser and rely on content generated by users to
attract more visitors to sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Social networking sites built on the Web 2.0 platform often
center around different focus areas. Facebook began as a site
only for college students, while MySpace users often use the
site to find and try new music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an interview conducted earlier this month, a Microsoft
executive said the company sees people belonging to multiple
social networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's not proven to me that there is going to be one killer
immersive user interface that is going to be the ultimate
social networking user interface," said Chris Jones, a
Microsoft corporate vice president in the Windows Live group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has invested heavily into building a common
contacts database through years of offering e-mail and other
communication services. It sees that database -- filled with
more than 25 billion contacts -- as the core of any social
networking strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Because we have a common list of people with the contacts
and people they care about and communicate with, we are just
going from activity to activity and scenario to scenario," said
Jones. "It starts with the contacts list."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 20 (Reuters) - Global Partners LP (GLP.N)
said on Monday its subsidiary Global Cos LLC has extended the
closing date of its purchase of two refined products terminals
from ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The closing of the purchase for $34.7 million, has been
extended to the fourth quarter from the third period of this
year, to allow for the orderly transition of certain permits,
Global Partners said in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Global Partners said it agreed to buy the
terminals, with a total storage capacity of 430,000 barrels,
in Glenwood Landing and Inwood, New York. The company said the
deal would increase its oil storage capacity to 8.6 million
barrels.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Patricia Nann &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT Aug 20 (Reuters) - SachsenLB, the second German bank to be hit by difficulties stemming from the U.S. subprime mortgages crisis, must be sold as part of a state-led rescue deal, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Late last week, a group of publicly owned German banks gave a credit line of more than 17 billion euros ($23 billion) to help SachsenLB withstand the credit market turmoil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In return, the group has demanded the lender be sold by the local state of Sachsen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The pool has formed on the condition that the state of Sachsen sits down with all those involved and talks about the future of the group," said one source, commenting on the sale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Talks will begin in the coming weeks," said a second. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SachsenLB declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The potential sale is the first clear signal the subprime mortgage collapse could accelerate the consolidation of government-owned banks in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    One source close to the situation said NordLB [NDLG.UL], a state-owned Landesbank; and Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg [LBBW.UL] were eyeing SachsenLB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    State-backed lenders, or Landesbanks, are powerful in Germany but their owners are normally reluctant sellers, fearing a loss of influence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The German government's involvement in banking has made Europe's biggest economy one of the continent's most overbanked countries, squeezing profits and forcing lenders to look abroad for new ways to bolster profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As a result, German banks have gone heavily into asset-backed securities and other instruments linked directly or indirectly to high-risk U.S. home loans, reaping profits as the market boomed in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Late last month Germany's IKB IKBG.DE became Europe's most high profile casualty from the crisis, and a group of banks put together a rescue package to prevent IKB's collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Germany has so far been the hardest hit in Europe by the problems that began with defaults on U.S. mortgages given to people with weak credit histories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The crisis -- triggered by slowing home prices and higher interest rates -- has spilled into the credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Patricia Nann, writing by John O'Donnell; editing by Sue Thomas; john.odonnell@reuters.com; +49 69 7565 1273)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=.7410 Euro)   Keywords: SACHSENLB MERGER/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Aug 20 (Reuters) - Mexico's top broadcaster Televisa said on Monday it has signed a deal to buy Argentine publisher Editorial Atlantida in a move that consolidates its leadership in the magazine industry in Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Financial terms were not disclosed but media reports earlier this year had put a $60 million tag on the acquisition. Company officials declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX) said in a note to the Mexican stock exchange that it was purchasing 99.9 percent of Atlantida, which publishes 11 titles from gossip magazines to children's publications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Atlantida, which also runs an Internet and book publishing business, had a magazine circulation of 12.8 million copies in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa is the world's top producer of Spanish-language programming. Its publishing unit, Editorial Televisa, has 82 titles across Latin America as well as titles for Hispanic readers in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa shares were off 0.2 percent at 54.10 pesos while its New York-traded stock slipped 0.29 percent to $24.24. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Cyntia Barrera Diaz and Jason Lange) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Maureen Bavdek; Mexico City newsroom; Reuters Messaging: cyntia.barrera.reuters.com@reuters.net; +5255-5282-7153)) Keywords: MEXICO TELEVISA/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The top executives of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO.O) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Monday that they would ensure their products work together, seeking to prevent customers from putting off buying decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Cisco and Microsoft are undisputed leaders in their respective fields of network equipment and software, they are competing aggressively to deliver a single, "unified communications" system that ties together e-mail, phones and other tools over Internet networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their first joint public discussion, Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers and Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said they would compete in some areas but also meet demands from customers who want to pick and choose from both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're saying, 'Give me the choice. Don't give me the all or nothing choice,'" Ballmer said, adding that he was seeking "respectful competition" with Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are plenty of competitors that you just don't talk to, or things get acrimonious," he said. "That's not where we want to go with Cisco."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chambers said he and Ballmer would visit customers together later in the day, and that the they would try to clarify how the two companies compete and work together at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even where we're going to compete, what the customer wants to know is, 'Tell me how to interoperate.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM Aug 20 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is cutting the European price for its Xbox 360 video game console by 50 euros to 349.99 euros ($470), following a similar cut in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said in a statement on Monday that the lower price for the Xbox model with a 20 gigabyte hard drive would be effective from Aug. 24. It also plans to launch a new model, Xbox 360 Elite, that will ship with a 120 gigabyte hard disk and cost 449.99 euros.  The European price of the entry-level model Xbox 360 Core, which does not include a hard drive, will be cut by 20 euros to 279.99 euros, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier this month, Microsoft announced a price cut by about 13 percent for its main Xbox 360 model in the United States, hoping to boost sales ahead of the crucial holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft reduced the U.S. price of the Xbox 360 Premium model by $50 to $350. Sony Corp (6758.T) had previously cut the price of its PlayStation 3 machine by 17 percent to $500. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Faced with unexpectedly strong competition from Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS cheaper Wii console, Microsoft is aiming at expanding the appeal of the Xbox 360 to an audience outside its core fan base of young men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The rising sophistication of consoles, which boast graphics performance that rivals personal computers costing several times as much, means manufacturers are more reluctant to drop prices.

W.W. Grainger Inc.(GWW.N) on Monday said it has agreed to buy
back $500 million of its outstanding shares from Goldman Sachs

benefit earnings per share by 1 cent for the remainder of 2007.
The full-year benefit in 2008 by buying now is expected to be

&lt;p&gt;Like most Japanese funds it has struggled in Japan's stagnant equity markets, but has underperformed its peers because it repositioned into small caps in mid-2006, where it currently has a 30 percent weighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the six months to March 31, 2007, it saw its NAV fall by 1.4 percent, compared to a Tokyo Stock Exchange rise of 3.4 percent over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although over the last two months the trust has picked up in performance terms, slightly outperforming the index, its board has fired a warning shot across the management's bows to improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The management can draw some security from the fact that its private clients continue to buy in, with the addition of 125,000 shares in the last three months to give it a 4.52 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of April, Lazards had a 1.75 percent stake, equating to over three million shares, while New Star's fund of trusts manager Paul Craig held 550, 000 shares, equating to 0.3 percent of the trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close Wins tipped the trust for possible likely corporate action in 2007, and believes the possibility of change could narrow the discount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wins analyst Simon Elliot says: "The management is under pressure to perform, and there is a lot more emphasis on boards to justify their managers' performance. Mitchell has been there a long time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However Elliot adds: "What it has got going for it is that it is a larger, more liquid fund than most of its competitors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In line with competitors such as Baillie Gifford Japan and Schroder Japan, it has geared up and is currently up to 15 percent gearing, compared to 13 percent and 16 percent for Schroders and Baillie Gifford respectively. The trust is currently trading at around a 10 percent discount and has been as wide as 13 percent in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some commentators feel if Japan comes back into favour the team could outperform, although other funds in the sector are considered better bets, with the special situations style Prospect Japan and Japanese upturn play Melchior Japan more popular current choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baillie Gifford Japan's mid cap bias is preferred by some aficionados because of manager Sarah Whitley's recent ability to outperform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the fund is currently trading on a slight 3 percent premium and its 141 million pound size makes it less liquid than Mitchell's fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitchell's aggressive repositioning to small caps last year means the trust could benefit from any upturn in the Japanese economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Arbuthnot's Chris Young, however, it is too early to go back into the trust, and he believes the whole sector should be avoided in favour of the currently more attractive Asia excluding Japan sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CITYWIRE VERDICT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trust has suffered along with the entire Japanese sector over the last year but after a move towards more mid cap stocks it has underperformed many of its rivals. However, it still provides access to a large, liquid and diversified spread of Japanese equities and should be relatively well placed to outperform if the Japanese economy picks up. Its current 10 percent discount may be attractive to some investors after a long-term holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(c) Citywire Financial Publishers Ltd 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 17 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) has agreed to sell Sun Microsystems's SUNW.O Solaris Operating System software to IBM's customers in a deal that pits the competing computer hardware makers against shared rival Hewlett-Packard.  Financial terms of the deal, originally announced on Thursday, were not disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM will distribute the software with certain of its blade server computers. Blade servers are compact servers that typically stand on end like books on a shelf. Sun lags Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ.N) and International Business Machines in the blade server market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Solaris is one of the main varieties of the Unix family of operating systems, known for their ability to safely and securely handle major computing tasks rather than for their ease of use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Franklin Paul) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reuters Messaging: Franklin.Paul.reuters.com@reuters.net; email Franklin.Paul@reuters.com; Tel: +1 646 223 6195; editing by Deborah Cohen)) Keywords: IBM SUN/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office is disinclined to charge Lindsay Lohan with three drug-related felonies, a decision that could spare the troubled actress from a prison sentence, celebrity news outlet TMZ.com reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charges are connected with Lohan's two recent arrests for drunken driving, first in May when she crashed her car on Beverly Hills, and then in July when she was involved in a late-night car chase in Santa Monica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TMZ, citing unidentified law enforcement sources, said the 21-year-old actress would likely face misdemeanor drunk-driving charges for both incidents. If found guilty of both, she would serve a minimum of four days in jail, TMZ.com said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal experts have said Lohan could face up to three years behind bars if confronted with the full weight of the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the TMZ.com report, district attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said the office has not yet received the Santa Monica case and the Beverly Hills case remains under review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A public discussion of potential charges prior to a case being filed would be inappropriate and potentially unethical," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibbons also denied TMZ.com's report that charges could be filed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Beverly Hills incident, cocaine was found in Lohan's car. After the Santa Monica chase, she was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, cocaine possession, bringing a controlled substance into custody and driving on a suspended license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lohan, who has done two rehab stints this year, has seen her promising film career plummet in recent years. Last month, she starred as stripper abducted by a sadistic killer in the box office bomb "I Know Who Killed Me."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Ritsuko Ando &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The top executives of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO.O) and Microsoft Corp.

Don't give me the all or nothing choice,'" Ballmer said, adding that he was seeking "respectful competition" with Cisco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "There are plenty of competitors that you just don't talk to, or things get acrimonious," he said. "That's not where we want to go with Cisco." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Chambers said he and Ballmer would visit customers together later in the day, and that the they would try to clarify how the two companies compete and work together at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Even where we're going to compete, what the customer wants to know is, 'Tell me how to interoperate. Don't make me throw away one relationship because of the other,'" Chambers said.    The comments come as both companies launch new products and form alliances that point to a growing rivalry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft and network equipment maker Nortel Networks NT.TO, a Cisco competitor, announced a broad alliance in unified communications last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cisco, in the meantime, has been expanding its alliance with IBM (IBM.N). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Both companies are also seen trying to bolster their unified communications offerings through recent acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft has bought Tellme Networks Inc., a privately held speech technology company. The move was announced a day before Cisco said it will buy online video conferencing company WebEx Communications Inc. WEBX.O. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    More recently, Cisco -- along with IBM -- bought a stake in software maker VMware Inc. (VMW.N) just before it went public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    VMware's software programs can create, run and manage multiple "virtual" machines on a single computer, allowing businesses to spend less on hardware and other costs.

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian court ruled on Tuesday that the country's immigration minister wrongly revoked a work visa for an Indian doctor who was briefly accused of links with a failed British car bomb plot in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government has been criticized by civil rights groups and legal organizations for its bungled arrest and subsequent release of Dr Mohamed Haneef in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The minister cancelled the visa ... by applying the wrong test. It follows that the decision must be set aside," said Federal Court Judge Jeffrey Spender in Brisbane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge's decision, referring to Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews, was posted on the Federal Court's Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrews said the government would appeal against the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I made the decision to cancel Dr Haneef's visa, I made it in the national interest and I stand by that decision,"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrews told reporters in Sydney. "I have instructed the Australian government solicitor to lodge an appeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haneef, 27, was held for 11 days before being charged with recklessly supporting terrorism in a case centered on the loan of a mobile phone SIM card to a relative in Britain allegedly linked to car bombs in London and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charges were dropped because of lack of evidence, but the government cancelled Haneef's visa and he flew home to Bangalore to see his wife and newborn daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haneef has denied any knowledge of the plot and his arrest ignited concerns about Australia's new counter-terrorism laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haneef, who worked in a Gold Coast hospital in Queensland state, has said he would like to return to Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spender rejected the minister's decision to cancel Haneef's visa on "character grounds" based on his association with two cousins who were terrorist suspects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Haneef's visa could have been cancelled if the minister had used the fact that British police regarded Haneef as a person of interest in relation to the bombings and that Haneef had been formally charged with terrorism offences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These matters would have permitted the minister to conclude that the association between Dr Haneef and the Ahmed brothers (his cousins) went beyond a purely familial, social, innocent relationship," said Spender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On that material, it would have been open to the minister ... to cancel Dr Haneef's visa," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haneef's visa is not automatically reinstated and the court in Brisbane ruled that the Australian government has 21 days to decide what action to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haneef's cousin, Imran Siddiqui, told Times Now television in India that the family was happy with the court ruling and was prepared to continue the legal fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are well prepared to go for further stages, judicial battle. It is of course first restoration of honor and pride," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Market turmoil may force lenders to change less stringent financing terms for the $1.4 billion private equity buyout of Singapore's United Test and Assembly Centre UTAC.SI, JPMorgan said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the latest sign that private equity firms hunting for deals in Asia may face tougher times as banks demand higher returns and more protection amid a global repricing of risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity firm Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL and Asia-focused buyout firm Affinity Equity Partners in June agreed to buy microchip testing firm UTAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, banking sources said ABN AMRO AAH.AS, JPMorgan JPM.SI and Merrill Lynch MER.N might arrrange loans for UTAC's leveraged buyout under a "covenant lite" structure -- deals that lack traditional restrictions on borrowers, encouraging them to use more debt to fund purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My sense is covenant-type lite structure will change somewhat," Philip Lee, chief executive of JPMorgan's investment banking Southeast Asia, told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the UTAC deal is still subject to approval from shareholders, but he added once it is approved the financing details will be finalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said the deal will be a barometer of funds' ability to raise debt in the region ID:nT69120.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee said the bank has a strong pipeline for equity and debt deals for the rest of the year, but issuers may have to wait for market conditions to improve before they can start raising money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debt and equity deals in Southeast Asia hit $70 billion in almost the first eight months of the year, compared to $102 billion for the whole of 2006, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananth Ramachandran, JPMorgan's executive director of debt capital markets Asia, said that the market was seeing a repricing of credit markets, but economic fundamentals for Asia had not drastically changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said JPMorgan expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points each in September and October from a current 5.25 percent, which would create stable conditions for bond issuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did see quality issues come to the market, but in terms of the volume to return probably the market will have to wait and see the rate decision go through," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Futures markets are already pricing in the high probability of a rate cut. If there is stability and there is some feeling that things have settled down, good issues will come to the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jan Dahinten)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Daisuke Wakabayashi &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Aug 20 (Reuters) - Social networking site Bebo said on Monday it will partner with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to use the software maker's Windows Live instant messaging service on its site and simplify the exchange of contacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, is aggressively seeking partnerships with social networking Web sites as a way to become a major player in the growing market for Internet services and online advertising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Social networking sites have attracted millions of users who spend hours creating their own pages and finding friends. They have become among the hottest names in the technology industry because they own a loyal and engaged audience, offering rich advertising opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bebo, the largest social networking site in the UK, will allow its 36 million global users to export and import contacts between its site and contacts lists maintained on Microsoft's Windows Live online services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It also plans to introduce a service run by Windows Live to to allow its users to instant message one another with one click from their profile page. Those users with Windows Live accounts can add a "IM Me" icon on their profile pages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Our core strength is not building applications. We're more of an open platform and much more likely to partner than build it ourselves," said Joanna Shields, president of Bebo's international business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    About 90 percent of Bebo users already use Windows Live IM services, according to Shields, making Microsoft the most logical partner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The alliance with Bebo, a social network centered around music, marks the first time Microsoft has partnered with a social networking site to run communication services like instant messaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft has more than 300 million Windows Live users, who frequently log in to check e-mail and instant messages. Those users represent Microsoft's most valuable asset in catching Web leaders Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Yahoo! Inc (YHOO.O). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    MICROSOFT TARGETS WEB 2.0 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In recent months, Microsoft has announced deals to broker display advertising with fast-growing social network Facebook and news site Digg -- two of the hottest names in the "Web 2.0" phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Web 2.0 is a catch-phrase for the new generation of Internet services that run interactive software accessed through a Web browser and rely on content generated by users to attract more visitors to sites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Social networking sites built on the Web 2.0 platform often center around different focus areas. Facebook began as a site only for college students, while MySpace users often use the site to find and try new music. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In an interview conducted earlier this month, a Microsoft executive said the company sees people belonging to multiple social networks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's not proven to me that there is going to be one killer immersive user interface that is going to be the ultimate social networking user interface," said Chris Jones, a Microsoft corporate vice president in the Windows Live group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft has invested heavily into building a common contacts database through years of offering e-mail and other communication services. It sees that database -- filled with more than 25 billion contacts -- as the core of any social networking strategy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Because we have a common list of people with the contacts and people they care about and communicate with, we are just going from activity to activity and scenario to scenario," said Jones. "It starts with the contacts list." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Phil Berlowitz; Reuters Messaging: daisuke.wakabayashi.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 206 652 2326)) Keywords: MICROSOFT BEBO/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

stand up and sing even on a regular-season night, "Musical 2" 
was extraordinary for cable. It was the most-watched basic 
cable telecast of all time, the biggest TV program ever among 
ages 6-11 and drew the best primetime audience for anything on 
cable or broadcast during the summer other than sports 
telecasts and the Olympics since September 5, 1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Hannah Montana," which followed "Musical 2" on Friday, 
averaged 10.7 million viewers, the top telecast for a series in 
cable history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Network TV's most-watched program for the week ending 
Sunday, NBC's "America's Got Talent," barely cleared "Hannah" 
and couldn't come close to "Musical 2." "Talent" averaged 10.8 
million viewers and a 3.1 rating/10 share in the adults 18-49 
demographic for Tuesday's telecast, Nielsen Media Research said 
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monday's season finale of "Hell's Kitchen" (9.7 million, 
4.5/12) was the week's top dog in adults 18-49. That gave Fox 
its 28th consecutive weekly win in the advertiser-friendly 
demo, the longest such streak for any network in 11 years. CBS 
racked up another win in viewership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Kitchen" ruled everything Monday, easily surpassing a 
boatload of repeats and ABC's "Fat March" (4.3 million, 1.6/5). 
Fox won the night with the help of a special "So You Think You 
Can Dance" (7.9 million, 3.0/10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tuesday went to NBC, with "Talent" and the half-hour "The 
Singing Bee" (9.7 million, 3.2/9), which tied with CBS' "Big 
Brother" (7.6 million, 3.2/9) for the night's lead in adults 
18-49. Not doing as well were ABC's "Primetime: Crime" (6.1 
million, 2.1/6 ) and "I-Caught" (5.2 million, 1.8/6); 
"I-Caught" sank to second place against a repeat "Law  Order: 
SVU" (7.3 million, 2.2/7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wednesday and Thursday belonged to Fox, with "Dance" 
overshadowing everything else. Wednesday's "Dance" (8.7 
million, 3.3/10) won from 8-10 p.m. in both key measures 
against CBS' new game show "Power of 10" (7.7 million, 2.0/7) 
and NBC's "Last Comic Standing" (5.7 million, 2.5/7). ABC's 
"NASCAR in Primetime" (3.2 million, 1.2/4) failed to get out of 
the gate against NBC's "Dateline" (6.6 million, 2.2/7) and CBS' 
"CSI: NY" (8.1 million, 2.2/7 ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was more of the same Thursday, with the season finale of 
"Dance" (9.6 million, 3.7/11) winning head to head against CBS' 
"Big Brother" (7.5 million, 2.8/9), the only other original of 
the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beyond "Musical 2" and "Hannah," it was a quiet night of TV 
on Friday. Fox won among broadcast networks with the NFL's 
preseason Minnesota Vikings-New York Jets game that averaged 
3.9 million viewers and a 1.4/5 in adults 18-49. It just beat 
out the CW's "Friday Night SmackDown!" (3.9 million, 1.2/4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saturday's preseason San Diego Chargers-Arizona Cardinals 
game on CBS was barely there, averaging 2.9 million viewers and 
a 0.9/4 in adults 18-49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sunday night featured a three-way tie in the demo among 
CBS, NBC and Fox. NBC's preseason "Sunday Night Football" (7.1 
million, 2.5/7) recovered a bit but was beaten by CBS' "Big 
Brother" (7.4 million, 2.9/8) as well as Fox's "Family Guy" 
(5.4 million, 2.8/7 at 9 p.m. and 5.9 million, 3.0/8 at 9:30 
p.m.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox (6 million, 2.3/7) was the top network in the key 
adults 18-49 demo, while CBS (6.7 million, 1.9/6) led in 
viewership, followed by ABC (4.4 million, 1.5/4), NBC (5.3 
million, 1.7/5) and the CW (1.8 million, 0.6/2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Channel was the third-most-watched network of the 
week overall with an average of 5.8 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the evening newscasts, ABC's "World News With Charles 
Gibson" won again in viewership (8 million) ahead of "NBC 
Nightly News With Brian Williams" (7.4 million) and the "CBS 
Evening News With Katie Couric" (5.8 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Los Angeles County District 
Attorney's office is disinclined to charge Lindsay Lohan with 
three drug-related felonies, a decision that could spare the 
troubled actress from a prison sentence, celebrity news outlet 
TMZ.com reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The charges are connected with Lohan's two recent arrests 
for drunken driving, first in May when she crashed her car on 
Beverly Hills, and then in July when she was involved in a 
late-night car chase in Santa Monica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TMZ, citing unidentified law enforcement sources, said the 
21-year-old actress would likely face misdemeanor drunk-driving 
charges for both incidents. If found guilty of both, she would 
serve a minimum of four days in jail, TMZ.com said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Legal experts have said Lohan could face up to three years 
behind bars if confronted with the full weight of the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked about the TMZ.com report, district attorney 
spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said the office has not yet received 
the Santa Monica case and the Beverly Hills case remains under 
review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A public discussion of potential charges prior to a case 
being filed would be inappropriate and potentially unethical," 
she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gibbons also denied TMZ.com's report that charges could be 
filed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the Beverly Hills incident, cocaine was found in 
Lohan's car. After the Santa Monica chase, she was charged with 
driving under the influence of alcohol, cocaine possession, 
bringing a controlled substance into custody and driving on a 
suspended license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lohan, who has done two rehab stints this year, has seen 
her promising film career plummet in recent years. Last month, 
she starred as stripper abducted by a sadistic killer in the 
box office bomb "I Know Who Killed Me."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MINSK (Reuters) - Belarus said on Wednesday that it was retaliating against punitive Western measures by toughening rules for U.S. officials wanting to visit the ex-Soviet state, but promised to make entry easier for other travelers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, following the lead of the European Union, last month expanded a list of Belarussian officials barred entry in connection with human rights violations and the disputed re-election last year of President Alexander Lukashenko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belarus said then it would impose counter-measures but gave no details. On Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Vanshina said authorities in Minsk had no choice but to respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In response to the unfriendly act of the United States, Belarus will impose corresponding visa restrictions for specific categories of U.S. officials," she said in a statement on the ministry's web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But let me stress that retaliatory measures will in no way affect personal contacts between Belarussians and Americans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanshina's statement gave no further details. But she said U.S. tourists and businessmen wishing to visit would be issued visas to the country, which lies between Russia and three EU states, without having to provide letters of invitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was "an act of good will and underscores the friendly character of Belarussian foreign policy," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. restrictions expanded a list of judges and election officials to include more legal officials, officers in the interior ministry and the intelligence service, still known as the KGB, and heads of state enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington said it had toughened the measures despite Belarussian moves to ease pressure on opposition activists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the United States and the European Union denounced as rigged Lukashenko's re-election to a third term last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also accuse the president of hounding his opponents and closing down independent media, and demand the release of what they describe as political prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lukashenko remains broadly popular and tells Belarussians he has spared them upheavals that have jolted other ex-Soviet states. He has called for improved ties with the West since quarrelling with traditional ally Russia over energy prices, but rejects any suggestion he must first improve his rights record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An opposition activist released earlier this year, Pavel Severinets, was sentenced on Wednesday to 15 days in prison on charges of illegal assembly when presenting a new book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The web site of Alexander Milinkevich, who challenged the president in last year's election, said other activists faced similar charges in connection with the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severinets was jailed in 2004 but freed ahead of time last May in what the opposition said was an attempt by authorities to forestall the imposition of new EU trade sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment from Exxon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Yereth Rosen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska Aug 22 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review a $2.5
billion fine against the oil company for the 1989 Valdez
disaster, the nation's worst tanker spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, in a petition filed on Monday, argued the high court
should overturn the punitive-damages verdict that the 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals said must be paid for the 11
million-gallon disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That total is half the amount ordered by a federal court
jury in Anchorage in 1994. The 9th Circuit Court reduced it to
comply with what it concluded were constitutional limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil, the successor company to Exxon Corp, argued in
its Supreme Court petition that maritime law does not allow
imposition of such a large punitive award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Ninth Circuit's inability to discern or even
acknowledge any substantive maritime-law principles limiting
the size of this extraordinary punitive award demonstrates the
urgency of the need for this Court to articulate such limits,"
Exxon argued in its petition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also repeated its earlier argument that the
punitive award was improperly calculated and an unacceptably
high multiple of actual compensatory damages. The company has
argued punitive damages should be no more than $25 million,
based on actual compensation given to commercial fishermen for
the loss of their harvests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Supreme Court has the right to hear Exxon's appeal or
reject it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plaintiffs include more than 30,000 fishermen, Alaska
natives, property owners and others who filed individual claims
against Exxon that were consolidated into a class-action case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Valdez spill remains a bitter memory in Cordova, a
fishing-dependent Prince William Sound town of 2,200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jerry McCune, president of Cordova District Fishermen
United, said he is not surprised Exxon appealed even after
having the punitive award reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They just don't believe that they owe anything, and
they're arrogant," McCune said. "Most people (in Cordova) don't
forget about it that went through the thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The spill spread oil to more than 1,200 miles (1,900 km) of
coastline, closed fisheries and killed thousands of marine
mammals and hundreds of thousands of sea birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As we have said many times, the Valdez oil spill was a
tragic accident, one which the corporation deeply regrets, and
one for which the corporation has paid significantly," Exxon
Mobil spokesman Tony Cudmore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Exxon Mobil has spent more than $3.5 billion on the
clean-up, compensation and settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Small pockets of Valdez oil remain on shorelines in Prince
William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska, according to federal
studies. A recent study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration found that remnant oil is disappearing very
slowly, at a rate of only 1 percent to 4 percent a year.

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - Last week's broadcast 
primetime viewership looked pretty paltry compared with Friday 
night's record-breaking 17.2 million viewers who tuned in to 
see "High School Musical 2" on Disney Channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; While the ratings would make a broadcast network executive 
stand up and sing even on a regular-season night, "Musical 2"

cable history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Network TV's most-watched program for the week ending 
Sunday, NBC's "America's Got Talent," barely cleared "Hannah" 
and couldn't come close to "Musical 2." "Talent" averaged 10.8

out the CW's "Friday Night SmackDown!" (3.9 million, 1.2/4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saturday's preseason San Diego Chargers-Arizona Cardinals 
game on CBS was barely there, averaging 2.9 million viewers and 
a 0.9/4 in adults 18-49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sunday night featured a three-way tie in the demo among 
CBS, NBC and Fox. NBC's preseason "Sunday Night Football" (7.1 
million, 2.5/7) recovered a bit but was beaten by CBS' "Big

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/HELSINKI Aug 22 (Reuters) - Leading mobile phone
maker Nokia (NOK1V.HE) said on Wednesday it would bring
Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT.O) Windows Live suite of Web services,
like e-mail and instant messaging, to many of its cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) and Google Inc. (GOOG.O) are
competing for valuable real estate on a handset's main screen,
so users can gain access to their online services without the
extra step of going through the phone's Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's services will integrate with Nokia's existing
programs allowing users to sync their Windows Live contacts
list with the phone's address book or send and receive Hotmail
e-mails within Nokia's messaging application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Owners of Nokia's multimedia phones will be able to
download a suite of Windows Live services that include e-mail,
instant messenger, contacts list and a blogging and picture
sharing site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Finnish phone maker plans to preload cheaper models
with Microsoft's suite of services next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In practice it would be as wide as possible," Nokia's Jari
Pasanen, vice president for strategy and technology at
multimedia business unit, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The service will be available for users of five Nokia
multimedia phones, including N95 and N73, in 11 European and
Middle Eastern countries including Britain, Germany, France,
the Netherlands, the Nordics and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies said the service would be initially free,
but they may charge a monthly fee for it later. Microsoft and
Nokia would not disclose how they planned to share revenue from
the agreement, but said sales of advertising for the services
would not be shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WEB SHIFTS TO MOBILE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nokia, the world's largest mobile phone maker with a 38
percent global market share, also has a deal with Yahoo to
feature the company's Yahoo Go software, a suite of services
for download that includes e-mail, search and an address book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Handset makers, faced with falling prices of cellphones,
are looking for new sources of revenue by striking deals with
content and service providers who want to be featured on Nokia
phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Microsoft and its Web rivals are targeting the 3
billion mobile phone users as the next -- and, possibly, more
lucrative -- frontier for online advertising. The huge profits
have yet to roll in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a ton of stuff going on, but ... you just can't
simply extend the advertising platforms as they exist today to
the phone," said Steve Berkowitz, the head of Microsoft's
online services group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nokia and Microsoft, fierce competitors because they make
rival operating systems for handsets, signed their first
co-operation agreement in 2005 to put the Windows Media player
on to Nokia phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, Nokia said it would start to use
Microsoft's copy protection technology in its software
platforms to boost the wireless use of music and videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There has been talk that Nokia and Microsoft would be in
some kind of war," Nokia's Pasanen said. "That is not the
case."

&lt;p&gt; (Rewrites first paragraph, adds details, background, byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Ransdell Pierson &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Wednesday said it named an industry outsider, Alcatel-Lucent ALU.PA executive Frank D'Amelio, as chief financial officer of the struggling drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    D'Amelio, who is currently chief administrative officer of the French-American telecommunications equipment maker, will take over his new post in mid-September, Pfizer said in a release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    His appointment comes as the world's largest drugmaker, whose products include cholesterol fighter Lipitor and anti-impotence treatment Viagra, is relying heavily on cost-saving initiatives to offset declining revenue of its wide array of prescription medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    D'Amelio will succeed Alan Levin, whose resignation was announced in May along with the planned retirement by year's end of Pfizer research chief John LaMattina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    New York-based Pfizer said D'Amelio has almost 30 years experience at AT (T.N), Lucent Technologies Inc LU.S and Alcatel-Lucent, and played a big role in the 2006 Alcatel-Lucent merger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Frank was a senior executive in global companies undergoing the kind of rapid and complex changes we have undertaken at Pfizer in response to our own rapidly changing markets," Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Jeff Kindler said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Kindler said D'Amelio would work closely with David Shedlarz, a Pfizer vice chairman who was CFO of the company for many years before Levin's two-year tenure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    D'Amelio's appointment is the latest in a number of executive changes at Pfizer since the company ousted longtime Chief Executive Hank McKinnell in July 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Pfizer had plunged 40 percent since McKinnell became chairman in May 2001 as the company failed to launch lucrative new medicines despite an industry-topping $7 billion annual research budget. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Kindler himself had limited experience in the drug industry before taking the helm of Pfizer, having served relatively briefly as Pfizer's top lawyer following senior executive roles at McDonald's Corp (MCD.N). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Pfizer were up 22 cents at $24.46 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Mark Porter; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; 646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER CFO/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 22 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. said on
Wednesday that all its refineries were operating normally after
Hurricane Dean swept over oil and gas installations in Mexico,
curtailing crude oil supplies to some other U.S. refineries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "All our facilities are operating normally and we continue
to meet our customer needs," said Prem Nair, a spokeswoman for
the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil's Gulf Coast refineries ran an average of
212,000 barrels per day of Mexican oil in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico, one of the top three suppliers of oil to the United
States, shut in 2.65 million barrels per day of offshore oil
ahead of Hurricane Dean, which slammed into the nation's
Campeche Sound producing hub.

&lt;p&gt;MINSK (Reuters) - Belarus said on Wednesday that it was retaliating against punitive Western measures by toughening rules for U.S. officials wanting to visit the ex-Soviet state, but promised to make entry easier for other travelers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, following the lead of the European Union, last month expanded a list of Belarussian officials barred entry in connection with human rights violations and the disputed re-election last year of President Alexander Lukashenko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belarus said then it would impose counter-measures but gave no details. On Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Vanshina said authorities in Minsk had no choice but to respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In response to the unfriendly act of the United States, Belarus will impose corresponding visa restrictions for specific categories of U.S. officials," she said in a statement on the ministry's web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But let me stress that retaliatory measures will in no way affect personal contacts between Belarussians and Americans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanshina's statement gave no further details. But she said U.S. tourists and businessmen wishing to visit would be issued visas to the country, which lies between Russia and three EU states, without having to provide letters of invitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was "an act of good will and underscores the friendly character of Belarussian foreign policy," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. restrictions expanded a list of judges and election officials to include more legal officials, officers in the interior ministry and the intelligence service, still known as the KGB, and heads of state enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington said it had toughened the measures despite Belarussian moves to ease pressure on opposition activists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the United States and the European Union denounced as rigged Lukashenko's re-election to a third term last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also accuse the president of hounding his opponents and closing down independent media, and demand the release of what they describe as political prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lukashenko remains broadly popular and tells Belarussians he has spared them upheavals that have jolted other ex-Soviet states. He has called for improved ties with the West since quarrelling with traditional ally Russia over energy prices, but rejects any suggestion he must first improve his rights record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An opposition activist released earlier this year, Pavel Severinets, was sentenced on Wednesday to 15 days in prison on charges of illegal assembly when presenting a new book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The web site of Alexander Milinkevich, who challenged the president in last year's election, said other activists faced similar charges in connection with the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severinets was jailed in 2004 but freed ahead of time last May in what the opposition said was an attempt by authorities to forestall the imposition of new EU trade sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 22 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said it
hoped to provide an update early next week on when the company
may have an assessment of the damage caused by a fire last week
at its Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are still in the assessment process," said company
spokeswoman Stephanie Price, countering some market talk that
the refinery would require months of repair after the fire
damaged a 160,000 bpd crude unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trade sources said it appeared the damage was confined to
that one crude unit and that some of the other nearby process
units have already been restarted.

&lt;p&gt;WebDialogs, a company based in Billerica, Massachusetts with 500,000 customers, provides Internet services that let clients work together over the Web while they are connected through audio and sometimes video connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's Lotus division sells desktop software with comparable features, but the company had not offered customers the option of buying the service over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WebDialogs' biggest rivals are WebEx, which Cisco bought in May for $2.6 billion, and Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS.O), which advertises its GoToMeeting and GoToWebinar offerings to small businesses over the radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WebDialogs is a "white label" service provider, which means that the bulk of its business is performed for other companies that market the service under their own brand, reselling it at a profit, said Sean Poulley, vice president of strategy for Lotus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPM, BAC, WB jointly announce today that they have made use, on a limited basis, of the discount window facility announced by the Federal Reserve Board late last week. In transactions intended to display the effectiveness of the facility, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wachovia each borrowed $500 mln, including some on a term basis, at the discount window. While JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wachovia each have substantial liquidity and the capacity to borrow money elsewhere on more favorable terms, the companies believe it is important at this time to take a leadership role in demonstrating the potential value of the Fed's primary credit facility and to encourage its use by other financial institutions. Co's hope their actions today will highlight that point for the financial community and promote broad acceptance of the use of the facility.

reserves, and production is limited at around 25,000 barrels

estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gas reserves in the Philippines are larger at 3.9 trillion
cubic feet (Tcf), almost all of which is located in the
Malampaya field, operated by Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell
(RDSa.L), who opted not to develop a small oil layer in the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Limelight Networks Inc said on Thursday it had expanded an online media distribution deal with Microsoft Corp, sending the shares of the digital content delivery company up as much as 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limelight (LLNW.O) will provide more media streaming and delivery services for Microsoft (MSFT.O) -- already a top customer -- under a multi-year technology agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies also agreed to license one another's technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've had a three-year or so relationship with Microsoft and it really has been a fairly traditional supplier-customer relationship. This builds on that and extends it deeper," Limelight Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer Michael Gordon told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has a very deep portfolio of intellectual property and has been for many years a leader in developing new technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial terms were not disclosed. Gordon said the deal would generate revenue starting in the third quarter, although this was already factored into its previously issued earnings outlook for the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement helped to ease the concerns of some investors over the outlook for Limelight, which helps media and Internet companies deliver bandwidth-heavy services more reliably by finding less congested routes over the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limelight's share price has fallen about 60 percent since their market debut in June on worries about increasing competition from Akamai Technologies Inc (AKAM.O), South Korea- based CDNetworks Co Ltd 073710.KQ and new technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock ended up 4.95 percent at $8.90 on the Nasdaq, after rising as high as $10.14. Akamai shares fell 3.32 percent to $30.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gordon said that, while prices appeared to have been falling over the past few years, he did not feel pricing pressure had particularly intensified in the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limelight already supports video and game downloading for Microsoft's Xbox Live. It also delivers content for MSNBC.com, a joint online news venture between Microsoft and NBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Limelight clients include social networking sites Facebook and News Corp's NWSa.N MySpace, as well as online video provider Akimbo Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the Tempe, Arizona-based company forecast third-quarter loss that was wider than expected, sending its shares to record lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT Aug 23 (Reuters) - German state bank SachsenLB has invested about 3.5 billion euros ($4.7 billion) in risky mortgages in the United States, the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper reported on Thursday, without citing sources.  About one-fifth of the total volume of SachsenLB's Ormond Quay fund was invested in subprime, the paper said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier this month, a group of German banks extended a 17.3 billion euro credit line to keep the fund afloat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Ormond Quay, named after an address in Dublin, invested in asset-backed securities -- packages of debt -- including U.S. subprime home mortgages, made to less creditworthy borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    These risky mortgages have been hit by rising defaults, a crisis that spilled over into the banking sector and the wider economy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SachsenLB declined to comment on the amount of money invested in risky mortgages, repeating only that all securities held by Ormond Quay have a "AAA" rating, Financial Times Deutschland said.  The bank has said the reorganisation of the fund would hit its profits but was not immediately available for comment on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Peter Dinkloh, editing by Will Waterman; Frankfurt Newsroom +4969 7565 1345; Reuters Messaging peter.dinkloh.reuters.com@reuters.net)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=.7418 Euro)   Keywords: SACHSENLB SUBPRIME/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

There have been no reported incidences of fire, personal injury or property damage resulting from the component failure in the wheel.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is in advanced talks to take a quarter of a privately owned cement maker in east China for nearly $80 million, marking the latest foreign foray into the country's fragmented cement sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has in principle agreed to pay 600 million yuan ($79.12 million) for 25 percent of Hongshi Cement, which holds all the assets of its namesake holding company, a source involved in the negotiation told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The two sides are working out some technical details and the final agreement could be signed before the end of the year," the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that Hongshi Cement would also go public eventually, preferably in the domestic market, but the timetable and other details have yet to be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hongshi executives declined to comment and Goldman's China operations could not be reached immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal underscores strong foreign interest in China, where global investment banks and private equity firms -- from Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to Carlyle CYL.UL -- are eager to cash in on the country's breakneck economic growth of 10 percent or more annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs alone has already taken control of China's top meat processor, Henan Shuanghui Investment  Development Co 000895.SS, and bought shares in top auto glass maker Fuyao (600660.SS) and air-conditioner maker Midea 000527.SZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also marks the latest foreign foray into the country's fragmented cement industry -- which makes half of the world's cement -- attracted by booming demand and restructuring efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE ACQUISITIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Beijing's efforts to cool overheated sectors of its fast-growing economy, including property, the 2008 Olympics and 2010 Shanghai World Expo continue to create strong demand for building materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France's Lafarge (LAFP.PA), which entered China in the mid-1990s, had in 2005 merged its Chinese cement arm with the cement unit of Shui On Construction and Materials (0983.HK) to form Lafarge Shui On, the market leader in southwestern China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three deals by outside investors were sealed late last year alone, with HeidelbergCement (HEIG.DE), ranked fourth in the world, taking 80 percent of Liaoning Gongyuan Cement and Irish building materials firm CRH (CRH.I) buying a cement plant in northeast China as well as a 26 percent stake in Yatai Cement, part of Jilin Yatai Group (600881.SS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consolidation among domestic players, meanwhile, are also picking up pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the week, China National Building Material Co (3323.HK), the country's top maker of cement, said it would form a 3.5 billion yuan venture with five Chinese partners, set to be its flagship subsidiary in the country's southeast region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expected more acquisitions and mergers in the country's cement sectors, as Beijing closes outmoded and polluting plants and accelerates the development of big, modern ones. Beijing wants to reduce the number of producers by 60 percent by 2020, leaving about 2,000 manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hongshi, based in Zhejiang province, controls eight cement making subsidiaries, mostly in the eastern coast, with a combined annual capacity of 16.5 million tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales are expected at 3.6 billion yuan this year, up from roughly 2.8 billion yuan in 2006, a senior company executive told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=7.583 Yuan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Aug 23 (Reuters) - Thailand will soon extend
offshore gas oil rights held by Chevron Corp (CVX.N) by 10
years to 2022, the Thai energy minister said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron and PTT Exploration  Production PCL (PTTEP)
PTTE.BK have requested permission to carry on operating their
separate fields in the Gulf of Thailand after the original
concessions expire in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The talks are nearly concluded. There's only a minor legal
problem but we will conclude the talks soon," Piyasvasti
Amranand told reporters in a ASEAN ministerial meeting in
Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A senior ministry official had said in July that the
Petroleum Board was likely to grant the extension. The deal
also reuqires cabinet approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In return, Chevron would invest another $8 billion in the
Erawan field to raise production to 1,240 million cubic feet
per day (mcfpd) from 740 mcfpd and sell it to state-run PTT PCL
(PTT.BK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron would have to pay the government $750 million in
fees for the field, which began producing gas in 1981 and was
operated by Unocal until it was acquired by Chevron in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PTTEP, part of a consortium that includes France's Total

fees.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Daisuke Wakabayashi and Tarmo Virki &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/HELSINKI Aug 22 (Reuters) - Leading mobile phone maker Nokia (NOK1V.HE) said on Wednesday it would bring Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT.O) Windows Live suite of Web services, like e-mail and instant messaging, to many of its cell phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft, Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) and Google Inc. (GOOG.O) are competing for valuable real estate on a handset's main screen, so users can gain access to their online services without the extra step of going through the phone's Web browser. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft's services will integrate with Nokia's existing programs allowing users to sync their Windows Live contacts list with the phone's address book or send and receive Hotmail e-mails within Nokia's messaging application. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Owners of Nokia's multimedia phones will be able to download a suite of Windows Live services that include e-mail, instant messenger, contacts list and a blogging and picture sharing site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Finnish phone maker plans to preload cheaper models with Microsoft's suite of services next year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "In practice it would be as wide as possible," Nokia's Jari Pasanen, vice president for strategy and technology at multimedia business unit, told Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The service will be available for users of five Nokia multimedia phones, including N95 and N73, in 11 European and Middle Eastern countries including Britain, Germany, France, the Netherlands, the Nordics and Saudi Arabia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The two companies said the service would be initially free, but they may charge a monthly fee for it later. Microsoft and Nokia would not disclose how they planned to share revenue from the agreement, but said sales of advertising for the services would not be shared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    WEB SHIFTS TO MOBILE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nokia, the world's largest mobile phone maker with a 38 percent global market share, also has a deal with Yahoo to feature the company's Yahoo Go software, a suite of services for download that includes e-mail, search and an address book. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Handset makers, faced with falling prices of cellphones, are looking for new sources of revenue by striking deals with content and service providers who want to be featured on Nokia phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Meanwhile, Microsoft and its Web rivals are targeting the 3 billion mobile phone users as the next -- and, possibly, more lucrative -- frontier for online advertising. The huge profits have yet to roll in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "There is a ton of stuff going on, but ... you just can't simply extend the advertising platforms as they exist today to the phone," said Steve Berkowitz, the head of Microsoft's online services group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nokia and Microsoft, fierce competitors because they make rival operating systems for handsets, signed their first co-operation agreement in 2005 to put the Windows Media player on to Nokia phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier this month, Nokia said it would start to use Microsoft's copy protection technology in its software platforms to boost the wireless use of music and videos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "There has been talk that Nokia and Microsoft would be in some kind of war," Nokia's Pasanen said. "That is not the case." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Leslie Gevirtz; Reuters messaging: tarmo.virki.reuters.com@reuters.net;  +358-9-680 50 235, news@reuters.fi)) Keywords: NOKIA MICROSOFT/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;EL PENOL, Colombia (Reuters) - With a machete and a long-handled spade, Colombian farmers like Claudio Gualtero are trying to succeed where seven years of aerial coca fumigation struggled in the battle to slash the country's drug exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After receiving billions of dollars in U.S. aid to spray coca crops from the air, Colombia is shifting strategy to intensify manual eradication on the ground to attack the leaves used to make cocaine that ends up on U.S. and European streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a small-time coca farmer, Gualtero now captains a work gang uprooting illicit crops along the dry hillsides of southern Narino province, where guerrillas, traffickers and paramilitaries battle over cocaine routes to the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is what creates so much chaos," the 52-year-old farmer said as his team, including four of his sons, dug up coca bushes speckled with red seeds under heavy police guard. "Every plant we destroy is another problem gone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say the U.S.-backed fumigation plan has failed to live up to its promise to slash cocaine output or provide sufficient alternatives for farmers who have learned how to protect coca crops after pilots dump trails of withering herbicides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While U.S. military and counter-narcotics aid helped Colombia reduce violence from its 40-year conflict, cocaine production remains stubbornly above 600 tonnes a year, or more than 60 percent of the world's total production, the United Nations says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month President Alvaro Uribe acknowledged mistakes made with fumigation after farmers complained legal crops were hit by herbicides, and he said the three-year-old eradication program was more efficient in killing coca at the root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the shift came after U.S. Democrats, critical of the results of aerial herbicides, pushed to cut military and fumigation aid in favor of more funding for development programs to ween farmers away from the lucrative drug crop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spray planes will still buzz over dangerous areas, but the government sees eradication teams more permanently rooting out coca, creating jobs for poor farmers and bolstering state presence in areas under rebel influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A hectare eradicated by hand is 100 percent eradicated," said Victoria Restrepo, head of the presidential illicit crop program. "When you spray a hectare, that doesn't mean 100 percent will be eradicated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REBEL THREATS, MINES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a makeshift camp of tents and black plastic sheeting near the impoverished town of El Penol in Narino, work gangs hike out with a police patrol shortly after dawn to destroy coca sown among a patchwork of maize and plantain plots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many are poor farmers struggling for work and most are shipped in from other parts of Colombia for two-month contracts to guard against guerrillas or paramilitaries seeking revenge on the local population for lost coca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narino, with its easy access to the Pacific coast, has become a major center for coca production and turf wars among rival armed groups looking to secure control of smuggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia sprays more than 320,000 acres of land each year, but the U.N. estimates the country still has about 200,000 acres of coca. Washington puts that figure higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities hope more than 100 work gangs hacking up an average of 3 acres a day nationwide can destroy 120,000 acres in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the program has risks. Six eradicators were killed last year when they set off a bomb attached to a coca plant and rebels killed 13 soldiers assigned to protect workers. Rebels often lay home-made land mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rafael Nieto, an analyst and former deputy justice minister, said eradication would effectively compliment spraying, but other experts questioned the long-term impact on coca output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The eradicators leave, the troops leave and a vacuum opens up again for the illegal armed groups," said Vicente Torrijos, an analyst at Bogota's Rosario University. "The outlook for this strategy looks bleak."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Abu Usama, accused of being a spy for working as a U.S. military translator, thought he would protect his family from retribution if he left Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, four months after he went alone to Jordan, his father, brother and brother-in-law were snatched by suspected al Qaeda fighters near their home in western Baghdad. None has been seen since. All are presumed dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abu Usama's story is typical of many of the thousands of Iraqis who put their lives at risk by working as translators for the Americans, British and others whose forces are fighting Iraq's relentless insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a few hundred dollars a month and with a dream of helping to build a new Iraq -- or of a visa to get out -- they put themselves and their families in danger of reprisals by Sunni Islamist militants and Shi'ite militias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many are in limbo, stuck in third countries like Jordan and Syria, where an estimated two million Iraqis have fled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translators interviewed by Reuters refused to give their names for fear of retribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Abu Usama" -- the name is an alias -- earned about $350 a month working for a U.S. military police unit in Abu Ghraib, a violent Sunni Arab neighborhood in western Baghdad. "It was a very terrible place," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He twice received death threats, one delivered in a message to his front gate. He decided to go, leaving behind his wife, 6-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter. Their third child was born two months after he left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am without work and it is very difficult for me to get them here," he told Reuters by telephone from Amman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I came here to Jordan to emigrate to America. It is very difficult. I have passed one year here trying," Abu Usama said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hard to get an exact figure for how many Iraqis work as translators for U.S. military and reconstruction teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most work for a contractor which pays about 8,000 translators a flat fee of $750 a month. They can earn bonuses of $150 a month if they live with their units and another $150 if they go out on patrols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEHEADED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shak", who lives in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone with his wife and five children, believes in his work and says U.S. forces are trying to help the people of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he also knows the risks after the body of a 26-year-old colleague was found last year near Sadr City, a sprawling Shi'ite slum in Baghdad and stronghold of powerful anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's feared Mehdi Army militia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They found an ID badge in his pocket that said he worked for U.S. forces. Unfortunately, they cut off his head. He was my friend," Shak told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many try to keep their work secret in a bid to protect themselves and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A woman in my neighborhood stopped me and asked if I worked for the Americans," said "Sal", who lives in Rusafa in Baghdad's predominantly Shi'ite east.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I laughed and said: 'I wish I worked for the Americans. I don't speak English. I work in a supermarket'. I don't think she believed me," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in May it could accept as many as 7,000 refugees through the 2007 fiscal year. This was after President George W. Bush's administration came under fire from Congress for accepting only 466 Iraqi refugees since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. embassy in Baghdad said in a statement that the Bush administration was separately seeking legislation from Congress that would grant special immigration visas to all eligible "locally engaged staff" after three years of service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The administration is committed to taking care of the many brave Iraqis who have worked or are working for the United States in Iraq," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment of translators in Iraq gained greater prominence in July after Denmark said it had secretly airlifted about 200 translators and other Iraqi employees and their families out of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An admission this month that automatic asylum would not be granted to the 90-odd interpreters working with the 5,000-strong British force in southern Iraq was soon followed by newspaper headlines like "Abandoned - The 91 Iraqis Who Risked All".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. efforts so far come as little comfort to the thousands of Iraqis like Abu Usama who are still without visas and want Washington to follow Copenhagen's example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We helped them undertake their mission. We are not warriors, we are civilians," Abu Usama said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We helped to free Iraq. It was bad luck for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Peter Graff in Baghdad)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has won Chinese government approval to buy a 10 percent stake in Fuyao Group Glass Industries Co. (600660.SS) for 890 million yuan ($118 million), the Chinese firm said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Commerce has given permission for the country's biggest auto glass maker to sell 111.28 million new shares, or a 10th of its expanded share capital, to an investment arm of Goldman Sachs, Fuyao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approval came nine months after Fuyao announced last November that Goldman Sachs would buy its shares at 8 yuan apiece in a placement, becoming the Chinese firm's strategic partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then Fuyao's shares have soared, closing at 33.70 yuan on Thursday, but the two companies won't renegotiate the purchase price, Fuyao's board secretary Chen Yuedan told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuyao said it would resubmit its application for the share placement to the China Securities Regulatory Commission next Monday because the previous one was out of date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proceeds of the placement will be used to repay bank loans and improve Fuyao's liquidity, the Chinese firm said. Goldman Sachs must hold its Fuyao shares for at least three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuyao has about half of China's auto glass market. Clients include U.S. auto maker Ford (F.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid claims by some officials that China has been selling its industrial assets too cheaply, the government has tightened its regulatory scrutiny of foreign companies' purchases of stakes in Chinese firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman has scored several successes since last year. In February this year it won final regulatory approval to buy control of China's top meat processor, Henan Shuanghui Investment  Development Co. 000895.SZ, and it has also bought shares in Chinese air-conditioner maker Midea 000527.SZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also in advanced talks to buy a quarter of privately Chinese owned cement maker Hongshi Cement for nearly $80 million, a source involved in the negotiations told Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other foreign investment deals in China have been bogged down with regulatory issues. U.S. private equity firm Carlyle CYL.UL has been trying since October 2005 to buy a major stake in China's largest machinery maker, Xugong Group Construction Machinery Co., but has not won approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 7.56 yuan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DRESDEN, Germany (Reuters) - The government of the eastern 
German state of Saxony on Sunday decided to sell its stricken 
lender SachsenLB to Stuttgart-based LBBW LBBW.UL for what 
sources said was 300 million euros in a move that speed further 
bank consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The bank was battered by heavy losses from U.S. subprime 
mortgages and other risky debt amid credit turmoil which has 
roiled world financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Germany has borne the brunt of the European fallout so far 
from problems stemming from subprime home loans as two of the 
country's banks have almost collapsed, requiring high-profile 
industry bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The cabinet unanimously decided to sell the state's share 
in SachsenLB," Saxony spokesman Andreas Beese told reporters in 
the state capital Dresden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Representatives of the state have been asked to act 
accordingly in a meeting of Sachsen LB owners tonight. The 
government assumes the meeting will approve the sale," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State premier Georg Milbradt earlier said SachsenLB had 
come under so much pressure that it could not continue its 
activities without a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SachsenLB would be run by LBBW as a subsidiary and LBBW had 
secured the right to return it to its owners -- Saxony state 
and local community savings banks -- if more unacceptable risks 
emerged, Milbradt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LBBW owners were due to meet later on Sunday in Stuttgart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source close to the company said LBBW was taking over 100 
percent of SachsenLB at a price of 300 million euros ($407 
million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another source close to the negotiations said SachsenLB 
needed between 250 and 300 million euros immediately, which 
LBBW would inject in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SachsenLB is the second German casualty after the near 
collapse of small-company lender IKB IKBG.DE which was saved 
by a group of banks including state-owned KfW KFW.UL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In return for a 17 billion euro ($23.1 billion) credit line 
to keep it afloat, the owners were forced into agreeing to its 
sale, a milestone in Germany, where few state-owned banks are 
ever put up for auction.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REFORM DEBATE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The events are speeding long-running discussions about how 
to reform Germany's banking sector, where analysts have long 
been saying the country could function with fewer institutions 
and that the state should loosen its dominance of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; North-Rhine Westphalia state premier Juergen Ruettgers 
favours creating a northern and a southern group of state 
banks, according to an advance extract of a Focus magazine 
article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ruettgers favored selling the state's 38-percent share in 
WestLB to Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), Focus also said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SachsenLB debacle has also prompted calls for the 
reform of financial market supervision, especially the role of 
financial watchdog BaFin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BaFin said on Saturday that SachsenLB's Irish subsidiary 
had already been investigated in 2005 and problems with its 
risk exposure had been found. BaFin at the time had asked the 
Dublin subsidiary to make changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Finance Ministry spokesman said on Sunday the government 
was permanently examining the efficacy of banking supervision 
and that adjustments could be made if necessary. He added:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A functioning banking oversight is no insurance against 
wrong decisions being made -- which are often only seen as 
wrong decisions afterwards," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (additional reporting by Dave Graham, Patricia Nann,

(BMY.N) said on Monday they finalized an agreement reached in April, under which the drugmakers will research, develop and sell a class of medicines called DGAT-1 inhibitors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The compounds could potentially treat metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes, the companies said. Pfizer had already discovered some such compounds in pre-clinical research, meaning early-stage studies not yet involving human subjects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The partnership also includes DGAT-1 inhibitors that Pfizer licensed last year from German drugmaker Bayer AG BAYG.DE, including a pre-clinical compound known as PF-04415060, or BAY 74-4113. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As previously announced, Pfizer will be responsible for all early-stage studies under the Bristol-Myers deal, while the companies will jointly conduct Phase III -- or late-stage -- trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The companies said the compounds are designed to block DGAT-1, an enzyme that plays a big role in creation of blood fats called triglycerides which at high levels can make people more prone to diabetes and related problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Derek Caney; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; 646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER BRISTOLMYERS/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;Co has filed a patent lawsuit against Kraft Foods,manufacturer of the Maxwell House Coffee brand. The lawsuit, filed in the United States Federal District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco, alleges that the new plastic container for Maxwell House coffee, now being introduced throughout the U.S., directly infringes key Procter  Gamble patents on Folgers Coffee. In 2003, PG introduced Folgers Coffee in a consumer-preferred plastic container. This innovation has grown the Folgers business for the past four years. The lawsuit seeks to stop Kraft Foods from selling the infringing Maxwell House Coffee package. It also seeks recovery of damages.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT Aug 27 (Reuters) - Barclays Bank (BARC.L) helped set up the offshore financing vehicle that tripped up SachsenLB, the stricken German Landesbank that needed rescuing, British newspaper The Times reported on its website on Monday.  "Barclays appears to have been responsible both for designing a complex fund that got Sachsen into difficulty and for helping to pull the plug on the bank by demanding margin calls in respect of another Sachsen investment," it reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sachsen Funding I, a Dublin-registered fund created jointly by Sachsen and Barclays Capital, was one of the offshore "conduits" that ran into trouble when the market dried up for commercial paper they used to finance investments in U.S. asset-backed securities, the paper said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Barclays also made margin calls last week on a credit hedge fund in which Sachsen has a stake and later seized some of its collateral, The Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Barclays did not immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The paper cited sources close to Barclays as saying that any losses on special investment vehicles it advised for clients appeared minimal for it and that it should not be blamed for clients' difficulties since it was not responsible for picking assets in the funds or running them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It said Barclays foresaw "little flowback" in the form of continuing financial or legal liabilities. Barclays would in theory be obliged to make a statement only if the loss topped 700 million pounds ($1.40 billion), a tenth of annual profits, it added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    German state-backed bank Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(LBBW) [LBBW.UL] agreed on Sunday to buy SachsenLB as pressure mounted for further mergers among Germany's state-sector banks, among the highest-profile victims of the U.S. mortgage crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    -- Additional reporting by Richard Hubbard in London &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ((Michael Shields, editing by Rory Channing; michael.shields@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: michael.shields.reuters.com@reuters.net; +49 69 7565 1266)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=.4993 Pound)   Keywords: SACHSENLB BARCLAYS/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Joanthan Gould &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT Aug 27 (Reuters) - LBBW's weekend takeover of SachsenLB, a fellow state-backed lender that was stricken by subprime investments, was quick but more German bank mergers will likely come slowly, keeping competitive pressure intense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LBBW and SachsenLB, with the backing of their respective state owners and German financial watchdog BaFin, hammered out a hasty agreement on Sunday rescuing SachsenLB by turning it into a subsidiary of Stuttgart-based LBBW [LBBW.UL]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LBBW, with total assets of 428 billion euros ($584.8 billion), is the largest of Germany's regional state-owned landesbanks, which act as wholesale banks to the hundreds of community-based savings banks in their regions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The takeover of SachsenLB cuts the number of independent landesbanks to seven from eight, but that is still far more than the 2-3 regional state banks that analysts see as optimal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Germany's crowded and fragmented banking market has kept profit margins thin at home, preventing the emergence of big banking players, while foreign banking rivals have grown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Even the flagship bank for Europe's biggest economy, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), ranks only 15th among Europe's banks by market capitalisation, according to Reuters data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Every bank has to fight to hold onto its market share," said Udo Steffens, banking professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Managment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The country's lenders are separated into three pillars, with publicly listed banks, state-owned lenders and mutual banks all scratching for earnings and often underbidding one another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Though European competition rules have dented the demarcation of banking types, consolidation in practice has come only within the pillars rather than across them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Politicians and savings banks have so far fiercely guarded the independence of their landesbanks, selling them only in the face of large potential losses like those at SachsenLB or under pressure from the European Commission in the case of Berlin landesbank LBB BEBG.DE earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Frankfurt School's Steffens said it would probably take a further five to eight years for politicians to allow the number of landesbanks to fall to just a few. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The illusion that the three-pillar system protects us from international capital flows is still widely held among politicians," Steffens said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "In that sense, the weakness seen at SachsenLB or WestLB is politically very opportune for the private-sector banks." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    WestLB [WDLG.UL], which earlier this year was rocked by losses from share trading blunders that sources familiar with the situation say have probably topped 500 million euros, has been in talks with LBBW about a possible tie-up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But LBBW's state owner said on Monday there would be no more talks until WestLB's owner, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(NRW), finalised its thinking on the future of the bank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NRW's premier raised the prospect that two landesbanks could be formed, one each for the north and the south of the country, out of the existing group of regional lenders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Germany's finance ministry said LBBW's takeover of SachsenLB was a "strengthening, not a weakening" of the banking sector. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Consolidation of state-sector banks is positive for the market in general because it reduces the number of weak competitors," said Thomas von Luepke, chief German banks analyst at credit ratings agency Fitch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But politicians must ensure that consolidation gives landesbanks access to retail banking such as savings banks, which would improve the stability of funding and revenues and allow for a better diversification of risks, von Luepke said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Von Luepke also said those awaiting mergers across the three types of banks in Germany would needed patience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It is unlikely to happen soon," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ((Editing by David Cowell; Reuters Messaging: jonathan.gould.reuters.com@reuters.net; +49 69 7565 1242)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=.7318 Euro)   Keywords: GERMANY LANDESBANKS/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Aug 27 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded COSCO Pacific Ltd (1199.HK) to buy from neutral after the company said it would sell its 20 percent stake in Chong Hing Bank Ltd (1111.HK) to its ultimate parent for HK$2.09 billion (US$267.7 million). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It also revised up its target price for the stock to HK$25 per share from HK$23. COSCO Pacific shares closed at HK$19.22 on Thursday prior to a share suspension on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The asset sale, which is at a premium price, highlights continued strong support for COSCO Pacific from its parent and removed a long-standing overhang on the stock, the investment bank said in a research note on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    COSCO Pacific said it expected to realise an estimated gain of about US$89.9 million from the disposal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For asset sale story please read [IDnHKG283514], for announcement details click  here &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Alison Leung, editing by Anne Marie Roantree; Reuters Messaging: alison.leung.reuters.com@reuters.net; +852 2843 6369, fax +852 2845 0636)) Keywords: COSCOPAC STOCK  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, quotes, share price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSLO Aug 27 (Reuters) - Norway's Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) has
agreed to buy a controlling stake in the Bressay oilfield and a
minority interest in the Mariner field in the British sector of
the North Sea from Chevron (CVX.N) for an undisclosed sum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The acquisition contains 64.6 percent in the Bressay field
and some 45 percent in the Mariner field, consisting of Mariner
and Mariner East," Norsk Hydro ASA said in a statement on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it was too early to say if the fields were
commercially viable, but said it aimed to bring its expertise of
similary heavy oilfields to bear to appraise the prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The (heavy oil) fields have been appraised by many wells,
but there are still uncertainties related to the potential
recoverable reserves," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Hydro official declined to say how much the company would
pay for the stakes in the fields, but said Hydro hopes to use
experience gained with a similar heavy oil field, Peregrino
offshore Brazil, where it is a partner with Anadarko (APC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We might be able to recover more resources and make it a
viable project," Hydro spokeswman Kama Holte Strand said. "But
first we need to do seismic (surveys) and an evaluation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal is subject to approval by UK authorities, partners
and the concurrence of Chevron's senior management, Hydro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is too early to confirm the commerciality, but Hydro's
experience from the heavy oil fields Grane in the North Sea and
Peregrino offshore Brazil will be valuable background when
assessing the possibilities and looking for viable solutions for
a development plan," Norsk Hydro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A possible solution could be to create a hub in this area
for more potential candidates for tie-ins," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Norsk Hydro, the energy and aluminium company, is spinning
off its oil and gas activities to Norway's Statoil (STL.OL) by
the end of the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hydro shares traded down 0.8 percent at 210.50 crowns at
1048 GMT, underperforming a 0.3 percent drop in the Oslo bourse
benchmark index .OSEBX and a 0.2 percent fall in the DJ Stoxx

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is to buy upscale jeweler Tiffany  Co's (TIF.N) flagship store in Tokyo for about 37 billion yen ($318 million), a sign that Japan's hot property market is shrugging off global credit concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A financial source close to the matter told Reuters that Goldman won a bid to buy the Tiffany shop in Tokyo's prime Ginza shopping district for 180 million yen per tsubo, a Japanese measurement equivalent to 3.3 square meters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is 78 percent above Yamano Music Co's main store nearby, which carried the highest official price of 100.98 million yen per tsubo as of January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do think it's expensive. I think it was priced this way because Tiffany is a tenant," said Morgan Stanley analyst Tomoyoshi Omuro. "I'm not sure if they could sell at that price once Tiffany leaves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omuro said Japan's property market, especially in the Tokyo area, remains tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Land prices jumped 17 percent last year in the biggest increase by far since Japan's bubble years. In the capital's fashionable Ginza district, the home of upscale department stores and luxury brands, average prices jumped by a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiffany bought the land and building in Ginza for 16.5 billion yen in 2003, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Goldman and Tiffany's Tokyo office declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global credit concerns triggered by a U.S. subprime mortgage crisis have cast a pall over the property market globally, but Japan and Asia remain attractive to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS said in a report on Friday that fund inflow into the Japanese real estate market was set to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As securitization of real estate has made progress, the liquidity of real estate has increased, leading to improved recognition by investors of real estate as an asset class and by an increasing number of investors who are expanding the weighting of real estate in their asset portfolios," UBS analyst Toshihiko Okino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect this trend to continue at least over the next year or two."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc bond 
analyst pleaded guilty on Tuesday to helping lead a far-flung 
insider trading scheme involving tips about pending mergers and 
stolen copies of BusinessWeek magazine that netted more than 
$6.7 million in illicit gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Eugene Plotkin, 28, a former associate in the fixed income 
research division at Goldman Sachs, pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy to commit securities fraud and insider trading 
charges at a hearing in federal magistrate court in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He had been scheduled to go on trial on October 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prosecutors accused Plotkin and another former Goldman 
employee of trading off tips leaked by an ex-Merrill Lynch and 
Co Inc investment banking analyst and also from stolen advance 
copies of BusinessWeek they obtained from printing plant 
workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also got information from a New Jersey grand juror 
about an investigation of drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, 
prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under a plea agreement, Plotkin is expected to be sentenced 
to anywhere from 4-3/4 to nearly six years in prison. He also 
agreed to forfeit $6.7 million. He is due to be sentenced on 
November 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I understood what I did was wrong and against the law," he 
told U.S. Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Harvard-educated Plotkin and several other defendants 
were arrested in April 2006. Authorities said the ring made 
millions from illegal trading on news of upcoming mergers, 
including Procter  Gamble Co's acquisition of Gillette Co and 
Adidas' acquisition of Reebok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case began in August 2005, when regulators grew 
suspicious of the options trading profits of a 63-year-old 
retired seamstress in Croatia. The account belonging to the 
retiree was frozen and her nephew, David Pajcin, was charged 
with insider trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pajcin, also a former Goldman Sachs employee, was alleged 
to be the co-head of the trading ring with Plotkin and has 
already pleaded guilty in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one scheme, according to prosecutors, Plotkin and Pajcin 
persuaded Stanislav Shpigelman, a low-level banking analyst at 
Merrill, to provide tips on upcoming mergers in return for a 
share of the trading profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shpigelman pleaded guilty to one count of insider trading 
last year and was sentenced to three years in prison in 
January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In another scheme, according to prosecutors, Plotkin and 
Pajcin recruited two individuals to get jobs at a BusinessWeek 
magazine printing plant to steal advance copies and pass on 
names of stocks mentioned in the magazine's "Inside Wall 
Street" column.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wisconsin printing plant worker Nickolaus Shuster has 
pleaded guilty in the case, while charges are still pending 
against the other employee, Juan Renteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A former New Jersey postal worker, Jason Smith, was 
sentenced to 33 months in prison in December for leaking secret 
grand jury information involving the accounting practices of 
Bristol-Myers to Pajcin and Plotkin.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Jessica Wohl &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO Aug 28 (Reuters) - Procter &amp; Gamble Co (PG.N) said on Tuesday that 70 percent of its top executive's $27.7 million in compensation in the latest fiscal year came in stock, restricted stock or stock options.  Chairman and Chief Executive A.G. Lafley's salary of $1.7 million was the same as in the three prior fiscal years, and his $3.5 million bonus, which is based on company performance, was unchanged from the previous two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Among other compensation, Lafley received $9.2 million in stock and $10.3 million in options. Most of his compensation stemmed from long-term incentive programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A year earlier, Lafley earned $5 million in restricted stock awards and $5.9 million in long-term incentive plan payments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    P, which makes Gillette razors and Pampers diapers, disclosed the details of Lafley's compensation in a proxy filing with U.S. regulators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Lafley, 60, is required to hold eight times his base salary in P shares and/or restricted stock units. He is well above that threshold as he owns more than 30 times his base salary in stock, P said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said 92 percent of Lafley's total compensation was predicated on P's performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sales rose 12 percent to $76.5 billion in the fiscal year ended in June, aided by the October 2005 acquisition of Gillette and revamped products such as Pantene shampoo and conditioner and Swiffer cleaning kits. Sales, excluding the effects of mergers and foreign exchange, rose 5 percent, within the goal of 4 percent to 6 percent set for Lafley's incentive pay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earnings per share jumped 15 percent to $3.04 and were up 11 percent before the impact of dilution from Gillette, topping a 10 percent target.    Retired Vice Chairman James Kilts, the former Gillette chairman and CEO who left P on Oct. 1, received $9 million in salary, bonus and other compensation, P said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Evelyn Y. Davis, a well-known shareholder activist who holds 800 P shares, is proposing at the Oct. 9 annual meeting in the company's hometown of Cincinnati that the board stop awarding stock options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last year, the same proposal from Davis, who did not attend the 2006 meeting, was defeated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Free Enterprise Action Fund, which owns 1,260 P shares, is proposing the board to report on any company policies and activities intended to promote free enterprise, improve the business environment and prevent anti-business activists from harming shareholder value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which owns 70 P shares, is proposing the board report on the feasibility of phasing out Iams' funding for and use of laboratory tests on animals in favor of in-home testing methods. Iams, a unit of P, makes pet food for cats and dogs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    P's board recommended shareholders vote against all three of the shareholder proposals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of P, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, were down 3 cents at $65.20 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (See here for "Shop Talk" -- Reuters' retail and consumer blog) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jessica Wohl) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Lisa Von Ahn; Reuters Messaging: jessica.wohl.reuters.com@reuters.net; +312-408-8132; e-mail: jessica.wohl@reuters.com)) Keywords: PROCTER PROXY/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 28 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said the
unplanned weekend shutdown of a flare gas recovery compressor at its

no impact on output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Work was underway to restart the compressor, which was shut due to a

on Environmental Quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There was no impact to production and all our customer needs were
met," Exxon added. The incident began on Sunday evening and was due to end
early Tuesday, according to the filing. The refinery is the largest in the

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A Microsoft (MSFT.O) document format that may be adopted as an international standard this weekend is a ploy to lock in customers, who could lose control over their own data in a worst-case scenario, critics say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) is balloting its members on the issue in a vote that closes on Sunday. ISO approval would encourage wider adoption of the Microsoft Open XML format by public-sector organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opponents of Open XML, which is the default file-saving format in Microsoft Office 2007, say there is no need for a rival standard to the widely used Open Document Format (ODF) that is already an international standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They argue its 6,000 pages of code, compared with ODF's 860 pages, make it artificially complicated and untranslatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and others point out that multiple standards are normal in the software and other industries and that competition makes for better products. Microsoft says its format has higher specifications and is more useful than ODF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More parallel standards makes for better standards. It's good not to decide for a single standard too soon," Michael Groezinger, Microsoft's chief technology officer in Germany, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to speculate on the outcome of the ISO vote but welcomed last week's decision of the German Institute for Standardisation -- an ISO member -- to give Open XML a conditional "yes" vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the controversy are fears that Open XML is not as open as it claims to be, raising the specter that customers using the word-processing format could become reliant on Microsoft for access to their own documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XML, short for Extensible Markup Language, is a standard for describing data in a way that is supposed to allow it to be shared across various systems and applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The absolute nightmare scenario is that Microsoft says: 'Update your licenses or we'll turn off your access,'" Georg Greve, president of the Free Software Foundation Europe, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Access to governmental data will completely depend on the existence of Microsoft," said Greve, who expects Microsoft to lose the ISO ballot in a close vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Free Software Foundation is a U.S.-based non-profit organisation that campaigns for computer programs that can be freely used, modified and redistributed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Groezinger denies any danger of bodies losing access to their own data. He said Microsoft had handed over control of Open XML to standards-making body Ecma, which would make it available even in the event of Microsoft's demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has also given guarantees not to pursue any patent claims against parties using, selling or distributing Open XML, although some have questioned whether those guarantees are sufficiently binding or comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also collaborated with Novell NOVL.O to develop a tool to translate Open XML documents into ODF and vice versa. But critics say the tool cannot provide a complete translation due to the higher complexity of the Microsoft format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open XML is unnecessarily bloated, partly because it packs in unrelated features that lead users to other Microsoft applications, FSF's Greve says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a classic vendor lock-in strategy," he told Reuters. "It's not that new, it's not that ingenious but it's quite effective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given Microsoft's leading market position, Open XML will become a de facto standard regardless of the ISO decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The two standards may converge in the longer term, but all organizations should plan on them coexisting for at least the medium term," research group Gartner said in a recent report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problems associated with the need to translate between formats will continue and will diminish the value of XML."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)

 Aug 28 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it estimates Turkey's
high cost of equity would come down to normal levels under a
stable environment and raised its price target on five Turkish
banks.

 The brokerage said minimal disruption of ongoing
presidential elections and stable macroeconomic dynamics
leading to lower interest rates in 2008 should help bring down
Turkey's cost of equity.

 Goldman upgraded Turkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. (HALKB.IS) to
"buy" from "neutral" and added the bank to its Pan-Europe Buy
List. The brokerage said fresh bouts of risk aversion in the
markets have disproportionately affected Halkbank's stock.

 The bank should command a significant premium to the sector
average, given its superior profitability and substantially
higher dividend-payout ratio, the brokerage added.

 The brokerage maintained its rating on Akbank (AKBNK.IS),
Turkiye Garanti Bankasi (GARAN.IS) and Yapi Kredi (YKBNK.IS).

 However, Goldman downgraded Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISCTR.IS)
to "sell" from "neutral" and added the bank to its Pan-Europe
Sell List. The brokerage said Is Bank's plan to optimise its
structure is slowly progressing and that the restructuring of
its commercial platform would take time to bring expected
benefits.

 The following table lists price target changes by the
brokerage on Turkish banks.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Aug 30 (Reuters) - China's top securities watchdog
has rejected a plan by domestic appliance maker Midea Group
000527.SZ to sell a stake to an investment arm of Wall Street
bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Midea said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Midea, a private company that is one of China's biggest
makers of appliances, has long planned to sell a 10.7 percent
stake to GS Capital Partners of Goldman for 717 million yuan ($91
million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan was vetoed by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission at a review on Wednesday, Midea said in a statement,
without giving a reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Shanghai Securities News cited analysts as saying it was
probably because the government did not want to see Midea sell
its stake too cheaply to Goldman -- which has made a string of
acquisitions in the world's fastest-growing major economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Midea, a manufacturer of air conditioners, freezers
and dishwashers, have gone up about 600 percent since November
when Midea signed an agreement to sell a stake to Goldman through
private share placement.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firms Madrone Capital Partners and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners agreed to invest $1 billion in closely-held Global Hyatt Corp, the hotel company's Chairman, Tom Pritzker, said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madrone Capital Partners, a private investment firm affiliated with Rob Walton, Chairman of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and his family, along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) will each receive a board seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker said the equity investment will be used primarily to provide liquidity to the Pritzker family interest that currently own Global Hyatt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extended family is in the process of restructuring the family's holdings. Hyatt is a medium-sized U.S.-based hotel company with more than 735 hotels and resorts in 44 countries, under brands such as Grand Hyatt, Hyatt Resorts and Andaz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The addition of these sophisticated investors with long- term horizons will allow us to further our restructuring efforts without affecting Global Hyatt's financial capacity to grow and execute on our business plan," Pritzker said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker did not disclose details about the structure of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lisa Lee)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) agreed to acquire Parlano, which provides technology to allow companies to create group chat sessions for employees, and add the application to its portfolio of communication offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker announced the deal on Wednesday and expects the acquisition to close in the fourth quarter of 2007. Microsoft did not disclose financial terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parlano, a Chicago-based company spun off from Swiss bank UBS (UBSN.VX)(UBS.N), has about 50 employees and is backed by Longworth Venture Partners and Oak Investment Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parlano's MindAlign group chat application started as a dealing room tool to let traders in various locations share market-moving information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it decided to buy Parlano instead of trying to build a competing application because MindAlign already has a long list of customers running the program, including Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) and Putnam Investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to offer the group chat application as part of its "unified communication" offering, which delivers telephone, e-mail, messaging and Web conferencing over Internet networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will add the group chat feature to Microsoft Office Communications Server and Microsoft Office Communicator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    (Adds details about Triad's financial performance) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 29 (Reuters) - Subprime auto lender Triad Financial Corp., partly owned by Goldman Sachs (GS.N), plans to cut 124 jobs in California next month, according to a notice filed with that state's department of labor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Triad of Huntington Beach, California specializes in financing auto loans for people with weak credit. During the first half of the year, Triad's delinquencies increased to 11.2 percent, up from 9.5 percent at the end of 2006, even though it usually sees improved collections during that period, the company said in its quarterly financial statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The planned layoffs in California represent nearly 10 percent of the company's total work force of more than 1,300. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The filing with California said the job cuts would take effect Sept. 17. Triad's holding company is owned by Hunter's Glen Ford Ltd., Goldman Sachs and GTCR Golder Rauner LLC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Triad was not available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The auto finance company's net income fell 19 percent to $8.1 million in the quarter ended June 30. Part of the decline was because Triad set aside more money for credit losses. That provision increased 15 percent to $60.2 million in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Triad also said in its quarterly financial statement it would take charges of about $7.5 million in the third and fourth quarters related to moving some Huntington Beach-based functions to its facility in North Richland Hills, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company also said it planned to designate North Richland Hills as its corporate headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Reporting by Tim McLaughlin) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ((Editing by Dave Zimmerman; Reuters messaging: tim.mclaughlin.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6033)) Keywords: TRIAD SUBPRIME/LAYOFFS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds detail and closing prices)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Aug 29 (Reuters) - Mexican stocks rallied on
Wednesday, with strong gains in blue-chips Televisa and America
Movil a day after investors unloaded shares on worries about
the U.S. economy and tightening global credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IPC stock index .MXX gained 1.31 percent to end at
29,710.78 points. The peso MXN= MEX01 was stable at 11.1025
per dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The yield on Mexico's benchmark 10-year government peso
bond MX10YT=RR rose 2 basis points to 7.89 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors shopped for bargains after worries about the U.S.
economy and a global credit shortage sent the IPC index down
3.13 percent on Tuesday, its third biggest loss this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brazil, Argentina and other emerging markets also regained
ground after falling on Tuesday. Mexico's stock market dropped
sharply in late July and early August because of worries about
a credit crisis but has since regained somewhat, leaving the
IPC index 12 percent higher year to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're waiting for more data to see how much the subprime
issue is hitting the United States," said Jorge Laguna, head
trader at Interacciones brokerage in Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cement maker Cemex (CMXCPO.MX) gained 1.94 percent to 34.18
pesos and its New York-traded (CX.N) stock rose 2.56 percent to
$30.84. Cemex said this week a recent threat by Venezuela of
"corrective actions" against its subsidiary will not hurt the
company much because its sales there are small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa (TLVACPO.MX), the world's leading producer of
Spanish language television, surged 3.00 percent to 56.27
pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cell phone operator America Movil (AMXL.MX), the most
heavily weighted stock in the IPC index, gained 1.68 percent to
32.67 pesos and its New York-traded stock (AMX.N) added 2.83
percent to $59.18.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS Aug 29 (Reuters) - Venezuela expects in the "coming
weeks" to complete talks with Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and
ConocoPhillips (COP.N) on the takeover of their Orinoco Belt
assets, a director of state oil company PDVSA told Reuters on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think we should have a result in the coming weeks," said
Eulogio Del Pino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two energy giants quit the OPEC nation in June after
failing to reach an agreement over the government takeover of
heavy crude upgrading projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips took a $4.5 billion second quarter charge for
its stake in the Petrozuata and Ameriven heavy oil projects, while
Exxon Mobil said it valued its stake in the Cerro Negro project at
$750 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Del Pino added that Sincor, a joint venture between PDVSA,
France's Total (TOTF.PA) and Norway's Statoil (STL.OL), would
carry out major maintenance in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In Sincor, there is a major maintenance planned for next
year," Del Pino said, without offering details on the timing of
the maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sincor has heavy crude production capacity of 200,000 barrels
per day (bpd) and upgraded synthetic crude capacity of 180,000
bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total and Statoil negotiated an agreement to reduce their
shares in Sincor and stay on as minority partners.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. said on Wednesday it plans to release the first major update to its Windows Vista operating system early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of Microsoft's large corporate customers wait for the release of the first "service pack" -- a software package of fixes, updates and improvements -- before implementing a new Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate customers often hold back on adopting new software to allow Microsoft time to work out the kinks experienced by regular consumers who often buy a new computer with the latest operating system already preloaded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a post on the company's Web site, Microsoft said it plans to begin testing Windows Vista SP1 among a smaller audience in a few weeks and aims to ship the product to computer manufacturers in the first quarter of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the first service pack is not as significant as in the past, because the company can now send out patches and fixes to the product through online updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Vista SP1 should, according to Microsoft, improve the operating system's security, reliability and performance, but it will not change the product's look or add any major features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said it delayed the target date for when it will release its upcoming Windows Server 2008 to hardware manufacturers. The company now expects to release the product to manufacturers in the first quarter of 2008 from an earlier target of the end of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said the delay should not affect its plan to launch Windows Server 2008 at the end of February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also announced plans to release the third service pack of Windows XP, Vista's predecessor, in the next few weeks. It will be released to PC makers in the first half of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft were up 27 cents, or nearly one percent, to $28.20 in afternoon trade on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 29 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) is no longer working for Liverpool F.C. to
refinance the debt used to buy the soccer club earlier this
year, people familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Following the March acquisition by U.S. tycoons Tom Hicks
and George Gillett, bankers at Goldman Sachs's New York office
drew up a highly geared refinancing plan that would have put
about 550 million pounds ($1.1 billion) of debt onto the club's
books, more than 20 times its profit, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liverpool is now focusing on either extending or refinancing
a 300 million pound bridge facility, which expires in February.
A new adviser may be appointed, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman is no longer involved in refinancing Liverpool," a
second source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while Liverpool F.C. were
not immediately reachable for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors are shying away from highly leveraged deals
following the recent turmoil in credit markets, making it more
difficult for companies to access financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liverpool arch-rival Manchester United [MNU.UL] also failed
this summer to refinance its high-priced debt, following the
acquisition of the club by U.S. billionaire Malcolm Glazer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike Glazer, the refinancing plan for the Liverpool
takeover did not include a direct equity investment by the new
owners, but was instead slated to be funded only with new debt,
the first source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan was to raise about 300 million pounds to re-pay the
bridge facility provided by Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), as
well as another 250 million pounds to finance the building of a
new stadium, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stadium, originally expected to cost about 280 million
pounds, may now end up costing as much as 400 million pounds,
the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman Sachs plan included raising as much as 8 million
pounds for naming rights on a new stadium, the source said,
while London rival Arsenal generates about 3 million for its
Emirates Stadium.

&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI (Reuters) - Chinese basketball player Yao Ming, an all-star member of the Houston Rockets, was granted a visa to visit Taiwan on a trip that will score a point for rival Beijing, which aspires to unify the two territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yao got a visa for a professional sporting exchange, Chen Ming-tong, chairman of the island's Mainland Affairs Council, told reporters late on Thursday, saying Yao would visit the island on September 6-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has seen self-ruled, democratic Taiwan as part of its territory rather than as a separate country since the island broke away from Mao Zedong's Communists after civil war in 1949. China has threatened to take back the island by force, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But over the past two years, the Beijing government has preferred a policy of cultural exchanges over military threats to bring the two sides closer together by appealing to racial and ethnic links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In principle, the 26-year-old, 2.26-metre (7 ft 5 in) basketball player should be allowed to visit Taiwan, even though island authorities sometimes turn away famous Chinese visitors to discourage their contact with local people, Taiwan officials have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Chinese athletes have visited as part of Taiwan's long-standing sports exchange programs, and Yao has visited the island on two prior occasions, said Chen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Plaintiffs in the long-running case surrounding the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil disaster this week asked the U.S. Supreme Court to restore a $5 billion punitive fine against Exxon Mobil Corp, a petition filed with highest U.S. court shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The petition, filed Tuesday, followed one filed last week by Exxon Mobil that asked the Supreme Court to overturn the $2.5 billion punitive fine assessed by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeals court had halved a $5 billion fine imposed in 1994 by a federal district court jury sitting in Anchorage. The class-action suit involves about 32,000 commercial fishermen, Alaska Natives, property owners and others harmed by the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In perhaps the most infamous oil accident in U.S. history, the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil that spread to about 1,300 coastline miles. It closed commercial fisheries in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska and killed thousands of marine mammals and hundreds of thousands of seabirds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs will respond by September 20 to Exxon's effort to overturn the $2.5 billion fine, said David Tarshes, one of the plaintiff's attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs' petition argues that no Supreme Court review is needed, and that it "could prolong the case for many years to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs say the case has already dragged on too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say that in the years that Exxon and its successor Exxon Mobil have challenged the jury's verdict, a fifth of the plaintiff class members have died while the oil giant has recouped the entire $5 billion though its internal corporate rate of return, the petition said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Exxon Mobil earned record profits recently, setting quarterly and annual highs for the most money made in corporate history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a prepared statement, Exxon Mobil spokesman Tony Cudmore said the company has already paid $3.5 billion in cleanup costs, compensation and settlements and does not deserve to be further punished for the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We acknowledge that the Exxon Valdez oil spill was a very emotional event for many in Alaska, and to some, those feelings remain strong even today," the statement said. "As we have said many times, the Valdez oil spill was a tragic accident, one which the corporation deeply regrets, and one for which the corporation has paid significantly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Supreme Court does take up the case, it should restore the original verdict, the petition said. They say Exxon Mobil deserves the punitive fine because of its "reprehensible" conduct before the spill, and cited a pattern of bad behavior by Exxon Valdez Captain Joseph Hazelwood, who the plaintiffs say was drunk when the tanker hit a reef.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hazelwood was a relapsed alcoholic, and Exxon knew it," the petition said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs' petition also dismisses claims by the oil company that it should be credited for its vigorous cleanup efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cleanup recovered only about 14 percent of the spilled oil, and tape-recorded comments from an Exxon official at the time suggested that it was mounted more for publicity than effectiveness, the petition said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The petition, filed Tuesday, followed one filed last week
by Exxon Mobil that asked the Supreme Court to overturn the
$2.5 billion punitive fine assessed by the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The appeals court had halved a $5 billion fine imposed in
1994 by a federal district court jury sitting in Anchorage. The
class-action suit involves about 32,000 commercial fishermen,
Alaska Natives, property owners and others harmed by the
spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In perhaps the most infamous oil accident in U.S. history,
the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground, spilling 11 million
gallons of crude oil that spread to about 1,300 coastline
miles. It closed commercial fisheries in Prince William Sound
and the Gulf of Alaska and killed thousands of marine mammals
and hundreds of thousands of seabirds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs will respond by Sept. 20 to Exxon's effort
to overturn the $2.5 billion fine, said David Tarshes, one of
the plaintiff's attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs' petition argues that no Supreme Court
review is needed, and that it "could prolong the case for many
years to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plaintiffs say the case has already dragged on too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They say that in the years that Exxon and its successor
Exxon Mobil have challenged the jury's verdict, a fifth of the
plaintiff class members have died while the oil giant has
recouped the entire $5 billion though its internal corporate
rate of return, the petition said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Exxon Mobil earned record profits recently, setting
quarterly and annual highs for the most money made in corporate
history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a prepared statement, Exxon Mobil spokesman Tony Cudmore
said the company has already paid $3.5 billion in cleanup
costs, compensation and settlements and does not deserve to be
further punished for the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We acknowledge that the Exxon Valdez oil spill was a very
emotional event for many in Alaska, and to some, those feelings
remain strong even today," the statement said. "As we have said
many times, the Valdez oil spill was a tragic accident, one
which the corporation deeply regrets, and one for which the
corporation has paid significantly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the Supreme Court does take up the case, it should
restore the original verdict, the petition said. They say Exxon
Mobil deserves the punitive fine because of its "reprehensible"
conduct before the spill, and cited a pattern of bad behavior
by Exxon Valdez Captain Joseph Hazelwood, who the plaintiffs
say was drunk when the tanker hit a reef.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Hazelwood was a relapsed alcoholic, and Exxon knew it,"
the petition said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs' petition also dismisses claims by the oil
company that it should be credited for its vigorous cleanup
efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cleanup recovered only about 14 percent of the spilled
oil, and tape-recorded comments from an Exxon official at the
time suggested that it was mounted more for publicity than
effectiveness, the petition said.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Aug 30 (Reuters) - The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N)
said on Thursday it reached distribution agreements with its
bottling partners and Glaceau distributors for its newly
acquired Glaceau brands and Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE.N), its
largest bottler, affirmed its 2007 profit forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola purchased Glaceau, the maker of vitaminwater and
smartwater, for $4.1 billion in June in a bid to boost its
position in the fast-growing market for noncarbonated drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CCE said it will carry all major package sizes and flavors
of each Glaceau brand in most of its U.S. markets beginning
Nov. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola bottlers representing 99 percent of Coke's U.S.
bottler-delivered volume have signed on to distribute the
Glaceau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current Glaceau distributors, including Big Geyser,

continue distributing the drinks in their territories.
Retailers such as club stores and natural food stores will be
managed directly by Coca-Cola North America's Glaceau unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CCE said the purchase of the Glaceau is not expected to
have a significant impact on its 2007 results. It affirmed its
full-year forecast calling for earnings per diluted common

currency and excluding nonrecurring items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CCE said that beginning in 2008, the Glaceau acquisition
will enhance the company's "ability to reach long-term growth
objectives."

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Julie Steenhuysen &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO Aug 30 (Reuters) - Imagine cramming 30,000 full-length movies into a gadget the size of an iPod. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Scientists at IBM said on Thursday they had moved closer to such a feat by learning how to steer single atoms in a way that could create building blocks for ultra-tiny storage devices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Understanding and manipulating the behavior of atoms is critical to harnessing the power of nanotechnology, which deals with particles tens of thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "One of the most basic properties that every atom has is that it behaves like a little magnet," said Cyrus Hirjibehedin, a scientist at International Business Machines Corp.'s (IBM.N) Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "If you can keep that magnetic orientation stable over time, then you can use that to store information. That is how your hard drive works," Hirjibehedin said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "What we are trying to understand is how this fundamental property works for a single atom." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Hirjibehedin and colleague Andreas Heinrich studied this property -- known as magnetic anisotropy -- in individual iron atoms using a special microscope developed at IBM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "What we've been able to do is to look at an iron atom on a copper surface and to move that magnetic orientation around," Heinrich said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Now they are looking for an atom that remains stable over a long time. "We have a couple of ideas but we don't really know which ones will work out," Hirjibehedin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "In the very long run, we're shooting for data storage on a very tiny scale," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM colleagues in Zurich, Switzerland, meanwhile, have stumbled on a way to manipulate molecules to switch on and off, a basic function needed in computer logic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    They had been evaluating the vibration of a molecule when they noticed it had distinct switching capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Heinrich, who is familiar with the work, said the discovery is especially important because the switching action did not alter the framework of the molecule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Switches inside computer chips work like a light switch, turning on and off the flow of electrons that ultimately make up the electrical circuits of computer processors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Molecular switches could be used to store information and would lead to super-fast, super-tiny computer chips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The two discoveries, which were published in the journal Science, will one day form the basis of future devices the IBM scientists were reluctant to even speculate about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Put yourself in the situation of people in the '70s, where they had a roomful of computing equipment that could basically do what you can do nowadays on your cell phone," Heinrich said.

"It allows us to market the rig four months earlier with the goal of achieving a higher dayrate in a high rig demand period worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Sugar Land, Texas-based Noble were off 3.3 percent to $49.49 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as low as $48.82.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Early termination of Noble's jackup 'Roy Butler' in Nigeria is going to raise eyebrows (raised ours)," Tudor Pickering  Co.

on Thursday after the company said Chevron Corp (CVX.N) put an

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 30 (Reuters) - The 11,000-barrel a day Erskine
oil and associated gas field should restart in the first week of
September after repairs to the CATS gas pipeline were completed
in August, field operator Chevron (CVX.N) said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Chevron expects to restart production from its Erskine
field around Sept 5, depending on the progress of the CATS
staged re-entry plan," a spokeswoman for the company said in an
email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CATS pipeline, which carries gas from a number of North
Sea oil and gas fields, was shut on July 1 for repairs after a
large vessel scratched off its protective casing with its anchor
in June. Several fields attached to CATS were unable to produce
oil while there was nowhere to send the associated gas to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CATS operator BP (BP.L) said earlier Thursday the system,
which supplies up to a fifth of Britain's gas, is to reopen this
week after a two-month repair, allowing a cluster of North Sea
oil and gas fields to resume output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BP said flows through the pipeline would be increased
gradually in early September, reaching normal throughput by the
middle of the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron admitted last month the repairs were affecting
production from Erskine, which also produced about 1.8 million
cubic metres a day of gas in March, but would not say how badly
output of either fuel was hit.

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds Midea earnings and Goldman acquisitions in China)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Aug 30 (Reuters) - China's top securities watchdog
has rejected a plan by domestic appliance maker Midea Group
000527.SZ to sell a stake to an investment arm of Wall Street
bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Midea, a fast-growing private company that is one of China's
biggest appliance makers, had long planned to sell a 10.7 percent
stake to GS Capital Partners of Goldman for 717 million yuan ($91
million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan was vetoed by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC) at a review on Wednesday, Midea said in a
statement on Thursday, without giving a reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amid claims by some officials that China has been selling its
industrial assets too cheaply, Beijing has tightened its
regulatory scrutiny of foreign companies' purchases of stakes in
Chinese firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Shanghai Securities News cited analysts as saying it was
probably because the government did not want to see Midea sell
its stake too cheaply to Goldman -- which is making a series of
acquisitions in the world's fastest-growing major economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Midea, a maker of air conditioners, freezers and
dishwashers, have gone up about seven-fold since November when
the company signed an agreement to sell a stake to Goldman
through private share placement. The stock lost 4 percent to
34.33 yuan on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has announced plans to buy into a number of Chinese
listed firms through share placements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, Goldman won Ministry of Commerce approval
to buy a 10 percent stake in Fuyao Group Glass Industries Co
(600660.SS) for 890 million yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal also requires CSRC approval. Fuyao, whose clients
include U.S. auto maker Ford (F.N), has about half of China's
auto glass market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February this year it won final regulatory approval to buy
control of China's top meat processor, Henan Shuanghui Investment
 Development Co 000895.SZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Midea also said on Thursday it expected its net profit to
surge more than 100 percent in the first nine months of this year
from 407 million yuan in the same period last year due to sales
growth and wider gross margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, based the industrial powerhouse of Guangdong
province in southern China, reported on Thursday its net profit
for the first half of this year grew 114 percent year on year to
710 million as revenue jumped to 19 billion yuan from 12 billion
yuan.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    (Adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 31 (Reuters) - Children's Place Retail Stores Inc (PLCE.O) said on Friday it secured a licensing agreement with Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) that had been in jeopardy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company also said it would not file its annual report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, confirming a statement made last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Children's Place said new terms modify a licensing agreement reached with Disney in June for Children's Place to develop a new prototype for the Disney stores that included remodelings and refurbishments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Children's Place, which runs the Disney Store chain and its namesake clothing chain, has agreed to remodel 236 existing Disney stores by Jan. 31, 2012, two more than previously  agreed, but pushed back its 2007 and 2008 deadlines to finish the remodelings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company will also refurbish 165 stores by June 30, 2008, the same as previously agreed, but will complete 18 fewer stores in fiscal 2007 than planned.  Children's Place said it will also allow Disney to relocate its Manhattan flagship store and agreed to relax restrictions on Disney's ability to license with other partners, especially those that offer products targeted at adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Children's Place said last week it was unable to meet the deadlines set in the agreement because of circumstances beyond its control, such as a mall being renovated or another tenant not moving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The missed deadlines were breaches of the agreement and entitled Disney to possible termination of the store licensing deal, which contributed nearly one-third of Children Place's revenue in its last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Children's Place said it does not expect the agreement modifications to affect its fiscal 2007 earnings guidance. The company previously said it expects earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.40 for the full year, in range with analysts' expectation of $2.35 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last week Children's Place said its internal policies and procedures were violated by two employees -- one, who was not a "named executive officer" of the company and one who was. It did not identify either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said it is still reviewing the matter and will delay filing its delinquent financial statements until it decides what action to take. The company said it will ask the Nasdaq board for more time to file its reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Children's Place closed at $28.14 Thursday on the Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (See here for"Shop Talk" -- Reuters' retail and consumer blog)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Sarah Coffey) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe; Reuters Messaging: sarah.coffey.reuters.com@reuters.net; New York Newsroom +1 646 223 6024)) Keywords: CHILDRENSPLACE DISNEY/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Imagine cramming 30,000 full-length movies into a gadget the size of an iPod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists at IBM said on Thursday they had moved closer to such a feat by learning how to steer single atoms in a way that could create building blocks for ultra-tiny storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding and manipulating the behavior of atoms is critical to harnessing the power of nanotechnology, which deals with particles tens of thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the most basic properties that every atom has is that it behaves like a little magnet," said Cyrus Hirjibehedin, a scientist at International Business Machines Corp.'s Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can keep that magnetic orientation stable over time, then you can use that to store information. That is how your hard drive works," Hirjibehedin said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we are trying to understand is how this fundamental property works for a single atom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hirjibehedin and colleague Andreas Heinrich studied this property -- known as magnetic anisotropy -- in individual iron atoms using a special microscope developed at IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we've been able to do is to look at an iron atom on a copper surface and to move that magnetic orientation around," Heinrich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now they are looking for an atom that remains stable over a long time. "We have a couple of ideas but we don't really know which ones will work out," Hirjibehedin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the very long run, we're shooting for data storage on a very tiny scale," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM colleagues in Zurich, Switzerland, meanwhile, have stumbled on a way to manipulate molecules to switch on and off, a basic function needed in computer logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had been evaluating the vibration of a molecule when they noticed it had distinct switching capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heinrich, who is familiar with the work, said the discovery is especially important because the switching action did not alter the framework of the molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switches inside computer chips work like a light switch, turning on and off the flow of electrons that ultimately make up the electrical circuits of computer processors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molecular switches could be used to store information and would lead to super-fast, super-tiny computer chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two discoveries, which were published in the journal Science, will one day form the basis of future devices the IBM scientists were reluctant to even speculate about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Put yourself in the situation of people in the '70s, where they had a roomful of computing equipment that could basically do what you can do nowadays on your cell phone," Heinrich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They would have given you some really stupid answers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 31 (Reuters) - European high-yield bond
investors have hardly changed their positions in the past two
months, despite a great deal of volatility, and nearly half are
willing to add to holdings, a survey by JP Morgan showed.
A total of 52 percent of investors reported long positions
in European high-yield bonds as of Aug. 30, versus 50 percent on
July 5, the bank said in a note to clients. Short and neutral
positions were little changed at 26 percent and 22 percent,
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Willingness to add risk has moved to a new high, with no
investors looking to reduce their exposure over the next three
months, and almost 50 percent looking to add risk," JP Morgan's
analysts said.
Prices in high-yield bond market have fallen sharply in
recent months as the turmoil from the U.S. subprime mortgage
crisis has spilled over to other credit markets and as a huge
pipeline of leveraged buyout financing has weighed on sentiment.
According to data from Merrill Lynch, spreads on
euro-denominated high-yield bonds stood at 400 basis points on
Aug. 30, more than double the low of 178 basis points three
months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The iTraxx Crossover index ITCRS5EA=GFI, made up of 50
mostly "junk"-rated credits, has seen enormous volatility,
peaking at over 500 basis points and currently trading around
330 basis points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On average, investors expect the Crossover to widen to as
much as 435 basis points over the rest of the year, with some
forecasting that it could rise to 500 basis points again, JP
Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, while almost 50 percent of investors had previously
forecast that leveraged loans would be the best performing asset
class in 2007, that number has now dropped to 22 percent.
Another 30 percent say high-yield bonds would perform the best,
and 26 percent favoured cash, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, 48 percent of investors say they expect global
default rates to pick up to 2 to 3 percent in 2008, with 26
percent forecasting 3 to 5 percent.

&lt;p&gt;BusinessWeek Online reports Coca-Cola (KO) shares are in favor again. "Coca-Cola is once again on its fast-growth trajectory," says Stephen Leeb of Leeb Capital Management, which owns shares. Its resurgence comes from a huge world distribution edge, notes Leeb, and its aggressive introduction of new products, including juices and sports drinks. It recently introduced kvass, a Russian cereal-based beverage. Some 75% of profits come from outside the U.S., mainly China, India, the European Union, and Latin America. Coke is a play on booming foreign economies and the falling dollar, says Leeb. Although the U.S. remains a weak spot for Coke, he adds, earnings have topped estimates handily because of rapid growth overseas. Yearly sales and earnings growth should again exceed 10%, predicts Leeb, who sees Coke at 75 in 18 months. Value Line assigns Coke its highest ranking for timeliness. The co has determined it must invest more heavily in growth to bolster the share price, says Value Line's Greg McGowan. He sees profits of $2.65 a share in 2007 on sales of $27.5 blnand $2.95 in 2008 on $30.5 bln, vs. 2006's $2.37 on $24 bln.

&lt;p&gt; (For more Reuters columns on deals, click [DEALTALK])&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Khettiya Jittapong and Wilawan Pongpitak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANGKOK Aug 31 (Reuters) - Exxon and Chevron are under
pressure from Thailand's military-appointed government to make
good on a pledge made 15 years ago to float shares in their
local oil refineries in Bangkok next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Esso (Thailand), a unit of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), and
Chevron's (CVX.N) Star Petroleum Refining Co (SPRC) are
expected to submit filings of listing plans by the year-end,
Energy Minister Piyasvasti Amranand said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We want the filings done within this government. They are
trying to postpone until the next government, which will open a
chance for them to keep delaying," Piyasvasti told Reuters
ahead of a general election set for Dec. 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government is trying to lure high-profile companies to
the Bangkok stock market, but many investors are wary about
Thailand after last year's military coup, making firms timid
about jumping into the stock market to raise capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest drive for a listing comes just as global equity
markets are shaken by fears about U.S. subprime lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government thinks the two listings could add up to 60
billion baht ($1.75 billion) to the Thai stock market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We want Thais to own the refineries and it's a condition
that should benefit the stock market by having more good
stocks," Piyasvasti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Listing was a condition of the 1991-92 deals which allowed
Esso and SPRC to build refineries in Thailand. They are the
only two of Thailand's seven refiners which have yet to list.
Failure to do so could mean losing their licence to operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government can terminate the contracts and they won't
have the right to operate a refinery business in Thailand. I
think they're aware of this and are starting to be serious and
speed up the process," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The previous governments did not push on this. Under the
agreement, the energy ministry has to get it done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ESSO IN TALKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many listing plans were derailed when the 1997-98 Asian
financial crisis pulled the plug on demand and put refineries
into debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top refiner Thai Oil (TOP.BK) restructured its debt in 2000
and floated in the country's biggest IPO in 2004, raising $867
million to pay off its creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Esso is still saddled with debt and has piled up
accumulated losses, putting it in breach of listing
requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Piyasvasti said Exxon had given its Thai unit, which runs a
refinery with capacity of 170,000 barrels per day, the go-ahead
to refinance 20 billion baht ($583 million) before going
public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The finance ministry, which owns 12.5 percent of Esso,
would also inject more than 2 billion baht, Piyasvasti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are working with the government. But I can't give any
details now," Esso director Mongkolnimit Auacherdkul said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm has appointed Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Phatra
Securities PHAT.BK to advise on a listing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THOSE DEVILISH DETAILS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SPRC's flotation is embroiled in protracted negotiations
between Chevron, which owns 64 percent, and state-controlled
PTT PCL (PTT.BK), Thailand's top energy firm, which owns the
rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Neither firm wants to list," said a financial source.
"It's normal they don't want to have too many shareholders and
sacrifice some sensitive information for tax benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PTT has stakes in five refineries and wants to dilute its
holding in SPRC to 25 percent. It talked to Chevron about
merging SPRC with its Rayong Refinery RRC.BK, but scrapped
that idea and decided to list Rayong separately in 2006 as
negotiations with Chevron foundered on differences over
details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has said listing SPRC could raise about 20 billion baht.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They talk in preparation to list whenever market sentiment
is favourable," said a banker close to the deal. "It's clear
PTT wants an exit, but that relies on Chevron's decision. The
devil will be in the detail."

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds forecast, acquisition details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Aug 30 (Reuters) - The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) said on Thursday it reached distribution agreements with its bottling partners and Glaceau distributors for its newly acquired Glaceau brands and affirmed its 2007 profit forecast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coca-Cola purchased the maker of vitaminwater and smartwater for $4.1 billion in June in a bid to boost its position in the fast-growing market for noncarbonated drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coca-Cola said it will carry all major package sizes and flavors of each Glaceau brand in most of its U.S. markets beginning Nov. 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coca-Cola bottlers representing 99 percent of Coke's U.S. bottler-delivered volume have signed on to distribute the Glaceau. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Current Glaceau distributors, including Big Geyser, Haralambos, Kalil, John Lenore &amp; Co and Honickman, will also continue distributing the drinks in their territories. Retailers such as club stores and natural food stores may find their deliveries being managed directly by Coca-Cola North America's Glaceau unit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said the purchase of the Glaceau is not expected to have a significant impact on its 2007 results. It affirmed its full-year forecast calling for earnings per diluted common share in a range of $1.27 to $1.32, including the impact of currency and excluding nonrecurring items. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coca-Cola said that beginning in 2008, the Glaceau acquisition will enhance the company's "ability to reach long-term growth objectives." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Lisa Baertlein, editing by Braden Reddall, Leslie Gevirtz; Reuters Messaging: lisa.baertlein.reuters.com@reuters.net; mail to:lisa.baertlein.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 213 955 6742)) Keywords: COCACOLA GLACEAU/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail, comment, background, changes dateline from CHICAGO) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TORONTO Aug 30 (Reuters) - Research in Motion Ltd RIM.TO RIMM.O moved higher on Thursday on renewed market speculation that Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) could be interested in buying the BlackBerry maker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Microsoft has been mentioned as a possible buyer," said Frederic Ruffy, an analyst at options education firm Optionetics in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "According to speculation, the software giant might be interested in RIM in response to Google's (GOOG.O) recent announcement that it is interested in making its own mobile phone operating system, which would compete with Windows Mobile," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    RIM shares were up 3.35 percent at $84.59 in midday trading after posting a new high of $85 on Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Waterloo, Ontario-based company's shares regularly move as much as 5 percent in a single session, even in the absence of news. The Microsoft rumor has surfaced in the past, as well as speculation that Motorola MOT.N could buy the Canadian company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts have heaped upgrades and praise on RIM in recent weeks in wake of strong growth, both in profit and in subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company's ubiquitous BlackBerry smartphones have penetrated the professional market, but have yet to gain the same acceptance among retail consumers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    To change this, RIM has been loading up its devices with multimedia features like music players and cameras. It has also worked with carriers to make them more affordable to individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The push into consumer markets could put RIM on a collision course with Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone. The competition could grow stiffer still if Google launches its own device. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Some option traders appeared to be betting that RIM shares' strength could continue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I've seen the rumors on RIM and there has been interest in the front-month calls, which allow investors to buy RIM shares at $80 all the way to $93.375 apiece," said Rebecca Engmann Darst, an equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers Group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Both RIM and Microsoft declined comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It is RIM's standard policy to not comment on rumors or speculation," a RIM spokeswoman said in an e-mail. A Microsoft spokesperson echoed the statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Among the busiest calls were the September $93.375 series as more than 8,000 lots moved early on Thursday. The odd strike price is due to a recent stock split in RIM, Ruffy said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The heavy trading in these out-of-the-money calls seems to reflect speculative call buying on the view the share price will continue moving higher during the next few weeks," Ruffy said. The September contacts come off the board on Sept. 21. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Jon Najarian, co-founder of Web information site optionmonster.com in Chicago, also noted a rise in RIM's September implied volatility, a measure of the expected magnitude of share price movement conveyed by option prices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    When RIM shares were up 2.25 percent Thursday morning, the at-the-money September implied volatility stood at around 49 percent above its average 44 percent over the past week, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "That indicates there is demand for options but the paper is mixed," he said. "The stock hit a new 52-week high this morning and the shorts were covering their positions. But we don't show any panic buying. The options action is interesting but so far not heavy according to our model." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ((Reporting by Doris Frankel and Wojtek Dabrowski, editing by Ka Yan Ng; E-mail: wojtek.dabrowski@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: wojtek.dabrowski.reuters.com@reuters.net.
