&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) would ask for crude oil from the U.S. emergency Strategic Petroleum Reserve on Tuesday and Shell Oil Co (RDSa.L) was expected to make a similar request, as refiners look to ensure gasoline supplies in the wake of Hurricane Gustav.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I understand they expect to get a request from Exxon tomorrow," Jindal said at a Monday evening news conference. "Shell is likely to make similar request."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon spokeswoman said she could not confirm the company would tap the SPR for oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I cannot confirm these reports at this time," said Premlata Nair. "I will, however, check and get back to you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jindal, a Republican, said he spoke with U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman on Monday about the impact of Gustav on the energy industry in Louisiana and the availability of oil from the SPR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early checks by some U.S. refiners reported no damage from Gustav, which weakened to Category 2 before roaring ashore near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a dozen oil refineries representing about 15 percent of the nation's fuel production capacity were shut as a precaution as the storm neared and another 10 refineries cut production rates, according to company officials, trade sources and a report from the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restarting a refinery can take at least a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve is the 700-million-barrel emergency stockpile of crude oil managed by the U.S. Department of Energy to keep the U.S. economy running in case foreign crude imports are cut off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Shell representative was not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mary Milliken and Erwin Seba; Editing by Kim Coghill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said
production was cut at its 330,000 barrel per day (bpd)
refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi, due to the closure of the
ship channel through which tankers bring crude oil to the
plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Production was expected to return to normal rates after
the ship channel reopens, the company said in a statement. The
channel was expected to reopen once weather from Hurricane
Gustav clears.

&lt;p&gt;The Baton Rouge refinery is the second-largest refinery in the United States, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The refinery reduced production to half-capacity on Sunday due to Gustav and planned to continue operating at that level as long as winds did not exceed 80 mph (129 kph), sources told Reuters on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon confirmed on Sunday that production was cut at the refinery, but did not say at what level the refinery was operating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Exxon did not say when it might begin restarting the Baton Rouge refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bruce Nichols and Erwin Seba, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - A decision to dismiss appeals against the controversial fast-track approval of a Microsoft (MSFT.O) document format has provoked six members of global standards-setting body ISO to question ISO's relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil, India, South Africa and Venezuela -- countries with fast-growing IT markets -- had appealed against ISO's stamp of approval for Microsoft Office Open XML (OOXML), an endorsement likely to help the software giant win more public-sector contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A significant minority of national standards bodies had voted against approving the Microsoft format, which is an alternative to the open-source Open Document Format that has been a published ISO standard since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But ISO, together with the International Electrotechnical Commission, decided earlier this month that those appeals were not worth pursuing -- meaning OOXML will soon become an ISO standard, provided no new appeals are lodged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekend, the state IT organizations of Brazil, South Africa, Venezuela, Ecuador, Cuba and Paraguay published a declaration saying they were no longer confident that ISO would be a vendor-neutral organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whereas in the past it has been assumed that an ISO/IEC standard should automatically be considered for use within government, clearly this position no longer stands," they wrote on the South African representative's site (www.raffee.co.za).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bending of the rules to facilitate the fast-track processing... remains a significant concern to us," they said, referring to a process many parties had complained was too fast and not transparent enough for such a complex format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft lost a first vote on OOXML -- which is opposed by advocates of open-source software that can be freely shared and modified -- but won a second vote after a week-long ballot resolution meeting to discuss the 6,000-page specifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many public bodies prefer to keep documents in formats whose specifications are owned by ISO, to avoid the risk that they will be unable to access their own archives -- or have to pay to do so -- in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISO is a non-governmental organization made up of the national standards of 157 countries. It sprang up in the 1940s in response to demand for standard specifications for materials needed to rebuild the infrastructure of war-shattered countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Georgina Prodhan; editing by Sharon Lindores)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI (Reuters) - Struggling Sony Ericsson (6758.T)(ERICb.ST) ditched on Monday rumors that its first cellphone powered by Microsoft's (MSFT.O) operating system would miss the key Christmas sales period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sony Ericsson introduced the Xperia 1 model in February, saying it would start to sell the phone in the second half of 2008 in selected markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, and over the weekend, several technology blogs and Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter reported of delays in product roll out, quoting rumors and unnamed sources at Sony Ericsson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is absolutely no delay. The product is on track," Sony Ericsson spokeswoman Merran Wrigley said. "We have said it will roll out in Q4 and we are on target to do that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phone makers usually unveil new models months ahead of starting sales -- to inform operators and consumers -- but introducing new phones more than six months ahead of sales is relatively uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Sony Ericsson joining the list of Windows users, all the world's top handset makers apart from Nokia (NOK1V.HE) will have Windows Mobile phones in their offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite years of investments Microsoft has struggled to appeal to mobile users, and has won only around 10 percent market share among smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stiff competition from other platforms -- especially RIM's RIM.TO BlackBerry and Apple's (AAPL.O) iPhone -- have hurt demand for Microsoft-based products, and the U.S. software firm missed its 20 million phone sales target for year to June 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The challenge for manufacturers is that Windows Mobile 6.1 is struggling to meet the high expectations that devices like the iPhone have set for top-tier phones," said Ben Wood, research director at CCS Insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To try and overcome its shortcomings we've seen companies like HTC, Samsung and now Sony Ericsson go to great lengths to re-skin Windows Mobile in order to deliver something that is more appealing to mainstream consumers," Wood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tarmo Virki)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) will slash the price of its Xbox 360 game console in Japan by about 30 percent, below Nintendo Co's 7974.OS Wii and Sony Corp's (6758.T) PlayStation 3 in a bid to boost market share, the Nikkei business daily said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been struggling to stir up demand for its Xbox 360 in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will lower the price of the Xbox 360 Arcade model by 8,000 yen ($73.92) to 19,800 yen, the Nikkei said. The Arcade does not come equipped with a hard drive and is the least expensive of the three Xbox 360 models, the Nikkei said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new price will make that model cheaper than Nintendo's Wii, which sells for about 25,000 yen, and the PlayStation 3, which sells for 39,800 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will also reduce the price of two higher models with hard drives by 5,000-8,000 yen, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Xbox spokeswoman Kazumi Ishiyama in Japan declined to comment on the Nikkei report. The company is scheduled to hold a briefing on the Xbox 360 in the Japanese market at 3:00 p.m. (2:00 a.m. EDT) on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox 360 has lagged its Japanese rivals on their home turf, with 684,695 units sold so far in Japan against Wii's 6.67 million and PS3's 2.32 million, according to game magazine publisher Enterbrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox 360, however, beat the PS3 in Japan weekly sales for the first time in the week ended August 10, on robust demand for Namco Bandai Holdings' (7832.T) recent "Tales of Vesperia" role-playing game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recently cut the price of its best-selling Xbox 360 Pro model game console with a 20 gigabyte hard drive to $299 from $349 in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong global sales of Wii led Nintendo to revise up its earnings forecasts for the six months to September and full year to March 2009 on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nathan Layne and Sachi Izumi; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with announcement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Sachi Izumi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said it
will slash the price of its Xbox 360 game consoles in Japan by up
to 29 percent, below Nintendo Co's 7974.OS Wii and Sony Corp's
(6758.T) PlayStation 3, in a bid to jump-start its sluggish
sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demand for the Xbox 360 has been tepid in Japan, mainly due
to a lack of popular games. In contrast, the market-leading Wii
is thriving on a range of innovative software, prompting Nintendo
to raise its earning forecast on Friday. [ID:nT97826]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It has not gone entirely smoothly," Takashi Sensui, general
manager of Microsoft's home and entertainment division in Japan,
said of the Xbox's performance since its launch three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are some analysts who say they are waiting for the
next generation of the Xbox," he said, adding that Microsoft took
a different view. "We will keep trying to be at the centre of the
storm in the Japanese market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But analysts said that to compete successfully, lower prices
were not enough and Microsoft would need to launch blockbuster
games to rival the Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft will cut the price of the Xbox 360 Arcade, which
comes without a hard drive and is the cheapest of the three Xbox
360 models, by 8,000 yen ($73.92) to 19,800 yen from Sept. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would make the Arcade cheaper than Nintendo's Wii, which
sells for about 25,000 yen, and the PlayStation 3, which sells
for 39,800 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft will also cut the price of the high-end Elite model
by 8,000 yen to 39,800 yen. It will upgrade the standard model's
hard-disk drive to 60 gigabyte from previously 20 gigabyte, and
sell it for 29,800 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before the upgrade, that model sold for 34,800 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BETTER GAMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has already cut the price of the Xbox 360 in the
United States, Europe and four Asian markets as it tries to bite
off a larger chunk of the $57 billion game industry. In Europe,
the Xbox 360 Arcade costs less than the Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KBC Securities analyst Hiroshi Kamide said price cuts alone
are unlikely to trigger a jump in demand for the Xbox 360 and
Microsoft needs to focus more on producing attractive software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Popular software is now serving as a tail wind to Xbox
sales," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even if they slash the console price, that would not
directly boost sales unless they release more good software," he
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robust demand for Namco Bandai Holdings' (7832.T) "Tales of
Vesperia" role-playing game helped Xbox 360 sales in Japan beat
the PS3 for the first time in the week ended Aug. 10.
[ID:nT236852]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wii's success has been attributed to inventive titles
such as the "Wii Fit" exercise game, its low price and its
easy-to-learn motion-sensing controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wii has sold 6.67 million units so far in Japan, nearly
triple the PS3's 2.32 million, according to game magazine
publisher Enterbrain. The Xbox has sold only 684,695 units even
though it was launched about a year earlier in December 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also announced on Monday it would launch
Xbox-exclusive action game "Ninja Blade", developed by
FromSoftware Inc, in early 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sony shares fell 2.4 percent to close at 4,140 yen after a
local newspaper reported the price cut in the morning. Nintendo
gained 3.7 percent to 53,700 yen, propelled by the outlook
revision. The Nikkei average .N225 was down 1.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Microsoft were down 2.3 percent at $27.29 as of
0856 GMT.

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif., &amp; PERTH, Australia--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) subsidiary Chevron Australia Pty
Ltd today announced first gas from the North West Shelf Venture's
Train 5 onshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility at the Karratha
Gas Plant in Western Australia.

   The US $2.1 billion (Aus $2.6 billion) new Train 5 production
facility is now online and is expected to increase the joint venture's
export capacity by up to 4.4 million tonnes of LNG annually to 16.3
million tonnes.

   President of Chevron's Asia Pacific Exploration and Production
Company, Jim Blackwell, said, "The North West Shelf Project is one of
the largest in the world. The addition of a fifth LNG train
demonstrates Chevron's commitment to expanding its global natural gas
business. LNG continues to be a major focus of Chevron's gas
commercialization strategy. Over the next decade, we expect natural
gas production to grow as a proportion of Chevron's total production,"
said Blackwell.

   Roy Krzywosinski, Managing Director of Chevron Australia, added,
"Chevron continues to make significant multi-million dollar
investments to expand our Australian operations. We are proud to be a
part of the North West Shelf Venture that has played an important role

jetty extension and second LNG loading berth, two additional power
generation units, a third LPG fractionation unit, a new fuel gas
compressor, an acid gas removal unit and a third boil off gas
compressor.

   Chevron holds a one-sixth interest in the joint venture. In

other North West Shelf venture participants also holding a one-sixth
interest are: BHP Billiton (North West Shelf) Pty Ltd., BP
Developments Australia Pty Ltd., Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty Ltd.,
Shell Development (Australia) Proprietary Ltd., and Operator Woodside
Energy Ltd. CNOOC NWS Private Limited is also part of the venture but
does not have an interest in its infrastructure.

Australia for more than 50 years. It operates the planned Gorgon and
Wheatstone Projects, the Barrow Island and Thevenard Island oilfields
and is a foundation partner in the North West Shelf Venture (natural
gas, crude oil and condensate) and in the Browse LNG development.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Global MA volumes were down 32
percent so far this year, Thomson Reuters Corp (TRI.TO) data for
August showed, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) topped
league tables as the world's largest dealmaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Syndicated loans issuance dropped 47 percent compared with
the same period a year before, while debt and equity issuance
dropped 35 and 36 percent respectively -- though last week was
the busiest for euro-denominated bonds from non-financials since
November 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Large euro-denominated issues from E.ON AG (EONGn.DE),
Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) and Daimler Chrysler AG
(DAIGn.DE) contributed to the increased debt volume during the
last week of August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The data underscore how badly investment banking is being
hit by the credit crisis, as access to leveraged finance has
shut for private equity firms -- a major driving force of deals
last year -- and corporate buyers have become more cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one particularly telling example, the volume of withdrawn
initial public offerings (IPOs) so far this year already exceeds
the full-year level of pulled flotations in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan (JPM.N) consistently topped league tables for
capital markets, coming first in syndicated loans, equity
capital markets as well as debt capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Benefiting from the weaker dollar, European companies
scooped up more rivals in the United States than last year, with
hostile deals reaching $82.1 billion, the highest level since
1999 when the number stood at $100.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top deals include the acquisition of Genetech DNA.N by
Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX), NRG Energy Inc's
(NRG.N) offer for Calpine Corp (CPN.N) and the proposed
acquisition of Alpharma Inc ALO.N by King Pharmaceuticals Inc
KG.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chinese companies bulked up in Europe, being responsible for
14.4 percent of all deals in which a European company was
approached, up from only 2 percent a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall acquisitions from so-called BRIC countries --
Brazil, Russia, India and China -- were also on the up,
accounting for 9 percent of overall deal volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The data also showed the trend of the dollar's diminishing
importance of debt issuance, with the euro gaining in
importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only 40.3 percent of investment-grade debt was issued in
dollars so far this year, down 4 percent from the full-year 2007
and a full 14.2 percent lower than in 1999.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's largest bank Popular
Inc (BPOP.O) said it will sell the loan and servicing assets of
its U.S. mortgage unit worth $1.17 billion to Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) to improve liquidity and reduce risky assets, sending
its shares up as much as 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The transaction, expected to close in the fourth quarter,
will provide more than $700 million in additional liquidity and
significantly reduce its U.S. sub-prime assets, Popular, the
parent of Banco Popular, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Popular expects a loss of about $450 million related to the
transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This sale probably gets rid of most of the remaining
sub-prime assets form the mainland and from their subsidiary
(Popular Financial Holdings)," Joseph Gladue, analyst with B.
Riley  Co, said by phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are continuing to narrow the scope of our mainland U.S.
operations that are most exposed to the credit and mortgage
markets, by leveraging on our core strengths in Puerto Rico,"
Popular Chief Executive Richard Carrion said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Gladue said he expects the company to sell some of
its banking assets also but feels it will be some time before
Popular gets a fair price for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Puerto Rico and the United States have been struggling
with weak economies, which have caused credit losses to rise
among consumer and business borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company operates more than 300 banking offices in
Puerto Rico and 140 branches in six U.S. states, including
California and Florida, which have been hit hard by the turmoil
in the housing and mortgage markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Popular had showed interest in selling U.S. operations in
July when it reported its quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In January, the San Juan-based company agreed to sell much
of its U.S. consumer finance business Equity One to a unit of
American International Group Inc (AIG.N) for about $1.5

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company announced today its intention to make cash
offers to purchase China Huiyuan Juice Group Limited, a Hong Kong
listed company which owns the Huiyuan juice business throughout China.

   The Coca-Cola business in China has been operating since 1979 and
is well known for its sparkling beverage brands such as Coca-Cola,
Sprite and Fanta. In the last few years, the Company has also
introduced a number of still beverage brands, including Guo Li Chen
(Minute Maid Pulpy) and Yuan Ye (Original Leaf Tea), with the
objective of offering consumers a wide range of beverage choices. In
line with this, the Company is seeking to further develop its beverage
business through this acquisition.

   "Huiyuan is a long-established and successful juice brand in China
and is highly complementary to the Coca-Cola China business," said
Muhtar Kent, President and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company.

   "This acquisition will deliver value to our shareholders and
provide a unique opportunity to strengthen our business in China,
especially since the juice segment is so dynamic and fast growing in
China. It is also further evidence of our deep commitment to China and
to providing Chinese consumers with the beverage choices that meet
their needs," Mr Kent said.

   If successful with the offers, the Company will use its expertise
as a global beverage company to further develop the Huiyuan brand to
address the evolving needs of consumers. There are anticipated
synergies that will drive operational efficiencies, particularly in
the Huiyuan business' production footprint and in Coca-Cola's
distribution and raw material purchasing capabilities.

   The making of the offers is subject to preconditions relating to
Chinese regulatory approvals.

   The Coca-Cola Company intends that the Huiyuan business will
continue to carry on its business, while reviewing its operations and
synergies over time.

   "I am very pleased that the current Chairman of the Huiyuan
business, Mr Zhu, has agreed to take up the role as Honorary Chairman.
Both the Huiyuan business and The Coca-Cola Company will benefit from
his deep understanding of the beverage business in China, as well as
his on-going experience and advice," Mr Kent said. "We are strongly
committed to building on the Huiyuan business' current brand,
improving the utilization of its fixed assets and enhancing
opportunities for employees of the Huiyuan business."

   The Coca-Cola Company is offering HK$12.20 per share, and an
equivalent price for outstanding convertible bonds and options.

   The Company has accepted irrevocable undertakings from three
shareholders for acceptance of the offers, in aggregate representing
approximately 66 percent of the Huiyuan shares.

   Assuming full acceptance of the offers, the deal is valued at
approximately US$2.4billion. The transaction is expected to be
dilutive to the Company's earnings per share by $0.03 to $0.04 in the
first full year following completion of the acquisition and accretive
to earnings per share in year 3 after completion.

   The Company now expects to repurchase a total of $1 billion of its
stock for the full year.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today introduced open software tools, industry-specific
data models and blueprints, and consulting services to help clients use
information as a strategic asset across their businesses. This is the
industry's first complete set of offerings to manage information across
an enterprise -- independent of the specific software applications or
business processes used to create it.

    With the increasing pace of business driven by trends such as
globalization and mergers and acquisitions, clients are recognizing that
information has become one of their most important assets for sustaining
a competitive advantage. Using IBM's new open software tools,
industry-specific data models, blueprints and consulting services, they
can establish a cross-company strategy for using their information more
effectively -- creating an "information agenda" that drives business
performance.

    By creating and following an Information Agenda for their business,
clients can better manage, integrate and draw insight from increasing
volumes of business data to improve overall performance. The new IBM
offerings help businesses transform their existing information into a
trusted asset that can be used across all applications and processes in
their company. Taking this first step can create a more unified approach
to accessing and using information on demand.

    While most businesses today have a strategy to guide their business
processes and applications, the information that supports their processes
is often not shared across their organization. Access to information has
been restricted because data has been tightly associated with the
applications for which it was created, leading to a lack of new insights
for better decision making and business performance. In effect, businesses
don't have a cohesive, industry-specific strategy to take advantage of
their information.

    To address this, IBM's new software tools, industry-based assets and
business consulting services focus on 18 key industries. Key
components
include:


--  An open set of new IBM Foundation software tools to help clients
discover and understand the information they have and govern it over time.

--  Industry-specific Information Agenda guides and workshops to help
create an information strategy and roadmap for better business performance.

--  Industry Accelerators such as data models and assets to improve
business performance, reduce risk and deliver results more quickly. 

--  Information on Demand Competency Centers to help clients build internal
expertise and skills to facilitate business transformation.

    
"In order for businesses to take their information to the next level
and accelerate the journey to using information on demand, they need a
cross-company information strategy," said Ambuj Goyal, general manager,
Information Management, IBM. "IBM is responding to this need by helping
businesses create an Information Agenda for their specific industry. This
will allow them to transform data into a strategic asset that can be used
across applications and processes to enable better decisions for sustained
competitive advantage."

    IBM Open Tools, Models and Blueprints Help Eliminate Information Barriers

    IBM has created new open tools that help businesses identify which
information is important; how to make information available to the people
and applications that need it; the technology required to manage
information; and the governance and processes needed to put an information
management plan into action. For each industry, IBM is providing a suite
of consulting services, software and industry guides to address that
sector's critical business challenges.

    Irish Life and Permanent, a leading provider of financial services in the
Irish market, faced the challenge of integrating several acquired
businesses into its portfolio and expanding its growth in a market in
which it already had leadership. To help improve its business
performance, the company decided to make a strategic shift away from a
product focus to growth based on customer service and loyalty. Among the
first steps it took was to establish an Information Agenda, which brought
together leaders from business and IT to determine how to best use
company information to service clients and create new business
opportunities.

    Starting with a series of incremental projects, each which addressed its
Information Agenda, Irish Life and Permanent moved toward a single view of
all its customer information. As a result, it can now tailor products and
services for clients across multiple touch points such as the Internet,
call-centers and various sales channels; create more effective targeted
sales campaigns; improve customer self-service; and maintain continuous
records of customer transactions and service satisfaction across the
business.

    "Now that we manage our customer information as an asset, the
opportunities for innovation and optimization are endless," said Noel
Garry, executive manager, Irish Life. "We can respond to the dynamics of
our business twice as fast."

    The 18 industries IBM is covering with its new offerings are aerospace and
defense; automotive; banking; chemical and petroleum; consumer products;
electronics; energy and utilities; federal government; health care payers;
healthcare providers; industrial products; insurance; media and
entertainment; pharmaceuticals; retail; state and local government;
telecommunications and travel and transportation.

    Managing an Information Agenda

    To help clients establish an Information Agenda, IBM has invested in
tools, assets and industry-based data models to help them understand and
accelerate enterprise access to information; govern it as a strategic
business asset; and design information structures to improve business
performance. These tools and techniques work with any server, database and
infrastructure to make business information easier to manage and use.

    Michelin, a global leader in tire manufacturing with a commercial presence
in more than 170 countries and over 110,000 employees, faces the challenge
of managing a huge volume of information generated from the enterprise.
Michelin deployed IBM's Information Server and Master Data Management
offerings to streamline customer database systems to provide an improved,
360 degree view of client information.

    "Because Michelin deals with so many parties in its supply chain --

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment from Potash Corp spokesman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Potash Corp of
Saskatchewan (POT.TO) has warned North American customers that
a strike at three of its mines may affect deliveries, an
analyst at JP Morgan said in an alert to clients on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst David Silver said fertilizer consultancy British
Sulphur has reported that Potash Corp told its domestic
customers that the strike, which began Aug. 7, will affect
delivery schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Global potash markets are already exceptionally tight, and
the strike further limits supply," Silver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Potash Corp declined to comment directly on
the report, saying the company is discussing its contractual
obligations with customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We view our obligations to our customers, both domestic
and international, as proprietary, and at this point, we're not
discussing them publicly," Bill Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Potash Corp shares were down 4 percent at C$177.50 on the
Toronto Stock Exchange amid a broad downturn in commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 500 workers represented by the United Steelworkers
union are on strike at three of the company's mines, which
account for about 30 percent of Potash Corp production and
about 6 percent of world supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were no talks scheduled, Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has said the strike has affected industrial
customers, accounting for about 5 percent of sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As far as the rest of our customers are concerned, it
remains early days in this strike, and we're still assessing
the impact it will have on the ability to meet our commitments
in the original timeframe," Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strike started during a seasonal lull in fertilizer
shipments, but analysts have said it could boost world prices
if it lasts past mid-September, when demand picks up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As (the strike) goes on, it will certainly remove some
supply from the system," Johnson said. "It's a tight market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Potash Corp restarted the largest of the three mines last
week, but has not said how much volume it hoped to produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Silver said the company could restore about half
the Allan mine's production, but unless the strike ends, it may
soon have to declare force majeure on contracts it can't fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=$1.07 Canadian)

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said on
Tuesday no time has been set for the restart of its 503,000
barrel per day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery, which was
shut by Hurricane Gustav.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon spokeswoman Premlata Nair and Exxon Baton Rouge
refinery spokesman George Pietrogallo both said the refinery was
doing preliminary checks of the refinery and adjoining chemical
plant complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Baton Rouge is conducting a preliminary site assessment to
determine the impact of Gustav," she wrote in an email. "We are
assessing restart options, but are unable to provide a restart
schedule at this time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Baton Rouge refinery had to shut down Monday due to an
electrical power failure caused by high winds as Hurricane
Gustav passed over Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Entergy Corp said more than 160,600 homes and businesses in
East Baton Rouge Parish were without power early Tuesday.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said on
Tuesday it was in touch with the U.S. Department of Energy on
oil supply options in the wake of Hurricane Gustav, including a
potential release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We remain in close communication with the DOE. As we assess
the impact of Hurricane Gustav we continue to evaluate our
supply options," a spokeswoman for the company told Reuters in
an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gustav caused Exxon Mobil to shut in oil production from its
Gulf of Mexico fields, and also led it to slow down refinery
operations along the coast.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 2 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Ann
Duignan initiated coverage of mining-equipment makers Bucyrus
International Inc BUCY.O and Joy Global Inc JOYG.O with a
"neutral" rating, and said uncertainty in the global economy
overshadowed the recent strength in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Duignan said even though a global slowdown would not likely
have an immediate impact on 2009 earnings, the group would
remain volatile for as long as the risks of a slowdown exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said both Bucyrus and Joy Global have 70
percent of their revenue leveraged to the coal industry. "The
global economy is spluttering... Overall, the net impact could
result in lower global coal consumption and a potential for
coal production to decline," Duignan wrote in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said the acquisition of DBT GmbH should give
Bucyrus opportunities to expand margins, which could support
earnings. Duignan said Joy Global had limited margin-expansion
potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bucyrus's shares were trading down more than 11 percent at
$62.03, while shares of Joy Global were trading down 6 percent
at $66.56 Tuesday morning on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 2 (Reuters) - JP Morgan cut its rating on offshore
drilling contractor Ensco International Inc (ESV.N) to
"underweight" from "neutral," citing few positive catalysts
against a backdrop of growing pressure on international jackup
rates and peaking U.S. Gulf jackup rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While international jackup rates appear to have stabilized
recently, we believe the longer decline trend remains intact,"
analyst David Smith said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were few positive near-term catalysts for Ensco, in
contrast to its peers, said Smith. He expects little
incremental data from the company's deepwater construction
program in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith also questioned Ensco's share buyback program, saying
it was unlikely that the company had better long-term view of
the jackup market than the investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Using peak cash flows to repurchase shares does not favor
the long-term shareholder," said Smith, whose earnings estimate
for Ensco's third quarter is $2.17 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the Dallas-based Ensco fell more than 6 percent
to $63.52 in early morning trade Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (Reporting by Arup Roychoudhury in Bangalore)

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects headline and lead and inserts clarification in
paragraph 5 to show that the state IT bodies questioning ISO's
relevance are not ISO members)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - A decision to dismiss appeals
against the controversial fast-track approval of a Microsoft
(MSFT.O) document format has provoked six national IT bodies to
question the relevance of global standards-setting body ISO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brazil, India, South Africa and Venezuela -- countries with
fast-growing IT markets -- had appealed against ISO's stamp of
approval for Microsoft Office Open XML, an endorsement likely to
help the software giant win more public-sector contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A significant minority of national standards bodies had
voted against approving the Microsoft format, which is an
alternative to the open-source Open Document Format that has
been a published ISO standard since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But ISO, together with the International Electrotechnical
Commission, decided last month that those appeals were not worth
pursuing -- meaning OOXML will soon become an ISO standard,
provided no new appeals are lodged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This weekend, state IT organisations of Brazil, South
Africa, Venezuela, Ecuador, Cuba and Paraguay -- which are not
the standards-setting bodies of those countries that belong to
ISO -- published a declaration saying they were no longer
confident that ISO would be a vendor-neutral organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Whereas in the past it has been assumed that an ISO/IEC
standard should automatically be considered for use within
government, clearly this position no longer stands," they wrote
on the South African representative's site (www.raffee.co.za).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The bending of the rules to facilitate the fast-track
processing of DIS29500 remains a significant concern to us,"
they said, referring to a process many parties had complained
was too fast and intransparent for such a complex format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft lost a first vote on OOXML -- which is opposed by
advocates of open-source software that can be freely shared and
modified -- but won a second vote after a week-long ballot
resolution meeting to discuss the 6,000-page specifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many public bodies prefer to keep documents in formats whose
specifications are owned by ISO, to avoid the risk that they
will be unable to access their own archives -- or have to pay to
do so -- in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ISO is a non-governmental organisation made up of the
national standards of 157 countries. It sprang up in the 1940s
in response to demand for standard specifications for materials
needed to rebuild the infrastructure of war-shattered countries.

&lt;p&gt;OneServer Virtual Edition Uses Hyper-V to Reduce Hardware
     Requirements and Simplify High Availability/Disaster Recovery
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
Azaleos(R) Corporation, the managed Microsoft Exchange services
company, today announced that its award winning OneServer(TM) Virtual
Edition product now also supports Microsoft Hyper-V Server for
virtualization of Microsoft Exchange e-mail servers. The immediate
availability of Hyper-V support combined with existing support for
VMware ESX, allows customers to choose either virtualization platform,
or a physical server option, for their Exchange infrastructure with
Azaleos OneStop(TM) Services.

   Azaleos OneStop remotely managed services enable organizations to
maintain an on-premise deployment of Exchange, while off-loading
monitoring and administration to professionals in the Azaleos network
operations center.

   "Exchange Server 2007, and its multiple roles, requires
organizations to deploy several hardware servers to take advantage of
its full capabilities," said Michael Osterman, President, Osterman
Research. "Hyper-V Server allows organizations to reduce hardware
costs, lower their power consumption, and streamline high availability
and disaster recovery configurations for Exchange using virtualization
technology that is fully supported by Microsoft."

   Since Microsoft Exchange Server typically does not require the
full processing capabilities of an entire server, it is ideally suited
for virtualization where its needs can be combined with other
workloads. Although virtualization of Exchange can be used to
consolidate server and storage resources, simplify administration, as
well as streamline high availability and disaster recovery - it is not
appropriate for all environments. Azaleos has published a free
whitepaper that outlines the benefits, challenges, and disadvantages
of deploying Exchange on a virtual machine.

   The "Virtualizing Exchange" whitepaper is available at:
http://www.azaleos.com/request_download.html?id=42.

   Azaleos OneServer Virtual Edition now provides support for the
leading virtualization platforms - Microsoft Hyper-V Server and VMware
ESX server. Customers can choose either alternative based on their
needs, preferences, or existing investments. OneServer Virtual Edition
is an all-in-one service endpoint that integrates an optimized
operating system and application software components to deliver highly
available, scalable, and reliable Microsoft Exchange e-mail for
today's enterprises. It enables organizations to reduce from four to
two the number of physical servers normally required for a highly
available Exchange configuration.

   "In our tests with Exchange Server, Microsoft Hyper-V Server
performed on par with the much more mature VMware ESX Server, which is
impressive," said Scott Gode, Vice President of Product Management for
Azaleos. "Adding support for Hyper-V to our OneServer portfolio allows
customers to choose from a broader set of virtual and physical
platform options for our OneStop services based on their technical and
financial needs."

   Azaleos OneStop Managed Services

   OneStop Managed Services available on OneServer Virtual Edition
include:

   --  ViewXchange, a real-time monitoring and reporting system for
        Exchange and its associated IT infrastructure.

   --  ManageXchange, a remote command and control service that
        allows Azaleos technicians to monitor, manage, patch,
        troubleshoot and fix issues in a customer's Exchange
        environment on a 24x7 basis.

   --  MobileXchange, a turnkey mobile device management and
        monitoring solution for the Blackberry Enterprise Server (BES)
        that can be rapidly deployed to provide remotely managed 24x7
        services.

   --  ProtectXchange, a comprehensive anti-virus/anti-spam service
        powered by MessageLabs that prevents threats from penetrating
        the network and safeguards data from malicious interference.

   --  RestoreXchange, a complete dual-site disaster recovery service
        that handles both dial tone and mail storage restoration to
        minimize the impact on employee productivity and business
        continuity.

   --  ArchiveXchange, an automatic archival and storage service that
        moves e-mail from the Exchange server to secondary storage to
        improve performance and reduce costs. ArchiveXchange enables
        users to access older mail using Outlook, web browsers, or
        mobile devices.

&lt;p&gt;  BANGKOK, THAILAND, Sep 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
ITU Telecom Asia -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced today an intelligent blade
server designed to help reduce security threats -- such as Denial of
Service (DoS) attacks and viruses -- while helping server providers
better manage network traffic for optimal performance.

    Consumers are using advanced communications like streaming video on hand
held devices, but they want them to be virus-free and fast. This creates a
challenge for service providers. The number of high-severity computer
vulnerabilities increased by 28 percent in the first half of 2008 over the
previous year -- the first such increase since 2004, according to IBM
X-Force(R) research (1). The new IBM blade can help reduce this threat by
performing real-time analysis of network activity so malicious traffic can
be diverted.

    The IBM blade can also help telecommunications carriers better manage and
prioritize network activity like video sharing and Web traffic for maximum
performance, minimizing end-user delays.

    The IBM BladeCenter(R) PN41 is the first blade in the industry to support
Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology from CloudShield(R), an
industry-leading network services management and security provider. The
IBM BladeCenter PN41 more deeply examines the "packets" of data streaming
across the Internet or corporate networks so they can be routed for
maximum performance while helping prevent security threats.

    "IBM continues to offer the broadest portfolio of blade servers in the
industry. The IBM BladeCenter PN41 enables service providers to manage
their network, security and telecommunications technology on a integrated
platform -- IBM BladeCenter," said Jim Pertzborn, vice president of
telecommunications industry solutions for IBM Systems Group. "This
integration can help service providers meet their customers' evolving
requirements for data, voice and video services from anywhere, at anytime
and over any device."

    The new blade becomes a key component of the IBM Telecom Integrated
Solution for Security, an integrated hardware, software and services
framework that allows communications service providers to deliver
carrier-grade network services that can divert malicious traffic. In
addition to BladeCenter, the key components of the Telecom Integrated
Solution for Security include IBM Proventia Intrusion Prevention and IBM
Tivoli Security Operations Manager along with hardware and software from
IBM Business Partners.

    "The IBM BladeCenter PN41 was specifically developed in response to demand
from service providers that want datacenter economics applied to network
services," said Matt Jones, CEO, CloudShield. "Now service providers have
a carrier-class, high-performance blade for consolidating network
appliances in the IBM BladeCenter."

    IBM is working to develop an ecosystem for the IBM BladeCenter PN41 that
can, for the first time, allow service providers to select from a
portfolio of Business Partners and providers when assembling the best
technology solutions for their businesses. As has been typical in
enterprise datacenter deployments, carriers can now select hardware,
software and services from multiple vendors.

    For example, in addition to its work with CloudShield to develop the IBM
BladeCenter PN41, IBM is working with CloudShield to support the company's
software applications on the new blade. In fact, it's the only blade in
the industry to support CloudShield's Subscriber Services Manager (SSM),
DNS Defender applications and its open development environment.

    The IBM BladeCenter PN41 also supports applications from Check Point
Software. "Running Check Point solutions on the IBM BladeCenter with the
PN41 blade provides an excellent platform for substantially accelerating
security performance," said Michael Anderson, head of America security
services at Check Point. "By combining IBM hardware with Check Point
acceleration technologies such as SecureXL and CoreXL, high-end carriers
and data centers can increase the number of customer connections they can
handle."

    IBM Global Services plans to provide support and services for IBM
BladeCenter PN41 customers.

    The new IBM blade can run in one of two high-speed IBM BladeCenter chassis
often used in enterprise datacenters, telecommunications central offices
or government environments. These chassis have been successful in the
marketplace because they address both IT and high-speed networking
requirements, allowing clients to support Next-Generation Network (NGN)
applications like video sharing and social networks.

    IBM and CloudShield are both members of blade.org, an industry consortium
driving open innovation in blade-based solutions. Blade.org helps members
like CloudShield and IBM come together to collaborate on innovative new
technologies based on the open BladeCenter architecture.

    IBM is one of the world's leading providers of risk and security
solutions. Clients around the world work with IBM to help reduce the
complexities of security and strategically manage risk. IBM provides a
range of risk and security solutions -- from dedicated research,
software, hardware, services and global business partner value -- to help
clients secure their business operations and implement company-wide,
integrated risk management programs. For more information, please visit

    Availability

    The new IBM BladeCenter PN41 blade will be generally available worldwide
in October 2008. The IBM BladeCenter PN41 is available either direct from
IBM or through IBM Business Partners.

&lt;p&gt;Lipitor 80 mg Provided Sustained Risk Reduction of Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Heart Disease During the Five-Year TNT Trial

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer announced that in patients with established heart disease, Lipitor(R)
(atorvastatin calcium) 80 mg not only significantly reduced the relative risk of
suffering a first cardiovascular event by 19 percent compared to Lipitor 10 mg
but also provided a sustained reduction in the risk of a subsequent second,
third, fourth, and fifth cardiovascular event, according to a subanalysis of the
five-year Treating to New Targets (TNT) study.

This subanalysis, designed and completed following the closure of the TNT study,
was presented at the 2008 European Society of Cardiology Congress in Munich,
Germany.

"The original TNT trial, as with most cardiovascular outcome trials, only
evaluated the time to a patient's first cardiovascular event and therefore may
not have fully accounted for the total clinical benefits achieved by intensive
LDL-cholesterol lowering," said Dr. John LaRosa, president and professor of
medicine at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center in
Brooklyn, New York, and a member of the TNT steering committee. "This
subanalysis is important because patients with heart disease often go on to
suffer more than one cardiovascular event."

Any cardiovascular event, which was chosen as the endpoint for this post-hoc
subanalysis, was defined as death from heart disease, non-fatal heart attack,
resuscitated cardiac arrest, certain types of heart surgery, procedure-related
heart attack, chest pain, fatal or non-fatal stroke, peripheral arterial disease
or hospitalization due to chronic heart failure.

"These findings suggest that patients can benefit from long-term therapy with
high dose Lipitor," continued Dr. LaRosa.

In this subanalysis of the TNT study, evaluating patients with established heart
disease (n=10,001), compared to Lipitor 10 mg, Lipitor 80 mg demonstrated:

    --  19 percent significant relative risk reduction in a first cardiovascular
        event (n=3,082);

    --  21 percent significant relative risk reduction in a subsequent second
        cardiovascular event (n=1,516);

    --  24 percent significant relative risk reduction in a subsequent third
        cardiovascular event (n=698);

    --  28 percent significant relative risk reduction in a subsequent fourth
        cardiovascular event (n=345);

    --  29 percent significant relative risk reduction in a subsequent fifth
        cardiovascular event (n=197).

"Although the original TNT study was not designed to look at subsequent
cardiovascular events, these results are compelling and suggestive of sustained
benefit with Lipitor 80 mg compared with Lipitor 10 mg in patients with heart
disease," said Dr. Rochelle Chaiken, vice president of Pfizer's global
cardiovascular and metabolic medical team.

About the TNT Study

The TNT study was an investigator-led trial coordinated by an independent
steering committee and funded by Pfizer. The study enrolled 10,001 men and women
with coronary heart disease aged 35 years to 75 years in 14 countries and
followed them for an average of five years. Primary study results were published
in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2005.

The primary endpoint of the original TNT study was the occurrence of a first
major cardiovascular event, defined as death from heart disease, non-fatal heart
attacks, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or fatal or non-fatal strokes.

In contrast, the endpoint for this subanalysis was any cardiovascular event,
defined as death from heart disease, non-fatal heart attack, resuscitated
cardiac arrest, certain types of heart surgery, procedure-related heart attack,
chest pain, fatal or non-fatal stroke, peripheral arterial disease or
hospitalization due to chronic heart failure.

Lipitor 80 mg is not a starting dose. Lipitor is not approved in all countries
to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with existing heart
disease.

Important U.S. Prescribing Information

Lipitor is a prescription medication. It is used in patients with multiple risk
factors for heart disease such as family history, high blood pressure, age, low
HDL ("good" cholesterol) or smoking to reduce the risk of a heart attack and
stroke, certain kinds of heart surgery and chest pain.

Lipitor is also used in patients with type 2 diabetes and at least one other
risk factor for heart disease such as high blood pressure, smoking or
complications of diabetes, including eye disease and protein in urine, to reduce
the risk of heart attack and stroke.

Lipitor is used in patients with existing coronary heart disease to reduce the
risk of heart attack, stroke, certain kinds of heart surgery, hospitalization
for heart failure, and chest pain.

When diet and exercise alone are not enough, Lipitor is used along with a
low-fat diet and exercise to lower cholesterol.

Lipitor is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is
not for women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant.

Patients taking Lipitor should tell their doctors if they feel any new muscle
pain or weakness. This could be a sign of rare but serious muscle side effects.
Patients should tell their doctors about all medications they take. This may
help avoid serious drug interactions. Doctors should do blood tests to check
liver function before and during treatment and may adjust the dose. The most
common side effects are gas, constipation, stomach pain and heartburn. They tend
to be mild and often go away.

&lt;p&gt;CloudShield(R) Announces Applications for the IBM Blade Center Built on an Open Development Platform

   Applications for the IBM BladeCenter PN41 blade provide security
                        and services management
BANGKOK, Thailand--(Business Wire)--
CloudShield Technologies, Inc., a leading provider of services
management and infrastructure security solutions, today announces
support for its DNS Defender and Subscriber Services Manager (SSM)
applications on the new IBM BladeCenter PN41 blade. The combination
gives service providers and national governments a comprehensive
platform to protect networks from attacks, launch new services, manage
network bandwidth and mitigate traffic congestion with a single blade.

   "We have seen some of the most aggressive DNS attacks occur during
the past few months and expect this behavior to continue. Service
providers continually strive to improve security and subscriber
services by effectively managing the increased demands on network
bandwidth," said Matt Jones, president and CEO at CloudShield.
"Protecting networks, retaining customers and deploying new services
are crucial to the success of the industry. Our applications can be
flexibly deployed to meet the needs of any carrier infrastructure and
help enable today's converged IP networks."

   CloudShield's DNS Defender application will run on IBM's
BladeCenter PN41 blade. The software provides protection against DNS
attacks and can reduce the number of DNS servers while improving the
overall performance of the network. By eliminating the need for
firewalls, load balancers and additional servers, DNS Defender
provides carriers with a significant CAPEX and OPEX cost savings.

   CloudShield's SSM is an enhanced solution for properly managing
network traffic. Service provider networks need to have the ability to
deliver latency sensitive applications such as VoIP and IPTV, without
interruption. SSM gives carriers a better understanding of network
traffic congestion, helping to deliver higher standards of customer
satisfaction.

   "In order to stay competitive, service providers need to increase
revenues from new services offered to customers. New security attack
methods and increased network traffic pose a significant challenge to
those objectives," said Jim Pertzborn, vice president,
Telecommunications Industry for IBM Systems and Technology Group. "The
IBM BladeCenter PN41 deep-packet inspection blade, combined with
CloudShield's applications, gives service providers the most scalable,
feature-rich platform on the market today in order to gain that
competitive edge."

   CloudShield's PacketWorks is the open development environment that
enables rapid application development. It allows developers to build
sophisticated security and service control applications four times
faster than using other approaches. This open environment streamlines
development in three ways: masks the complexity of writing massively
parallel code for the CloudShield platform or the new IBM BladeCenter
PN41 blade; makes optimal resource decisions so developers don't have
to program these choices and has a built in understanding of packet
and network processing. An open programming environment provides
service providers and national governments the rapid programmability
that they need to respond to changing customer requirements and the
latest security challenges.

   "It is no secret that the telecom industry faces a myriad of
challenges today. Fierce competition among service providers is
dropping prices, impacting profits and driving carriers to find new
revenue streams," said David Vorhaus, research associate at Yankee
Group. "Economic pressures are driving the demand for open architected
solutions that enable rapid creation of new services. Carrier grade
solutions that address security threats, combat network congestion and
accelerate new service delivery are a stepping stone to tiered
services across a wide range of audiences."

&lt;p&gt;IDC's Market Intelligence Advisory Practice Identifies Adobe, AT, and IBM as Best Practitioners in Market Intelligence Portal Strategies

   IDC Provides Executive-Level Insight Into What Makes the
Technology Industry's Best-in-Class Market Intelligence Professionals
Successful
FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
IDC's Market Intelligence Advisory Practice today released a new
study: Market Intelligence Advisory Best Practice Series: MI Portals
That Provide On-Demand Intelligence. The report, based upon interviews
with market intelligence (MI) executives at leading technology firms
and portal vendors, provides insights and case studies on the
management of MI portals and their increasing importance within
technology firms.

   Laura Curtis, director of the IDC Market Intelligence Advisory
Practice, noted, "Market intelligence executives should transition
their market intelligence portal into a core strategic product for
delivering information on demand to all functional areas of the
organization. In so doing, the MI function will optimize their role as
a strategic partner within the organization, delivering targeted
information when needed and packaged for key constituents, including
senior executives, sales, marketing and product teams."

   Curtis continued, "Today, MI executives are facing a more complex
competitive environment in which solutions selling, bundling, channel
dynamics, and global competition requires more rigorous and complex
market and competitive analysis. These challenges demand that MI and
their teams engage in more in-depth strategic assessments at an
accelerated pace. In order to strategically position the MI team as
internal consultants to senior decision makers, the MI portal must be
optimized to service many constituents with precise and tailored
content to ensure they are meeting the requirements of the whole
company"

   IDC finds that the new generation of MI portals will be enriched
with Web 2.0 technologies to move the MI portal from a simple
self-service model to a dynamic Web tool. The future state-of-the-art
MI portal will engage users more collaboratively and more frequently.
IDC's new report includes case studies and examples on how to build an
advanced MI portal with both push and pull techniques such as RSS
feeds, Wikis, video casting, Webcasts, and podcast enhancements.
Additional information on optimizing SEO techniques, user interface
development, and marketing and evangelizing the portal internally are
also discussed.

   The more tactical elements of accomplishing these objectives are
provided in the new report, Market Intelligence Advisory Best Practice
Series: MI Portals That Provide On-Demand Intelligence (Doc #213532).
The report includes executive-level insight as well as case studies
based upon interviews with the market intelligence executives of
Adobe, AT, and IBM.

&lt;p&gt;Walter Reed Evaluation Concludes OraQuick(R) HCV Test is Preferred Over Other Rapid Tests

      - OraQuick(R) HCV Test Found to Have Higher Sensitivity and
               Specificity Than Other Rapid HCV Tests -
BETHLEHEM, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
OraSure Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:OSUR), a market leader in oral
fluid diagnostics, today announced that an evaluation by the Walter
Reed Army Institute of Research of the OraQuick(R) HCV Test, currently
in clinical development by OraSure Technologies, was recently released
at the Advanced Technology Applications for Combat Casualty Care
meeting, sponsored by the Department of Defense. The purpose of the
evaluation, entitled "Laboratory Evaluation of Hepatitis C Rapid Test
for Use in Screening Walking Blood Bank Donors," was to determine the
best rapid HCV test to use for screening blood donors for hepatitis C
("HCV") in the theater of war. The OraQuick(R) HCV test was selected
as the preferred test based on all facets of the evaluation.

   Blood that is donated to commercial or hospital blood banks is
subjected to extensive testing for blood-borne pathogens before it is
released to be used in transfusions. However, emergency battlefield
conditions sometimes dictate that an available soldier, or Walking
Blood Bank, donate without this normal lab-based testing being
available. A rapid assay such as the OraQuick(R) HCV test can add a
measure of safety against this important blood borne virus.

   Five rapid tests were initially selected from the rapid HCV tests
available worldwide, based on an evaluation of published claims and
sensitivity testing using HCV positive samples. The tests were then
compared in a comprehensive evaluation of test performance using
plasma and blood specimens. The study indicated that the OraQuick(R)
HCV test had the highest sensitivity (99.4%) and the highest
specificity (99.7%) among the tests evaluated. In addition, the
evaluation indicated that the OraQuick(R) HCV test detected HCV
antibodies approximately three days sooner than available
laboratory-based enzyme immunoassays and approximately sixteen days
earlier than the next most sensitive rapid HCV test. Early detection
of seroconversion is an important measure of the sensitivity of a test
and means that hepatitis C infection can be identified even with
relatively recent exposure.

   "We are very pleased with the results of the Walter Reed
evaluation," said Stephen R. Lee, Ph.D., Chief Science Officer of
OraSure Technologies. "We are eager to complete our clinical trials
for the OraQuick(R) HCV test and submit our applications for both FDA
approval and CE registration for this product. Based on the
performance data generated to date, we believe this test will play an
important future role in identifying new HCV infections and enabling
infected individuals to receive the care and treatment they need."

   The study was conducted at The Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research and involved investigators from the Walter Reed Army
Institute of Research Division of Retrovirology, The U.S. Military HIV
Research Program, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Division of
Military Casualty Research, the U.S. Army Blood Program, the Army
Medical Department Center and School, the Robertson Blood Center and
the American Red Cross. Conference information may be obtained at
https://www.usaccc.org/ATACCC/index.htm

   The OraQuick(R) HCV rapid test is not currently approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for use or sale in the
United States. OraSure Technologies is currently conducting clinical
trials to obtain FDA approval for the test utilizing multiple specimen
types including oral fluid, finger-stick and venous whole blood,
plasma and serum. The clinical studies are nearing completion and a
pre-market application is expected to be submitted to the FDA in the
near future. An application for CE mark approval, which is required to
sell the test in the European Union, is expected to be filed shortly
after the FDA submission.

   Approximately 170 million people are chronically infected with
hepatitis C worldwide, and there are approximately three to four
million new HCV infections each year on a global basis. Chronic
hepatitis C can cause cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. About
half of all cases of primary liver cancer in the developed world are
caused by hepatitis C, and hepatitis C-related liver disease is now
the leading cause for liver transplants. Most people who develop
chronic hepatitis C infection are not aware that they have the
disease. Identification and treatment of occult infections could
significantly reduce future morbidity and mortality associated with
HCV infection.

&lt;p&gt;New Data is Presented on Investigational Oral Anticoagulant Apixaban in Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients

      Dose-Ranging Study Examined Apixaban in Patients Taking Commonly Used
                             Anti-Platelet Therapies
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) and Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) announced
today the results of a Phase 2 dose-ranging study (APPRAISE-1) involving the
investigational compound apixaban in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS,
commonly known as heart attack or severe chest pain). The study compared the
current standard of care for ACS, including aspirin and clopidogrel, with
apixaban on top of the standard of care. The study results were presented during
a late-breaking session at the annual European Society of Cardiology (ESC)
meeting in Munich, Germany.

Apixaban, which is currently being developed by the two companies, is an
investigational oral, highly selective factor Xa inhibitor, a new class of
agents with therapeutic potential to prevent and treat blood clots in the veins
and arteries.

"The APPRAISE-1 study provided encouraging trends suggesting that
anticoagulation with apixaban on top of current standards of care and continued
beyond the initial hospitalization period may reduce the risk of a second heart
attack, stroke or death. As with all effective anticoagulants, there was a trade
off with some increase in bleeding for reduction in risk. We look forward to
further studies of apixaban in patients with ACS to fully understand its
potential beyond current therapies in this population," said John H. Alexander,
M.D., Principal Investigator of the APPRAISE-1 study, Duke Clinical Research
Institute and Duke Heart Center in Durham, North Carolina.

The six-month APPRAISE-1 study was not powered to demonstrate significance on
the composite efficacy endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack,
severe recurrent ischemia and non-hemorrhagic stroke. However, there was a
non-significant relative risk reduction compared to placebo (n=611) of 27
percent for 2.5 mg twice daily (n=317) and 39 percent for 10 mg once daily (n=
318) doses.

The incidence of the primary endpoint of this safety study, major bleeding plus
clinically relevant non-major bleeding, was 5.7 percent for apixaban patients
who took the 2.5 mg twice daily dose (n=315), 7.9 percent for patients who took
the 10 mg once daily dose (n=315), and 3.0 percent for patients who took placebo
(n=599). The bleeding scale used in the APPRAISE-1 trial was the comprehensive
International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) standard. The
incidence of major ISTH bleeding was 0.8 percent with placebo (n=599) versus 1.6
and 1.9 percent with the 2.5 mg twice daily (n=315) and 10 mg once daily (n=315)
doses, respectively. Results for major bleeding measured using the more commonly
used TIMI scale, in a post-hoc assessment, were 0.3 percent (n=599) for placebo,
0.0 percent (n=315) for the 2.5 mg twice daily apixaban dose and 1.0 percent (n=
315) for the 10 mg once daily apixaban dose. Two additional arms of the study
that examined higher doses, 10 mg twice daily and 20 mg once daily, were stopped
early due to increased total bleeding.

The incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events and discontinuations due
to adverse events was similar for all treatment groups. The discontinuation
rates for bleeding events were 1.2 percent with placebo, 1.9 percent with the
2.5 mg twice daily dose and 2.9 percent with the 10 mg once daily dose. The
incidence of liver function test abnormalities following six-month dosing was
similar with apixaban and placebo. The frequencies of alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) elevations above 3-fold the upper limit of normal were 2.7, 0, and 1.0
percent for the placebo, 2.5 mg twice daily apixaban, and 10 mg once daily
apixaban groups, respectively.

"This important study helps to identify appropriate apixaban dosing for future
studies, with the goal of balancing potential efficacy benefit while minimizing
the risk of bleeding for ACS patients," said Jack Lawrence, vice president,
Research and Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb. "The objective is to identify
whether apixaban can reduce the risk of secondary cardiovascular events,
offering significant improvements for patient lives, as well as reducing the
economic burden of cardiovascular disease around the world."

About the APPRAISE-1 Study

The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to evaluate
the safety and efficacy of apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily, 10 mg once daily, 10 mg
twice daily, or 20 mg once daily) over a 26-week treatment period in 1715
patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). All patients received
aspirin less than or equal to 165 mg/day. The use of clopidogrel was left to the
discretion of the treating physician. The primary endpoint of the study was the
incidence of ISTH-defined major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major
bleeding. The composite efficacy endpoint was the amount of time from patient
randomization to the first occurrence of a combination of cardiovascular events
including cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack, severe recurrent
ischemia and non-hemorrhagic stroke.

Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a life-threatening form of coronary heart
disease (CHD) that occurs when the heart muscle does not receive enough
oxygen-rich blood. ACS includes myocardial infarction (MI), also known as a
heart attack, and unstable angina, or sudden, severe chest pain that typically
occurs when a person is at rest. Every year, ACS affects an estimated 1.4
million people in the United States and an estimated 1.40 million people in
Europe. Even though patients are treated with intense management of ACS in the
hospital setting, there still remains an unmet need for new treatments that can
reduce the significant residual risk of acute MI, stroke and cardiovascular
death. Patients with an ACS event are often given IV or injectable
anticoagulants but, due to the route of administration, the use of these agents
is limited to the hospital.

About the Apixaban Clinical Trial Program

Apixaban is currently being explored in the EXPANSE clinical trial program which
includes eight Phase III clinical studies involving approximately 45,000
patients worldwide. The ADVANCE-2 and 3 trials are investigating the safety and
efficacy of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily compared to enoxaparin 40 mg once daily
in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. The ADOPT study is
investigating apixaban for one month compared to standard of care (enoxaparin 40
mg once daily for at least 6 days followed by placebo) for the prevention of VTE
in hospitalized patients who are medically ill and at risk of VTE.

Apixaban is also in Phase III trials studying the prevention of stroke and other
thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and studying the
treatment of VTE. The AF program consists of two trials. The ARISTOTLE trial is
investigating apixaban compared to warfarin in approximately 15,000 patients
with atrial fibrillation. The AVERROES trial is investigating apixaban compared
to aspirin in approximately 5,600 patients with atrial fibrillation who are
ineligible for vitamin K antagonists (VKA) treatment or haven't tolerated
previous VKA treatment.

The VTE treatment program consists of two trials. The AMPLIFY trial is a 6-month
trial investigating apixaban compared to enoxaparin plus warfarin in
approximately 4,800 patients with acute DVT or PE. The AMPLIFY-EXT trial is a
12-month trial investigating apixaban compared to placebo for extended treatment
to prevent recurrent VTE in approximately 2,400 patients who have completed 6 to
12 months of treatment for DVT or PE.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds byline, analyst comment, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on
Wednesday it plans to cut the U.S. prices of its Xbox 360 video
game machine, lowering the price of its entry-level console to
$50 below Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS top-selling Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move makes the Xbox 360 the first game machine of this
generation of consoles to sell for less than $200, a key
mass-market price that Microsoft said historically has
accounted for more than 75 percent of all machine sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lower prices ahead of the crucial holiday shopping
season -- a period of time when the video game industry racks
up most of its sales -- puts pressure on rivals Nintendo and
Sony to cut the prices of their machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it will cut prices for its entry-level
Xbox 360 Arcade, which comes without a hard drive, to $199 from
its current price of $279 and it also will lower the prices of
its mid-range and high-end Xbox 360 consoles by $50 each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new prices will go into effect on Sept. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nintendo's Wii sells for $249 while Sony Corp's (6758.T)
least expensive PlayStation 3, which comes with an 80-gigabyte
hard drive and a Blu-ray high-definition video disc player,
retails for $399.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft wants to drum up demand for the holiday.

a way to get a foothold into people's living rooms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it will cut the price of its Xbox 360 Pro,
its best-selling version which comes with a 60-gigabyte hard
drive, to $299 from $349 and reduce the price of its top-end
Xbox 360 Elite with a 120-gigabyte hard drive to $399 from
$449.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. price cut comes on the heels of a similar price
cut for the Xbox 360 in Japan where Xbox sales have been slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has sold over 20
million Xbox 360 consoles worldwide since its introduction in
late 2005 compared to 14.4 million units for the PlayStation 3
and nearly 30 million Wii units since debuting in Nov. 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In recent months, the PlayStation 3 has outsold the Xbox

division, comprised mainly of the Xbox business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price cuts were reported earlier by BusinessWeek on its

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), the world's
largest soft drinks maker, offered to buy juice maker China
Huiyuan Juice Group Ltd (1886.HK) for a hefty premium, marking
the biggest takeover in China by a foreign company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The all-cash deal of $2.5 billion, which still requires
regulatory approval, values Huiyuan at nearly three times its
closing price on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Major acquisitions in China's fragmented consumer industry
have slowed to a trickle in past years as companies grapple
with fierce competition and a slide in margins. Local brand
names are also known to resist foreign control, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huiyuan, more than one-fifth-owned by France's Danone
(DANO.PA), controls 10.3 percent of a Chinese fruit and
vegetable juice market that grew 15 percent last year to $2
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is followed closely by Coca-Cola, which already has a
9.7 percent share of the market and dominates in the area of
diluted juices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China is already Coke's fourth-largest market and a crucial
battleground with rival PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) -- it has twice
Pepsi's soft-drinks market share with 15.5 percent.
[nN16311903]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke and Pepsi increasingly rely on developing markets like
China, India and Russia for growth, as North American sales of
traditional soft drinks like colas have slowed amid a growing
consumer emphasis on health and an economic slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke is also trying to expand its portfolio of
noncarbonated drinks to better compete with PepsiCo, which
makes Tropicana juices, Gatorade sports drinks, Lipton iced
teas and SoBe drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The takeover of Huiyuan would be Coke's largest acquisition
since last year's $4.1 billion purchase of vitaminwater maker
Glaceau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola, which also makes Minute Maid juices, Powerade
sports drinks and Aquafina bottled water, is paying a high
premium to strengthen its grip on the domestic juice market,
and it may have plans to sell Huiyuan's drinks abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The move is a big surprise to the market and the offer is
super-generous," said Lawrence Chor, analyst at Tai Fook
Securities. "It's very possible Coca-Cola will leverage the
Huiyuan brand, acquire other Chinese juice makers, then boost
their output for export."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley analyst William Pecoriello said in a
research note that the deal makes strategic sense, given that
juice is one of Coke's key focus areas in China, along with
carbonated soft drinks and bottled teas. Yet Coke investors
"might at first react negatively to the high price paid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke shares were down 30 cents at $51.66 in afternoon
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REGULATORY OBSTACLES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola agreed to pay HK$12.20 a share in cash -- 43
times Huiyuan's forecast 2008 earnings and nearly three times
its Friday close of HK$4.14 -- for the 16-year-old company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huiyuan shares soared 170 percent on Wednesday, regaining
levels last seen in October 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three shareholders, including Danone, with a combined 66
percent in Huiyuan agreed to sell their stakes, Coca-Cola said.
Coca-Cola will now make a general offer for all shares, bonds
and options in Huiyuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The purchase would be the single largest takeover in China,
where inbound MA is notoriously difficult given state
dominance of the corporate sector and regulatory red tape.
Nationalistic pride often triggers protests when foreign
companies gain influence over domestic businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's official Xinhua news agency has already warned that
this deal could face regulatory obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are two main difficulties," Mei Xinyu, a researcher
at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic
Cooperation, a government think tank, told Xinhua.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "One is the large size of the two companies, which will
raise concerns about monopolies. The second is that the brand
of Huiyuan is considered to be protected as a famous domestic
brand," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group's [CYL.UL] $375
million offer for a stake in Xugong Group Construction
Machinery Co was scrapped in July after some Chinese officials
argued state assets would be sold to foreigners too cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chinese inbound corporate deals so far are up 30 percent
from a year ago, to $15.3 billion, Thomson Reuters data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PURE-JUICE EXPOSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chinese juice market -- encompassing pure juice,
diluted juices and nectars -- is expected by analysts to grow
more than 10 percent in coming years, benefiting Huiyuan,
Tingyi (0322.HK), Uni-President (1216.TW) and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of juice in China rose 15 percent last year to 13.6
billion yuan ($1.99 billion) and sales volume rose 12.3 percent
to 2.57 billion liters, based on AC Nielsen data from Huiyuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola said its Chinese sales rose 20 percent in volume
in the first quarter and 13 percent in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Coca-Cola is looking to tap the pure juice market, where
Huiyuan is the market leader," said Emma Liu, analyst with
Nomura Securities. "Though it's a relatively small market in
the beverages space, it's a high-growth market because of the
growing personal income in China and increased health
awareness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huiyuan said it controls about 43 percent of China's
pure-juice market and expects sales to grow five-fold in three
to five years to 10 billion yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of smaller competitors rallied, with Andre Juice
8259.HK jumping 11 percent as the broader market .HSI
dropped 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal hands a whopping profit to Huiyuan's investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danone, which has about 23 percent of Huiyuan, said it has
tendered its stake to Coca-Cola and expects a profit of about
100 million euros ($145 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus  Co also stands to
make a windfall, as its near-7 percent stake in Huiyuan is
worth around $175 million, up from a $62.5 million investment
in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola was advised on the deal by Royal Bank of Scotland
and Huiyuan was advised by Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=.6898 Euro)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=HK$7.807)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Parvathy Ullatil, Tony Munroe,

Local brand names are also known to resist foreign control, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huiyuan, more than one-fifth-owned by France's Danone (DANO.PA), controls 10.3 percent of a Chinese fruit and vegetable juice market that grew 15 percent last year to $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is followed closely by Coca-Cola, which already has a 9.7 percent share of the market and dominates in the area of diluted juices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is already Coke's fourth-largest market and a crucial battleground with rival PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) -- it has twice Pepsi's soft-drinks market share with 15.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke and Pepsi increasingly rely on developing markets like China, India and Russia for growth, as North American sales of traditional soft drinks like colas have slowed amid a growing consumer emphasis on health and an economic slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke is also trying to expand its portfolio of noncarbonated drinks to better compete with PepsiCo, which makes Tropicana juices, Gatorade sports drinks, Lipton iced teas and SoBe drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeover of Huiyuan would be Coke's largest acquisition since last year's $4.1 billion purchase of vitamin water maker Glaceau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, which also makes Minute Maid juices, Powerade sports drinks and Aquafina bottled water, is paying a high premium to strengthen its grip on the domestic juice market, and it may have plans to sell Huiyuan's drinks abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The move is a big surprise to the market and the offer is super-generous," said Lawrence Chor, analyst at Tai Fook Securities. "It's very possible Coca-Cola will leverage the Huiyuan brand, acquire other Chinese juice makers, then boost their output for export."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley analyst William Pecoriello said in a research note that the deal makes strategic sense, given that juice is one of Coke's key focus areas in China, along with carbonated soft drinks and bottled teas. Yet Coke investors "might at first react negatively to the high price paid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke shares were down 30 cents at $51.66 in afternoon trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REGULATORY OBSTACLES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola agreed to pay HK$12.20 a share in cash -- 43 times Huiyuan's forecast 2008 earnings and nearly three times its Friday close of HK$4.14 -- for the 16-year-old company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huiyuan shares soared 170 percent on Wednesday, regaining levels last seen in October 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three shareholders, including Danone, with a combined 66 percent in Huiyuan agreed to sell their stakes, Coca-Cola said. Coca-Cola will now make a general offer for all shares, bonds and options in Huiyuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchase would be the single largest takeover in China, where inbound MA is notoriously difficult given state dominance of the corporate sector and regulatory red tape. Nationalistic pride often triggers protests when foreign companies gain influence over domestic businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's official Xinhua news agency has already warned that this deal could face regulatory obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are two main difficulties," Mei Xinyu, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, a government think tank, told Xinhua.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One is the large size of the two companies, which will raise concerns about monopolies. The second is that the brand of Huiyuan is considered to be protected as a famous domestic brand," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group's CYL.UL $375 million offer for a stake in Xugong Group Construction Machinery Co was scrapped in July after some Chinese officials argued state assets would be sold to foreigners too cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese inbound corporate deals so far are up 30 percent from a year ago, to $15.3 billion, Thomson Reuters data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PURE-JUICE EXPOSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese juice market -- encompassing pure juice, diluted juices and nectars -- is expected by analysts to grow more than 10 percent in coming years, benefiting Huiyuan, Tingyi (0322.HK), Uni-President (1216.TW) and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of juice in China rose 15 percent last year to 13.6 billion yuan ($1.99 billion) and sales volume rose 12.3 percent to 2.57 billion liters, based on AC Nielsen data from Huiyuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola said its Chinese sales rose 20 percent in volume in the first quarter and 13 percent in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Coca-Cola is looking to tap the pure juice market, where Huiyuan is the market leader," said Emma Liu, analyst with Nomura Securities. "Though it's a relatively small market in the beverages space, it's a high-growth market because of the growing personal income in China and increased health awareness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huiyuan said it controls about 43 percent of China's pure-juice market and expects sales to grow five-fold in three to five years to 10 billion yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of smaller competitors rallied, with Andre Juice 8259.HK jumping 11 percent as the broader market .HSI dropped 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal hands a whopping profit to Huiyuan's investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danone, which has about 23 percent of Huiyuan, said it has tendered its stake to Coca-Cola and expects a profit of about 100 million euros ($145 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus  Co also stands to make a windfall, as its near-7 percent stake in Huiyuan is worth around $175 million, up from a $62.5 million investment in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola was advised on the deal by Royal Bank of Scotland and Huiyuan was advised by Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.6898 Euro)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=HK$7.807)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Parvathy Ullatil, Tony Munroe, Michael Flaherty, Joseph Chaney, Megan Davies and Martinne Geller; Writing by Edwin Chan, Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO; Coca-Cola) announced today its
intention to make an approximately $2.4 billion cash offer for China
Huiyuan Juice Group Limited (Huiyuan), a Hong Kong listed company with
operations throughout China. Coca-Cola's IDRs of 'A+/F1' are unchanged
by the announcement. Huiyuan manufactures and distributes China's
market leading 100% juice and nectar brands, complementing Coca-Cola's
Chinese juice business, which comprises primarily juice drink
products. Strategically, Fitch views the acquisition positively. Given
that Coca-Cola's bid requires regulatory approval, the transaction's
closing date is uncertain.

   Fitch notes that Chinese authorities have been reluctant in the
past to allow such large purchases. However, Coca-Cola's increasingly
strong brand presence and ongoing investment in China may help
facilitate the approval. Coca-Cola's offer values Huiyuan at
approximately 17.8 times 2007 EBITDA on an Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA
basis. In comparison, Coca-Cola is currently valued by the market at
approximately 15.5 times 2007 EBITDA. While the offer represents a
significant premium over Huiyuan's current market value, the growth
potential of the Chinese juice category appears to justify the bid.
Additionally, Coca-Cola's growing Chinese distribution network and
global procurement system provide opportunities for acquisition
synergies.

   In conjunction with the offer, Coca-Cola announced it would reduce
its 2008 gross share repurchases from a top-end target of $2 billion
down to approximately $1 billion. Due to Coca-Cola's healthy cash
balance of approximately $6.6 billion at June 27, 2008, the company's
roughly $2 billion in free cash flow for the latest twelve months
ended June 27, 2008, and its decision to moderate share repurchases,
Fitch does not anticipate a material increase in Coca-Cola's or the
Coca-Cola system's leverage as a result of the acquisition.

Beverage Companies: In Search of Growth as US Trends Remain Weak,'

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, Sep 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) Research announced a new project, dubbed "Sametime 3-D,"
demonstrating the integration of Lotus Sametime with several virtual
environments. The project showcases the business value virtual
environments can bring to the future of unified communications.

    Specifically, users can instant message a colleague and instead of only
chatting with one another, launch into an immersive 3-D environment
directly from within the Sametime chat session. "Sametime 3-D" creates a
virtual meeting space 'on demand' that uses the capabilities of the
virtual environment, including presentation tools, access to 3-D objects
in the avatar's inventory and full avatar functionality.

    As the 3-D meeting space is launched, people have the option to attach
files, select a meeting space type and sign in using their existing
enterprise authentication tools. Future work includes the provision of
recording and reporting capabilities that the meeting initiator can use to
capture text chat, video recording of the meeting and maintain a record of
participants and materials, including the entire meeting space.

    Today, at the Virtual Worlds Conference and Expo, IBM will be
demonstrating the integration of Lotus Sametime with the OpenSim virtual
world platform. See demo video here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzuiEzTah5w.

    "The ability to easily integrate existing communication and collaboration
tools in 3-D environments will allow businesses to clearly realize the ROI
of virtual environments," said Colin Parris, vice president of Digital
Convergence. "Extending the real-time connection between people into a 3-D
medium enhances the experience and productivity of teams located across
the country or the world."

    The IBM collaboration vision is to foster innovation and business agility
by making it easier for people to find, connect to and collaborate with
one another through a unified communications experience -- right from
their familiar devices, applications, and processes.

    In addition to IBM's work with the OpenSim platform, IBM and Forterra
Systems (http://www.forterrainc.com/) have been working together to
develop and release later in 2008 a futuristic unified communications
solution code-named "Babel Bridge" for the U.S. intelligence agencies.
This robust feature set also addresses the needs of other industries like
financial services, energy, consulting services, and healthcare.

    The combination of IBM Sametime's unified communication and collaboration
platform and Forterra's On-Line Interactive Virtual Environment
(OLIVE(TM)) immersive 3-D environment takes group collaboration
productivity to a new level, incorporating not only voice, video, and
media, but it adds the important element of a sense of presence and
digital identities that build stronger relationships.

    Also, IBM is pursuing similar integration capabilities between Lotus(R)
Sametime(R) software/IBM Unified Communications and Collaboration
(UC2(TM)) platform and a variety of other environments including the
ActiveWorlds platform.

&lt;p&gt;The Coca-Cola Foundation Pledges $1 Million to Ocean Conservancy to Help Eradicate Ocean Litter

   Join Thousands of Volunteers Saturday, September 20, 2008 for the
                     International Coastal Cleanup
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Foundation has launched a multi-year partnership
with Ocean Conservancy through a $1 million pledge to support the
International Coastal Cleanup (ICC), the world's largest volunteer
event to eradicate litter from the world's waterways. Since 1986, the
International Coastal Cleanup has gathered six million volunteers to
remove more than 100 million pounds of marine litter from 170,000
miles of beaches and inland waterways. This year, the ICC takes place
Saturday, September 20, 2008.

   Coca-Cola has sponsored the International Coastal Cleanup for the
past 13 years. Each year hundreds of Coca-Cola associates from around
the world join forces with the International Coastal Cleanup and other
volunteers to rid the planet's oceans, rivers, and lakes of unwanted
trash and debris.

   "We are excited about our continued support to the Ocean
Conservancy and for our associates to participate as volunteers in the
world's largest waterway cleanup," said Ingrid Saunders Jones, chair
of The Coca-Cola Foundation. "Our support allows Ocean Conservancy to
enhance its global education initiatives, increase public awareness
and change behaviors around litter, pollution and marine debris."

   The donation to Ocean Conservancy closely aligns with the
Company's global community investment pillars, which support water
stewardship, community recycling, healthy active lifestyles, and
education. Over the past 25 years, The Coca-Cola Foundation has
contributed more than $278 million to support sustainable communities
worldwide. In addition to their annual financial support of the ICC
from The Coca-Cola Foundation, The Coca-Cola Company provides in-kind
support nearly equal that value through promotional, marketing and
strategic campaigns aimed at heightening awareness of the ICC.

   "This gigantic wave of support from Coca-Cola provides us a
greater opportunity to educate and engage more people around the world
in our work on behalf of the ocean," said Vikki Spruill,
president/CEO, Ocean Conservancy. "The ocean is sick, and we have a
personal responsibility to help sustain the life support system that
sustains us. There are things we can do every day to fight for
healthy, thriving waters. The International Coastal Cleanup is more
than a one day event, it's a year-round movement and now, thanks to
Coca-Cola, we can grow that movement into a sea of change for the
health of the ocean."

   In 2007, 378,000 volunteers in 76 countries removed six million
pounds of marine debris. Trash in the ocean continues to threaten
millions of seabirds, fish and wildlife every year. Last year,
volunteers found 81 birds, 63 fish, 49 crabs and lobsters, 30 mammals,
11 reptiles and one amphibian entangled in debris that included
discarded fishing line, fishing net, rope, and plastic bags.

   Another unique aspect of the International Coastal Cleanup is the
data collection component. Each year, volunteers gather data on the
types of debris collected. Ocean Conservancy produces the results in
an annual report, which is the most comprehensive collection of
volunteer marine debris data in the world. The report helps the
public, industry, and government officials understand the issue, and
helps spread the message about how to best address litter issues at
the source. The grant from Coca-Cola will also provide for more
efficient data submission and management and establish a new online
Web site for the ICC network, in addition to expanding the volunteer
base.

   The majority of debris collected along beaches and waterways
around the world is the result of human impact through recreational
and shore-line activities. Cleaning up debris alone will not solve the
problems; a project to change the behaviors that create trash on our
beaches is another component of the International Coastal Cleanup.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts to add reaction from ExxonMobil)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major ExxonMobil (XOM.N)
may appeal a decision by Britain's Advertising Standards

advert saying gas is one of the cleanest fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four viewers had challenged Exxon's claim that "natural gas

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said on
Wednesday it was flying workers back to its offshore oil
platforms in the Gulf of Mexico after they were shuttered and
evacuated by Hurricane Gustav.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We are returning operations crews to those facilities that
were not in the direct path of the storm. We are also moving
post-storm assessment teams to those remaining facilities which
were in the immediate path of the storm," Exxon said in a press
release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company added that it had no timetable for restarting
its two Louisiana oil refineries, Chalmette and Baton Rouge,
that were shut due to Gustav.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are assessing restart options, but are unable to

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is acquiring rights to a promising experimental drug for Alzheimer's disease from Medivation Inc (MDVN.O) for as much as $725 million, sending Medivation shares up nearly 31 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which is seeking to boost its pipeline of experimental drugs, will pay an initial $225 million for rights to the medicine, Dimebon, which is also being developed for Huntington's disease, the companies said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest drug maker will pay San Francisco-based Medivation up to $500 million more should Dimebon reach various development and regulatory goals, plus additional undisclosed commercial milestone payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results for Dimebon were presented at a prominent Alzheimer's conference in July, when the drug showed it kept symptoms of the brain-wasting disease at bay for 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No cure exists for Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, and current drugs just delay symptoms somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will collaborate on the Phase 3 program in Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease development, and regulatory filings in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company will assume 60 percent of U.S. development and commercialization expenses, and receive 60 percent of U.S. profits. Medivation will co-promote Dimebon to specialty physicians in the United States, should the drug reach the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will have responsibility for the drug outside the United States and will pay Medivation royalties on sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medivation started enrolling patients in June for a 525-patient Phase 3 trial for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Medivation said a mid-stage trial showed Dimebon significantly improved cognitive function in patients with Huntington's disease, a condition in which the degeneration of brain cells causes uncontrolled movement and loss of intellectual function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medivation shares rose to $34 in premarket trading from Tuesday's close of $26.03. Pfizer rose 8 cents to $19.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fastest Storage Systems in the World to Get Faster with
                   Fusion-io's ioMemory Architecture
SALT LAKE CITY--(Business Wire)--
Fusion-io, a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology
and high-performance I/O solutions, today announced that the company
is working with IBM to dramatically accelerate data access performance
in IBM's clustered storage systems. The two companies have adapted
Fusion-io's enterprise SSD technology for "Project Quicksilver,"
demonstrating increased data access performance and reduced power
consumption, while dramatically reducing latency and bottlenecks that
tend to be compounded in today's high transaction and virtualized
environments.

   "IBM's choice to use our solution to increase the performance of
their world-class storage systems validates our ioMemory technology as
the leading enterprise solid-state architecture," said Don Basile, CEO
of Fusion-io. "We are excited to work with IBM as they develop their
next generation storage solutions that will not only increase
performance for a broad range of applications and workloads, but also
improve the effectiveness and power efficiency of next generation data
centers."

   Combining Fusion-io's innovative silicon-based, NAND flash storage
technology with IBM's storage technology and system and application
expertise will revolutionize how enterprises access and store large
amounts of data, enabling a new performance standard that addresses
the growing demands from virtualization, as well as high-transaction
and data-intensive I/O applications. This powerful combination will
provide customers with a whole new way to architect their high
performance storage needs with unparalleled performance, flexibility
and scalability, while consuming far less power.

   The increasing demand for a next generation solid state storage
technology is driven by advancements in computer processors which,
following Moore's Law, have grown exponentially in performance.
Mechanical disks, on the other hand, follow Newtonian Dynamics and
experience lackluster performance improvements, introducing a
performance gap. The ioMemory technology from Fusion-io creates a new
tier in the memory hierarchy - one that has 100 times the capacity
density and 10 times the capacity per dollar of DRAM. NAND flash-based
ioMemory makes it possible to have terabytes of near-memory-speed
storage within each node - bringing extremely large memory problems
and I/O bound analysis to a new level of cost effectiveness.

high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities
for performance-starved applications. Ushering in a new era of
silicon-based storage, Fusion-io offers several magnitudes of
breakthrough performance at a fraction of the cost of today's
traditional disk-based storage systems. The company's first product,
the ioDrive, puts the performance of a SAN in the palm of customers'

&lt;p&gt;Visa Mobile Platform Powering New Mobile Payment Programs in
Brazil, South Korea and Value-Added Service Pilots in U.S.
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa (NYSE:V), the global leader in payments, today took the next
step toward making mobile commerce a global reality by launching four
new programs to deliver payments and services via mobile devices. Two
commercial mobile payments programs, in Brazil and Korea, along with
two mobile offers and transaction notification pilots in the United
States, add to more than a dozen pilot and commercial programs enabled
by the Visa mobile platform around the world.

   The Visa mobile platform gives Visa's bank and wireless carrier
partners the tools and technology framework they need to develop, test
and offer innovative mobile services around payments to this growing
market segment. The mobile platform already supports consumer programs
and pilots in a dozen countries and territories, delivering
convenient, reliable and secure payment services to active lifestyle
consumers.

   Visa's investment in its mobile platform comes as more consumers
in both developed and emerging markets adopt mobile devices. According
to the GSM Association, there are nearly 3.5 billion such devices in
the world with the greatest growth coming from developing countries.
As these numbers have increased - and as the devices themselves grow
smarter - consumers rely on them for much more than just
communication, creating greater opportunity for them to play a central
role in commerce and to deliver new services around payment.

   Visa's vision in creating its mobile platform has been to apply
the scale, flexibility, and security of its global payment network to
deliver both payment and value-added mobile services that have
immediate value to consumers, merchants and issuers.

   "Today we again see how far Visa and our partners have come in the
development of mobile financial services," said Elizabeth Buse, Global
Head of Product at Visa Inc. "As the payments ecosystem has expanded,
so has Visa's opportunity to deliver innovative products and services
to a diverse set of stakeholders."

   Global Momentum

   The Visa mobile platform was created to help financial
institutions, telecommunications providers and handset manufacturers
tap into technology to deliver both mobile payments and related
services that enhance the consumer payment experience. Visa has
continued to extend the platform to offer more innovations that meet
the needs of consumers, merchants, financial institutions and mobile
service providers. The latest programs include:

   --  Brazil: Visa announced yesterday the availability of remote
        mobile payments in Brazil by Banco do Brasil, which is marking
        its 200th anniversary in early October with a number of
        innovative banking programs. It is the first program of its
        kind in Latin America, allowing Banco do Brasil's Visa
        cardholders to pay with their mobile device and confirm the
        transaction via text message. The service is accessible
        through any Brazilian mobile carrier serving the more than 140
        million subscribers in the country. Companhia Brasileira de
        Meios de Pagamento (VisaNet Brasil), the acquiring institution
        for all Visa debit and credit payment transactions in the
        country, will be running the deployment of this technology in
        Brazil.

   --  Korea: In a world first and in partnership with T-Money
        provider KSCC (Korea Smart Card Company), card issuer Shinhan
        Bank and Korea Telecom Freetel (KTF), Visa has made it
        possible for commuters to use their Visa account to top up
        their T-Money balances automatically on the phone's SIM card
        when it falls below a certain level. By conducting the entire
        transaction automatically over the mobile network, commuters
        are freed from the inconvenience of waiting in line at transit
        kiosks or other agents to top up their transit account.

   --  US: Visa recently announced a partnership with Chase Bank for
        a pilot program to deliver personalized mobile offers to
        select consumers in Phoenix, AZ. With more than 50
        participating merchants, the program has capacity for 5,000
        participants who will receive offers, including discounts or
        special deals, directly to their mobile devices via text
        message. They will be able to redeem these offers at the
        merchant's location or online. The pilot will also cover
        special game day offers for baseball fans attending games at
        Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks.

   --  North America: Visa is working with multiple leading issuers,
        such as PNC Bank, SunTrust Bank, U.S. Bank, Wachovia, and
        Wells Fargo in the United States, and RBC, TD Bank Financial
        Group, and Vancity in Canada, to trial a transactions
        notification program that is able to send near real-time
        information to cardholders. Participating cardholders will
        receive e-mail or SMS text messages on their mobile devices
        whenever one or more transaction "triggers" occur, sometimes
        before they leave the store. These mobile notifications will
        be created simultaneously with the transaction, providing
        cardholders with an effective way to monitor and manage their
        accounts.

   These mobile payment initiatives join a series of existing pilots
in several countries and territories, including:

   --  Australia: Last week, National Australia Bank (NAB), Telstra
        and Visa announced an Australian first with the launch of a
        contactless payment trial using components of the Visa mobile
        platform. The trial, involving 200 participants and 12
        merchants in the Docklands area of Melbourne, will run over
        the coming months and will enable Telstra, NAB and Visa to
        assess Australian consumers' and retailers' reaction to mobile
        payments.

   --  Canada: In November 2007, RBC announced a mobile payments
        trial based on the Visa mobile platform. The Ontario-based
        trial will involve multiple phases including in-lab testing,
        an RBC staff pilot, and a consumer pilot. As part of the
        trial, mobile phones with an embedded NFC contactless chip
        will enable users to make mobile Visa payWave transactions at
        contactless acceptance locations.

   --  France: Visa Europe is part of a joint pilot with six major
        French banks as well as four mobile operators called "payez
        mobile." This trial tests mobile payments with 1,000 customers
        at 200 sales outlets in Caen and Strasbourg in France.

   --  Germany: In July 2007, a joint venture between Visa Europe,
        Nokia, T-Systems and Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (RMV), a
        regional transport network in Frankfurt, called RMV2go was
        announced. The joint venture was formed to spearhead the
        development of payment solutions based on the Visa mobile
        platform, incorporating Visa payWave on Nokia mobile devices.

   --  Korea: In February 2007, Visa and SK Telecom, the country's
        leading mobile operator, announced a trial of the world's
        first contactless payment application using a third-generation
        (3G) universal SIM (USIM) that is personalized for payment
        "over-the-air." The program involved SK Telecom subscribers
        installing the Visa payWave contactless application directly
        onto their phone. Since then, KTF, another major mobile
        operator, launched a similar trial with Visa in June 2008.

   --  Malaysia: In October 2007, Visa, in partnership with Maybank,
        Maxis and Nokia, begin a mobile Visa payWave trial with 100
        staff from the participating companies. The trial utilized
        Malaysia's existing contactless infrastructure and built upon
        a mobile payment trial conducted in 2006. Technologies from
        the Visa mobile platform, including graphics-rich user
        software and the ability to download and personalize the Visa
        payWave function over-the-air, were tested during the trial.

   --  Spain: In June 2007, BBVA, Nokia and Visa announced the launch
        of a mobile payments program using Nokia 6131NFC mobile phones
        with NFC (Near Field Communication). A small group of BBVA
        employees were pre-selected to participate in the program.
        Each participant received a phone that is preloaded with the
        Visa payWave application and can be used to pay for purchases
        at various merchants throughout Madrid.

   --  Taiwan: In September 2007, Visa announced a trial with
        Chunghwa Telecom, the largest telecommunications provider in
        Taiwan; Chinatrust Commercial Bank (CTCB), the largest
        privately owned bank in Taiwan; and Nokia. The program
        involved Chunghwa and CTCB customers provisioning their phones
        over-the-air with the Visa payWave payment application. This
        pilot has been complemented with two additional pilots
        conducted by Far EasTone and Taishin Bank and Vibo and United
        Bank of Taiwan.

   --  United Kingdom: Visa Europe announced its participation in a
        large scale UK mobile pilot for payments - entitled "mobile
        wallet" with mobile operator O2. The six month pilot will

&lt;p&gt;VMware ESX is the Industry's First Hypervisor to be Validated by Microsoft, Offers Customers Expanded Support Options for Microsoft Applications

    VMware Lays Foundation for Broader Market Penetration by Giving
   Customers Access to Support for Software For All Major Microsoft
Applications such as Microsoft Exchange Server, SQL Server, SharePoint
           Server and others across Virtualized Environments
PALO ALTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW), the global leader in virtualization
solutions from the desktop to the datacenter, today announced it has
qualified its industry-leading VMware ESX hypervisor under the
Microsoft Server Virtualization Validation Program (SVVP). VMware ESX
3.5 update 2 (ESX 3.5u2) is the first hypervisor to be listed under
the program, providing VMware customers who run Windows Server and
Microsoft applications with access to cooperative support from
Microsoft and VMware.

   "Virtualization is now well within the IT mainstream and our
relationship with Microsoft underscores how far virtualization has
come by providing VMware ESX users with access to valuable support for
their virtualized Microsoft applications," said Bogomil Balkansky,
senior director of product marketing, VMware. "VMware and Microsoft
are working cooperatively to help ensure that our joint customers can
employ the benefits of virtualization along with the peace of mind
that professional product support can provide."

   Microsoft's Server Virtualization Validation Program enables
VMware and other software providers to test and validate their
virtualization software to run Windows Server 2008 and previous
versions of Windows Server. Under this program, Microsoft offers
cooperative technical support to customers running Windows Server on
validated, non-Microsoft server virtualization software, such as
VMware ESX 3.5 update 2. Customers with support policies in place, and
running Windows Server-based applications on VMware ESX 3.5u2, can
receive cooperative technical support from Microsoft. VMware also
offers an extra layer of protection for customers, outside of
Microsoft's Server Virtualization Validation Program, who work
directly with VMware for support. The additional protection is a part
of the VMware Premier Support contract with Microsoft that enables
VMware to escalate application issues rapidly and work directly with
Microsoft engineers to expedite resolution.

   "As virtualization emerges as a mainstream technology for
customers of all sizes, it's important that they can depend on these
technologies to work smoothly with the rest of their infrastructure,"
said Zane Adam, senior director of integrated virtualization at
Microsoft Corp. "Microsoft established the Server Virtual Validation
Program to help ensure customers have a consistent and productive
support experience when using validated non-Microsoft virtualization
software, regardless of the vendor. We are pleased that VMware has
joined the Server Virtual Validation Program and along with the other
participants can bring the benefits of interoperability to our
customers."

   "Microsoft Exchange is an essential application for us; we have
over 50,000 Exchange 2007 mailboxes running on VMware ESX," said
Adrian Jane, infrastructure and operations manager, University of
Plymouth in England. "Application performance and availability have
been outstanding, but the lack of formalized application support was a
concern. With ESX now SVVP-validated, we can reap all the benefits of
virtualization without having to make any tradeoffs in application
support. It's perfect for us. And from a broader perspective, SVVP
support will make it much easier for us to move ahead with our
virtualization-first policy on future application deployments."

   Today's move is expected to be particularly compelling for
VMware's tens of thousands of small and medium-size business (SMB)
customers. Many of these customers turned to virtualization for the
dramatic cost savings that virtualization can provide by reducing
hardware requirements and power consumption.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) said it expects Japan's beleaguered property market to rebound and will use staff gained from its acquisition of Bear Stearns to develop its real estate securitization business. "There is a lot of interest in buying real estate right now both from domestic real estate investors and foreign investors," Gregory Guyett, chief executive of JPMorgan Securities Japan told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"And those investors will look for financing. That's a business we think can be very attractive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan gained some 80 employees in Tokyo when it took over troubled Bear Stearns in May, which has led it to expand its small securitization team to about 25 people, including real estate financing through securitization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The securitization group, headed by a former Bear Sterns employee Rosario Antoci, may expand further depending on market developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the credit crunch, a number of banks in Japan have tightened lending to small and midsized property firms, leading to a string of bankruptcies. But large firms have been relatively unaffected and some like Orix Corp (8591.T) have seen the downturn as an opportunity to go bargain hunting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guyett named Fortress Investment Group (FIG.N), Blackstone Group (BX.N) and Mitsubishi Estate Co Ltd (8802.T) as active investors in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has also been hiring aggressively to develop its commodities and other businesses, and anticipates overall headcount to increase by about 5 percent over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You will see us in the early part of next year with a number of senior hires," Guyett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent hires include Hiroki Kazekami from Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) as head of its global commodities division in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even though commodity prices will fluctuate up and down, it's a major business that our corporate customers and investor customers are interested in," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has hired former senior finance ministry official Yoshiaki Kaneko as a senior advisor to strengthen government and regulatory relationships, and Christopher J. LaFleur as head of government relations and corporate responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaFleur once served as U.S Ambassador to Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan in June also hired Katsuyuki Kuki as vice chairman of investment banking and head of its financial institutions group. Kuki has 20 years of experience in investment banking and worked at Lehman Brothers and UBS Securities Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edwina Gibbs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Medivation Enter into Global Agreement to Co-Develop and Market Dimebon for the Treatment of Alzheimer's and Huntington's Diseases

   Medivation to Host Conference Call/Webcast Today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) and Medivation, Inc.(NASDAQ: MDVN) announced today that
they have entered into an agreement to develop and commercialize Dimebon,
Medivation's investigational drug for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and
Huntington's disease. Dimebon currently is being evaluated in an international,
confirmatory Phase III trial in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's
disease (www.connectionstudy.com).

Under the terms of the agreement, Medivation will receive an up-front cash
payment of $225 million. Medivation also is eligible to receive payments of up
to $500 million upon the attainment of development and regulatory milestones
plus additional undisclosed commercial milestone payments. Medivation and Pfizer
will collaborate on the Phase III program in Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's
disease development and regulatory filings in the United States. The companies
will share all U.S. development and commercialization expenses along with U.S.
profits/losses on a 60 percent/40 percent basis, with Pfizer assuming the larger
share of both expenses and profit/losses. In addition, Medivation will
co-promote Dimebon to specialty physicians in the U.S.

Pfizer will have responsibility for development, regulatory and
commercialization outside the U.S. and will pay Medivation tiered royalties on
commercial sales outside of the U.S. The agreement is subject to approval under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. J.P. Morgan served as
financial advisor, and Cooley Godward Kronish LLP served as legal advisor, to
Medivation on this transaction.

Alzheimer's disease leads to the death of brain cells and the loss of nerve
connections in areas of the brain that govern memory, thinking and behavior.
Alzheimer's disease gradually destroys a person's memory and ability to learn,
reason, make judgments, communicate and carry-out daily activities. No currently
marketed Alzheimer's disease drug appears to stop brain cell death and prevent
or restore lost nerve connections.

Dimebon is an orally-available, small molecule that has been shown to inhibit
brain cell death in preclinical models relevant to Alzheimer's disease and
Huntington's disease, making it a potential treatment for these and other
neurodegenerative conditions. Based on preclinical data generated to date,
Dimebon appears to improve the function of mitochondria, the energy generators
in cells that play a vital role in governing brain cell health, growth and
overall function. Dimebon also has been shown to stimulate the outgrowth of
nerves from brain cells, or neurites, a process that is believed to play an
important role in restoring or generating new brain cell connections.

"With more than 18 million people worldwide suffering from the debilitating and
ultimately fatal effects of Alzheimer's disease, Pfizer has made this
devastating illness one of our highest priorities," said Dr. Martin Mackay,
president, Pfizer Global Research and Development. "We are working to develop
new medicines that improve memory and halt or significantly slow the disease's
progression. We look forward to collaborating with Medivation to bring Dimebon
to patients as rapidly as possible."

"After a rigorous process that garnered substantial interest, we believe that
Pfizer is the ideal partner, sharing our vision for Dimebon and capable of
maximizing its potential globally," said Dr. David Hung, president and chief
executive officer of Medivation. "As one of the leaders in Alzheimer's disease,
Pfizer is an optimal partner because of its extensive experience developing new
medicines; its marketing and commercialization track record; and, its
significant global capability to effectively reach primary care physicians, who
today prescribe the vast majority of Alzheimer's disease medications in the
U.S."

About Dimebon's Clinical Program

Results from the first pivotal trial of Dimebon in Alzheimer's disease showed
that patients treated with Dimebon experienced statistically significant
improvements compared to placebo in key aspects of the disease -- memory and
thinking, activities of daily living, behavior and overall function. Dimebon's
benefit over placebo continued to increase throughout the 12-month treatment
period. At the end of 12 months, Dimebon-treated patients were on average
functioning as well or better than they had been at the start of the study on
each of 5 clinical endpoints. These results were published in the July 19, 2008
issue of The Lancet, and are noteworthy as untreated Alzheimer's patients
progressively deteriorate over time in these areas.

On July 7, 2008, Medivation announced positive safety and efficacy results from
its Phase 2 trial of Dimebon in Huntington's disease, which was conducted in
collaboration with the Huntington Study Group. Dimebon appeared to be well
tolerated and showed statistically significant benefit versus placebo in
cognition as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination, a secondary endpoint
in the study.

&lt;p&gt;Pre-Announces Second Quarter Results
FORT WORTH, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Pier 1 Imports, Inc. (NYSE:PIR) announced today that it is
participating in the Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference being
held today at the Marriott Marquis in New York. Members of the
management team are scheduled to give an update on the Company's
business, which will be web cast live beginning at approximately 2:15
p.m. eastern time.

   In anticipation of the presentation, the Company announced today
that second quarter comparable store sales are approximately negative
1.7%, which is in line with the Company's previous guidance of
slightly negative to modestly positive. Merchandise margins are
expected to be approximately 49.3%, which is below the previous
guidance of at or above 51.3%. EBITDA before special charges is
expected to be negative $15 - 17 million.

   Alex Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "In
spite of the challenges of the current retail environment, our
turnaround plan remains on track. During the quarter, comparable store
sales benefited from traffic being slightly positive and an increase
in conversion rate offset by a decrease in average ticket. Merchandise
margins were below our expectations for the quarter due to the deeper
markdowns needed to clear out garden accessories and outdoor furniture
especially in geographic areas where sales are more difficult. Our
stores are now in good shape and fall merchandise is flowing in
nicely. We feel good about the levels and complexion of our inventory.
As we look ahead to the more important third and fourth quarters, we
will continue to focus on generating profitable sales, and returning
our Company to profitability and beyond. We will be discussing all of
this in more detail during our presentation."

   The live web cast will be available to all investors on our
website at www.pier1.com linking through the "Investor Relations" page
and the "Events" page.

   Financial Disclosure Advisory

   This release references estimated EBITDA before special charges,
which is a non-GAAP measure that represents earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and excludes special
charges. The Company has not included a reconciliation of this
forward-looking non-GAAP measure to estimated net income because the
GAAP financial measure on a forward-looking basis is not accessible,
and the reconciling information is not available without unreasonable
efforts.

   The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measure included
in this press release allows management and investors to understand
and compare the Company's anticipated operating results in a more
consistent manner for the second quarter of fiscal 2009. This non-GAAP
measure should be considered supplemental and not a substitute for the
Company's financial results that will be recorded in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles for the period presented. The
Company's announcement of second quarter earnings is anticipated to be
on September 18, 2008.

   Management's expectations and assumptions regarding future results
are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or
other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements
included in this press release. Any forward-looking projections or
statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary
statements and risks contained in the Company's annual report filed on
Form 10-K. Refer to the Company's most recent SEC filings for any
updates concerning these and other risks and uncertainties that may
affect the Company's operations and performance. The Company assumes
no obligation to update or revise its forward-looking statements even
if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected
results expressed or implied will not be realized.

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said oil
output at its Russian Sakhalin-1 project, shrinking after
reaching a peak level, will decline less than expected this year
and will continue falling in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon raised its Sakhalin-1 output forecast to 9.2 million
tonnes in 2008 (184,251 barrels per day) from the previously
planned 7.9-8.2 million tonnes, a press officer from Exxon's
Moscow office said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new forecast represents a 17.9 percent decline from the
peak production of 11.2 million tonnes reached in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2009, Sakhalin-1 oil output is likely to fall by around 1
million tonnes as Exxon has yet to get local authorities'
permission to add an adjacent field to the project's licenced
area, the press officer quoted a top executive as saying at a
recent meeting with regional authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil production in Russia, the world's second largest crude
oil exporter, has been declining since the start of the year as
many deposits are becoming depleted and oil firms complain that
heavy taxation prevents them from investing enough in new fields
to support growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sakhalin-1, like the neighbouring Sakhalin-2 project, co-led
by Gazprom (GAZP.MM) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), is a
production sharing deal (PSA) which is subjects to special
regulations, when its tax status is fixed for a long term.

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Chemical Steps Up Asia Pacific Specialty Compounds Supply with Compounding Agreement

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical will improve the supply of its specialty
compounds in Asia Pacific following the establishment of a compounding
agreement with Resin &amp; Pigment Technologies Pte. Ltd. (R), a
subsidiary of EnGro Corporation Limited. Under the agreement, R will
manufacture a broad range of ExxonMobil Chemical's specialty compounds
for use in automotive interior and exterior applications, appliances
and consumer products.

   The R facility is located on Jurong Island, Singapore, just two
kilometers from ExxonMobil Chemical's petrochemical complex.
ExxonMobil Chemical will leverage its global portfolio of specialty
plastics and elastomers using the Singapore complex as the primary
source of polyolefins for the production of its specialty compounds.
The R facility is ISO 9001 certified and recently achieved ISO/TS
16949 automotive certification.

   Specialty compounds, such as ExxonMobil's line of Exxtral(TM)
performance polyolefins, will be produced at R's facility to supply
customers throughout Asia Pacific. This new capacity, which can be
expanded significantly in line with growing needs, will improve
ExxonMobil Chemical's global supply. ExxonMobil Chemical will utilize
its existing sales network and service infrastructure to serve
customers across the region.

   "Because this simplifies the supply chain, we can respond more
quickly to changes in demand," said Jim McKinley, manager, ExxonMobil
Chemical specialty compounds business. "Our aim is to provide more
efficient, larger-scale production close to the source of integrated
feedstock supply. By offering a wider range of high-performance
materials from the region's Singapore hub, our Asia Pacific customers
will benefit from more efficient service and supply."

   Earlier this year, ExxonMobil Chemical announced the start-up of a
new $20 million specialty compounding facility in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, with an annual capacity of 40 thousand tons. This facility
complements ExxonMobil Chemical's compounding capability in
Lillebonne, France, and additional compounding capacity from regional
service providers.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) kicked off a $300 million marketing campaign on Thursday, aimed at improving the image of its Windows Vista operating system and strike back at Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) "Mac vs. PC" ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first commercial of Microsoft's new marketing push, being created by advertising agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky, aired on Thursday featuring comedian Jerry Seinfeld and company co-founder Bill Gates at a shoe store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite selling more than 180 million licenses since its launch in 2007, Windows Vista continues to suffer from the perception that the operating system is clunky and hard to use compared with Apple computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That image has been stoked by Apple's "Mac vs. PC" ads featuring a geeky and unfashionable PC guy unable to keep up with a better-looking, hip Mac counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What the brand stands for, particularly in the case of Windows Vista, has been defined by the competitors. The time is now for us to get in and start telling our story," said Brad Brooks, a corporate vice president at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has steadily gained market share against PCs in recent quarters. In the June quarter, Gartner said Apple accounted for 8.5 percent of U.S. computer shipments, a rise of 38 percent from a year earlier. That outpaced the overall U.S. computer market growth of 4.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the commercial is part of a broader, long-term initiative to change consumers' perception of Windows, which will include setting up a retail corner at several hundred Best Buy (BBY.N) and Circuit City CC.N stores staffed by "Windows Gurus" to explain the benefits of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said it has been working with PC makers to optimize systems to speed up computer boot times and improve the overall experience of using a Windows machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the major PC brands are expected to introduce new or revamped models, which Microsoft calls a new category of PCs, with improved designs in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Spanish language
broadcaster Televisa (TLVACPO.MX)(TV.N) and its partner
Univision Communications Inc are headed back to federal court
for a trial over royalty payments, court documents showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Los Angeles trial judge ordered the two sides to file
jury screening instructions by Sept. 8 for a trial set to
commence on Oct.14, according to court documents filed on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trial has been postponed twice from its original start
date last spring, prompting analysts and legal observers to
conclude that the two companies were trying to end the
three-year old dispute out of court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attorney Marshall Grossman, who represents Televisa, said
on Thursday that "there are no substantive settlement
discussions pending and it is anticipated the case will go to
trial as scheduled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An attorney for Univision could not be reached for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa sued in 2005 demanding royalty payments it said
Univision had withheld as part of a programming deal that
expires in 2017.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), the world's
largest soft drinks maker, offered to buy juice maker China
Huiyuan Juice Group Ltd (1886.HK) for a hefty premium, marking
the biggest takeover in China by a foreign company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The all-cash deal of $2.5 billion, which still requires
regulatory approval, values Huiyuan at nearly three times its
closing price on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Major acquisitions in China's fragmented consumer industry
have slowed to a trickle in past years as companies grapple
with fierce competition and a slide in margins. Local brand
names are also known to resist foreign control, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huiyuan, more than one-fifth-owned by France's Danone
(DANO.PA), controls 10.3 percent of a Chinese fruit and
vegetable juice market that grew 15 percent last year to $2
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is followed closely by Coca-Cola, which already has a
9.7 percent share of the market and dominates in the area of
diluted juices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China is already Coke's fourth-largest market and a crucial
battleground with rival PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) -- it has twice
Pepsi's soft-drinks market share with 15.5 percent.
[nN16311903]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke and Pepsi increasingly rely on developing markets like
China, India and Russia for growth, as North American sales of
traditional soft drinks like colas have slowed amid a growing
consumer emphasis on health and an economic slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke is also trying to expand its portfolio of
noncarbonated drinks to better compete with PepsiCo, which
makes Tropicana juices, Gatorade sports drinks, Lipton iced
teas and SoBe drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The takeover of Huiyuan would be Coke's largest acquisition
since last year's $4.1 billion purchase of vitaminwater maker
Glaceau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola, which also makes Minute Maid juices, Powerade
sports drinks and Aquafina bottled water, is paying a high
premium to strengthen its grip on the domestic juice market,
and it may have plans to sell Huiyuan's drinks abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The move is a big surprise to the market and the offer is
super-generous," said Lawrence Chor, analyst at Tai Fook
Securities. "It's very possible Coca-Cola will leverage the
Huiyuan brand, acquire other Chinese juice makers, then boost
their output for export."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley analyst William Pecoriello said in a
research note that the deal makes strategic sense, given that
juice is one of Coke's key focus areas in China, along with
carbonated soft drinks and bottled teas. Yet Coke investors
"might at first react negatively to the high price paid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke shares were down 30 cents at $51.66 in afternoon
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REGULATORY OBSTACLES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola agreed to pay HK$12.20 a share in cash -- 43
times Huiyuan's forecast 2008 earnings and nearly three times
its Friday close of HK$4.14 -- for the 16-year-old company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huiyuan shares soared 170 percent on Wednesday, regaining
levels last seen in October 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three shareholders, including Danone, with a combined 66
percent in Huiyuan agreed to sell their stakes, Coca-Cola said.
Coca-Cola will now make a general offer for all shares, bonds
and options in Huiyuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The purchase would be the single largest takeover in China,
where inbound MA is notoriously difficult given state
dominance of the corporate sector and regulatory red tape.
Nationalistic pride often triggers protests when foreign
companies gain influence over domestic businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's official Xinhua news agency has already warned that
this deal could face regulatory obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are two main difficulties," Mei Xinyu, a researcher
at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic
Cooperation, a government think tank, told Xinhua.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "One is the large size of the two companies, which will
raise concerns about monopolies. The second is that the brand
of Huiyuan is considered to be protected as a famous domestic
brand," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group's [CYL.UL] $375
million offer for a stake in Xugong Group Construction
Machinery Co was scrapped in July after some Chinese officials
argued state assets would be sold to foreigners too cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chinese inbound corporate deals so far are up 30 percent
from a year ago, to $15.3 billion, Thomson Reuters data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PURE-JUICE EXPOSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chinese juice market -- encompassing pure juice,
diluted juices and nectars -- is expected by analysts to grow
more than 10 percent in coming years, benefiting Huiyuan,
Tingyi (0322.HK), Uni-President (1216.TW) and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of juice in China rose 15 percent last year to 13.6
billion yuan ($1.99 billion) and sales volume rose 12.3 percent
to 2.57 billion liters, based on AC Nielsen data from Huiyuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola said its Chinese sales rose 20 percent in volume
in the first quarter and 13 percent in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Coca-Cola is looking to tap the pure juice market, where
Huiyuan is the market leader," said Emma Liu, analyst with
Nomura Securities. "Though it's a relatively small market in
the beverages space, it's a high-growth market because of the
growing personal income in China and increased health
awareness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huiyuan said it controls about 43 percent of China's
pure-juice market and expects sales to grow five-fold in three
to five years to 10 billion yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of smaller competitors rallied, with Andre Juice
8259.HK jumping 11 percent as the broader market .HSI
dropped 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal hands a whopping profit to Huiyuan's investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danone, which has about 23 percent of Huiyuan, said it has
tendered its stake to Coca-Cola and expects a profit of about
100 million euros ($145 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus  Co also stands to
make a windfall, as its near-7 percent stake in Huiyuan is
worth around $175 million, up from a $62.5 million investment
in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola was advised on the deal by Royal Bank of Scotland
and Huiyuan was advised by Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=.6898 Euro)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=HK$7.807)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Parvathy Ullatil, Tony Munroe,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS AG (UBSN.VX), rocked by
more than $44 billion in credit write-downs during the past
year, said on Thursday it hired a top Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) executive as its new global head of fixed income,
currencies and commodities trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Carsten Kengeter, 41, was most recently a partner and
co-head of Goldman's securities division for Asia, excluding
Japan, with responsibility for all fixed-income products in the
region. He is expected to join UBS early next year, and will
move to London from Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He will report to Jerker Johansson, a former Morgan Stanley
executive who joined UBS in March to help restore the its
credibility and revive the performance of its capital markets
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS, among the hardest hit by the credit crisis, has been
shaking up management as it tries to convince investors it can
still compete on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kengeter was chosen after a four-month search to replace
Andre Esteves, a Brazilian banker who ran fixed income for
about 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Swiss bank, long regarded as a conservative wealth
manager, has lost money for four consecutive quarters due to a
poorly timed expansion into mortgage trading, structured debt
and hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS still held more than $45 billion of risky debt at the
end of the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS Chief Executive Marcel Rohner said last month the bank
would split off the investment bank division from the rest of
the company's private wealth and fund management businesses.
The bank acknowledged these businesses eventually could be
sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johansson will continue to oversee the fixed income
business until Kengeter arrives. In recent weeks, UBS has been

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund
Partners LLC, an investment fund comprised by five other hedge
funds, fell in value by 2.6 percent in July, according to a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The fund-of-funds also disclosed that earlier this week it
completed a private placement of Class A units to several
qualified investors, raising proceeds of $8.96 million. The
investors were not identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund's July performance reflected negative returns in
four out of its five funds: Global Tactical Trading, Global
Equity Long/Short, Global Relative Value and Global Fundamental
Strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only positive performance was generated by Goldman
Sachs HFP Opportunistic Fund, which had net returns of 2.4
percent, according to the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokeswoman said the firm does not comment on

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. municipal swap market should survive the recent high-profile exit by JPMorgan Chase and an Alabama's county's ill-fated deals because well-crafted swaps save state and local governments money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, states, cities, hospitals and others that sell debt in the $2.6 trillion muni bond market have increasingly used swaps to lower rates by selling floating-rate debt and locking in that cost with a fixed-rate swap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think if municipal issuers never did another swap it would probably raise the cost of financing in the long term," said Evan Rourke, an M.D. Sass muni strategist in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alabama's Jefferson County, which has threatened to file for bankruptcy in a battle with banks, including JP Morgan, is one issuer that probably will not venture back into swaps any time soon. Swaps aggravated the county's financial woes, which were caused by $3.2 billion of soured sewer debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travis Hulsey, Jefferson County's acting finance director, said other issuers also might be disinclined to use swaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"J.P. Morgan's dropping out of offering derivatives possibly signals the curtailing of derivatives as instruments for municipalities," he said. "It would be some time before Jefferson County considered instruments of this nature again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan is closing a unit that offered muni interest rate swaps amid probes by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission into the sale of some derivatives and investment contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bank spokeswoman declined comment on the investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other banks that offer swaps as part of their muni underwriting business are unlikely to follow JP Morgan out the door as this can be quite profitable, muni analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan's competitors also could win business from it because municipal issuers often demand swaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that's been the cornerstone of profitability and the underlying reason to even be in public finance for most of the firms," said one of the analysts, who requested anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to JP Morgan, he added: "So I think they are going to be going into battle without any weapons if they don't have a derivative desk to offer an issuer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, banks that could not offer swaps either lost out muni underwriting deals or had to hire competitors to provide swaps, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other issuers took a more measured approach to the latest upheaval in the muni market, which since January has been grappling with the collapse of the $330 billion auction rate market, another victim of the global credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania Treasurer Robin Wiessmann, a Democrat, said the fault lay not with derivatives but with how they were used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, David Bryant, treasurer of the Chicago Public Schools, said: "I wouldn't throw out all swaps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago's school system has existing swaps, though not with J.P Morgan, and it will continue to look at swaps if they are economically compelling. "I would discuss the risks and benefits with my board," Bryant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan said it will still offer swaps to some muni issuers: nonprofit health care entities, private educational and cultural organizations, and for-profit clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to keep this line of business might reflect the often simpler and swifter financial decisions these issuers can make. City or county governments typically require multiple approvals, which dilutes the responsibility of individual officials, and reduces banks' leverage in disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that complex financial deals have rattled muni issuers. City and county officials often have broad responsibilities, including pensions and healthcare, in addition to debt. So they can be at a disadvantage in dealing with Wall Streeters who specialize in bonds, the experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After California's Orange County's 1994 bankruptcy, one of the largest-ever such filings, there were calls for federal and local bans on derivatives -- and some curbs were enacted. Interest-rate derivatives had cost the county $1.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about bans, the Pennsylvania treasurer said: "If I were to see that there were very serious, systemic risks with the use of derivatives as it relates to them as a product, then I would perhaps think about it." The legislature has only approved derivatives for some agencies and localities, not the Commonwealth itself, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joan Gralla in New York, Karen Pierog in Chicago, Melinda Dickinson in Birmingham and Michael Connor in Miami)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Osteoporosis patients given a low dose of an experimental Pfizer Inc pill were more likely to die within five years than others who got a placebo, U.S. drug reviewers said in an analysis released on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increased death rate for women who took the highest dose of the drug Fablyn was not statistically significant in the company study, Food and Drug Administration reviewers said. That means the difference could have been due to chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug, which the FDA rejected for osteoporosis in 2005, was developed with technology from Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA staff said it was "of concern" that Fablyn patients had more than double the chance of developing a blood clot in a vein. Blood clots are a known risk of similar drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency will ask a panel of outside advisers that meets on Monday if Fablyn offers acceptable safety, the staff summary said. The reviewers said the once-a-day pill was effective for preventing fractures in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, which weakens bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study of more than 8,500 women, 4.7 percent given the lowest Fablyn dose developed a new or worsening fracture within 3 years. That compared with 6.4 percent of placebo patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in a separate summary: "Overall (Fablyn) was not associated with an increased mortality risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the company's main study, 3.2 percent of women given the low Fablyn dose died, compared with 2.3 percent in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher rate for low-dose patients "appears to be due to an unusually low mortality rate in the placebo group" in one region where the drug was tested, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The causes of death were consistent with the leading killers of elderly people, including cancer and heart disease, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fablyn belongs to a class of drugs known as selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs, which includes Eli Lilly and Co's osteoporosis drug Evista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said Fablyn "affords a unique benefit among SERMs" by reducing more types of fractures. More than 200 million people worldwide have osteoporosis, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA will weigh the advisory panel's input before deciding whether to approve Fablyn. The agency usually follows panel recommendations, but is not required to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug's generic name is lasofoxifene. The previous proposed brand name was Oporia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Fablyn is approved, Ligand will receive a milestone payment and royalties of 3 percent of net sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis drugs already sold include Procter  Gamble and Sanofi-Aventis SA's Actonel, and Boniva, sold by GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Roche Holding AG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The generic drug alendronate, a cheaper copy of Merck  Co's Fosamax, also is available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 2.8 percent to close at $18.67 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Ligand dropped 2 cents to $3.32 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Tim Dobbyn, Dave Zimmerman, Lisa Von Ahn, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green Mountain Coffee Pumps It Up with Revv(TM), a New Extra Bold Coffee, at ExxonMobil Locations Nationwide

WATERBURY, Vt.--(Business Wire)--
There's a new fuel at your local Exxon and Mobil convenience
stores. Green Mountain Coffee, the coffee segment of Green Mountain
Coffee Roasters, Inc. (NASDAQ: GMCR), announces the launch of
Revv(TM), a new Extra Bold coffee that delivers 27% more coffee and
27% more kick. The new coffee blend is now available by the cup at all
On The Run and Tiger Market convenience stores, encompassing
approximately 1,100 locations nationwide.

   Revv expands the selection of coffee blends that Green Mountain
Coffee has supplied to ExxonMobil since the late 1990s. It is designed
to appeal to consumers who are interested in a bolder, richer coffee
experience. It also taps into the growing interest in high-energy
coffees and other beverages within the convenience store channel.

   Like all Green Mountain coffees, Revv is made with 100 percent
Arabica specialty coffee. Beans from Sumatra give it a deep, rich
body, while Central American beans add a smooth balance. Says Lindsey
Bolger, Director of Coffee Sourcing and Relationships at Green
Mountain Coffee, "Our goal was to create an intense coffee experience
without compromising on quality. Revv's blend of medium and dark
roasted coffees is every bit delicious as it is invigorating."

   "We believe that Revv's Extra Bold flavor and bold look on the
coffee island will draw a whole new audience of coffee drinkers and
knock the socks off our loyal consumers who drink their coffee on the
go," said T.J. Whalen, VP of Marketing at Green Mountain Coffee.
"ExxonMobil's industry-leading convenience stores make a terrific
starting point for launching this high quality, high attitude coffee."

   ExxonMobil plans to promote Revv's launch throughout the fall and
will be the featured blend throughout September, October and November
with dedicated media and point-of-sale that includes pump toppers,
window signs and coffee island merchandising.

   "The taste of Revv is rich and bold, and the little extra kick
will help get your day off to a fast start," says George Salmons,
ExxonMobil Category Director for Coffee and Foodservice.

how consumers and utilities will ultimately benefit from this
intelligence.

Mark van den Berg, a venture capitalist with Vantage Point Venture
Partners. Vantage Point's portfolio includes clean tech startups focused
on renewable energy, transportation and water. Also featured are Allan
Schurr, VP of Strategy and Development for IBM's energy and utility
industry, and Drew Clark, director of strategy for IBM's Venture Capital

create a backup image, convert it to a .vhd, create a diskless VMin
Hyper-V, and then import the .vhd file into Hyper-V.

    The company is developing native support for Hyper-V for its Acronis True
Image product family, which includes Acronis True Image Echo Enterprise
Server, Acronis True Image Virtual Edition, Acronis True Image Server for
Windows, Acronis True Image Server for Microsoft Small Business Server,
and Acronis True Image Echo Workstation, as well as Acronis Universal
Restore for each of these products. Acronis Universal Restore is an
add-on module for customers that require the ability to recover server
images to dissimilar hardware, regardless of the operating system or
installed components. With Acronis True Image Virtual Edition, there is
no limit on the number of virtual servers that customers can back up.

    "Adoption of Microsoft's Hyper-V technology is expected to increase
dramatically, so it is important for us to support this important new
technology in the market," said Walter Scott, CEO of Acronis. "As a
Microsoft partner, we've had excellent cooperation to expedite the process
of building support into our software, which is great news for our mutual
customers."

    There will be no additional charge for the Hyper-V added support. Acronis
has yet to announce the date when users will be able to download the
software update.

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source; adds details)
 Sept 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded the U.S. steel
sector to "neutral" from "attractive,"  saying the near-term
concerns continue to weigh on investor sentiment, and
transferred the coverage of the sector to analyst Sal Tharani
from Aldo Mazzaferro.

 "Several of the typical risks to the steel cycle such as a
rising US dollar, "China fear" and sharply falling scrap prices
have shaken investor confidence in sustainability of steel
cycle," the brokerage said in a note to clients.

 The brokerage while maintaining its "buy" rating on United
States Steel (X.N), removed it from conviction buy list. It
also maintained its "buy" rating on Nucor Corp (NUE.N)

 Goldman upgraded Steel Dynamics (STLD.O) to "buy" from
"neutral" and downgraded Commercial Metals (CMC.N) to "neutral"
from "buy."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it led all vendors worldwide in identity
and access management security software in 2007, according to a new
report from independent analyst firm IDC.(1) IBM also today announced the
availability of new IBM Tivoli Access Manager for Enterprise Single
Sign-On software, redesigned based on technology from IBM's March 2008
Encentuate, Inc. acquisition.

    The new software serves as a business productivity tool, freeing
businesses and their employees from having to manage and recall multiple
passwords. It supports a wide scope of computer use -- from traditional
desktops, shared workstations and remote access -- while also helping to
simplify organizations' compliance initiatives.

    IDC ranks IBM as the overall revenue leader for the second straight year
in 2007, growing its revenue by six percent from 2006 and further
extending its lead ahead of the nearest competitor. The report states the
total worldwide revenue for identity and access management grew to more
than $3.1 billion in 2007, and due to strong demand for the software as
an integral component of governance, risk, and compliance initiatives,
IDC expects revenues to reach $5.3 billion by 2012.

    "Our identity and access management software integrated with security
information and event management is a cornerstone of IBM's approach to
help customers achieve their company-wide security and compliance goals,"
said Al Zollar, general manager, of IBM Tivoli Software. "While superior
technology and extensive integration are significant keys to IBM's growth
in this area, one must not overlook how these technologies are applied
successfully in the context of business and IT processes. We are simply
enabling our clients to apply security to these processes, so authorized
users can access the right applications and information for the right
business reasons."

    IBM Tivoli Access Manager for Enterprise Single Sign-On allows users to
securely sign-on once to their corporate network and then automatically
handles subsequent authentication and access to a wide range of different
applications. By automating password management and allowing users one
password instead of several, employees can become more efficient and
businesses can lower help desk costs associated with forgotten passwords.

    This software, now available, provides customers with several new and
enhanced features including support for additional strong authentication
methods such as cell phones and building access badges, centralized and
customized event reporting and auditing for governance and compliance
initiatives, and improved out of the box integration and session
management capabilities. The software additionally provides new "visual
profiling" for simpler set-up and supports 13 new languages for extensive
global use.

    With the new version, organizations can effectively and quickly enable
secure remote access for their mobile workforce without installing any
desktop software and modifying application servers. Remote workers require
only one password, as well as an optional second authentication factor, to
access corporate information from remote offices, home PCs, and PDAs.

    Portland General Electric, Oregon's largest electric utility, uses IBM
Tivoli Access Manager for Enterprise Single Sign-On and plans to upgrade
to the new version 8.0 as part of its security technology strategy to
help the utility company drive productivity and save costs on IT and help
desk support. The effort has simplified password management for
employees, who otherwise could have more than a dozen passwords to access
over 20 different enterprise applications.

    "Self-service password reset, multi-factor authentication and integration
with our IBM Tivoli Identity Manager provisioning application are new
capabilities that are important to us," said Theo Pozzy, Enterprise
Architect for Portland General Electric. "As we plan for deployment within
PGE, our company is looking for additional productivity improvements as
well as increased security, and we focused on these goals as we tested the
new release. The software continues to be an important solution in our
efforts to address governmental and corporate security requirements."

    When Tivoli Access Manager for Enterprise Single Sign-On is used with
computer kiosk stations, co-workers can securely and effectively share
access without needing to re-start a computer. For example, a hospital can
use IBM software to provide employees access to both buildings and
computers with a single RFID work badge. A physician can sign-in to any
shared computer station with a tap of the badge to securely access lab
reports or patient records. With its advanced session management
capabilities, multiple users can now have a secure, private desktop with
shared kiosks, allowing quick and easy access to their own personalized
session at several locations throughout the hospital. The software also
logs access along the way and provides reports to support HIPAA compliance
efforts.

    IBM Tivoli Access Manager for Enterprise Single Sign-On is part of IBM's
Tivoli security software that helps prevent unauthorized access to
valuable customer, employee and business data and facilitates compliance
with corporate security policy and regulatory requirements. IBM's
identity and access management software is part of IBM's portfolio of
service management software which automates some of the most challenging
processes associated with managing a complex IT environment, such as
managing storage devices and deploying new software releases and patches.
The software helps customers fight rising IT costs, manage constant
change and meet the demand to stay competitive in the marketplace.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - The global economy contracted for
the third consecutive month in August, and while the pace of
contraction was slower than July, the outlook remained gloomy, a
survey showed on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Global Total Output Index, produced by JP Morgan with
research and supply management organisations, was 49.7 in
August. That was higher than July's 49.0 but still below the 50
mark that divides growth from contraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With the activity, new orders and employment indexes
remaining at relatively low levels in August, conditions are
unlikely to improve significantly in the near future," said
David Hensley, a director at JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The global new business index contracted for the third
consecutive month, particularly in manufacturing, but costs
eased with the input prices index posting its lowest reading for
five months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Recent declines in oil and commodity prices are
starting to filter through to some manufacturers and service
providers, slowing the pace of overall cost increases," Hensley
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The United States service sector expanded slightly in
August, creeping above the 50.0 mark to 50.6 from July's 49.5,
while Russia's service industry also saw robust growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Japanese manufacturing output fell to the
greatest extent since late-2001, while government restrictions
in place during the Olympics meant that Chinese manufacturing
production declined at the sharpest rate in the survey's
history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global manufacturing data published on Tuesday showed
activity at its weakest in five years as production slowed
sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The index combines survey data from countries including the
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) said it is shuttering a unit that structured interest rate swaps for municipal borrowers, as regulators scrutinize the bank's role in the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats to additional subscribers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 4 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
said it is shuttering a unit that structured interest rate
swaps for municipal borrowers, as regulators  scrutinize the
bank's role in the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The municipal bond market has been rocked by an antitrust
probe and the near bankruptcy of Alabama's most-populous
county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move to close down the business comes as the U.S.
Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission
investigate JPMorgan over the sale of certain derivatives and
investment contracts to municipal issuers. A JPMorgan
spokeswoman declined comment on the investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a memo to employees, Matt Zames, JPMorgan's head of
rates, foreign exchange and municipal bonds, said the returns
from the business "no longer justify the level of resources we
have allocated to it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the shake-up, JPMorgan is also tightening
controls around its broader tax-exempt capital markets unit
including reducing external counsel and enhancing credit
standards and compliance policies. The municipal swaps business
is part of that unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reorganization will cut the number of JPMorgan offices
that handle tax-exempt capital markets to 10 from 19. This will
affect about 15 people, most of whom will be given the option
to relocate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zames said in the memo that the municipal swaps group falls
within a portfolio of businesses that are being reviewed by
Steve Black and Bill Winters, co-chief executive officers of
the investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street marketed unregulated derivatives as a way for
municipalities to save money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of derivatives to cities, towns and school districts
provided banks with fees as earnings from arranging sales of
tax-exempt bonds used to build schools, roads and other public
works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The financing backfired this year as fallout from the
global credit crisis caused borrowing costs to soar.

&lt;p&gt;
NEW YORK, Sept. 4, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ACI Worldwide, Inc. (Nasdaq:ACIW), a
leading international provider of software for electronic payment systems, today
announced a new version of ACI Proactive Risk Manager(tm), the company's
comprehensive fraud monitoring and detection solution. Proactive Risk Manager
Release 7.1 Version 08.2 maximizes the performance of the solution on IBM's
System z hardware platform and includes expanded support for IBM's DB2 database
platform and their enterprise-wide Tivoli monitoring tool. The new version also
offers enhanced security, additional PCI functionality and a new interface to
send real-time account status updates.

Clients using the latest version of Proactive Risk Manager on IBM's "blue stack"
database, middleware and security platform will benefit from comprehensive fraud
detection features as well as the high reliability, availability and
serviceability of IBM's z/OS operating system and the underlying performance and
security of the System z hardware platform. Customers can use the solution to
lower transaction costs, improve margins and enhance their competitive
positioning by optimizing their financial, technological and human resources.

"ACI clients have typically run their scoring engine on IBM System z while the
other components of the software (rules and analysis and review) ran on other
platforms," said Ron Totaro, senior vice president at ACI. "Now clients can run
their entire transaction base from multiple channels on Proactive Risk Manager
and IBM System z, benefiting from the superior reliability, availability,
serviceability and security of IBM's platform. This provides users with an
enhanced capability to respond to fraud in real time."

Customers will benefit from a significant performance boost, enabling them to
respond to payments fraud across their entire transaction base in real time.
Fine-tuning Proactive Risk Manager to harness the unique parallel processing
approach of IBM's System z hardware has enabled faster analysis of potential
fraud situations, which will enable clients to reduce payments fraud losses and
realize significant efficiency and productivity gains in alert management and
investigative case management.

Version 08.2 offers support for IBM's enterprise-wide monitoring tool, the
Tivoli Enterprise Console, by enabling logging of events from the analysis and
review system and the file update interface. The software also supports access
to administrative and user accounts and screens with Tivoli Access Manager 6.0,
strengthening user identification and password encryption and simplifying the
user account management process.

Totaro continued, "With Proactive Risk Manager's proven record in handling large
volumes of data, the combination with IBM System z processing power takes the
product to a new level. We are seeing unprecedented levels of performance in our
test environment, and I am confident this combination will make a significant
difference for major financial institutions who wish to fully embrace the
enterprise risk concept. The ability to detect fraud across a transaction, be it
financial or even non-monetary, such as a change of address in identity related
crime, is now a reality with IBM's support."

Brett Small, head of consumer banking fraud at National Australia Bank, said,
"As phishing has grown significantly over the years, along with clients'
expectations of shorter settlement times for transactions, it has become more
and more important to be able to assess transactions in real time for fraud.
ACI's Proactive Risk Manager using the power of the IBM System z platform
enables us to successfully handle this challenge and provides the ability to
extensively carry out data mining to explore new fraud attacks. NAB is looking
forward to being able to exploit new features becoming available as a result of
the ACI and IBM collaboration."

&lt;p&gt;  BANGALORE, INDIA, Sep 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it is implementing an innovative
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-based solution for Hindustan
Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), a Fortune 500 company and a leading
downstream petroleum organization (Refining and Marketing) in India. HPCL
will leverage IBM's technology expertise to deploy an end-to-end tracking
solution based on RFID technology at HPCL's Nashik plant. Signed in March
2008, this US$2.2 million deal is one of the single largest
implementations in India for RFID-based tracking solutions and involves
infrastructure services, business consulting services and middleware
solutions from IBM.

    Under this agreement, IBM will design, deploy and integrate the RFID
solution for tracking LPG cylinders from plant to the end-consumer. The
solution will streamline the process of identification of LPG cylinders
during bottling, distribution and supply chain, and is expected to cover
500,000 cylinders in the initial phase. HPCL intends to evaluate the
technology and deploy the same in a phased manner to cover the entire
supply chain from bottling plant, logistics, and distributors to the
end-consumers.

    Commenting on the project, G A Shirwaikar, Executive Director-LPG, HPCL,
said, "This RFID-based cylinder tracking project is the first of its kind
in India. Considering the magnitude of our operations, which continues to
grow significantly, it has become imperative for us to bring greater
efficiencies in our supply chain. We aim to achieve this with our new
RFID-based tracking solution. We are happy to partner with IBM, as their
global expertise in deploying such solutions would help HPCL strengthen
its supply chain of LPG cylinders end-to-end, and finally result in
significant operational benefits for the organization. We also expect to
roll out this solution to other plants in India (an additional 42)
besides extending it to dealers for an integrated supply chain."

    "IBM is committed to build capabilities to address some very unique
business challenges faced by Indian enterprises. We are very excited about
the RFID implementation at HPCL and especially the fact that this solution
covers the entire supply chain of HPCL's very significant LPG business.
The energy sector is seeing a tremendous growth in India and we believe
that a unique solution like this will help market leaders like HPCL
improve their operational efficiencies while strengthening their
competitive edge in the market," said Nipun Mehrotra, Vice-President and
General Manager, Global Technology Services, IBM India/South Asia.

    Through its RFID-based asset tracking solutions, IBM helps clients across
the world improve their operational efficiencies using its wide range of
RFID tracking solutions for different industries. IBM also has thirteen
worldwide RFID Solution Centers which offer a combination of RFID
technical expertise, practical assessment and implementation services, and
industry-leading innovative solutions that place IBM among the leaders in
RFID technology solutions.

&lt;p&gt;Federated Media and 'Small Business Trends' Work with Microsoft to Add Value to Popular Small Business Resource

    Anita Campbell's 'Small Business Trends' Website Rolls Out New
           Features and Functionality Sponsored by Microsoft
SAUSALITO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Federated Media Publishing (FM) and Small Business Trends today
announced new content, features and functionality made possible by
Windows Vista. The enormously popular website is a vital, trusted
resource for an active community of small business owners, aspiring
entrepreneurs and the people who interact with them. Now, an
innovative alliance with Microsoft will make the site even more useful
and insightful for its dedicated readers.

   "I'm always looking for ways to make Small Business Trends a more
useful resource for readers," said Anita Campbell, editor in chief.
"This collaboration with Microsoft has enabled some great new content
that has already received deep reader engagement and positive
feedback. It's the perfect example of how an advertiser can add value
to existing communities and bring benefit to their brand -- with
openness and transparency."

   New features of the website made possible by the Microsoft
sponsorship include:

   --  A hosted section of the website dedicated to the theme
        "helping small businesses be successful."

   --  Partnerships with leading business voices including
        VentureBeat, Duct Tape Marketing, Technologizer and more.

   --  Reader-generated group writing projects centered on crucial
        small business themes.

   --  Reader polls that will help leverage the collective wisdom of
        the community.

Chas Edwards, publisher and chief revenue officer at Federated Media.
"When marketers add value, customers pay more attention to that brand

conversational approach to marketing. At PBS or NPR, they call this
approach 'underwriting.' It's a fantastic way for the brands to attach
themselves to influential conversations authentically and
transparently. The brand, the publisher and the audience all benefit."

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Indonesia has approved U.S. oil
major Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) proposal to develop natural gas
fields offshore from East Kalimantan, Borneo island, the mines
and energy minister said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Gehem and Gendalo deepwater natural gas projects would
be the deepest offshore gas fields in Indonesia, at water
depths ranging from 2,500-6,000 feet (760-1,800 metres),
according to an official at oil watchdog BPMIGAS, who declined
to be quoted by name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron previously said that it planned to invest about $6
billion to develop gas fields off the coast of Borneo,
including the Gehem and Gendalo projects, which would help
Indonesia to crank up its flagging gas output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government has agreed to Chevron plans to develop gas
fields offshore East Kalimantan. I signed the Chevron proposal
on August 29," Purnomo Yusgiantoro told Reuters by phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron official in Jakarta said the company was still
waiting for the official government approval of the
Gehem-Gendalo deepwater gas projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron submitted plans to develop several gas fields,
including the Gehem and Gendalo projects, to the government in
August 2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combined natural gas reserves in the area covered by
the plan are estimated at more than 3 trillion cubic feet, the
BPMIGAS official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia, Asia Pacific's only OPEC member, which has far
more gas than oil, has pushed companies to move faster in
developing areas as the country badly needs the gas for
domestic industries and exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron currently produces gas from several other fields in
East Kalimantan, but the output is in decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia, the world's second-biggest liquefied natural gas
(LNG) exporter after Qatar, has been struggling to meet export
commitments due to declining gas output being diverted to the
domestic market.

&lt;p&gt;The report from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration cited said illicit drug use among those aged 55 to 59 more than doubled, to 4.1 percent in 2007 from the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government's annual report assessing illicit drug use in the United States offered a mixed picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that 4.6 percent of men and women ages 18 to 25 reported use of prescription pain drugs for nonmedical reasons in 2007, a 12 percent rise from the previous year, continuing the rising trend of recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 1.7 percent in this age group used cocaine in 2007, a 23 percent drop from 2006, while 0.4 percent of young adults reported using methamphetamines, down by about a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey results were based on interviews with about 67,500 people nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report found that an estimated 19.9 million Americans ages 12 or older used illicit drugs in the month before responding to the survey, accounting for 8 percent of that population, compares to 8.3 percent in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illicit drugs included marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants and prescription drugs used for nonmedical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marijuana was the most common, with an estimated 14.4 million users. The report estimated that 5.8 percent of Americans were marijuana users in 2007, compared to 6 percent in 2006. There were an estimated 2.1 million cocaine users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illicit drug use remained stable among adolescents (ages 12 to 17) last year, the report said, but rates declined between 2002 and 2007, from 11.6 percent to 9.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also said an estimated 24.3 million Americans ages 18 and up experienced serious psychological distress over the past year, and 16.5 million Americans had suffered at least one major depressive episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Will Dunham, editing by Alan Elsner)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott+Scott LLP Files Class Action Lawsuit Against General Electric Company On
Behalf of Investors -- GE

NEW YORK, Sept. 5, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On September 5, 2008, Scott+Scott
LLP filed a class action complaint against General Electric Company ("GE" or the
"Company") (NYSE:GE) and certain officers and directors in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Connecticut. The action is brought on behalf of those
purchasing GE common stock during the period beginning March 12, 2008 and
through April 10, 2008, inclusive (the "Class Period"), for violations of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

If you purchased GE common stock during the Class Period and wish to serve as a
lead plaintiff in the action, you must move the Court no later than September
29, 2008. Any member of the investor class may move the Court to serve as lead
plaintiff through counsel of its choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain
an absent class member. If you wish to discuss this action or have questions
concerning this notice or your rights, please contact Scott+Scott
(scottlaw@scott-scott.com, (800) 404-7770, (860) 537-5537 or visit the
Scott+Scott website, http://www.scott-scott.com) for more information. There is
no cost or fee to you.

The complaint alleges that during the Class Period GE made materially false and
misleading statements regarding, among other things, the Company's 1Q08 earnings
guidance, including earnings per share ("EPS"), the performance of GE's
financial services division, the Company's sale of key real estate assets and
the ability of the Company's Consumer and Industrial division and Healthcare
division to sell certain products. The complaint alleges that defendants
provided a 1Q08 EPS guidance of $.50-.53, and FY08 guidance of $2.42 "or
greater." This would represent EPS growth of 10% at a minimum.

Despite repeated reassurance by GE directly to its investors, however, the
complaint alleges that the Company shocked the market and its investors when it
released its 1Q08 results on April 11, 2008. Instead of reporting a 1Q08 EPS of
$0.50-0.53 and improving on 1Q07 results, as the Company had assured its
investors that it would just weeks before, GE reported a significantly lower
1Q08 EPS of $0.43, down 2% from the 1Q07.

As the market reacted to these disclosures, GE's stock declined $4.70 per share
from $36.75 to close at $32.05 per share on volume of over 366 million shares,
representing a 13% drop that wiped out approximately $47 billion in market
value, at least one analyst is quoted as stating, "The miss and cut to guidance
raises credibility concerns for GE."

Indeed, the complaint alleges, it became clear at the end of the Class Period,
among other things, that defendants had failed to disclose that GE's financial
services division was underperforming prior representations, with the division's
investments materially declining in value such that the Company would be
required to record mark-to-market losses and recognize certain asset
impairments, and that GE's Consumer and Industrial and Healthcare Divisions were
experiencing an inability to sell certain products. Moreover, as alleged in the
complaint, the Company had been depending on selling real estate assets of
approximately $900 million that it had been unable to sell.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The vote of the European
Union's second highest court last year to uphold a European
Commission ruling against Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) came on a 7-6
vote, Bloomberg news reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Court of First Instance never announces its votes, but
Bloomberg said two people with direct knowledge of the outcome
confirmed the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Sept. 17, 2007, the court in Luxembourg upheld the 2004
finding of the European Commission that Microsoft had violated
antitrust laws, for which it was fined 497 million euros and
ordered to change its business practices. Microsoft did not
appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Former court president Bo Vesterdorf came close to
criticizing the decision of his own court in two speeches,
without ever saying how he voted. Vesterdorf's speeches were
made after he left the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The court keeps its votes confidential to present a united
front and to avoid pressure on individual judges by their
countries. It is rare for internal tallies of the court to
leak. By contrast, votes in U.S. appellate courts are announced
publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft had no comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission is continuing to investigate Microsoft on
other violations. As well, it is investigating several other
U.S. technology companies, but on different kinds of charges.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said on
Friday it began restarting its oil refineries in Baton Rouge
and Chalmette, Louisiana, after both plants were shut for days
by Hurricane Gustav.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The Baton Rouge Refinery and Chalmette Refining began a
safe and sequenced start-up process on 5 September," the
company said in a press release. "It is anticipated that
additional units will restart throughout the weekend as we work
to bring the facilities back to normal operations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Baton Rouge plant is the second largest in the country
with a capacity of 503,000 barrels per day. The joint venture
Chalmette refinery has a capacity of 193,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Richard Valdmanis)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N, battered by over $40 billion in write-downs, will incur fresh write-downs, according to a Goldman Sachs research report, and its shares dropped 3.2 percent on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman analyst William Tanona downgraded the stock to a "sell" and reduced his third-quarter estimate by $1 to a loss of $5.75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill, the world's largest brokerage, said last month it would need to take additional write-downs of more than $5 billion in the third quarter after it sold about $30 billion in repackaged debt to Lone Star Funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanona, however, expects Merrill to post even more write-downs, and he added the stock to his Americas conviction sell list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanona said the stock currently trades at the highest price-to-book multiple in his large-cap brokerage universe, despite having some of the most significant exposures to troubled assets like collateralized debt obligations, mortgages and leveraged loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_We expect Merrill's multiple to compress over the coming weeks and months, as third-quarter earnings will mark the fifth consecutive quarterly loss for the company, and its prospects for the fourth quarter of 2008 are not promising enough to warrant this level of a premium to book value," he wrote in a Thursday note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanona cited expectations of higher compensation expense alongside his outlook for large gross write-downs as the reason for his downgrade. He also widened his 2008 loss estimate to $11.55 a share from $10.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also cited a fine of $125 million that the brokerage is due to pay to settle a regulatory dispute over sales of the debt instruments known as auction-rate securities, and the cost of buying them back from retail investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst cut his six-month price target on the stock to $22 from $28.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock was down 84 cents at $25.37 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill shares have fallen more than 50 percent since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore and Elinor Comlay in New York; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy/Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, share movement)

 Sept 5 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities said its top
picks in the European legal publishing sector were news and
information publisher Thomson Reuters Plc TRIL.L and Dutch
publisher Wolters Kluwer (WLSNc.AS), and reiterated an
"overweight" rating on both companies.

 Analyst Mark O'Donnell said while investors were
pessimistic about revenue from Thomson Reuter's markets
division, he already sees scope for consensus on the division's
revenue to be beaten. He also added that he sees an upside to
forecasts from resilient legal and professional segments, and
cost savings.

 According to O'Donnell, Wolters stock is too cheap given
strong visibility into the second-half of the year.

 The analyst maintained a "neutral" rating on Anglo-Dutch
publisher Reed Elsevier (REL.L) (ELSN.AS) and said continued
strong growth and margin improvement were largely priced in.

damage. We hope our contribution will make a meaningful difference in
the affected communities."

&lt;p&gt;CAIRO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Egypt's stock indexes declined on
Sunday, led by a 2.77 percent dip in heavyweight Orascom Telecom
ORTE.CAORTEq.L after Goldman Sachs downgraded it, citing
continuing operating difficulties in Pakistan and Algeria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Orascom Telecom shares ended at a fresh year closing low of
47.65 Egyptian pounds ($8.81), helping drag the benchmark CASE
30 index .CASE30 0.7 percent lower to 8,342.25 points. The
Hermes index .HRMS lost 0.78 percent to 723.28 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Goldman Sachs report had an impact," said Teymour
el-Derini of Beltone Financial. "OT took the market down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs dowgraded OT on Friday to "neutral" from "buy"
and cut its price target to 65 pounds from 100. The news had
helped pull OT's GDR shares down 5.68 percent on Friday, dealers
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall on Sunday, Egypt's broader CIBC index .CIBC was 
0.02 percent lower at 404.74 points as local investors dominated
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a surge in real estate developer Talaat Moustafa
(TMGH.CA) helped temper market losses, gaining 12.58 percent to
6.71 pounds as it continued to recover from declines after the
firm's former chairman was charged in a murder case last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said investors were returning to the stock after the
company said last week it had replaced its chairman and would
meet all its project obligations on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "To an extent, nothing worse can happen to the stock now,"
said Mohamed Tawfiq of Delta Rasmala Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Market heavyweight Orascom Construction Industries
(OCIC.CA)(OCICq.L) also gained, adding 2.11 percent 363 pounds
as traders engaged in bargain hunting. The shares are well below
a year closing high of 485 pounds set in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But several other big caps slipped lower, with investment
bank EFG-Hermes (HRHO.CA)(HRHOq.L) losing 3.16 percent to 47.52
pounds. Telecom Egypt (ETEL.CA)(ETELq.L) dropped 4.34 percent to
15 pounds, and dealers said it was following OT lower.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; Adds panel member, Pfizer comments, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Lisa Richwine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROCKVILLE, Md., Sept 8 (Reuters) - A Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)
drug rejected by U.S. regulators three years ago won support
from an expert advisory panel on Monday for treating women with
the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The committee voted 9-3 that the drug, Fablyn, offered
benefits that outweighed risks such as blood clots. One member
abstained. Pfizer developed the drug with technology from
Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc (LGND.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most panel members said they could not tell if a higher
rate of deaths among Fablyn patients represented a true
increase. Many said the drug could appeal to some women as an
alternative to other therapies with their own hazards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The panel felt, overall, women would benefit from having
this drug available," said Dr. Sandra Carson, the panel's
chairwoman and the director of reproductive medicine and
infertility at Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Food and Drug Administration will weigh the advice
before deciding if Fablyn can be sold. The FDA usually follows
panel recommendations. A ruling is expected in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than 200 million people worldwide have osteoporosis,
which weakens bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Panel members felt Fablyn would be most likely to help
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who were at high risk of
fractures, Carson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some said the drug should be reserved for women who do not
tolerate other medicines known as bisphosphonates. That
category includes Merck  Co Inc's (MRK.N) Fosamax, which is
sold generically as alendronate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, is looking for new
medicines to help it survive generic competition as early as
2011 to cholesterol fighter Lipitor, which has sales of $13
billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cowen and Co estimates Fablyn will garner annual sales of
$250 million by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDA rejected Pfizer's bid to sell the once-a-day pill
for osteoporosis in 2005 with the name Oporia and again in 2006
for vaginal atrophy. Pfizer said the agency was concerned at
the time about a possible risk of endometrial cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Pfizer's latest data, 6.4 percent of placebo patients
developed new or worsening fractures within three years. That
compared with 3.8 percent given the proposed Fablyn dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But more women died while taking a lower dose of Fablyn
than with a placebo. Pfizer said the difference was due to a
small number of deaths in the placebo group in one region and
was not linked to the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seven panel members said they were unable to tell if the
finding reflected a true mortality increase with the drug. Four
panelists said the data did not support a higher rate, while
two said it did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The panel also voted 9-2, with two abstentions, that blood
clot concerns were no greater for Fablyn than with hormonal
drugs already sold for osteoporosis or menopause symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumer representative Merrill Goozner of the Center for
Science in the Public Interest said too little was known about
serious risks from Fablyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I can't really figure out what the risks are based on the
data," said Goozner, who voted against the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fablyn belongs to a class of drugs known as selective
estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs, which includes Eli
Lilly and Co's (LLY.N) osteoporosis drug, Evista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fablyn's generic name is lasofoxifene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Fablyn is approved, Ligand will receive a milestone
payment and royalties of 3 percent of net sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer spokesman Jack Cox said the company "will continue
to work with FDA on any outstanding questions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares gained 3.4 percent to close at $19.14 on the
New York Stock Exchange, while Ligand shares rose 10.9 percent
to close at $3.56 on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;Data to Be Presented At ESMO 2008 Highlight Pfizer Commitment to Cancer Care and Research

    Data on SUTENT(R) and Investigational Agent CP-751,871 Will be
                  Presented at the 33rd ESMO Congress
STOCKHOLM, Sweden--(Business Wire)--

   Other Pfizer Compounds:

   Data on the following compounds will also be presented at ESMO:
Aromasin((R)) (exemestane), Campto((R)) (irinotecan HCl), axitinib and
tremelimumab.

   About SUTENT((R)) (sunitinib malate)

   Sunitinib, an oral treatment, was approved in Europe as a first
line treatment for mRCC in January 2007. Sunitinib is also indicated
for the treatment of unresectable and/or metastatic malignant
gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) after failure of imatinib
mesylate.

   SUTENT works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in
the growth, proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important
sunitinib malate targets, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
(VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are
expressed by many types of solid tumours, and are thought to play a
crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumours acquire
blood vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. SUTENT also
inhibits other targets important to tumour growth, including KIT, FLT3
and RET.

   Important SUTENT((R)) (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

   The recommended starting dose for Sutent is 50 mg once daily for
four weeks followed by two weeks off. The dose can be modified in 12.5
mg increments not to exceed 75 mg or decrease below 25 mg. Sutent is
available in 12.5 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg capsules. Please refer to the
Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for additional dosing
recommendations regarding co-administration with cytochrome P450 3A4
inducers or inhibitors.

   Adverse events (AEs) were generally mild to moderate. Most adverse
events were reversible, and generally did not result in
discontinuation. In clinical trials, the most common treatment related
adverse events (greater than20%) included fatigue; gastrointestinal
disorders, such as diarrhoea, nausea, stomatitis, dyspepsia, and
vomiting; skin discoloration; dysgeusia (loss of taste); and anorexia.
Fatigue, hypertension and neutropenia were the most common grade 3
treatment related adverse events. Increased lipase (2%) was the most
common grade 4 treatment related adverse event. Hepatitis and hepatic
failure occurred in less than1% of patients and prolonged QT interval
events occurred in less than 0.1%.

   The most important treatment related serious adverse events
associated with Sutent treatment of solid tumour patients were
pulmonary embolism (1%), thrombocytopenia (1%), tumour haemorrhage
(0.9%), febrile neutropenia (0.4%), and hypertension (0.4%). Patients
should be screened for hypertension and appropriately controlled with
medical management. Temporary suspension of Sutent is recommended in
patients with severe hypertension that is not controlled with medical
management.

   Developed by Pfizer, Sutent is being studied alone and in
combination with other medicines as a potential treatment for a number
of other solid tumours, including breast, lung, prostate, and
colorectal cancers.

   About CP-751,871

   CP-751,871, a fully human monoclonal antibody, is a highly
specific inhibitor of the IGF-1R pathway. The IGF-1R pathway is one of
the key signaling pathways in cancer cells that lead to uncontrolled
growth and survival of tumour cells.

   Pfizer initiated a global Phase III clinical trial registration
program for CP-751,871 in NSCLC. The program initially includes two
studies in patients with non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC; ADVIGO 1016 in
first-line patients and ADVIGO 1018 in refractory patients. In
addition, Pfizer is studying CP-751,871 in clinical trials for the
potential treatment of many other cancers, including prostate, breast
and colon cancers and Ewing's sarcoma. To date, more than 700 patients
have participated in CP-751,871 clinical trials in multiple tumour
types.

&lt;p&gt;ROCKVILLE, Maryland (Reuters) - Members of a U.S. advisory panel said on Monday they could not determine if a proposed Pfizer Inc drug for osteoporosis increased the chances of dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven members of the Food and Drug Administration committee said they could not tell if the drug, Fablyn, was responsible for a higher rate of deaths among women given a low dose in a study. Four panelists said the data did not reflect a true mortality increase, while two said it did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee also voted 9-2 with two abstentions that blood clot concerns were no greater than with other similar drugs already approved by the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel was set to vote later on Monday on whether the drug's benefits outweigh its risks. Pfizer developed the drug with technology from Ligand Pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

--  Technologies incubating in IBM's labs such as the long-term
archiving project, solid state technologies, memory breakthroughs,
real-time decision making to further enhance future storage offerings
(see separate release on http://www.ibm.com/press).

    
IBM today announced its largest launch ever of new storage hardware,
software and services that are the building blocks for the world's
strongest information infrastructure portfolio. The new IBM offerings are
designed to enable businesses, governments and other institutions to
transform static data managed in silos into more dynamic information that
is accessible by individuals wherever they go in a cloud computing
environment.

    As consumers now look to "take their information" with them -- improving
their healthcare, security, entertainment, social life and consumer
experience anytime, around the globe, in real time -- businesses are
struggling with outdated data centers, which are unable to handle the
increased information management demands.

    The proliferation of the mobile web, connected sensors everywhere, from
cars to pipelines, online medical records, and the explosive growth of Web
2.0 data and social networking, are leading to 16-fold growth in each
individual's "information footprint" by 2020, according to IBM.
Infrastructures need to adapt today to meet this demand.

    In response, IBM today delivered critical elements for an information
infrastructure as part of its New Enterprise Data Center strategy. These
elements focus on the availability, compliance and retention, and security
pain points for clients as they re-design their data centers. More than 30
new and upgraded products and services are being introduced across the IBM
portfolio to meet these critical needs:

    Internet-Scale Availability: Today's infrastructure is not designed to
efficiently manage the estimated two billion people who will be on the Web
by 2011(3) nor the expected one trillion connected objects -- cars,
appliances, cameras, roadways, pipelines -- comprising "the Internet of
things." Cost-effective, scale-out technologies are needed as an essential
element of a client's information infrastructure to enable Internet scale
and speed for the management of vast amounts of online information within
an organization and out to billions of individuals. Businesses must be
prepared for this new phase of "cloud computing," giving consumers access
to data and systems remotely, from any device, anywhere. To meet these
needs, IBM announced a series of products and offerings enabling Internet
Scale Availability. Among the highlights:


--  An entirely new, highly scalable disk storage system designed to
handle today's diverse mix of information -- from Web 2.0 to
traditional applications such as financial services.  Developed from
the XIV acquisition in January, this new enterprise disk offering
features a unique grid-based architecture that offers easier
management, greater performance scalability, self-tuning/healing and
thin provisioning to help reduce the cost and complexity of information
storage while enabling consistently quick access of data for today's
dynamic range of workloads.  More information on the IBM XIV system can
be found here:
http://www.ibm.com/systems/storage/disk/xiv/index.html
--  Designed to meet demanding mid-range data center requirements, IBM
is introducing a new disk storage system which can add interfaces,
increase performance, grow capacity as Internet scale demands, and be
reconfigured on-the-fly.  More information on the DS5000 can be found
here: http://www.ibm.com/systems/storage/disk/ds5000/index.html
--  IBM is offering new storage virtualization software that helps
clients more efficiently manage and consolidate volumes of business
data, providing clients with a storage solution designed to help
improve utilization rates, energy efficiency, availability, and
scalability of critical applications.  More information on SVC can be
found here:
http://www.ibm.com/systems/storage/software/virtualization/svc/index.html

--  As a means to support storage optimization, IBM is announcing new
scale out file services (SOFS), flexible storage virtualization
services that will help alleviate data storage challenges by enabling
quick implementation of highly scalable, global, clustered network
attached storage systems.  More information on SOFS can be found here:
http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/its/html/sofs-landing.html

    
Consolidation and Retention: Today's information infrastructure
suffers from massive inefficiency in both duplicate sources of the same
information and excessive energy costs. Leading analysts have stated that
50 percent of data centers will run out of power or space for their data
centers sometime in 2008(4) and the energy consumed by U.S. data centers
will grow from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent of the nation's total energy
consumption over the next five years.(5) To meet these needs, IBM
announced a series of products and offerings enabling data center
consolidation and retention. Among the highlights:


--  IBM is delivering new data de-duplication software and hardware
from the Diligent Technologies acquisition in April, which may help
clients reduce redundant data by a factor of up to 25:1(6) More
information on the IBM ProtecTier offering can be found here:
http://www.ibm.com/systems/storage/tape/ts7650g/index.html
--  To help clients retain and back-up copies of their critical data
off-site, and ensure the continuous availability of e-mail and mission
critical applications and data on site in the event of a disaster, IBM
is introducing Onsite and Remote Data Protection offerings through its
acquisition of Arsenal.  More information can be found here:
http://www.935.ibm.com/services/us/index.wss/offerfamily/bcrs/a1026934

--  Physical space is a huge problem for data centers today as they
look to consolidate, so a new high density tape storage library frame
is being introduced that can hold up to three-times more cartridges in
a 10 square foot footprint, providing nearly twice the storage density
of Sun(7).  More information on the TS3500 can be found here:
http://www.ibm.com/systems/storage/tape/ts3500/index.html
--  IBM is introducing an upgraded high end disk offering that adds
more IBM mainframe storage functionality for customers dealing with
large database growth in their mainframes.  The updated disk offering
will also have RAID 6 protection -- while delivering 50 percent more
storage capacity(8) in the same footprint with new, higher capacity,
performance-optimized drives -- allowing clients to keep data center
costs and energy usage down.  More information on the DS8000 can be
found here:
http://www.ibm.com/systems/storage/disk/ds8000/index.html

    
Security: Ensuring that the information in a data center is secure and
being accessed only by those authorized has become a top concern for all
data centers -- large and small. A recent data center hack cost one
company more than $60 million dollars in damages through theft of data and
unauthorized use of credit card information of consumers.(9) Meanwhile,
the availability and authentication of data -- from massive corporate and
government databases to the 1 billion people expected to be using the
mobile web(10) this year -- is a key priority.


--  IBM is enhancing its leading compliance disk storage offering with
enhanced drives that will enable 33 percent more disk capacity.(11)
Unlike the EMC Centera(12), the IBM system allows partitioning to run
third-party ISV applications and leverages both disk and tape, allowing
clients to reduce their total cost of ownership and power consumption
up to 50 percent.(13) More information on the DR550 can be found here:
http://www.ibm.com/systems/storage/disk/dr/index.html
--  IBM is formally offering clients the world's fastest one terabyte
storage tape drive, far surpassing the current Sun offering(14), to
help them protect and archive more information with less cost and less
energy usage.  Storing up to one terabyte of uncompressed data per tape
cartridge, storage backups can be completed up to 54 percent faster
than the previous IBM generation drive.  More information on the TS1130
can be found here:
http://www.ibm.com/systems/storage/tape/ts1130/index.html
--  In the emerging area of information security and  encryption key
management for storage -- where information is "locked" and can only be
accessed by users who have "keys," IBM will release new Tivoli Key
Lifecycle Management software, which helps automate the management of
keys where disk and tape storage devices cannot be compromised if lost
or stolen.  More information on TKLM can be found here:
http://www-01.ibm.com/software/tivoli/solutions/security/
--  To help clients cost-effectively monitor, secure and manage their
IT infrastructures while addressing increasing workloads, IBM is
announcing new Remote Managed Infrastructure Services (RMIS). These
services offer clients a new model for efficient IT management and
security with minimal disruption to existing environments, allowing
clients to maintain their existing assets on-site.  More information on
RMIS can be found here:
http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/its/html/rmis-landing.html

    
More than 30 new products and services from IBM Systems and Technology
Group, IBM Software Group and IBM Research were announced today,
supporting the information infrastructure pillar of IBM's New Enterprise
Data Center strategy. Coupled with new announcements from IBM's Global
Technology Services business, IBM aligns critical storage usage to a
client's direct business priorities, helps them reduce the risk, cost,
complexity and planning efforts required for large data migrations, and
delivers strategic IBM design and implementation services to target
client pain-points. For a full listing of all the products and services
announced today, please visit
http://www.ibm.com/systems/storage/products/showcase/index.html

    Through home-grown innovation, development and acquisitions, today's
announcement marks a $2 billion investment, three years of research and
development, and a global team of more than 2,500 storage technical
professionals, engineers and researchers from nine different countries
including France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, Switzerland,
United States, and the United Kingdom. Key acquisitions of XIV, Diligent,
Cognos, Arsenal, Optim, FilesX, Softek, and NovusCG over the last 24
months add strategic pieces to the strongest ever information
infrastructure portfolio of offerings unveiled today.

    "The world is re-tooling its underlying IT infrastructure in a dramatic
shift away from a decades-old client/server model to a radically more
efficient Internet-style architecture. This requires different thinking
and new capabilities, which we are addressing in this information
infrastructure launch, with our investments going forward, and how IBM
will do business with our clients," said Andy Monshaw, General Manager,
IBM System Storage. "There is no bigger opportunity for our clients than
to unlock the value they have in their data centers and help them create
smart, innovative offerings for their end users -- the consumer. IBM is
the only company in the world -- not HP, not EMC, not Sun -- with decades
of research, industry knowledge, market leadership and the end-to-end
capabilities to make this a reality for our clients."

    To help clients accelerate their data center transformation initiatives
and integrate these new IBM information infrastructure offerings into
their data centers, IBM is also announcing the global opening of the New
Enterprise Data Center Leadership Centers. At these new centers, more than
500 IBM engineers and experts across locations in the U.S. and Europe will
work with clients and focus on solutions and best practices around energy
efficiency, consolidation and virtualization, business resiliency and
security and service management and information infrastructure. More
information can be found here:
http://www.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/web/leadershipcenters

    These new tools and offerings for the IBM information infrastructure will
allow clients to streamline their data centers with highly integrated
storage offerings focused around archive, compliance, retention, and
security pain points to help clients deliver information as a service to
their customers -- the consumers, who are looking for access to
information at any time from any device. These tools and technology
resources which IBM has been developing and amassing, open doors to new
industry collaborations, and on demand storage technologies -- a key
pillar in the emergence of cloud computing.

    IBM Global Financing, the lending and leasing business segment of IBM,
offers low-rate financing and environmentally safe storage asset disposal
for this comprehensive suite of new information infrastructure offerings.
IBM Global Financing rates are as low as 4.6% for hardware purchases; 4.8%

large database growth in their mainframes.  The updated disk offering
will also have RAID 6 protection -- while delivering 50 percent more
storage capacity(8) in the same footprint with new, higher capacity,
performance-optimized drives -- allowing clients to keep data center
costs and energy usage down.  More information on the DS8000 can be
found here:
http://www.ibm.com/systems/storage/disk/ds8000/index.html

    
Security: Ensuring that the information in a data center is secure and
being accessed only by those authorized has become a top concern for all
data centers -- large and small. A recent data center hack cost one
company more than $60 million dollars in damages through theft of data and
unauthorized use of credit card information of consumers.(9) Meanwhile,
the availability and authentication of data -- from massive corporate and
government databases to the 1 billion people expected to be using the
mobile web(10) this year -- is a key priority.


--  IBM is enhancing its leading compliance disk storage offering with
enhanced drives that will enable 33 percent more disk capacity.(11)
Unlike the EMC Centera(12), the IBM system allows partitioning to run
third-party ISV applications and leverages both disk and tape, allowing
clients to reduce their total cost of ownership and power consumption
up to 50 percent.(13) More information on the DR550 can be found here:
http://www.ibm.com/systems/storage/disk/dr/index.html
--  IBM is formally offering clients the world's fastest one terabyte
storage tape drive, far surpassing the current Sun offering(14), to
help them protect and archive more information with less cost and less
energy usage.  Storing up to one terabyte of uncompressed data per tape
cartridge, storage backups can be completed up to 54 percent faster
than the previous IBM generation drive.  More information on the TS1130
can be found here:
http://www.ibm.com/systems/storage/tape/ts1130/index.html
--  In the emerging area of information security and  encryption key
management for storage -- where information is "locked" and can only be
accessed by users who have "keys," IBM will release new Tivoli Key
Lifecycle Management software, which helps automate the management of
keys where disk and tape storage devices cannot be compromised if lost
or stolen.  More information on TKLM can be found here:
http://www-01.ibm.com/software/tivoli/solutions/security/
--  To help clients cost-effectively monitor, secure and manage their
IT infrastructures while addressing increasing workloads, IBM is
announcing new Remote Managed Infrastructure Services (RMIS). These
services offer clients a new model for efficient IT management and
security with minimal disruption to existing environments, allowing
clients to maintain their existing assets on-site.  More information on
RMIS can be found here:

&lt;p&gt;  MONTPELLIER, FRANCE and ARMONK, NY and TOKYO, Sep 08
(MARKET WIRE) -- 
As part of IBM's (NYSE: IBM) largest launch ever of new storage hardware,
software and services -- the building blocks for the world's strongest
information infrastructure portfolio -- the company today outlined
next-generation technologies incubating in IBM's labs that could further
enhance future information infrastructure offerings.

    The IBM future technologies are designed to enable businesses, governments
and other institutions to transform static data managed in silos into more
dynamic information that is accessible by individuals wherever they go in
a cloud computing environment. Among the highlights:

    Preventing a Digital Dark Age: As the volume of digital information
continues to grow, individuals and businesses alike will face
ever-growing data archiving and retention problems. Data generated 20
years ago on a 5.25 inch floppy disk will likely become impossible to
access in the near future; as the world becomes digital, clients may be
entering a new "Dark Age" in which business, public and personal assets
are in danger of being lost due to changing technologies. IBM Research is
leading the charge to preserve myriad types of information, such as
scientific, financial, healthcare, artistic, and cultural data for tens
and even hundreds of years.

    Breakthrough Storage Performance: Engineers and researchers at the IBM
Hursley development lab in England and the Almaden Research Center in
California have demonstrated groundbreaking performance results that
outperform the world's fastest disk storage solution by over 250 percent.
IBM has demonstrated, for the first time, the game-changing impact
solid-state technologies can have on how businesses and individuals
manage and access information. The results were achieved using Flash
solid-state technology coupled with IBM's industry leading, highly
scalable storage virtualization technology. Under the codename "Project
Quicksilver," IBM achieved groundbreaking results in transferring data at
a sustained rate of over one million Input/Output (I/O) per second --
with a response time of under one millisecond (ms). Compared to the
fastest industry benchmarked disk system, Quicksilver improved
performance(1) by 250 percent at less than 1/20th the response time, took
up 1/5th the floor space and required only 55 percent of the power and
cooling.

    A New Revolution in Storage Technology: In April, IBM outlined a computer
memory milestone that could lead to electronic devices capable of storing
far more data in the same amount of space than is possible today. Within
the next ten years, "racetrack" memory, so named because the data "races"
around the nanoscale wire "track," could lead to solid state electronic
devices -- with no moving parts, and therefore more durable -- capable of
holding far more data in the same amount of space than is possible today.
For example, this technology could enable a handheld device such as an
mp3 player to store about 500,000 songs or 3,500 movies, 100-times what
is possible today with far lower cost and power consumption.

    Unparalleled Processing of Real Time Data: IBM's System S rapidly
analyzes data as it streams from a variety of sources to help
organizations increase the speed and accuracy of decision making. Today
for example, a financial services client is piloting stream computing
from IBM -- IBM Stream Computing Software running on an IBM Blue Gene
supercomputer -- to examine thousands of real-time information sources to
capitalize on up-to-the-minute market changes.

    New Computing Paradigms for Business Advantage: IBM is working on select
prototypes of Information Cloud Services to deploy its information
infrastructure across groups of servers accessed remotely (from the
"cloud") from a variety of devices.

    Power Management for Storage: As servers become larger and faster, our
disks and their capacities are also becoming bigger. Meanwhile,
components are getting smaller and speedier -- creating more IT heat
density. Reducing the energy consumption of IT systems is a major
challenge. Until now, power management for storage systems has been
limited, but this is all changing. After intensive studies of the factors
that affect power usage in storage systems, IBM researchers have
developed new algorithms and models that are being incorporated into IBM
capacity planning tools to estimate the power consumption of different
storage controller components for various workloads characteristics.
These technologies are targeted at helping SMBs, archives, and
enterprises better manage their storage power resources.

    More than 30 new products and services from IBM Systems and Technology
Group, IBM Software Group and IBM Research were announced today,
supporting the information infrastructure pillar of IBM's New Enterprise
Data Center strategy. Coupled with new announcements from IBM's Global
Technology Services business, IBM aligns critical storage usage to a
client's direct business priorities, helps them reduce the risk, cost,
complexity and planning efforts required for large data migrations, and
delivers strategic IBM design and implementation services to target
client pain-points. For a full listing of all the products and services

&lt;p&gt;First-of-its-Kind Process to Effectively Guide Target Date Fund Selection
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


JPMorgan Asset Management ("JPMAM") today announced the launch of the
first-of-its-kind resource, JPMorgan's 'Target Date Navigator(SM)', a patent
pending evaluation process to help advisors and their plan sponsor clients
identify target date funds most closely aligned to a plan's goals and
participants' savings behavior.

Designed and created by JPMorgan's retirement and investment professionals,
'Target Date Navigator' is the first framework to categorize funds according to
their investment composition and glide path strategy, creating a map of the
target date fund universe. Since not all target date funds are created equal and
generally differ according to their investment time horizons and level of asset
class diversification, this tool fills a necessary void in the marketplace in
determining which funds might best fit the particular needs and the goals of
each retirement plan. 'Target Date Navigator' should also assist advisors and
their plan sponsor clients to ensure fiduciary responsibilities are being
addressed and that plans are compliant with qualified default investment
alternative ("QDIA") guidelines.

Since target date funds are becoming the most popular option chosen for QDIAs,
JPMAM believes that more can be done to help advisors and their plan sponsor
clients distinguish between competing funds and address fiduciary
responsibilities in the selection and monitoring of these investments.

"What we have found in the marketplace is a real disconnect in the alignment of
participants' behaviors and needs, plan sponsors' goals, and target date
strategy selection," said David Musto, Managing Director of Retail Investment
Only Retirement, JPMorgan Asset Management. "Retirement advisors and plan
sponsors have been hungry for an easy to use and intuitive target date
evaluation solution."

"We believe our process and tool-set will provide the marketplace with an
elegant solution. In the hands of independent advisors, this could become the
industry standard for target date fund categorization."

Using JPMorgan's 'Target Date Navigator' involves the following three step
process:

-Assessing the plan's desired level of equity exposure for participants at or
near retirement,

-Determining the plan's philosophy regarding asset class diversification,

-Comparing and selecting the most appropriate target date funds using JPMorgan's
'Target Date Compass(SM)'.

"The Navigator does not favor any specific type of target date strategy. What it
does is distinguish the differences between various funds and helps advisors and
plan sponsors select a good fit for their plan sponsor clients and
participants," added Mr. Musto.

"We take pride in our efforts to question current practices and false
assumptions, and deliver real world applications that we believe may lead to
more successful retirement outcomes for American workers. The bedrock of our
insights and expertise in developing this tool is based on our own studies of
the target date fund environment and 401(k) participant behavior. We look
forward to working with the industry to help advisors and plan sponsors assess
the target date fund universe effectively."

JPMorgan is already in discussion with a select group of advisors and plan
sponsors to begin the rollout of the JPMorgan 'Target Date Navigator' this
month.

About JPMorgan Asset Management:

&lt;p&gt;First-of-its-Kind Process to Effectively Guide Target Date Fund
                               Selection
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Asset Management ("JPMAM") today announced the launch of
the first-of-its-kind resource, JPMorgan's 'Target Date
Navigator(SM)', a patent pending evaluation process to help advisors
and their plan sponsor clients identify target date funds most closely
aligned to a plan's goals and participants' savings behavior.

   Designed and created by JPMorgan's retirement and investment
professionals, 'Target Date Navigator' is the first framework to
categorize funds according to their investment composition and glide
path strategy, creating a map of the target date fund universe. Since
not all target date funds are created equal and generally differ
according to their investment time horizons and level of asset class
diversification, this tool fills a necessary void in the marketplace
in determining which funds might best fit the particular needs and the
goals of each retirement plan. 'Target Date Navigator' should also
assist advisors and their plan sponsor clients to ensure fiduciary
responsibilities are being addressed and that plans are compliant with
qualified default investment alternative ("QDIA") guidelines.

   Since target date funds are becoming the most popular option
chosen for QDIAs, JPMAM believes that more can be done to help
advisors and their plan sponsor clients distinguish between competing
funds and address fiduciary responsibilities in the selection and
monitoring of these investments.

   "What we have found in the marketplace is a real disconnect in the
alignment of participants' behaviors and needs, plan sponsors' goals,
and target date strategy selection," said David Musto, Managing
Director of Retail Investment Only Retirement, JPMorgan Asset
Management. "Retirement advisors and plan sponsors have been hungry
for an easy to use and intuitive target date evaluation solution."

   "We believe our process and tool-set will provide the marketplace
with an elegant solution. In the hands of independent advisors, this
could become the industry standard for target date fund
categorization."

   Using JPMorgan's 'Target Date Navigator' involves the following
three step process:

   -Assessing the plan's desired level of equity exposure for
participants at or near retirement,

   -Determining the plan's philosophy regarding asset class
diversification,

   -Comparing and selecting the most appropriate target date funds
using JPMorgan's 'Target Date Compass(SM)'.

   "The Navigator does not favor any specific type of target date
strategy. What it does is distinguish the differences between various
funds and helps advisors and plan sponsors select a good fit for their
plan sponsor clients and participants," added Mr. Musto.

   "We take pride in our efforts to question current practices and
false assumptions, and deliver real world applications that we believe
may lead to more successful retirement outcomes for American workers.
The bedrock of our insights and expertise in developing this tool is
based on our own studies of the target date fund environment and
401(k) participant behavior. We look forward to working with the
industry to help advisors and plan sponsors assess the target date
fund universe effectively."

   JPMorgan is already in discussion with a select group of advisors
and plan sponsors to begin the rollout of the JPMorgan 'Target Date
Navigator' this month.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs added Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) to its list of favorite technology names and said a recent survey suggested business improvement, helping Cisco shares rise 2 percent by mid-morning on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman analyst Simona Jankowski said a survey found that the percentage of companies that expect their network equipment spending to increase jumped to 54 percent from 42 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jankowski said Cisco could exceed its own estimates and the company's financial analyst conference on September 16 could provide a "positive catalyst."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite a cautious near-term view of the business driven by the macro environment, we expect management to maintain its bullish long-term 12 to 17 percent growth outlook, and provide details around its strategy, product roadmap and business positioning that could bolster investors' confidence in those targets," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco shares were added to the Goldman Sachs Technology Framework's Favorite Growth list, and Jankowski said they appeared to be "very attractive" at 15 times earnings estimate for calendar 2009, below the sector's median of 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco's shares were up 48 cents at $22.74. The broader market was also up on Monday on news that the U.S. government had seized control of the troubled mortgage companies to stem market turbulence.

&lt;p&gt;  MCLEAN, VA, Sep 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
CIBT, Inc. (http://www.cibt.com), the world's largest visa and passport
expediter, has been named an exclusive agent to help travelers obtain
visas for Russia. CIBT was selected as a result of the decision by the
Russian Embassy, Washington, D.C. to no longer process any visa
applications received via regular or overnight mail effective September
8, 2008. All mailed items received after that time will be either
returned or forwarded to CIBT for processing based on the preference of
the applicant.

    "CIBT is proud to have been chosen by the Russian Embassy to help people
in America obtain Russian visas quickly and efficiently," said Jeff Fine,
CEO of CIBT. "As the leading processor of visas for globe trotting
executives and leisure travelers, CIBT has the knowledge and experience
necessary to meet the demands of business people and tourists planning to
visit Russia."

    On its website, the Consular Division of the Russian Embassy in
Washington, D.C. has stated that, "In order to streamline and improve the
visa obtaining process, as well as for security concerns, the Russian visa
section will abandon the practice of processing the visa applications by
mail starting September 8, 2008."

    The Russian Embassy provides visas and other consular services to
travelers living in Maryland, the District of Columbia, Virginia, West
Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan.

    Travel to Russia by both tourists and business executives has increased
dramatically. The International Trade Administration reports that more
than 317,000 Americans visited Russia in 2007, the last year statistics
are available. Travel industry sources indicate that Russian travel has
increased at least 10 percent annually due to strong growth by both
business and leisure travel to Russia.

www.russianembassy.org and at www.CIBT.com/russianvisa.

&lt;p&gt;SOA Consortium Releases New Podcast from Ed Lynch, IBM Corporation on SOA, Event Processing and Business Process Management

NEEDHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
The SOA Consortium(TM) today announced the availability of a
podcast and slide deck of the presentation by Ed Lynch, Product
Manager and Integration Executive, IBM Corporation on "SOA, Event
Processing and Business Process Management," recorded at the SOA
Consortium meeting in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, in June. To access the
podcast, visit http://www.soa-consortium.org/pr-el.

   One focus area of the last SOA Consortium meeting was on combining
SOA and Event Processing to deliver business capability. Ed Lynch
shared his view that SOA and Event Processing come together within
Business Process Management.

   Ed referenced an IBM Enterprise of the Future CEO study, which
speaks to a business environment of accelerating change, brought on by
globalization, constant connectivity, doubling data and burgeoning
competition. To cope with this torrent of change, executives require
two things. First, they need visibility into their businesses, in
real-time. Second, those businesses need to be agile. Businesses must
be able to respond quickly to opportunities and threats, or risk
losing market share to existing or new competitors. With that business
backdrop, Ed shared the basic constructs of event processing and then
made the connection to services and business processes. Bridging the
conceptual and reality, Ed described several customer examples,
including fleet management, customer loyalty programs, algorithmic
trading, business activity monitoring and fraud detection.

   To hear all of the insights Ed Lynch presented, download the
49-minute podcast and accompanying slide presentation at
http://www.soa-consortium.org/pr-el.

   About the Speaker

   Ed Lynch is a Product Manager in the IBM WebSphere brand. He is
also the Integration Executive responsible for the AptSoft
acquisition. Ed is based in Toronto, Canada. He is responsible for
overseeing the product and investment strategy for the WebSphere
Business Process Management family of products, a portfolio, which
includes WebSphere Business Events. He has spent 24 years at IBM.

&lt;p&gt;EldoS Corporation's New Software Securely Connects and Transforms Data for Microsoft(R) SQL Server Users

   New Software Product Ensures Secure Data Connection and Processing
for Companies that Run Microsoft SQL Server
LONDON--(Business Wire)--
EldoS Corporation announces today the release of a new software
product for the corporate market, providing comprehensive security
enhancements for Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).
Customers will benefit from direct secure connections to SSH-, SFTP-,
FTPS-servers through newly developed connectors. Among other
significant benefits is an ability to encrypt/decrypt operations using
OpenPGP and PKI technology implemented as Microsoft SQL tasks, as well
as support of native security of PDF and XML files and other features,
detailed below. Put together, this software release dramatically
improves secure connectivity and data transformations within
distributed business servers' infrastructure.

   EldoS Corporation is the recognized leader on the market of
security components for software development. For many years, EldoS
SecureBlackbox family is guarantying security of countless software
products used all over the world. A huge demand from corporations for
secure data storage and transfer prompted EldoS to release an addition
to the SecureBlackbox family targeted at the market of Microsoft SQL
Server owners. Currently, with Microsoft SQL Server being a widespread
platform, the set of tasks and connectors for SSIS bringing security
to the level of modern requirements and latest standards, is a natural
fit.

   "During communications with our corporate clients, engineers of
EldoS Corporation often receive complaints about lack of solutions for
SSIS providing secure communication abilities," says Eugene Mayevski,
EldoS CTO. "Use of standard SSIS FTP connector for file exchange with
remote server is insecure and unacceptable in the majority of cases.
This is why release of SecureBlackbox for Microsoft SQL Server is such
a welcome event. Communications of your SSIS will be expanded by newly
developed connectors which support secured access to remote SFTP-,
FTPS-, and SSH-servers. Your toolbox will also include a new connector
adding possibility to send an e-mail from mail-servers via secure
protocol SMTP. SecureBlackbox for Microsoft SQL Server expands the
list of SSIS tasks accessible to you, and, what is especially
important; these tasks are powered by the most current cryptographic
protection. We are offering complete implementation of OpenPGP for
encryption/decryption operations, plus reliable security support for
your files in PDF, XML and other formats by established cryptographic
algorithms and technologies. You will also benefit from powerful PKI
technology for creating and verifying digital signatures,
encrypting/decrypting data and files. And, last but not least, you
will be able to run tasks that send commands to remote SSH-servers,
upload and download files securely by SFTP and FTPS protocols."

   The release of SecureBlackbox for Microsoft SQL Server is now
available for evaluation. The software can be downloaded from the
corporate website. After successful June 2008 release of
SecureBlackbox for BizTalk, EldoS Corporation is currently expanding
its SecureBlackbox for Business Servers family. Moreover, preview
version of SecureBlackbox for Windows Workflow Foundation (WWF) is
already available for download and early evaluation. Please look for
additional information at www.eldos.com.

   About EldoS Corporation

   EldoS Corporation focuses on developing security, communication
and driver-based software solutions. The software offered by EldoS
Corporation is used in over 70 countries on 5 continents by a number
of small to large-scale companies and organizations, including
financial institutes and military.

        and encryption

&lt;p&gt;Combined Offering Expected to Benefit Underserved Mid-Market by
  Offering Reduced Cost, Superior Flexibility for Web-Based Workloads
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
AMD (NYSE: AMD) today announced the availability of robust new
virtualization solutions powered by a combination of technologies from
AMD and Microsoft Corp. This new deployment model uses AMD Opteron(TM)
processors with AMD Virtualization(TM) (AMD-V(TM)) technology together
with Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V to deliver significant
efficiencies to enterprises large and small. Mid-market companies in
particular, which have traditionally been slower to implement
virtualization, can take advantage of the combined AMD and Microsoft
product offering to help reduce cost, complexity and energy
consumption.

   "AMD has taken a leading role in driving virtualization innovation
into the x86 processor, helping to meet a compelling need in the
commercial market for cost reduction, increased performance and energy
efficiency," said Kevin Knox, vice president of Worldwide Commercial
Business, AMD. "Now, through our continued partnership with Microsoft,
AMD is expanding virtualization's reach and the benefits of resource
consolidation to companies that might not have taken advantage of
virtualization in the past."

   Resource consolidation achieved through virtualization can deliver
the low energy consumption, and superior utilization and manageability
demanded by today's businesses. AMD Opteron processors and Microsoft
Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V, a hypervisor-based virtualization feature
of Microsoft Windows Server 2008, allow OEMs, VARs and Solution
Providers to offer a valuable server virtualization combination to
help increase their competitive edge and market opportunity. AMD-V
technology and Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V also help enable businesses
to scale according to demands, boosting the efficiency of workloads.

   "AMD and Microsoft have a history of working closely together to
design industry-leading solutions that allow customers to maximize
their investments and stay ahead of the changing business landscape,"
said Bob Kelly, corporate vice president of Microsoft Infrastructure
Server Marketing. "Virtualization is here to stay, and Microsoft's
portfolio of virtualization software combined with technology like
AMD-V will help a business of any size realize its potential."

   Increased Flexibility for the Mid-Market

   Mid-market companies are often faced with legacy applications and
hardware, integration challenges and cost constraints. The
efficiencies and flexibility promised through the combined AMD and
Microsoft product offering is expected to particularly benefit this
underserved market segment.

   "We implemented virtualization for manageability purposes, but
rapidly adopted the AMD and Microsoft solution for its multiple
benefits," said David P. Smith, Chief Technology Officer, ServiceU
Corporation, an on-demand event management software provider. "Through
the use of power-efficient AMD processors running Windows Server 2008
Hyper-V, in one datacenter alone we doubled the number of operating
system installs and processor cores, while cutting power requirements,
heat output and space requirements by approximately one third,"
continued Smith. "We were blown away by the results, and are now firm
believers in the AMD Opteron processor and Microsoft's Hyper-V
technology."

   AMD Opteron processors with Direct Connect Architecture are well
suited for x86 server-based virtualization. Microsoft and AMD's robust
architectures allow customers to scale with ease, providing a flexible
infrastructure that can evolve as an organization grows. The two
platforms also deliver the necessary performance to securely handle
memory-intensive virtualization with less overhead--all with low
energy consumption. Benefits of AMD's design architecture and
technology include:

   --  AMD-V technology improves efficiency by allowing customers to
        host more virtual machines, transactions and users per server
        with superior control and less overhead.

   --  Native multi-core capabilities fully integrate processing
        cores rather than simply packing them together.

   --  AMD continues to add significant features to AMD Opteron
        processors, such as Extended Migration, the Tagged Translation
        Look-aside Buffer for fast switching times and Rapid
        Virtualization Indexing technology.

&lt;p&gt;Sun Expands Cross-Platform Virtualization Collaboration with Microsoft with Windows Server Certification for Upcoming Sun xVM Server and Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V Support for Sun Ray Thin Clients

    Solaris Operating System to Become a Certified Guest on Windows
                              Server 2008
SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ:JAVA) today announced new and
significant developments in its cross-platform virtualization
initiatives with Microsoft Corp. Making it simple to integrate and
interoperate with Sun's xVM portfolio, Sun has made key pieces of its
virtualization software available in open source via the OpenxVM.org
community - http://www.openxvm.org.

   As part of Sun's participation in Microsoft's Server
Virtualization Validation Program, the Sun xVM Server software, an
open, flexible and datacenter-grade hypervisor, will be validated to
work with Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and prior versions. Microsoft
and Sun customers will benefit from stronger interoperability and a
joint support experience for virtual infrastructure deployments. In
addition, Sun and Microsoft are working together to offer customers
the Solaris(TM) Operating System (OS) as a certified guest on Windows
Server 2008 Hyper-V. Additionally, Sun is expanding its support for
Microsoft technologies by providing Sun Ray(TM) thin client customers
the ability to access Windows as a guest OS running on Microsoft
Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V.

   "Sun is committed to offering interoperability with Microsoft's
products, so that our mutual customers can run their choice of
operating systems on any virtualization platform on Windows-compatible
x64 servers from Sun," said Steve Wilson, vice president of xVM, Sun
Microsystems. "From the desktop to the datacenter, Sun offers a broad
portfolio of products ideal for virtualization. By collaborating with
Microsoft, we are delivering on the promise of cross-platform
virtualization and most importantly, helping customers reap the full
benefits of their virtualization investments."

   "Interoperability is an important requirement for customers to
adopt virtualization for their datacenters and desktops," said Bob
Kelly, corporate vice president of infrastructure server marketing
within Microsoft's Server and Tools Business. "Together with Sun, we
are equally committed to ensuring Windows Server runs well on Sun's
virtualization products, and that the same is true for the Solaris
operating system running on Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V."

   Sun Ray thin client customers can now use Windows Server 2008
Hyper-V to host user desktops originating on Windows Server 2008,
Windows Vista, and Windows XP Professional, and display these desktops
on Sun Ray thin client devices over the network. With the
Windows-client OS being supported, customers who choose to deploy
Microsoft server-based computing technologies with Sun Ray thin
clients will no longer be limited to applications that only run
seamlessly in a Windows Server Terminal Services environment,
including web and enterprise applications.

   As part of Sun and Microsoft's collaboration efforts, the two
companies plan to integrate Sun(TM) xVM Ops Center with Microsoft
System Center Configuration Manager 2007, offering customers the
ability to update and manage Windows guest operating systems in the
second half of 2008. With this addition, Sun customers will be able to
use a single management framework to manage their choice of operating
systems from Solaris and Windows to Linux as well as monitor physical
and virtual environments.

   Avanade, a global IT and business solutions company and Sun
partner, chose the Sun Fire(TM) x4150 server, based on the Intel(R)
Xeon(R) processor 5400 series, to deploy Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V
for their internal datacenter. "Sun is changing the game with its new
line of x86 systems -- a great platform to take advantage of the new
features in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V," said
Dale Christian, chief information officer, Avanade.

   Sun's collaboration with Microsoft continues to show Sun's
commitment to maximize flexibility and deliver value for its small and
medium business and enterprise customers. Sun x64 customers can now
run Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V. As a Windows Server OEM, Sun sells
and supports Windows Server products on certified x64 servers and
blades, and offers Windows Server utilities and value-added software.
Sun additionally provides solutions to enable major TCO savings for
customers, such as Sun's Infrastructure Solution for Microsoft

&lt;p&gt;Use of Open Source Software from Eclipse COSMOS Project Helps
      Accelerate Implementation of CMDBf Specification and System
                           Interoperability
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
itSMF FUSION - CA, Inc. (NASDAQ: CA) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today
announced the ability to share information between their respective
configuration management databases (CMDBs) and management data
repositories (MDRs), such as asset management systems and service desk
solutions. The interoperability demonstration, based on the CMDB
Federation (CMDBf) specification and debuting this week at itSMF
Fusion '08 in San Francisco, gives customers a way to better
consolidate IT data in a multi-vendor environment by linking CA and
IBM data sources for a single view of their IT systems and components,
and the relationships among them.

   This is the first public demonstration of any two software
vendors' systems incorporating the CMDBf specification developed by
the CMDB Federation working group in October 2007. The specification,
which has since been submitted to the Distributed Management Task
Force for development as a standard, was authored by industry leaders
BMC Software, CA, Fujitsu Limited, HP, IBM and Microsoft.

   This CMDB Federation demonstration shows businesses they can
successfully link data sources and asset information in a multi-vendor
environment to simplify IT service management initiatives.

   "Businesses recognize that reducing the complexity in managing
their multi-vendor IT environments can help them save money, ease
operations, and enable other IT initiatives for improved service
management," said Brian Bell, senior vice president and general
manager, CA Service Management. "The demonstration unveiled today
shows CA's commitment to helping our customers share and integrate
important IT information no matter what vendors' system manages that
data. This supports organizations as they work to manage the service
lifecycle whether it's through ITIL guidance or other service
management best practices."

   The use of open source software from the Eclipse COSMOS project
helped CA and IBM accelerate implementation of the CMDBf
specification. In turn, the two companies plan to contribute code from
the interoperability demonstration to the COSMOS project as reference
code.

   "This example of federation illustrates IBM's commitment to work
with other software vendors through open standards to help our
customers simplify and automate their IT environments," said Alan
Ganek, CTO and vice president of Autonomic Computing, IBM Tivoli
Software. "By championing these industry service management
initiatives, we provide our customers with greater visibility, control
and automation over their disparate IT systems and help them to
increase the return from their IT investments. Our joint contributions
to the Eclipse COSMOS project also ease partners' efforts to use the
CMDBf specification by providing an open-source reference
implementation."

   The IBM and CA demonstration will simulate a post-corporate merger
scenario where two IT infrastructures managed by different tools - IBM
Tivoli CCMDB and CA CMDB - provide business services spanning both
infrastructures. The demonstration will show two-way federation,
dynamic updates, topology changes after federation, and on-demand
retrieval of the federated detailed resource data. The demonstration
will be shown in both the CA booth 708 and the IBM booth 626 at itSMF
Fusion at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, Sept. 7-13.

&lt;p&gt;  FREMONT, CA, Sep 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
3PAR(R) (NYSE: PAR), the leading global provider of utility storage,
announced today support for Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V,
Microsoft's newest server operating system with built-in, hypervisor-based
virtualization. 3PAR Utility Storage and Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V work
together to give IT organizations the ability to deliver software and
hardware as a service through server and storage virtualization as part of
a complete utility computing environment. 3PAR Utility Storage and Windows
Server 2008 Hyper-V are designed to deliver a more agile and resilient
infrastructure with significantly enhanced capacity utilization and cost
efficiency.

    Server virtualization technologies were developed to deliver improved
utilization and simplified management as well as providing datacenters
with a more flexible infrastructure. However, in order for the entire
virtualized environment to be provisioned quickly and efficiently, both
servers and storage must be agile. Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V enables
rapid and efficient server consolidation by allowing customers to quickly
provision multiple virtual machines that run simultaneously and
independently on a single physical server. To complement these
efficiencies, customers need to consider a storage infrastructure that
offers similar benefits.

    Unlike traditional storage solutions, 3PAR Utility Storage is a highly
virtualized storage platform built from the ground up to support the
unique requirements of virtualized server environments and utility
computing. Together, 3PAR Utility Storage and Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V
combine server and storage virtualization to help reduce infrastructure
costs and management overhead while improving agility and the ability to
rapidly provision resources.

    "More and more organizations are uncovering the potential of delivering
enterprise IT as a utility service," said David Scott, president and CEO
of 3PAR. "This is evident in the rise of next-generation datacenters and
the accelerating adoption of cloud computing delivery models among content
service providers," said Scott. "Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V and 3PAR
Utility Storage work together to provide an ideal utility computing
platform for resilient and cost-efficient services delivery."

    "Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V enables IT organizations to adopt
virtualization more cost-effectively, improve utilization, optimize
infrastructure, and rapidly provision new servers," said David Greschler,
director of integrated virtualization strategy, Microsoft Corp. "Working
with leading storage vendors such as 3PAR provides our joint customers
with even more business advantages as a result of deploying both server
and storage virtualization."

    Unique features built into the 3PAR Utility Storage platform enhance the
value of Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V in the following ways:


--  Advanced internal virtualization. The 3PAR InServ(R) Storage Server
    automatically stripes volumes widely across all disks within this massively
    scalable, tiered-storage array. Due to this highly load-balanced design, as
    the system scales to accommodate multiple virtual machines created with
    Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V, the InServ continues to deliver high and
    predictable levels of service and performance for all workload types. This
    makes 3PAR Utility Storage an ideal storage consolidation platform for
    virtualized environments using Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V.

--  Inherent efficiency. 3PAR Utility Storage is designed to reduce
    capital expenditures and increase storage utilization by enabling customers
    to initiate a larger number of projects and deploy more virtual machines
    using fewer resources. With 3PAR Thin Provisioning and thin copy
    technologies, 3PAR customers have dramatically reduced capacity and related
    costs while substantially alleviating storage system administration. With
    the use of 3PAR Thin Provisioning software, organizations are able to
    provision virtual capacity to a virtual machine application only once and
    then purchase physical capacity only as virtual machine applications truly
    require it for written data. Capacity for all virtual applications is drawn
    automatically and as needed from the InServ's shared storage pool to
    eliminate allocated but unused capacity and simplify storage
    administration.
    

    
"3PAR Utility Storage and Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V deliver
complementary benefits that are optimized through highly virtualized
storage and server technologies," said Benjamin S. Woo, vice president,
Enterprise Storage Systems, IDC. "Customers looking to maximize the
efficiency gains of deploying virtualization in their datacenters should
consider this combination."

    As a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, 3PAR works with Microsoft to ensure
that 3PAR Utility Storage products are tested and approved for use with
Microsoft products. In addition, 3PAR has access to new Microsoft product
releases, development tools, technical resources, and marketing programs.
These resources allow 3PAR to more quickly integrate, test, and support
new Microsoft product releases and better serve mutual customers.

    About 3PAR

&lt;p&gt;  NASHUA, NH, Sep 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 today manages documents and
supports collaboration at many Microsoft-focused organizations. End users
can upload, download and share documents, calendars, blogs and messages,
and information can be quickly disseminated to those who need it.

    The Windows Workflow Foundation developed by Microsoft offers powerful
tools that enable SharePoint site administrators to create workflows to
speed-up business processes. As new documents arrive at the SharePoint
server, workflow processes initiate automatically to notify appropriate
workflow participants by e-mail or their personal task lists.

    "SharePoint's workflow is built on the Windows Workflow Foundation
platform which enables developers to model extremely complex custom
workflows," said Errin O'Connor, president and senior SharePoint
architect at EPC Group.net. "Organizations can develop workflows in
either SharePoint Designer 2007 or Visual Studio depending on the
workflow's complexity and functional requirements."

    But even with SharePoint-driven electronic processes, many times there are
still paper documents involved in the workflow. This creates a "paper
problem" -- a slow manual process working in parallel with a SharePoint
workflow moving at Internet speed.

    "To address this challenge, users need to look for document imaging
software that is easy to use and administer, otherwise training costs and
time expended on IT management will outweigh any potential workflow
efficiencies. For example, the eCopy Connector for SharePoint utilizes
the multifunction peripherals and document scanners that have already
populated the enterprise and are connected into your Microsoft
environment," said O'Connor.

    To read an in-depth interview with O'Connor on what IT managers should
look for in document imaging software as well as steps to take to ensure
a smooth SharePoint implementation process, please click here.

    According to O'Connor, "From an IT management perspective, a document
imaging application needs to have out of the box capabilities and leverage
your SharePoint investment. You should not have to modify Microsoft
SharePoint to add document scanning. And the document imaging software
should have zero footprint on the SharePoint Server."

&lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, California (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) is making a major push on Monday to upgrade computer storage products and services it offers customers struggling to manage mountainous piles of data being created inside their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is announcing more then 30 new or upgraded products or services that are the result of a $2 billion investment over the last three years involving thousands of IBM researchers and eight acquisitions of data storage start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as the economy slows and businesses move to slash spending on computers and network gear, sales of storage will continue to spiral -- at least until someone invents a way for companies to stop collecting so much data, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proliferating data storage requirements brought on both by customer demands to keep information instantly available and by mounting record-keeping mandated by regulators are forcing companies to retool their corporate data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said its new line-up of storage products and services are designed to help customers manage the transition from static data archives to dynamic storehouses ready to manage two-way data flows over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM is trying to illustrate how many facets of their storage offerings can be viewed as something strategic and cohesive as opposed to just another series of 'cool products,'" said analyst Clay Ryder, the president of Sageza Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp said it aims to help customers -- big banks, retailers, government agencies and other organizations -- contend with the growing digitization of entertainment, health care, security and retail information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM estimates that the average individual's "information footprint" -- the amount of data connected to a person -- will grow to more than 16 terabytes by 2020 from roughly one terabyte, or trillion bytes, of data currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM is saying let's talk about general business requirements first, then will go the technology bag of tricks and figure out what the customers need," said Mary Turner, an analyst with Enterprise Strategy Group. "This is a cross business-unit effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitively, IBM is showcasing how the breadth of its storage-related hardware, software and related services can be made to work together for customers small and large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only EMC Corp (EMC.N), the leading independent storage maker, has articulated a similarly broad strategy for managing all parts of an organization's "information infrastructure," analysts said. Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) and Dell DELL.O still sell storage largely tied to their server products, while Sun Microsystems JAVA.O is also active in the tape market, but its offerings are nowhere near as comprehensive as IBM or EMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQUEEZING IN MORE DATA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At some level IBM is announcing the latest, greatest versions of products that have been around quite a while," said Charles King, an analyst with Pund-IT Research. It is also showing off really interesting next-generation capabilities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking to show it can cut the costs of storing massive amounts of data, IBM is demonstrating new technology from its January acquisition of XIV using solid-state memory instead of disk-drives or magnetic tape now used to store data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transition from disk drives to flash-memory has begun to occur in consumer electronics, but IBM's announcement suggests that solid state storage -- memory with no moving parts -- is becoming cost effective in big business storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the industry's first stab at big solid state storage," Ryder said. "If you don't have spindles and disks, you have no parts to fail and you can use less power."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it is incorporating the latest data "deduplication" technology that eliminates the need to keep many copies of the same information, a move that promises to help customers save vastly more information in the same amount of office space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making use of software and hardware it acquired by buying Diligent Technologies in April, IBM said the deduplication technology can reduced redundant data by up to 25 to 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deduplication joins storage virtualization, another technique that IBM and it rivals are promoting to increase the usage of existing storage equipment while making it easier to manage and cutting energy usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies are running out of room in existing data centers to store these growing piles of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is offering a high-density tape storage library system that uses robotic arms to locate and read archival data tapes that holds three times more cartridges in the same floor space. Businesses can store up to three petabytes, or quadrillion bits, of data in 10 square feet of floor space, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To secure this data, the company also is offering systems with automatic data encryption that take advantage of disk supplier Seagate Technology's STX.N encrypted hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ALTOS, CA, Sep 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Liquid Computing, developer of the world's first fully converged
communications and computing platform, today announced that its LiquidIQ
solution supports Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V. LiquidIQ, a
converged solution that combines standard physical data center resources
with sophisticated management and control software, can be tightly
integrated with Hyper-V to create dynamically adjustable server resource
pools that match workload needs and minimize under-utilized assets.

    Capabilities of Microsoft Hyper-V technology, which include the ability to
tailor the utilization of server resources and provide more IT flexibility
through the use of Virtual Machines, are often constrained by the inherent
limitations of rack mount servers and their associated I/O architectures.
The LiquidIQ system enables users to create a highly dynamic data center
by allowing them to easily alter the physical characteristics --
processor, memory and networking components -- of the LiquidIQ Logical
Server hardware underlying a Hyper-V instance by simply editing its
software attributes.

    "Liquid Computing's LiquidIQ complements the powerful virtualization
capabilities offered by Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V," said Zane Adam,
senior director of integrated virtualization at Microsoft. "The
combination of these offerings provides customers with the fundamental
virtualization infrastructure for their businesses and improved business
agility for a more dynamic data center."

    The Liquid Computing system provides the following benefits:


--  Rapid provisioning - LiquidIQ's diskless and stateless logical servers
    provide extremely rapid provisioning of servers and associated networking.
    Templates can be copied and deployed in minutes.
--  Verifiable disaster recovery and business continuity - The system
    provides verifiable business continuity as all application, operating
    system and network data is stored externally on Network Attached Storage
    (NAS) or on Storage Area Networks (SANs). Simple replication of this data
    provides business continuity at a second site.
--  Interoperability - LiquidIQ embraces standard operating systems,
    standard Ethernet networking and management tool interfaces (SNMP, command
    line interface) to provide simple data center integration.
--  High energy efficiency - The system uses 20-30 percent less power to
    provide the same processing power as equivalent clusters built using rack
    mounts servers and switches.
--  High density footprint - LiquidIQ enjoys more than a 6:1 ratio benefit
    for floor space for an equivalent amount of computing and switching.
--  Hardware lifecycle management - The system is based on a scalable
    chassis and software design that allows servers with processors from
    different vendors to co-exist in the system and to be retired at a rate
    determined by the business.
--  Fully integrated solution - VMware(R) Virtual Appliance Server
    provides the power of VMware Virtual Infrastructure, the complete library
    of VMware virtual appliances, VMware VDi and LiquidIQ in an integrated
    package. This package is financed to enable monthly billing versus up front
    capital expenditures. Additionally, NetApp(TM) filers can be included in
    this financed package.
    

    
"The combination of Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V technology and Liquid
Computing's LiquidIQ delivers a dynamic, virtualized data center that
provides customers with service agility, high asset utilization and low
management costs," said Greg McElheran, president and CEO, Liquid
Computing. "Our strong relationship with Microsoft enables us to continue
to provide mutual customers with innovative virtualization solutions that
offer increased performance, flexibility and efficiency across all
Microsoft solutions and applications."

    About Liquid Computing, Inc.

    Liquid Computing has delivered a new generation of IT infrastructure that
is transforming the traditional server and switch configurations
commonplace in data centers. LiquidIQ, the world's first fully converged
communications and computing platform, provides flexible pools of

&lt;p&gt;NetApp Storage Systems Provide Microsoft Customers With Enhanced
Storage Efficiency and Scalability
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) today announced new storage solutions
optimized for Microsoft(R) Windows(R) Server 2008 Hyper-V(TM),
virtualization software that's a feature of most versions of Microsoft
Windows Server 2008. The new NetApp(R) storage solutions provide data
center customers with server virtualization capabilities for increased
operational efficiencies and scalability. Further reinforcing its
support of Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V, NetApp is a Platinum sponsor
at Microsoft's "Get Virtual Now" launch event taking place today in
Bellevue, Washington.

   With thousands of NetApp systems already deployed for virtual
server environments, NetApp now provides Windows Server 2008 customers
with the technology needed to enable them to build a complete virtual
architecture. As a result, customers will experience enhanced
infrastructure flexibility along with lowered costs through
consolidation and simplified management. NetApp's built-in storage
deduplication and thin provisioning technologies, both available at no
additional charge, allow Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V customers to
reduce storage power, cooling, and space requirements by up to 50%.
With NetApp's virtual cloning and virtual volume capabilities, Windows

&lt;p&gt;Offerings Give Enterprise Clients a 360-Degree View from the Data
Center to the Desktop to Streamline IT Environments and Reduce Costs
BLUE BELL, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Unisys Corporation (NYSE:UIS) today announced the availability of
its services-based solutions for Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V
and the Microsoft System Center management suite. These services
simplify IT infrastructure management, enhance security and reduce
operational costs.

   The Unisys services are designed to make it easier for clients
using Microsoft technologies to plan and deploy fully virtualized IT
environments as part of a real-time infrastructure, and help companies
focus on strategic transformation.

   The Unisys virtualization services include:

   --  Unisys 3D Blueprinting for Virtualization service, which helps
        clients create a comprehensive virtualization plan that
        accounts for a full range of business and IT requirements; and

   --  Unisys Virtualization Operational Readiness Assessment (VORA)
        service, which gives clients a detailed understanding of the
        full operational impact of virtualization in advance,
        including changes to business and IT processes.

   "Unisys virtualization services help clients take maximum
advantage of the powerful new virtualization technologies Microsoft is
delivering to virtualize desktops, consolidate servers in a data
center or cost-effectively deploy business continuity initiatives,"
said Mark Feverston, general manager, Microsoft Solutions, Unisys.
"They can map out and build a virtualized, resource-efficient,
low-cost environment that quickly accelerates delivery of the benefits
of a real-time infrastructure."

   These two Unisys solutions were previously available for VMware
and other leading virtualization technologies. Now clients using a
combination of Unisys virtualization services can more efficiently and
clearly integrate a full range of virtualized resources from Microsoft
as well as other leading providers into their enterprise-wide IT
infrastructure.

   "Our clients are keenly interested in deploying new Microsoft
virtualization technologies to help capture savings and drive
efficiencies from server, desktop and Microsoft Exchange Server
consolidation," said Jeff Parker, president of analyst and consulting
firm Directions on Microsoft. "Still, they're realistic about the
risks of large-scale virtualization projects. The Unisys services for
virtualization give enterprise CIOs a concrete roadmap to assess and
navigate these risks. Unisys also has the people and expertise to help
CIOs execute their virtualized infrastructure blueprint."

   Full 360-Degree View: From the Datacenter to the Desktop

   While virtualization is most commonly associated with server
consolidation, applying virtualization technologies broadly across the
IT infrastructure yields important improvements in efficiency,
flexibility, continuity and responsiveness to both sudden and
long-range business changes. Unisys approach to enterprise-wide
virtualization is distinguished by the capability it provides clients
both to plan and implement solutions across all levels of the IT
infrastructure.

   "By extending its services offerings to encompass Windows Server
2008 Hyper-V and System Center, Unisys is opening up new paths for
clients seeking to use virtualization efficiently to help manage IT
costs and support strategic business objectives," said David
Greschler, director of integrated virtualization strategy, Microsoft
Corp.

&lt;p&gt;Desktone Supports Microsoft Virtualization Technologies in Desktops as a Service Offering

BELLEVUE, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
Desktone, Inc., provider of the first solution that enables
virtual desktops as an outsourced subscription service, today
announced support for Microsoft virtualization technologies as the
building blocks of a service provider's desktop hosting
infrastructure. The Desktone Virtual-D Platform enables Microsoft
System Center, including System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008,
and Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V to power a cloud-hosted
desktop environment.

   "Microsoft's virtualization technologies provide tremendous
flexibility, manageability and TCO benefits," said Les Yetton, senior
vice president of sales, marketing and business development, Desktone.
"Companies that can't dedicate the resources needed to build and
maintain virtual desktop infrastructures themselves, can now realize
these great virtualization benefits--while ensuring a rich Windows
client experience--by consuming VDI in the cloud with Desktone-powered
desktops as a service (DaaS)."

   Desktone DaaS is the only form of cloud computing that provides an
uncompromised Windows client experience, which is critical for
enterprises with large investments in Windows-based applications. It
leverages a hypervisor layer, such as Microsoft Windows Server 2008
Hyper-V, to enable the hosting of authentic Windows client operating
systems, as opposed to browser-based and shared services alternative
desktops.

   "By bringing the worlds of cloud computing services and
virtualized desktops together, customers can have much more
flexibility in how they use and manage their desktops," said Zane
Adam, senior director of integrated virtualization at Microsoft. "By
including the System Center offerings and Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V
in Desktone's DaaS model, Desktone can deliver expanded capabilities
and is providing a way to help customers quickly adopt desktop
virtualization and move toward a more dynamic IT environment."

   The Virtual-D Platform enables service providers to offer hosted,
subscription-based virtual desktops. The only solution that integrates
all enabling technologies into a single, automated self-service
platform, it helps enterprises quickly realize the full benefits of
centralized virtual desktops without having to build and deploy the
infrastructure internally. It dramatically reduces desktop TCO and
transforms virtual desktop infrastructure costs from CAPEX to OPEX.
And because the Virtual-D Platform is uniquely designed along two
tiers (enterprise and service provider), it lets enterprises maintain
ownership and control over their Windows OS images, applications and
all relating licensing while outsourcing just the physical data center
infrastructure powering their virtual desktops.

   In addition to supporting Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V and System
Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008, the Virtual-D Platform allows
Microsoft customers to employ other solutions that they are already
using to manage their physical desktops, such as System Center
Configuration Manager and Microsoft Application Virtualization.

   Attendees of the Microsoft Get Virtual Now launch event can visit
Desktone and experience the Virtual-D Platform at Desktone's exhibit.

   About Desktone

   Desktone, Inc. provides the only virtual desktop hosting platform
that enables desktops to be delivered as an outsourced subscription
service. The Desktone Virtual-D Platform integrates all enabling
technologies into a single, automated, self-service platform. By
offering desktops as a service, Desktone simplifies large-scale
desktop provisioning and management, transforms virtual desktop
infrastructure costs from CAPEX to OPEX, provides greater protection
of physical resources and corporate information, and increases
business agility--all of which reduces desktop total cost of
ownership. For more information, visit www.desktone.com.

&lt;p&gt;LeftHand SANs Optimize Virtualized Environments with Simplified
  Storage Management and Cost-Effective, Multi-Site High Availability
BOULDER, Colo.--(Business Wire)--
LeftHand Networks, the leading provider of highly available iSCSI
SANs that optimize virtual environments, today announced support for
Microsoft's virtualization strategy and set of virtualization
solutions. LeftHand Networks iSCSI SAN solutions provide high
availability and non-disruptive storage management, capabilities that
become vital as customers seek to optimize the efficiencies and cost
advantages of virtualized infrastructures.

   With more than 3,000 customers, many running Microsoft
applications, LeftHand Networks delivers SAN solutions that complement
and extend the power of Microsoft's new group of virtualization
solutions, including Microsoft's Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V,
Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008 and Microsoft
Application Virtualization 4.5. Microsoft's full set of technologies
enables a compatible, end-to-end virtualized infrastructure. When
combined with LeftHand Networks' storage solutions customers have the
ability to deploy a desktop-to-data center virtualization and storage
strategy that is easy to manage and provides a compelling total cost
of ownership.

   "Virtualization drives substantial efficiencies and creates
considerable flexibility within an IT infrastructure. Customers who
deploy Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V can provision new applications and
simplify storage management significantly with LeftHand SANs," said
Karl Chen, vice president of business development and alliances,
LeftHand Networks. "Microsoft's desktop and data center virtualization
solutions with LeftHand Networks iSCSI SANs deliver a dynamic,
virtualized infrastructure that helps customers achieve significant
savings."

   "LeftHand Networks' SAN solutions allow customers to achieve
resource utilization and cost reduction through consolidation, also
providing them with high manageability, agility and flexibility in
their operations," said Zane Adam, senior director of integrated
virtualization at Microsoft. "LeftHand Networks' SANs provide
simplified management capabilities that work seamlessly with Windows
Server 2008 Hyper-V and the System Center offerings, helping to enable
customers to maximize their virtualization infrastructure investments
and keep pace with the ever-changing needs of their business."

   Server virtualization and consolidation create a dynamic
application environment that requires an increasingly flexible and
dynamic storage solution. In these environments, storage capabilities
such as high availability, simplified management, and non-disruptive
configuration changes and scaling become critical. With its clustered
architecture and SAN/iQ(R) storage software, LeftHand Networks
provides advanced storage management as well as key advantages in
storage system performance, efficiency and disaster recovery.

   "Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V delivered a reliable
virtualization platform optimized for our Windows applications, but to
maximize the power of our virtualized environment, we needed storage
that was equally flexible and dynamic," said Michael Johnson, vice
president of information technology at Jackson Energy. "LeftHand
Networks' iSCSI SAN delivered an ideal storage solution that provided
high availability and flexible, easy-to-use storage management,
enabling us to reduce cost and complexity at the same time. With a few
simple clicks of the mouse we can reconfigure our storage, provision
additional capacity, and boost performance levels - all without any
disruption to the system."

   Innovative Approach Delivers Simplified Management and High
Availability

   LeftHand Networks' innovative storage approach provides
significant advantages in virtualized environments. Based on its
SAN/iQ storage software, LeftHand Networks is able to cluster together
multiple storage nodes into a single, scalable pool of shared storage
that delivers high availability, agility and simplified management.

   LeftHand Networks SANs are designed to easily accommodate the
frequent changes required in virtualized environments, including
features such as automated volume provisioning, which allows
administrators to grow, shrink, or move an iSCSI volume with just a
few mouse clicks and no downtime. The classic re-provisioning tasks of
finding additional space, load balancing the new volume across
available resources, and ensuring the proper allocation of blocks to
implement desired availability is all done automatically. Thin
provisioning of the volumes avoids the tasks associated with re-sizing
file systems without wasting capacity on the SAN. For IT personnel,
this means that changes within the SAN can be easily and immediately
accommodated without days of pre-planning and re-provisioning LUNs.

   Planned and unplanned downtime is more impactful in a virtual
environment due to the increased number of applications in virtual
machines dependent on a set number of physical connections into the
SAN. LeftHand SANs are highly available by design and are architected
to keep volumes available both during administrative activities as
well as during component or environmental outages. For multi-site
environments, LeftHand Networks SANs can provide single volumes with
multiple copies of data across sites delivering always-on data even in
the event of site failure. This complements the high availability and
Quick Migration features of Windows Server 2008 to deliver a complete
highly available environment across applications and storage.

   LeftHand Networks and Microsoft's Strategic Relationship

   LeftHand Networks and Microsoft have a strong history of working
together to provide scalable IT and business solutions for the
mid-tier and enterprise markets. LeftHand is a Microsoft Gold
Certified Partner, a managed ISV partner, and a Microsoft certified
Virtualization and Storage Partner.

   About LeftHand Networks

   Founded in 1999, LeftHand Networks pioneered iSCSI-based storage
area networks (SANs). SANs built using LeftHand's SAN/iQ(R) software
are uniquely able to distribute and protect data across a cluster of
industry-standard storage servers. The company's patented architecture
increases data availability, allows users to start small and grow the
SAN seamlessly, and simplifies management. The LeftHand SAN is ideal
for storage and server consolidation, multi-site SANs, and disaster
recovery. LeftHand SANs are available in the U.S., Canada and
throughout Europe. For more information, contact LeftHand at
info@lefthandnetworks.com.

expenses associated with inadequate management of virtualization. A
virtualization management pioneer, BMC has been working with leading
virtualization vendors for more than three years to help customers
extract the most value from their virtualized IT infrastructure.

   "Virtualization offers the promise of cost reduction and increased
data center efficiency, but the reality of managing virtualization
often comes with significant added costs," said Jim Grant, senior vice
president and general manager of BMC's Enterprise Service Management
business unit. "BMC Performance Manager is available to help
enterprises proactively monitor both physical and virtualized
environments while keeping costs down. BMC customers will benefit from
the very real Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) reductions offered by
Microsoft's virtualization solutions, and we're working with Microsoft
to collectively help our customers create efficient and easy-to-manage
virtualized operations. BMC's relationship with Microsoft continues to
deliver strong benefits for our mutual customers."

   "BMC Performance Manager for Servers provides a valuable solution
to customers that have virtualized their IT operations using Windows
Server 2008 Hyper-V, helping to ensure continued success with their
virtualization initiatives," said David Greschler, Microsoft's
director of integrated virtualization strategy. "Customers have the
option of using BMC Performance Manager to manage virtual machines
running within Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V, helping make it possible
for customers to maximize the return on their IT investments and keep
up with the ever-changing needs of business."

   BMC Performance Manager offers Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V
customers an easy and cost-effective way to monitor their virtual
machines and is the first step in helping them manage and control the
entire lifecycle of virtualization in the data center. These solutions
will provide joint customers with better resource utilization and cost
reduction through consolidation. The implementation of BMC's
virtualization management solution and Microsoft's virtualization
offerings provides customers with greater flexibility and agility in
their virtualized IT operations.

   In addition to BMC Performance Manager, BMC is working with
Microsoft to optimize BMC's capacity planning, configuration
automation and other management solutions for Windows Server 2008
Hyper-V. These solutions will help IT departments ensure that their

&lt;p&gt;F5 Networks Integration With Microsoft Offerings Delivers Optimum IT Foundation for a Dynamic Virtualized Environment

     F5 Solutions Support Microsoft System Center and New Hyper-V
   Server Virtualization Solution; Provide "Network Awareness" for a
               Highly Efficient Virtualized Environment
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV), the global leader in Application
Delivery Networking, today announced its support of Microsoft's Get
Virtual Now launch event. Through tightly coupled integration efforts,
F5 and Microsoft's solutions together enable organizations to unlock
the power of a comprehensive virtualized ecosystem--from the data
center to the desktop.

   "As customers seek to reduce costs while improving the dynamic
nature of their IT infrastructures through virtualization, coupling
that desire with the availability of Microsoft's broad offerings
spanning the desktop, data center, and management will enable them to
accelerate the adoption of virtualization technologies," said David
Greschler, Director of Integrated Virtualization Strategy, Microsoft
Corp. "F5's integration with the System Center management offerings
will provide our mutual customers greater visibility into the network
and the ability to respond to changing network conditions to help
maximize their virtualization investments."

   Microsoft's virtualization strategy and F5(R) solutions work in
tandem to provide a comprehensive and dynamic infrastructure
framework, giving joint customers the IT agility to adapt to varying
network and business conditions. With solutions from Microsoft and F5,
organizations can now integrate virtualization technologies into their
infrastructures to cut costs and improve performance, while
maintaining the manageability and familiarity of their legacy IT
environments.

   "In a virtualized IT environment, effective resource management
becomes the most critical pain point," said Zeus Kerravala, Senior
Vice President of Global Enterprise Research at Yankee Group. "With
Microsoft providing familiar interfaces and common management consoles
for customers to implement virtualization technologies, the network
becomes an extremely powerful tool in connecting users to the
best-performing resources. F5's strategic position in the network,
together with their integration with Microsoft's System Center
portfolio, enables them to provide significant performance and
optimization benefits for customers seeking to implement an end-to-end
virtualization strategy."

   Deploying F5 solutions within Microsoft's virtualization framework
enables customers to:

   --  Gain essential visibility into the network - F5 provides
        tested deployment guidance for Microsoft System Center,
        delivering the "network awareness" necessary to maximize the
        advantages of virtualized environments without sacrificing
        network or application performance.

   --  Optimize end-user experience through network flexibility - The
        F5 Management Pack for Microsoft System Center Operations
        Manager 2007, an add-on software module available in the first
        half of CY09, enables Operations Manager to monitor and
        respond to changing network conditions in real time,
        optimizing the use of network resources and easing the
        management of Microsoft virtualization environments. And F5's
        PowerShell-enabled iControl(R) API allows System Center to
        proactively and dynamically modify the network to ensure the
        best end-user experience.

   --  Leverage storage virtualization to scale IT environments - As
        a key component of Microsoft's virtualization ecosystem,
        storage virtualization enables customers to manage and access
        their data in virtualized environments. The F5 Acopia(R)
        ARX(R) solution provides unique virtualized storage
        capabilities that create an intelligent abstraction layer
        between users and disk, allowing customers to more efficiently
        leverage storage investments and scale their infrastructures.

   "Organizations adopt virtualization solutions to dynamically
migrate their server, application, storage, and desktop resources into
a fluid IT environment that ensures optimal use of IT resources at all
times," said Jim Ritchings, VP of Business Development at F5. "To
truly take advantage of the performance gains offered by
virtualization, it's essential that the network supporting these
virtualized resources be dynamic as well. F5 solutions enable the
network to perform in lockstep with application services and make sure
that users are always seamlessly directed to the most available and
best-performing resources."

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) equity analyst Arjun Murti has left his forecast for oil prices unchanged but added prices could fall below $100 a barrel in the event of a global recession, according to a research note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forecast, prepared by Murti and other analysts at Goldman, left their price forecast for U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude in the fourth quarter 2008 unchanged at $130 a barrel and its full-year 2009 forecast at $140.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slumping demand in the United States and other consumer nations has sent WTI tumbling from record highs over $147 a barrel in July to $107 a barrel on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murti, one of the analysts who first predicted several years ago that crude prices would hit $100 as part of what he called a "super spike", said earlier this year that prices could hit $150-$200 before the end of 2009 on rising global demand and faltering supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we recognize downside global economic risks have risen in the past month or so, the Goldman Sachs Global Economics Research team continues to view modest global growth including a 'happy slowdown' in China as its central forecast, which we view as consistent with our continued bullish oil price outlook," the research note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he maintained his bullish stance for oil, the note added prices could dip into double digits in the event of a global recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the event a global recession and hard landing in China materializes, WTI spot crude oil prices would likely fall below $100 a barrel, absent an especially sizable supply disruption," the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although fundamental support would be expected to exist around marginal costs ($80-$90 a barrel) given ongoing supply growth challenges, we recognize markets often overshoot fundamentals both to the upside and downside," the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ikuko Kao and Matthew Robinson; Editing by Michael Urquhart)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Analyst Interview. Today's interview
is with senior analyst Steve Biggs, who Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), IBM
(NYSE: IBM) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ).

   A synopsis of today's Analyst Interview is presented below. The
full article can be read at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678.

   With projected weakness in the consumer segment continuing, do you
see tougher times ahead for tech stocks under your coverage?

   Most companies in the IT sector derive the bulk of their revenue
from the enterprise market, followed by government and small and
medium businesses. Although the consumer has been weak this year,
enterprise spending has held up relatively well, and second quarter
results confirmed this.

   The exception has been that industries that sell to consumers have
been weak. For example, companies that sell into the retail industry
have shown some weakness. Although consumer weakness could spill over
into other areas as well, falling energy prices make me optimistic
that consumer spending will improve. In my coverage universe, Apple
(Nasdaq: AAPL) has the heaviest consumer exposure. Apple has held up
quite well given frequent product releases that don't appear to have
much sensitivity to the economy.

   In what ways is the global economy important in your outlook?

   The global economy has provided strength for many multinational
companies I cover. Companies such as IBM (NYSE: IBM) and
Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) derive more than half their revenue
overseas. Strength in economies outside the U.S. has helped these
companies offset any weakness in the U.S. economy.

   In addition, U.S.-based companies have benefited from currency
translation as the U.S. dollar has fallen in value relative to other
currencies. As a result, products are cheaper for customers outside
the U.S. Moreover, currency translation has inflated revenue growth
numbers from non-U.S. sales. I believe that this is starting to
reverse itself as Europe appears to be weakening and the dollar is
rising in value relative to European currencies as a result. This was
partially behind my downgrade of HP, which derives almost 70% of
revenue from outside the United States.

an interview during a company event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The businesses under Bach's watch -- Xbox, Windows Mobile,
Zune and computer peripherals -- are more reliant on consumer
spending than other Microsoft divisions such as server software or
even the Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Xbox business has been doing very well, according to Bach,
who noted that the video games business moves on new release
cycles and not economic ones. He also said he expects Xbox to have
a strong holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bach was speaking at an event for the company's computer mouse
and keyboard division. Microsoft introduced a new mouse that
incorporates a new tracking technology called "BlueTrack,"
designed to let the mouse work on various surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're going to reinvent our entire mouse business starting
today," Bach said at a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new mouse emanates a blue beam light, not a red laser like
its current top-end mouse. The Microsoft Explorer Mouse and
Microsoft Explorer Mini Mouse will be available later this year
for $99.95 and $79.95, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bach also addressed Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) new line of iPod
music players. He said Microsoft wants to build on the Zune's
positives -- recognized brand name and high customer satisfaction
-- to close the share gap with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He touted new Zune features, introduced by Microsoft on
Monday, as part of its third-generation Zune digital music player,
due out next week, that allows users to buy and download songs
from the built-in radio tuner in the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Apple has an advantage of strong market share position and
that's a challenge for us," said Bach.  "The value of Zune over
time will transcend across everything we do in entertainment and
devices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft closed down 2 cents to $26.10 on the
Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Morgan
Stanley (MS.N) and other banks said Tuesday they are still
trading with embattled Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N,
helping counter speculation Wall Street firms were limiting
their exposure to Lehman's credit woes and plunging stock
price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Goldman is a willing counterparty to Lehman across all our
businesses," spokesman Michael DuVally told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Morgan Stanley continues to trade as usual with Lehman
Brothers," spokesman Mark Lake said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spokesman at Credit Suisse AG (CSGN.VX) and Citigroup Inc
(C.N) also said they continued to trade with Lehman across all
their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The statements indicated Lehman's trading partners would
continue to do business. That sent shares of Lehman rising 3.7
percent in late electronic trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman's stock had plummeted 45 percent to its lowest price
since the 1998 Asian debt crisis as investors worried the No. 4
investment bank was struggling to raise the capital it needs to
offset losses on hard hit mortgage and other assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts estimate Lehman in its third-quarter results could
write down the value of its assets by more than $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors demonstrated the extent of their worries by
bidding up the price of Lehman credit default swaps by 50
percent, fueled by news that takeover talks with Korean
Development Bank had broken down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Five-year CDS on Lehman Brothers traded at 490 basis points
-- or $490,000 a year to protect $10 million of debt. The price
widened by 163 basis points on the day, according to John
Atkins, an analyst at IDEAglobal in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KDB in recent weeks has emerged as the most-likely savior
for Lehman, which has been scrambling to either sell the
company, sell its money management arm or shed a big block of
distressed assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Dena Aubin and Jon Stempel;

&lt;p&gt;Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team Protects Users from Latest
       Microsoft Windows, Office, and SQL Server Vulnerabilities
COLUMBIA, Md.--(Business Wire)--
Open source innovator and SNORT(R) creator, Sourcefire, Inc.
(Nasdaq:FIRE), a leader in Enterprise Threat Management, announced
that the Sourcefire(R) Vulnerability Research Team (VRT) has delivered
rules to protect Sourcefire customers and Snort users from the four
Microsoft vulnerabilities disclosed today. These vulnerabilities
impact Microsoft Windows, Office, Internet Explorer, .NET Framework,
SQL Server and Visual Studio.

   "Critical vulnerabilities, like the ones announced today, can
cause huge security issues as they create holes for new exploits to
quietly disrupt systems or steal information," said Matt Watchinski,
Senior Director of the Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team. "The
proactive protection offered by Sourcefire's IPS, combined with the
superior network visibility delivered by Sourcefire RNA(TM), provides
our customers with a one-two punch for defending networks against
zero-day attacks."

   Following Microsoft's disclosure earlier today, the Sourcefire VRT
created, tested and delivered Snort rules designed to detect attacks
targeting the Microsoft vulnerabilities listed below. These new rules
are included in the latest Sourcefire Security Enhancement Update
(SEU) released today.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-052 - Critical Microsoft
        Windows GDI+ vulnerability could allow remote code execution
        if a user viewed a specially crafted image file using affected
        software or browsed a Web site that contains specially crafted
        content.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-053 - Critical Windows Media
        Encoder 9 Series vulnerability could allow remote code
        execution if a user viewed a specially crafted Web page. If a
        user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker
        who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take
        complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then
        install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new
        accounts with full user rights.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-054 - Critical Windows Media
        Player vulnerability could allow remote code execution when a
        specially crafted audio file is streamed from a Windows Media
        server. If a user is logged on with administrative user
        rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this
        vulnerability could take complete control of an affected
        system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change,
        or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-055 - Critical Microsoft
        Office vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a
        user clicks a specially crafted OneNote URL. An attacker who
        successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete
        control of an affected system. An attacker could then install
        programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts
        with full user rights.

&lt;p&gt;Panama's Most Important Development Continues to Meet Construction
                        and Financial Deadlines
MIAMI--(Business Wire)--
Last week, the executives from JP Morgan proudly announced Trump
Ocean Club's (TOC) second quarter results which were not only in line
with the company's budget, but displayed how the project has passed
some key milestones. TOC's ability to meet the 1.25x Collateralization
Ratio satisfied any skeptics, while collection rates on deposits,
which rose to 99% in May, have superseded even the most optimistic
estimates. Additionally, this month, Trump International Hotels
Management LLC signed the Hotel Management Agreement for the hotel at
the Trump Ocean Club International, solidifying the property's
relationship with Trump.

   Despite unstable conditions in the global real estate market,
TOC's sales and receivables as of July 31, 2008 reached US$356.1
million and $271.5 million, respectively. The company also announced
price increases of 5-10% in all of its products (despite already
capturing a significant premium relative to other projects in Panama)
and a new marketing plan for products with higher inventory levels. To
date, TOC has sold nearly 79% of the project's units two years before
the expected completion in August 2010.

   A key measure of TOC's work progress rose in the second quarter of
2008; the Schedule Performance Indicator (SPI) measures the amount of
work completed relative to the original forecast. This number shot to
102% in second quarter, a phenomenon almost entirely unseen in today's
market. While many projects in Panama City are far behind projected
timelines, these numbers put TOC in a league of their own.
Additionally, TOC's liquidity remains strong, with cash and cash
equivalents totaling US$197.9 million.

   Trump Ocean Club is the largest real estate investment in Latin
America with 2.8 million total square feet of space. The state of the
art building offers the latest and the finest in technology and
architecture. The Trump Ocean Club master plan includes condominiums
and condo-hotel units, a magnificent wellness spa, an oversized
infinity pool &amp; deck, a full-service hotel, yacht club, a private
island &amp; beach club, an electrifying on-site 45,000 square foot Trump
International Casino, upscale shops from international brands,
exclusive office lofts, an elite hotel sky lobby, a state-of-the-art

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Studios' profit
margins have increased five-fold since it cut costs and its
film slate, studio president Alan Bergman said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Bergman also told the Merrill Lynch 2008 Fall Preview
Conference that the company has not decided whether to turn to
outside film financing again when its deal with Kingdom Films
LLC runs out in mid-2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bergman said the studio sees no problem finding new
investors even in a down market but may not want to share
profits or ownership going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think we could replace (the funding) in this market. We
aren't actually sure if we are going to," Bergman said. "We are
focused on Disney-branded movies because that's a strong area
for us, we are not sure we want to do a deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bergman also forecast that film production costs would stay
stable. "It depends on the timing of movies as they come in and
out. Over the next few years I don't think it will change
materially," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marketing costs also continue "flat or maybe up a little
bit," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a lot of clutter out there and a certain amount
of money you need to spend," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal with Kingdom Films, which was set up in 2005 by
Credit Suisse First Boston, raised $505 million to foot 40
percent of the production and distribution costs for 32 films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film fund gave 40 percent of profits to investor hedge
funds, insurance companies and mezzanine funds. Disney keeps 60
percent of profits from its live-action, non-sequel films and
has the option to buy the fund's ownership stake in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney turned to outside funding under Chairman and Chief
Executive Michael Eisner in 2005 when production costs were
spiraling and during a downturn in North American box office
grosses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The studio cut its overhead and production costs under CEO
Bob Iger, boosting profitability from 3 percent margins that
delivered operating profit of $207 million in fiscal 2005 to 16
percent margins resulting in operating profit of $1.2 billion
in fiscal 2007, Bergman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue for the division has remained flat, at about $7.5
billion, on a smaller slate of films. The studio division's
performance has been uneven in recent quarters, and dragged on
earnings for Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) in its most recent
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Walt Disney Co closed down 1.5 percent, or 49
cents per share, at $32.43 on the New York Stock Exchange on
Tuesday.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
3:18 P.M. EDT

   THE PRESIDENT: General, thank you for your hospitality and thank
you for your leadership.

   I come to Walter Reed to do a couple of things; first, to pay my
respects to those who have been wounded. I've come to pay my respects
to the healers and doctors and nurses, and thank them for their
service. I can truthfully say that the health care our troops receive
here is first-class.

   I've also come to pay my respects to family members that are
praying that their loved one can get back on their feet and serve
again, or get back on their feet and live a normal life.

   It's -- this is a interesting experience because, on the one hand,
you see the horrors of war; on the other hand, you see the courage of
the people that have volunteered to serve. I marvel when I come to
Walter Reed, I marvel at the fact that people say to me, Mr.
President, I'd do it again. And you see somebody in bed who's been
severely wounded, and they look and they say, I'm honored and proud to
have served. They had one kid in there who got hurt pretty bad, and he
says, I'm looking forward to getting back in uniform, getting back on
the front lines.

   America is lucky to have men and women who volunteer to wear the
uniform and to serve to protect us. And, General, we're lucky -- and
they're lucky -- to have health care that can provide for the wounded
and provide comfort to those who need the care. So I'm honored to be
with you.

   GENERAL HAWLEY-BOWLAND: Well, thank you. You energize our staff,
as well as the patients and their families, to get even better. So
thank you very much.

   THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, all. Thank you.

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Sep 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today extended its leadership in business event
processing, introducing new products and services and mapping out a
vision for the future of a market that Credit Suisse notes is expected to
grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 17.7 percent through 2012
reaching $2.6 billion revenue versus $1.1 billion in 2007. The same
report notes that IBM is the industry leader in business event processing
with 63.8 percent of the market.(1)

    Businesses are facing an explosion of business information from email,
voicemail and new sources such as RFID. It is estimated that there are now
up to 72 quadrillion unique business events generated worldwide each day,
and this figure is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. The
ability to process these information streams quickly and accurately is one
of the most complex tasks facing businesses today, requiring massive
computing power and the most advanced software and hardware available.

    With today's announcement, IBM completes the foundation for the industry's
most comprehensive event processing portfolio. The technology can
automatically track, analyze and respond to changing business conditions
-- whether the events that trigger them are planned or unplanned. Unlike
other vendors, IBM business event processing software incorporates both
business and IT events into a single, unified business view that taps the
greatest number of information sources in the industry.

    The recent IBM CEO study reinforced the importance that business leaders
have placed on business event processing when it revealed that more than
60 percent of all CEOs say they are looking for faster access to, and
management of, the information that can be gleaned from the massive
streams of data they face everyday.

    IBM's business event processing technology not only recognizes these
events but puts them in context and channels them into the hands of
business leaders. This allows businesses to directly identify and analyze
cause-and-effect relationships among events in real time in order to make
more intelligent and proactive decisions.

    "Our clients are looking for technologies to help them identify and
analyze business information in real time, helping them make faster, more
accurate business decisions and quickly seize business opportunities,"
said Steve Mills, Senior Vice President and Group Executive IBM Software
Group. "To address this, we are leveraging unique IBM technologies for
very high-scale transaction and message processing, combined with
acquired technologies from InfoDyne, Micromuse, Solid, AptSoft and
Cognos. This combination of leading-edge technology and skills uniquely
positions IBM to lead the market for high-performance, event-driven
systems."

    The IBM business event processing portfolio, with 3,770 customers
worldwide, is used by 18 of the top 20 Fortune 500 companies and the top
20 Global 500 banks. The proven solution offers greater scalability than
any other vendor, and can process more than 1.6 million events per second
with less than one millisecond latency -- the largest volumes and fastest
speeds in the industry.

    During a briefing of IT industry analysts, IBM mapped out the future of
the business event processing market, illustrating through proven
customer and industry-specific examples that while the technology may
have begun within the financial services industry -- where the need to
make split-second decisions in a low-latency and high trade volume
environment is common -- it has now crossed over into every major
industry worldwide. IBM detailed its vision for this technology, and
illustrated how it gives clients a combined view of the factors
influencing their business allowing them to make smarter, faster
decisions.

    Supporting this, IBM presented numerous client success stories that span
geographies and industries, including Airbus, Active Care Network, ISO New
England and SK Telecom.

    SK Telecom, for example, found that its existing mobile telecommunications
service infrastructure couldn't handle the increasing volume nor real-time
requirements of its growing customer base. By deploying the IBM business
events processing solution it achieved faster response times and now
processes between 50 million to 100 billion messages per day.

    The new IBM products and services represent the unification of several IBM
global initiatives, including Service Oriented Architecture (SOA),
Information on Demand, Virtualization and Web 2.0. They combine business
process management (BPM) and business event processing software to quickly
and accurately predict, detect, analyze and act upon the flood of events
they face everyday:


--  WebSphere Business Events V6.2 - Delivers business event processing
through intuitive business user tools that define, implement, and manage
business events. Version 6.2 provides improved integration with IBM
business process management products and delivers enhancements to the
business user tools
--  WebSphere Business Events eXtreme Scale V6.2 - Offering extreme scale
capability for high event volume customers
--  WebSphere Business Monitor - Provides support for events sent from
WebSphere Business Events, with the ability to monitor via a Blackberry or
iPhone
--  WebSphere Front Office for Financial Markets - Built on technology
acquired from InfoDyne, this will provide rich platform capability and low
latency messaging integration
--  IBM Tivoli Monitoring, IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus and IBM Tivoli
Network Manager and Tivoli Business Service Manager - Current  and upcoming
versions will include new predictive analytics capabilities that can enable
customers to predict potential events such as network outages, online
trading transaction failures, cell phone service disruptions or retail
point-of-sale downtime. The new capabilities in the IBM Tivoli Netcool
software improve event management by using trending and historical data to
help customers proactively manage millions of potential events per day.
The Tivoli software shares event and dashboard views with Websphere
Business Process Events, and Websphere Business Monitor, bringing improved
visibility of both business and IT events
--  InfoSphere Streams Early Access Program - InfoSphere Streams will
provide a new database that can provide analysis of extreme volumes of
information at high speeds
--  CICS Transaction Server Support Pac - Provides new integration with
WebSphere Business Events
--  IBM Event Management and Monitoring Services - Offers design guidance
and deployment services with a focus on event management and monitoring for
IT systems, IT services and business performance management.  The services
will help clients gain the most from their event management system and turn
multiple monitoring data streams into manageable information

    
Today's announcement reinforces IBM's recently announced Business
Process Management (BPM) suite, an integrated set of role-based,
SOA-enabled software that enables clients to design, execute, and improve
core business processes. The suite brings together capabilities from
across IBM to address typical customer scenarios involving systems,
applications, content, people and decisions.

    The IBM BPM suite has helped companies improve business processes across
heterogeneous environments, which include high-volume transactions,
extensive human interaction and broad uses of content, data and
information. The suite empowers business users to take advantage of BPM
capabilities without additional reliance on IT staff.

    The new predictive capabilities are available now in new versions of IBM
Tivoli Monitoring, IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus and IBM Tivoli Network
Manager software. The capabilities will also be in the new version of
Tivoli Business Service Manager, which will be available later this year.

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Sep 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Simba Technologies Inc., industry's source for standards-based relational
and multi-dimensional data connectivity solutions, announced today that
it has partnered with Cognos, an IBM company (NYSE: IBM), to develop new
data access capabilities, integrating IBM Cognos' products with
multi-vendor solutions. As a Cognos Partner Program member, Simba gains
complete access to IBM Cognos resources, software and support to build
high performance SQL and MDX Language interoperability between IBM
Cognos' products and Simba's data connectivity solutions that are
deployed by leading data vendors worldwide.

    "Collaborating with Cognos to enhance data access will play a strategic
role in providing users with wider data access using Cognos products,"
said Amyn Rajan, CEO of Simba Technologies Inc. "This is a testament to
both companies' commitment to open data connectivity for powerful and
actionable business intelligence. For IBM Cognos customers, this means
they can attain greater accessibility to data in multi-vendor data
sources, providing greater synergies for interoperability and data access
that will transform their user experience."

    Simba's innovative technology has gained the company a reputation as the
pioneering leader in data connectivity. Simba has introduced a series of
industry firsts in data connectivity, beginning with pioneering the
development of the first standards-based ODBC drivers with Microsoft in

this time, the company has created many other breakthrough technologies,
such as the world's first licensable Multi-dimensional Expression (MDX)
engine for OLAP data connectivity and reporting, and the first SQL to MDX
conversion technology packaged as an easy to deploy driver. Today,
Simba's MDX technologies are based upon Microsoft's MDX 2005 Query
Language, enabling native data connectivity with the latest reporting and
analytics tools available.

    "Simba's history of innovation translates directly into our data
connectivity products and technologies that are embedded by many of the
world's largest software companies," said Rajan.

    Many leading Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) choose to use Simba's
data technologies to harness Simba's data connectivity expertise, save
time, gain interoperability and benefit from Simba's wide industry
adoption. To enable connectivity between a multitude of data sources and
an ever-increasing list of applications, Simba offers data
drivers/providers and Software Development Kits (SDKs) for various data
access standards, including ODBC, JDBC, XMLA and ODBO. With Simba's
proven technology, users can achieve seamless integration between
products, leveraging existing technologies and processes to enable key
decision makers to gain greater insight into business intelligence.

    "Simba is a valued addition to the Cognos Partner Program," said Mel
Zeledon, VP of Global Alliances at Cognos. "Working together with Simba
will open new opportunities for Cognos and will provide our customers
with greater integration with other vendors' products. This collaboration
will fuse our industry expertise in analytical applications with Simba's
expert knowledge in data connectivity to ensure wider data access options
for our customers."

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc has hired Joanne Bradford, Microsoft Corp's former top saleswoman for Web advertising, as its U.S. sales chief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bradford, who left Microsoft in March to join local TV ad company Spot Runner Inc, will become senior vice president for U.S. revenue and market development and report to Hilary Schneider, executive vice president of Yahoo's U.S. business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She will oversee sales, market development for advertisers, small business, and Yahoo HotJobs recruiting business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bradford's position is newly created. However, she will take over for David Karnstedt, senior vice president of U.S. Sales. Karnstedt, who resigned from Yahoo earlier in the summer, is leaving on September 16 to become an executive in residence at a Silicon Valley venture capital firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are thrilled to have an executive of Joanne's caliber to lead Yahoo through to the next phase of its growth," Yahoo President Sue Decker said in a statement. "Yahoo and Joanne have a shared mind-set about the strategic role that Yahoo and online marketing can play to both build leading brands and drive customer acquisition for the world's leading marketers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bradford took a job earlier this year as executive vice president of national advertising services for Spot Runner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, at Microsoft, she had led global product and platform development, content and programming, business development, product management, marketing and branded entertainment for the company's MSN business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had joined Microsoft in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her tenure at the software giant, she also served as the corporate vice president of Global Sales and Marketing and chief media revenue officer for Microsoft Digital Advertising Solutions across all Microsoft properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her arrival at Yahoo comes during a lull in the back-and-forth negotiations between Microsoft and Yahoo over whether Yahoo will accept a partial or complete takeover offer from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has repeatedly rebuffed Microsoft's offers as undervaluing the company and Microsoft has said it is no longer pursuing a deal with Yahoo although Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has allowed that it might renew a bid later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2006 interview, Bradford had told Reuters she spent her first few years at Microsoft secretly wondering if the software giant was serious about cashing in on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her earlier years at Microsoft, the company had no search engine and Yahoo and Google were quickly building multibillion dollar businesses online, she had noted. Bradford had been given smaller roles by new leadership at Microsoft's Internet business in the year prior to leaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Brian Moss)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Has Selected b2een From Amalto Technologies to Enable Electronic Transactions With Its Suppliers

     Amalto's Breakthrough b2een Solution to Boost Adoption of B2B
             Electronic Transactions for Chevron Suppliers
SAN MATEO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Amalto Technologies today announced that Chevron U.S.A. Inc. has
selected its b2een solution to enable exchanges of electronic
documents with suppliers across Chevron businesses.

   Amalto b2een combines a light web 2.0 client software providing a
secured transport mechanism of encrypted documents between the trading
partners and a SaaS* platform to manage the validation, transformation
and routing of the transactional documents. The solution proposed by
Amalto allows large organizations to capture 100% of their suppliers
in their electronic B2B initiatives.

   With b2een, SMEs have an easy way to send their invoices directly
to their customer's back office systems and get paid rapidly. b2een's
ease of installation and use is one of the levers that would allow
Chevron to achieve its objectives of capturing 100% of its procurement

&lt;p&gt; (Adds revenue expectation for drug, shares)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is
withdrawing all of its marketing applications for its
experimental antibiotic for skin infections to conduct further
clinical study of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December had asked
Pfizer to provide more data for the drug, dalbavancin, before
deciding whether to approve the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After hearing comments from regulators, Pfizer said on
Tuesday it decided to conduct an additional late-stage study of
dalbavancin and withdraw applications for the product in the
United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has been developing dalbavancin for treating adults
with complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by
bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
or MRSA, which can be tough to treat and potentially
dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer estimated the Phase 3 trial for dalbavancin would
take about 18 months to complete but did not specify when the
study will start. Assuming the results are favorable, the
company would resubmit the product to various regulatory
agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it is also planning a pediatric program
for dalbavancin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer acquired dalbavancin in 2005 as part of its purchase
of Vicuron Pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cowen and Co has estimated the drug could generate $250
million in annual sales by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares fell 24 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $18.90 in
morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares were
also down as traders in Europe cited market talk of takeover
interest by Pfizer in Germany's Bayer AG BAYG.DE.

&lt;p&gt;Supply Chain Experts From IBM and SCC Team Up For NCSU Workshop on Planning Production and Inventory

   Presentations to focus on bringing together business and academic
 communities for solving real-world supply chain challenges in today's
                                economy
WILMINGTON, Del.--(Business Wire)--
IBM's Ken Fordyce and Supply Chain Consultants' (SCC) Harpal Singh
are teaming up to deliver a presentation as part of a workshop called
"Planning Production and Inventories in the Extended Enterprise"
sponsored by the Edward P. Fitts Department of Industrial and Systems
Engineering at North Carolina State University. The workshop will take
place September 21-23, 2008 at the Radisson Hotel in Research Triangle
Park, N.C.

   "The focus of our presentation is to enable a connection between
the business community, which is being faced with a variety of
economic challenges, and the academic community, which potentially has
tools or methods that can be applied to real-world situations for
solving these issues," said Fordyce, a senior computational decision
scientist for IBM. "It's that ability to go between the business and
academic worlds and open a line of communication between the two that
is critical, and will ultimately lead us to the next generation of
effective supply chain solutions."

   The purpose of the workshop is to bring together leading
authorities from academia and industry to discuss the state of supply
chain coordination and how to move forward in the future. The workshop
will feature presentations on the history of the supply chain,
challenges that researchers and practitioners face today, including
rising energy and fuel costs and shortages of raw materials, and new
ways of working together to solve those challenges.

   The overall goal of Fordyce and Singh's presentation, titled "An
Industrial Perspective of Planning and Scheduling," is to point out
how optimization should not be viewed as the improvement of one
decision-making point in the supply chain process but should be seen
as the improvement of all of the decision-making points in the entire
process as well as the process itself. Fordyce and Singh, chief
executive officer for SCC, will provide real-world examples of supply
chain challenges to show both academia and industry how choices being
made throughout the supply chain need to be seen and understood at all
levels to provide more efficiency and better sustainability throughout
the complete process.

   Fordyce and Singh have more than 60 years of collective experience
from both the academic and industrial points of view and first
collaborated about 10 years ago on a project for IBM. Since 1995,
Fordyce has been a leader in the development of applications using
advanced optimization models to support daily global supply chain
planning for IBM and its clients as well as teaching undergraduates
applied modeling. He holds a Ph.D. in Decision Science. Singh is
recognized as a thought leader, teacher, writer, software designer and
consultant for process change. In addition to years of industry and
consulting experience, he has taught graduate and undergraduate
courses and has run numerous executive management seminars. He holds a
Ph.D. in Operations Research from Cornell University.

&lt;p&gt;  REDWOOD CITY, CA, Sep 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
NComputing, the leading provider of desktop virtualization software and
hardware, today announced that Will Poole, Corporate Vice President of
Microsoft's Unlimited Potential Group and former head of the Windows
Client Business, has joined NComputing as co-chairman and member of the
board of directors. He brings 25 years of knowledge from the personal
computer industry to NComputing as well as recent experiences co-leading
Microsoft's Unlimited Potential initiatives. Poole will serve as a global
ambassador for NComputing in developing countries and support expansion
efforts in new markets and geographies. He will also draw on his numerous
experiences with leading-edge and disruptive technologies and business
models to help guide NComputing's corporate strategy.

    "NComputing has a practical and proven technology that breaks the
affordability barriers that most schools, businesses and governments in
developing economies face," said Poole. "Working with NComputing allows me
to pursue my passion for addressing some of the most important global
development issues via sustainable and eco-friendly technologies,
including NComputing's innovative virtualization solutions built on
Windows."

    Poole joined Microsoft in 1996 through the acquisition of eShop Inc., a
company he co-founded in 1991 and ran as president and chief operating
officer. Prior to eShop, Poole spent five years at Sun Microsystems,
working in senior marketing and engineering management roles. At
Microsoft, Poole led various business development efforts, ran the
Windows Digital Media Division for three years, and in 2003 assumed
leadership of the Windows Client Business. For the past two years, Poole
co-led Microsoft's Unlimited Potential Group, which spearheads a
companywide effort to create social and economic opportunity for the next
5 billion people -- those in the middle and bottom of the world's
"economic pyramid" -- with a focus on transforming education, fostering
local innovation, and creating jobs and opportunities. In that role,
Poole led development of Windows Starter (which has now been sold to over
seven million first-time PC users around the world), championed
Microsoft's partnership with the One Laptop per Child organization, and
built relationships worldwide with government and business leaders.

    "With NComputing now exceeding a  million unit annualized run rate, we're
poised for substantial and rapid growth. We are excited to have Will join
us to guide our strategic direction and assist us in forging
relationships with governments and other technology companies," said
Stephen Dukker, NComputing CEO and chairman. "We look forward to drawing
from his experiences and relationships as we take NComputing to the next
level."

    The NComputing solution is based on a simple fact: today's PCs are so
powerful that the vast majority of applications only use a small fraction
of the computer's capacity. NComputing's virtualization software and
hardware tap this unused capacity so that it can be simultaneously shared
by multiple users. Each user's monitor, keyboard, and mouse connect to
the shared PC through a small and very durable NComputing access device.
The access device itself has no CPU, memory or moving parts so it is
rugged, durable, and easy to deploy and maintain, which is especially
critical in developing nations. The NComputing solution costs as little
as $70 per seat. More than 20,000 organizations in over 90 countries use
NComputing solutions every day.

    "NComputing has the potential to reshape the computing landscape and Will
joining the company should substantially increase their potential for
success given his background and contacts," said Rob Enderle a leading
technology analyst from the Enderle Group. "Education and commercial
buyers are looking for ways to make their limited resources stretch to
cover their growing needs and NComputing is uniquely suited to help many
do exactly that."

    About NComputing, Inc.

    Winner of the Wall Street Journal's Technology Innovation Award,
NComputing, Inc. was founded with the goal of making desktop computing
affordable for everyone. Headquartered in Redwood City, CA, NComputing is

&lt;p&gt;  AUSTIN, TX and LAS VEGAS, NV, Sep 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
RF Code, Inc., a leader in automating physical asset management, today
announced it has received certification from IBM Tivoli for its Zone
Manager integration module, which provides seamless, real-time physical
asset inventory, location information, and wireless sensor information to
IBM Tivoli Asset Management for IT. The solution will be demonstrated at
RF Code's booth (#228) at RFID World this week.

    In addition, the RF Code booth will spotlight its active RFID tracking
solutions for healthcare, data centers asset tracking, distributed asset
tracking for disperse organizations, just-in-time ordering solutions,
personnel asset tracking for security, environmental monitoring and more.
The company is also featuring a Partner Pavilion in which market-leading
companies will demonstrate their solutions based on RF Code's active RFID
technology.

    RF Code will also be participating in a  panel discussion as part of the
Enterprise IT Asset track of sessions at the trade show. Greg Bryett, VP,
Technical Services, will be a member of a distinguished group of
panelists who will examine "Asset Tracking in the Data Center and Beyond."

    The Importance of Asset Tracking

    Asset tracking, an important part of an overall asset management strategy,
is emerging as a key to an organization's overall financial strategy. Lost
or misplaced assets cost companies millions to replace. Moreover, many
companies end up paying on service agreements or leases for assets that
have gone missing. Overprovisioning costs as well.

    Therefore, the Zone Manager/IBM Tivoli Maximo integration will play an
important role in helping companies more effectively and efficiently
manage their assets.

    About the Integrated Zone Manager/IBM Tivoli Maximo solution

    Through RF Code's Zone Manager, IBM Maximo will have live and
up-to-the-minute asset inventory and location information, rendering an
accurate count of tagged assets and their location.

    RF Code's Zone Manager is a real-time location engine for use with RF Code
active RFID hardware (tags and readers). By collecting and analyzing tag
and reader data, Zone Manager determines the rack-level or zone-level
location of each asset tag. Zone Manager's programmatic and subscription
interfaces allow external applications to easily obtain inventory and
location data. Zone Manager's integration with IBM(R) Tivoli Maximo allows
Zone Manager information to flow seamlessly into Tivoli Maximo to
represent real asset location within Maximo. The following active RFID
asset tag information is exchanged:


--  Current location
--  Location changes
--  Status changes (online or offline)
--  Extended tag information such as: motion, tamper, low battery
--  Temperature readings from temperature sensor tags
--  Door status readings from door switch tags
    

    
About RF Code, Inc.

    RF Code automates the ability to discover, track and monitor high-value
physical assets across the enterprise. Using the company's award-winning
platform for active RFID, customers know instantly and on demand the
precise location of each individual asset. This spares them the high cost,
time intensity, and compliance risk of a manual inventory. RF Code and its
world-class roster of global partners develop solutions used in demanding
industry environments including IT, healthcare, defense, pharmaceutical,
manufacturing, transportation and homeland security. www.rfcode.com

&lt;p&gt;NetIQ AppManager Provides Foundation for Heterogeneous Unified
                        Communications Adoption
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
NetIQ Corporation, an Attachmate business, today announced the
availability of complete Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) lifecycle
management for Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007. With this
module, NetIQ now provides event monitoring, service performance and
availability reporting for all industry-leading VoIP platforms. As
enterprises leverage VoIP implementations, messaging platforms and
alternate forms of real-time communication, NetIQ(R) AppManager(R)
software provides the needed foundation for enterprises pursuing
unified communications to further reduce IT expenses and boost
enterprise productivity.

   As communication patterns increasingly rely on multiple forms of
real-time interaction and instant access to voice and data
applications, IT is pressed to deliver more complex services while
continually ensuring their 24x7 availability. NetIQ AppManager for
Microsoft Office Communications Server module enables IT
administrators to:

       --  Manage server performance through real-time monitoring and
            alerting on server health, including CPU, memory usage and
            hard drive disk space across Office Communications Server
            2007.

       --  Determine server performance thresholds and demonstrate
            service delivery by establishing performance baselines
            that allow for more accurate capacity planning.

       --  Track application performance with call and messaging
            session activity and failure metrics for aggregated
            reporting.

   "By extending enterprise monitoring and management to Microsoft
Office Communications Server 2007, NetIQ furthers its breadth and
depth of expertise in Microsoft technologies and, more importantly,
helps customers to proactively manage voice quality and confidently
deploy Microsoft unified communications technologies in the
enterprise," said Yancey Smith, director of UC Product Management at
Microsoft Corp. "We look forward to exploring how our relationship
with NetIQ spurs innovation and drives enterprise-wide adoption of
this next generation of business communications."

   Although unified communications aims to enhance enterprise
productivity, it also introduces a complex architecture that requires
comprehensive management to ensure 24x7 delivery of services and
consistent end-user experience. NetIQ enables organizations to manage
the breadth and depth of sophisticated unified communications
platforms and applications -- including VoIP, Microsoft Exchange
Server 2007, SQL Server, Active Directory, BlackBerry and more.
Through a single dynamic view of heterogeneous technologies managed
cohesively by NetIQ AppManager, organizations are able to view the
performance and availability of complete unified communications
services, manage service-impacting events crossing disparate
technologies and conduct rapid root cause analysis to limit service
downtime and improve incident and problem management.

   "Enterprise 'unified communications' is inevitable; however, no
two organizations will have the same unified communications
deployment. For that reason, IT needs flexible tools to facilitate
multi-vendor, multi-faceted technology adoption and decrease the
resulting management complexity," said Todd Tucker, director of
Product Marketing at NetIQ. "We recognize that Microsoft Office
Communications Server 2007 will be important to many organizations
pursuing a comprehensive unified communications strategy and with
support now for this emerging technology, AppManager is the ideal
platform for enterprises to achieve their real-time business
communications objectives."

   Availability and Pricing

   NetIQ AppManager for Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007
is available worldwide today. List pricing starts at $1,500 per
managed server.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


J.P. Morgan today announced that its Health Savings Account (HSA) business has
grown by 60 percent in account volume over the last year.

As the only national bank to offer HSAs through its own proprietary platform,
J.P. Morgan remains an industry leader with more than 300,000 account holders
and more than $400 million in assets.

"HSAs enable employers and consumers to balance more effectively short- and
long-term needs around healthcare expenses," said David Josephs, head of J.P.
Morgan's Consumer-Directed Healthcare business. "With the rising cost of
healthcare coverage, health insurance plans that include an HSA help individuals
plan for current and future expenses while helping employers and individuals
manage healthcare costs."

J.P. Morgan reports a number of key trends in the market since offering HSAs
directly to employers and consumers last year.

Employer commitment key to success

The firm reports seeing a 97 percent adoption rate among eligible employees in
HSA programs sold by J.P. Morgan directly to employers. Much of the success of
these new plans is attributed to senior level commitment and employee training
and education.

"Employers that have embraced the HSA as a major part of their healthcare
strategy are seeing high levels of adoption," said Josephs. "Keys to success are
a strong plan design with employer contributions and an aggressive education
program."

To assist employers with HSA education, J.P. Morgan has developed a
comprehensive adoption kit that includes communication materials needed to
educate employees, as well as a road map on how and when to conduct training
sessions. The kit also includes an interactive video that educates employees on
how the HSA works using real-life examples.

Diversity in employer adoption

J.P. Morgan saw early adoption of its program from medium and small businesses
that found the HSA as a way to preserve affordable health coverage. As the HSA
is offered along with a high deductible health plan, employers are generally
able to offer their employees lower premiums and put employees in control of how
their dollars are spent. The additional tax savings of these plans can also make
offering the program much less expensive for the employer than traditional
insurance coverage.

At the same time, many large organizations have adopted J.P. Morgan's HSA
program. These organizations come from industries such as manufacturing, retail
and financial services, with participation across all salary levels including
low- to-moderate income employees as well as managers and executives. Larger
organizations realize they can save up to 30 to 40 percent annually using HSAs.

Benefits of an HSA for consumers and employees

HSAs allow account holders to finance their current medical expenses with
pre-tax dollars and accumulate savings in a tax-free cash account. As their
balance grows, account holders have the option of opening an investment account
and transferring assets into a mix of mutual funds. They also have the
flexibility to hold onto their HSA account if they change jobs and can carry
over unspent HSA balances from year to year, creating an excellent retirement
healthcare savings tool.

J.P. Morgan's HSA program is offered directly to consumers through Chase, the
firm's consumer banking brand. More information on the Chase HSA is available at
www.chase.com/hsa.

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Will Withdraw Global Marketing Applications for Dalbavancin to Conduct a New Trial

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc today announced it will globally withdraw all dalbavancin marketing
applications for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections
in adults, including the U.S. new drug application (NDA) and the European
marketing authorization application (MAA).

Following feedback from regulatory authorities, the company plans to conduct an
additional Phase 3 clinical trial with dalbavancin for the treatment of adults
with complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Gram-positive
bacteria, including MRSA (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus). The
global multi-center study will generate additional clinical data to support
planned future regulatory submissions. A pediatric program with dalbavancin is
also planned.

"After careful consideration of feedback and ongoing dialogue with regulatory
authorities, Pfizer has decided to study dalbavancin further in patients with
complicated skin and skin structure infections," said Dr. Mark Kunkel, Pfizer's
Global Medical Therapeutic Area Leader for Anti-infectives and HIV. "Dalbavancin
represents a potential important treatment advance and Pfizer is committed to
ongoing research of its use in patients who suffer from serious skin infections,
including those caused by MRSA."

Dalbavancin, a member of the glycopeptide class of antibiotics, represents an
important addition to Pfizer's broad portfolio of antibacterial products and
product candidates. Dalbavancin was acquired by Pfizer in September 2005 as part
of its acquisition of Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Pfizer has a long history of developing new medicines for treating infectious
diseases and remains committed to providing physicians with this important new
treatment option. FDA-approved products, including Pfizer's ZYVOX(R) (linezolid
IV/Oral), are currently available for the treatment of complicated skin
infections caused by MRSA.

MRSA is a virulent and potentially deadly bacterium, and MRSA infections caused
by this bacterium are on the rise in hospitals, long-term care facilities and
within communities. MRSA is resistant to many classes of commonly used
antibiotics and can cause several types of infections, with skin infections
being the most common. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has
included MRSA on a reported Hit List of top-priority, dangerous drug-resistant
microbes that require additional research and new treatments.

DISCLOSURE NOTICE: The information contained in this release is as of September
9, 2008. Pfizer assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements
contained in this release as the result of new information or future events or
developments.

This release contains forward-looking information about a product candidate,
Dalbavancin, including its potential benefits and plans for future regulatory
submissions, that involves substantial risks and uncertainties. Such risks and
uncertainties include, among other things, the uncertainties inherent in
research and development; the results of the planned additional Phase 3 clinical
trial; decisions by regulatory authorities regarding whether and when to approve
any drug applications that may be filed for Dalbavancin as well as their
decisions regarding labeling and other matters that could affect its
availability or commercial potential; and competitive developments.

A further description of risks and uncertainties can be found in Pfizer's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 and in its
reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.

&lt;p&gt;Exchange Expert Keith McCall to Discuss Benefits, Challenges, and
       Disadvantages of Deploying Exchange on a Virtual Machine
--(Business Wire)--

*T
WHO:    Keith McCall, Chief Technology Officer, Azaleos Corporation

        Keith McCall is an expert on Microsoft Exchange, messaging,
         and collaboration systems. Mr. McCall spent several years as
         director and product unit manager for Microsoft Exchange
         Solutions. He was senior director for Lotus' line of
         Domino.Applications collaborative solutions. Mr. McCall also
         invented Net.Commerce and built the team that delivered IBM's
         flagship Internet Commerce product.

WHAT:   Since Microsoft Exchange Server typically does not require the
         full processing capabilities of an entire server, it is
         ideally suited for virtualization where its needs can be
         combined with other workloads. Although virtualization of
         Exchange can be used to consolidate server and storage
         resources, simplify administration, as well as streamline
         high availability and disaster recovery - it may not be
         appropriate for all environments. In this Webinar, Mr. McCall
         will cover the following topics for planning, deploying, and
         managing Exchange architectures:
        -- When and why to consider virtualized Exchange
        -- Return on investment advantages of virtualization
        -- VMware vs. Hyper-V
        -- Unanticipated Costs and Issues

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 9 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities assumed coverage
of MetroPCS PCS.N and Leap Wireless International Inc
LEAP.O with an "overweight" rating, saying the mobile phone
service providers should benefit from rapid subscriber growth
and improving margins over the next several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which added MetroPCS to its U.S. Focus list,
set a price target of $22 on MetroPCS' shares and $56 on Leap's
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said customers of both the companies tended to
use significantly more minutes than prepaid or postpaid
customers and were benefitting from the unlimited monthly plans
that the companies offer, and that larger carriers tend to shy
away from the companies targeted demographic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leap Wireless and MetroPCS typically target youth and
ethnic minorities with relatively lower earnings power by
offering unlimited calls at flat monthly rates without tying
customers to contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies reduce the impact of a volatile churn and
lower pricing by spending less on subsidies, marketing and
customer care, JP Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Leap closed at $46.64 on Nasdaq, while MetroPCS'
stock closed at $17.17 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Customers Cite VMware's Innovation and Comprehensive Solution as
                          Keys to Preference
PALO ALTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW), the global leader in virtualization
solutions from the desktop to the datacenter, continues to gain
momentum as customers opt for VMware's industry-leading virtualization
and management suite, VMware Infrastructure 3, over the Microsoft
Hyper-V hypervisor.

   The Interior Health Authority (IHA) of British Columbia provides
healthcare services to more than 750,000 people through a network of
183 hospitals and offices across the southeastern portion of the
province. With the volume of electronic data growing by orders of
magnitude in recent years, IHA found itself adding as many as 10
hardware servers each week to keep pace with business demands. IHA
virtualized its application environment, which is 95 percent
Windows-based, on the VMware platform to help the agency gain control
over its IT environment by reversing the server sprawl and providing a
more efficient way to manage critical applications and data stores.

   "We were on an unsustainable trajectory and VMware has enabled us
to reign in our infrastructure," said Kris Jmaeff, information system
security specialist, Interior Health Authority. "We can now manage our
entire environment centrally, and we are using far less hardware,
which means fewer potential headaches and much lower costs. We've
already avoided buying over 200 physical machines. More importantly,
VMware is helping us fulfill our agency's mission; we have greater
control and predictability over application performance and
availability, which helps doctors and nurses improve patient care."

   VMware's Complete Virtualization Solution

   VMware has built its lead by offering a simple-to-use, complete
virtualization solution rather than a standalone hypervisor. That's a
major reason why Rochester General Hospital, a community-based
teaching hospital that includes a premier heart institute and cancer
center and offering innovative surgical procedures and care to the
region and beyond, standardized on VMware's platform. The hospital's
IT infrastructure encompasses many business applications and
patient-critical systems. Rochester General needed a solution that
would not only help control server sprawl, but also support
applications that require extreme resiliency and availability as well
as superior performance and disaster recovery.

   "We see virtualization as a strategic approach, not simply a
consolidation tactic," said Tom Gibaud, IT manager at Rochester
General Hospital. "Only VMware could offer us a comprehensive
solution. The administrative control, overall manageability and the
breadth of VMware's feature set make it ideal for us. It addressed all
of our requirements and the result is an IT infrastructure that helps
improve patient care and streamline business operations."

   Safe Choice, Smart Choice

   Yet another customer who selected VMware over Microsoft is
Interfaith Medical Center, one of New York City's leading medical
facilities. Interfaith began investigating virtualization when its
server hardware requirements reached unsustainable levels. The
hospital faced power, space and budget constraints. After considering
offerings from VMware, Microsoft and Citrix, Interfaith selected
VMware Infrastructure. The hospital is now running nearly all of its
critical Windows-based applications in a virtualized environment,
including its core Meditech health information system that is the
foundation for patient care and billing, BlackBerry Enterprise Server,
Microsoft SharePoint, Kronos software for timekeeping and scheduling,
and Lawson software for finance and accounting.

   "VMware's platform gives us exactly what we need - a stable,
mature solution stress-tested across many deployments," said Meraz
Nasir, manager of infrastructure at Interfaith Medical Center. "We
haven't had any planned or unplanned downtime since moving to VMware.
Performance is never an issue. Disaster recovery is even within our
reach now that we don't need to deploy massive amounts of hardware.
All these factors help us focus more attention on our patients and
less attention on technical issues. When we got serious about
virtualization, our choice was very simple. It was VMware all the
way."

   Raghu Raghuram, vice president of product and solutions at VMware,
explained the secret to VMware's success, "We provide customers with a
complete solution, not just one piece of the puzzle like Microsoft. We
reach from the datacenter to the desktop, from the hypervisor to the
management tools. We've also established a massive ecosystem of
partners who add value for our customers and we offer a full set of
services. The plain truth is that no other player in the
virtualization space can match the quality or range of our offerings.
That's why customers view us as the safe choice and have such
confidence that we'll continue to innovate and lead in the years
ahead."

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 9 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded
technology market research firm Gartner Inc (IT.N) to "neutral"
from "overweight," saying potential deceleration in global
IT-related investment could hurt the company's business in the
coming quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IT-related investment is cooling and it could be a negative
for Gartner as it generates revenue from IT-focused research,
consulting and events, analyst David Lewis said in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gartner has been growing nicely outside the United States,
up about 18 percent in 2007, but as economic slowdown extends
to Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, the company could
face trouble adjusting to it, Lewis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In addition, the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar
could become a slight headwind for Gartner in coming quarters,"
the analyst added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gartner generates about 40 percent of its revenue from
outside the United States, Lewis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Stamford, Connecticut-based Gartner closed at
$26.49 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.

Researched by Industrial Info Resources (Sugar Land, Texas) -- From now
until 2030, the world's energy demand is expected to increase at an

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Banks recouped $20 billion on mortgage
securities holdings in Monday's sweeping MBS rally after the
government takeover of Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac
FRE.N the day before, a JPMorgan analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Banks just made about $20 billion on their available
for-sale portfolios this morning," Matthew Jozoff, head of
mortgage strategy at JPMorgan, said on a conference call.
"Maybe they'll use that gain to add to their capital base or
even start rotating into some of the sectors that had lagged."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Available for sale refers to securities that a company is
trying to sell rather than hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Risk premiums on mortgage bonds issued by the troubled
mortgage financiers have been slashed by as much as 40 basis
points over Treasuries on Monday, Jozoff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Banks had been a little over $40 billion under water
relative to their book costs for securities overall and with
today's move and the tightening in mortgages, we estimate that
helps bring that to only about $20 billion under water," Jozoff
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This could be an opportunity for banks to basically
recycle and move out of agency securities and potentially move
into other products as well," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial firms overall have posted over $500 billion in

                               33rd ESMO Congress
STOCKHOLM, Sweden--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer announced today that important study results involving the company's
leading anticancer agent, SUTENT(R) (sunitinib malate), as well as data
examining an investigational agent, CP-751,871, will be presented at the 33rd
European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress in Stockholm, 12--16
September 2008.

Researchers will present results of several analyses evaluating the cost
effectiveness of SUTENT(R) as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic
renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), as well as updated data from a pivotal Phase III
trial in mRCC. In addition, researchers will present updated results for
CP-751,871, a novel anti-IGF-1R antibody, and the first in its class to initiate
Phase III trials in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

"Pfizer has made a major commitment to oncology, and invests a significant
portion of R funds in cancer research across four scientific platforms and 22
compounds," said Garry Nicholson, senior vice president, General Manager, Pfizer
Oncology Business Unit. "We are eager to share with the international oncology
community key study results at the 2008 ESMO Congress."

Details on the key studies to be presented at the meeting during podium
presentations and poster discussions are as follows:

SUTENT(R) (sunitinib malate) clinical studies:

Abstract 723P: Cost-effectiveness of sunitinib (SU), sorafenib (SFN),
temsirolimus (TMS), and bevacizumab plus interferon-alfa (BEV/IFN) as first-line
therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) - an indirect comparison:

    --  A new cost-effectiveness analysis indirectly comparing SUTENT with
        sorafenib, temsirolimus, and bevacizumab from a third party payor
        perspective will be presented by Agnes Benedict, MSc, United BioSource
        Corporation.

    --  An adaptation of the cost effectiveness analysis for the Swedish Health
        Service (Abstract 725P), as well as an analysis of cost effectiveness

About SUTENT((R)) (sunitinib malate)

Sunitinib, an oral treatment, was approved in Europe as a first line treatment
for mRCC in January 2007. Sunitinib is also indicated for the treatment of
unresectable and/or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST)
after failure of imatinib mesylate.

SUTENT works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important sunitinib malate targets,
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth
factor receptor (PDGFR) are expressed by many types of solid tumours, and are
thought to play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumours
acquire blood vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. SUTENT also
inhibits other targets important to tumour growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET.

Important SUTENT((R)) (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

The recommended starting dose for Sutent is 50 mg once daily for four weeks
followed by two weeks off. The dose can be modified in 12.5 mg increments not to
exceed 75 mg or decrease below 25 mg. Sutent is available in 12.5 mg, 25 mg, and
50 mg capsules. Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for
additional dosing recommendations regarding co-administration with cytochrome
P450 3A4 inducers or inhibitors.

Adverse events (AEs) were generally mild to moderate. Most adverse events were
reversible, and generally did not result in discontinuation. In clinical trials,
the most common treatment related adverse events (greater than20%) included
fatigue; gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhoea, nausea, stomatitis,
dyspepsia, and vomiting; skin discoloration; dysgeusia (loss of taste); and
anorexia. Fatigue, hypertension and neutropenia were the most common grade 3
treatment related adverse events. Increased lipase (2%) was the most common
grade 4 treatment related adverse event. Hepatitis and hepatic failure occurred
in less than1% of patients and prolonged QT interval events occurred in less
than 0.1%.

The most important treatment related serious adverse events associated with
Sutent treatment of solid tumour patients were pulmonary embolism (1%),
thrombocytopenia (1%), tumour haemorrhage (0.9%), febrile neutropenia (0.4%),
and hypertension (0.4%). Patients should be screened for hypertension and
appropriately controlled with medical management. Temporary suspension of Sutent
is recommended in patients with severe hypertension that is not controlled with
medical management.

Developed by Pfizer, Sutent is being studied alone and in combination with other
medicines as a potential treatment for a number of other solid tumours,
including breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers.

About CP-751,871

CP-751,871, a fully human monoclonal antibody, is a highly specific inhibitor of
the IGF-1R pathway. The IGF-1R pathway is one of the key signaling pathways in
cancer cells that lead to uncontrolled growth and survival of tumour cells.

Pfizer initiated a global Phase III clinical trial registration program for
CP-751,871 in NSCLC. The program initially includes two studies in patients with
non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC; ADVIGO 1016 in first-line patients and ADVIGO 1018 in
refractory patients. In addition, Pfizer is studying CP-751,871 in clinical
trials for the potential treatment of many other cancers, including prostate,
breast and colon cancers and Ewing's sarcoma. To date, more than 700 patients
have participated in CP-751,871 clinical trials in multiple tumour types.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S.-based major oil company Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on Wednesday it extended by 30 years an agreement that allows it to drill for oil and natural gas in the Neutral Zone area shared jointly by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement extends the existing arrangement for 30 years, through February 19, 2039. Under the agreement, Saudi Arabian Chevron, a subsidiary of Chevron, will continue to explore for and produce crude oil and natural gas in the Neutral Zone on behalf of Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude oil exporter and de-facto leader of the OPEC producers group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concession, approved by Saudi Arabia's cabinet in July, is the only oil production agreement that survived the Saudi nationalization of the oil industry in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 60-year deal was first granted in 1949 to a company founded by U.S. industrialist Jean Paul Getty, helping make him the richest man in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia and Kuwait share the estimated 270,000 barrels per day (bpd) of onshore production from the Neutral Zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's net production after royalties is 110,000 barrels per day, mostly heavier grades that trade at a discount to benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil. Chevron could book some of those reserves at the end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The zone is a region between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that dates back to 1920s treaties to establish regional borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron acquired the concession when it bought Texaco in 2001. Texaco had acquired it from Getty Oil in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a large prize there," said John Watson, executive vice president of Chevron, who oversaw discussions with Saudi Arabia on the concession extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Saudi Aramco - the kingdom's state-owned oil company - has mastered many high-tech drilling techniques, it chose Chevron because of its expertise in using super-heated steam to drive petroleum deposits out of the rock, Watson told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are very astute," Watson said of Aramco. "If they could do it themselves more readily, they would."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's too early to tell how steam-injection techniques will work in the Neutral Zone's carbonate reservoirs, Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in its San Joaquin Valley fields, which have a different geology, Chevron was able to boost oil recovery rates to about 50 percent using steam injection, Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Euan Rocha in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GEORGETOWN, Guyana (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) has begun oil exploration in deep water off Guyana, an industry official said on Wednesday, in a sign of the growing foreign interest in the country after a U.N. boundary ruling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Canada's CGX Energy also said it will this month begin offshore exploration, a resumption of its frozen activity after the United Nations ruled a year ago in favor of Guyana in a sea border dispute with Suriname.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guyana, a former British colony in South America, hailed the ruling last year, hoping it would draw back oil companies to tap reserves offshore and boost an economy that depends on the agriculture and mining industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newell Dennison, manager of the petroleum division in the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission, told Reuters a seismic vessel began exploration late last month in a concession bloc held by Exxon, one of the world's largest companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N. decision set a frontier between Guyana and Suriname in the Atlantic Ocean off the northeastern shoulder of South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CGX Energy had operated in the waters until Surinamese gunboats expelled the company in 2000 and halted companies' plans for the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sharief Khan; Editing by Saul Hudson, editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proliance Users Can Easily Capture and Manage Critical Project
Data Directly Within Microsoft Outlook
FOLSOM, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Meridian Systems, a software solutions leader for improving
capital program and construction project performance, announced today
the availability of Proliance(R) Navigator for Microsoft Outlook, an
optional add-on product for both existing and new Proliance customers.
Proliance Navigator enables Proliance users to seamlessly navigate
through data stored in their project management system using the
familiar Microsoft Outlook user interface.

   "Converging enterprise applications and desktop tools such as
those found in Microsoft's Office Suite make data needed for
decision-making more easily accessible," said Cindy Jutras, vice
president and group director, Aberdeen Group, a leading provider of
fact-based research focused on the global technology-driven value
chain. "Meridian Systems is among the first enterprise application
vendors to deliver on this new technology wave sweeping towards
convergence."

   Proliance Navigator was developed as an Office Business
Application (OBA), a technology that helps bridge the gap between
users who want to leverage their existing desktop productivity tools,
while allowing organizations to keep all project data visible and
secure in one centralized project database. This combination can
enable users to work more efficiently, reduce risk and work in a
familiar environment.

   "CIO's want enterprise systems that are easy to adopt by their
user community to ensure their technology investments are fully
utilized," said Bruno Berti, senior director of product management at
Meridian.

   Email Import

   Proliance Navigator allows users to save Outlook emails and
attachments directly to Proliance, where they can be simultaneously
linked to other critical project data, such as Invoices, Contracts,
and Change Orders, creating an easy-to-follow trail of information.

   Data Management and Synchronization

   Proliance Navigator allows users to leverage Outlook folder
structure capabilities to organize Proliance documents in any way that
is meaningful to them. Proliance users can access Outlook's
capabilities to search, filter, group, and sort across multiple
Proliance projects. They can also view, edit and synchronize Proliance
documents directly from an Outlook email. Proliance Navigator
automatically references and updates the Proliance document - without
ever leaving Outlook.

   "Proliance Navigator is an example of a role-based user interface
tailored to specific work tasks, so that project team members can work
the way they want to," said John Bodrozic, Meridian president and
cofounder. "Because Proliance Navigator utilizes the Proliance
Platform, it adheres to the same security, business logic, and
workflow rules configured in your Proliance system."

   Proliance software delivers Infrastructure Lifecycle Management
(ILM) to building owners, real estate, construction organizations who
plan, build and operate large complex capital project, programs and
facilities. For more information on Proliance and the Proliance
Navigator, go to

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)

 Sept 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs lowered its view on the
U.S. asset management segment to "neutral" from "attractive,"
saying a strong dollar, slowing global economy and rising
competition from higher deposit rates will weigh on the sector.

 "We believe that deteriorating international equity fund
flows, increasing competition for investors' dollar from bank
depositories, and the general lack of market conviction will
continue to pressure assets under management and earnings
growth over the coming quarters," analysts Marc Irizarry and
Alexander Blostein wrote in a note to clients.

 The analysts said the recent rise in deposit rates is
contributing to the weakening fund flow, and it will be
increasingly more difficult for managers with mediocre
investment performance track record to bring in new money,
while the best performers would continue to gain share.

 Goldman downgraded Calamos Asset Management (CLMS.O) to
"sell" from "neutral" and added it to its Americas conviction
sell list. Calamos shares fell more than 10 percent.

 The brokerage also downgraded Franklin Resources (BEN.N) to
"neutral" from "buy".

 However, Goldman upgraded Eaton Vance (EV.N) to "buy" from
"neutral" and added it to the brokerage's conviction buy list,
citing the company's low international exposure and expected
growth in assets under management.

 Goldman retained its "buy" rating on Janus (JNS.N) but
removed it from the conviction buy list.

 The brokerage said BlackRock (BLK.N) remains its favourite
diversified asset gatherer.

 The analysts said the segment's relative valuation is
approaching the highest level since early 2006 and might be
overdue for a correction.

&lt;p&gt;Global Partnership Confirmed with
                 Coca-Cola Zero and QUANTUM OF SOLACE
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company today announced that it has teamed its
Coca-Cola Zero brand with the highly anticipated James Bond adventure
QUANTUM OF SOLACE, which will be released worldwide November, 2008.

   This is the first major promotional partnership for Coca-Cola Zero
on an international stage since its successful launch in 2005. The
partnership reinforces Coca-Cola Zero's masculine positioning,
associating the brand with the much anticipated QUANTUM OF SOLACE.

   Derk Hendriksen, global brand director for Coca-Cola Zero, said:
"QUANTUM OF SOLACE is without a doubt one of this year's most
anticipated film releases, and we are very excited to be a part of it.
Coke Zero and Bond share an edgy persona and a global fan base, making
this the perfect partnership."

   Coca-Cola Zero will roll out a fully integrated marketing campaign
across 35+ markets to support the partnership including television,
cinema, print and outdoor advertising as well as on-pack, retail and
theatre activation.

   The brand's global advertising agency Wieden + Kennedy, Amsterdam
is also creating a high-impact TV/Cinema spot to support the
partnership. The spot begins with a nod to the familiar gun barrel
sequence that traditionally opens every James Bond film, with Bond as
a silhouette walking through a barren landscape. As Bond approaches a
mysterious woman in order to retrieve the bottle of Coca-Cola Zero she
holds in her hand, the earth cracks beneath their feet and the bottle
is tossed into the air. The bottle and silhouettes, evocative of the
famous Bond girls, swirl across the screen with images of bubbles and
the bottle lands back in the women's hand as she races off in a sports
car.

   A chase ensues and the sports cars crisscross the landscape
forming the familiar contour Coca-Cola bottle shape. Bond next
overpowers several villains in an attempt to reach the girl and
achieve his goal of recovering the Coke Zero bottle.

   "By incorporating the traditional visual elements of a Bond film
-- the trademark silhouettes, the sophisticated Bond girls and the
high-energy action -- we are able to engage with our core target
audience in a way that resonates with them," said Hendriksen.

   The commercial also features an instrumental score from the film
composed by Jack White, best known as part of the musical duo "The
White Stripes."

   Coca-Cola North America will activate the campaign across major
U.S. cinema chains, where Coke Zero is now widely available at
concession stands. The Coke Zero and QUANTUM OF SOLACE program will
showcase the new cinema ad on thousands of screens nationwide and
include promotions on cups, popcorn bags, point of sale materials and
other in-theater elements. The campaign will also feature a Facebook
tie-in and a text-messaging promotion which will offer consumers the
chance to win exciting Bond-themed prizes. An extensive retail program
will be activated across the West region of the U.S. as well.

   Daniel Craig reprises his role as Ian Fleming's James Bond 007 in
QUANTUM OF SOLACE, the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures/Columbia Pictures
release of EON Productions' 22nd adventure in the longest-running film
franchise in motion picture history. The film is produced by Michael
G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli and directed by Marc Forster. The
screenplay was written by Paul Haggis and Neal Purvis &amp; Robert Wade.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) plans to seek approval under China's antitrust law for its $2.5 billion bid for top domestic juice maker Huiyuan, the final obstacle to what would be the largest foreign takeover of a local firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts and lawyers said the application will be closely watched as it is the first case to test the nascent law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fears that the deal -- which critics warn would mark the loss of a local champion to foreign control -- could be derailed under the anti-monopoly regulations, have helped push down Huiyuan Juice Group's (1886.HK) shares 13 percent from its year high on Sept 3, struck after the purchase was announced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will be the very first case under China's antitrust law, implemented on August 1," Huiyuan's Chief Financial Officer Francis Ng told a news conference on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The offer price had been carefully considered by both the buyer and the sellers," said Ng, when asked whether he thought the offer price was fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola's Hong-based spokesman Kenth Kaerhoeg said: "We will obviously comply with the process, and we'll facilitate it based on what the regulators ask of us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would be inappropriate to comment on the regulatory process," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said on Tuesday rising economic nationalism was deterring investment by European companies and hampering access to the domestic market, saying the Huiyuan deal would be a litmus test of Beijing's attitude toward foreign business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, looking to make inroads into a pure-juice segment of the market it is absent in and shoring up its lead in the overall domestic beverages industry, is paying three times the market price for the Hong Kong-listed Chinese firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some industry experts argue Beijing has no interest in killing a non-sensitive deal but others say a public outcry will have regulators scurrying to protect a beloved national brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen Yuan, a lawyer at legal firm Linklaters, argued the high-profile acquisition may tweak nationalistic sensibilities but the government is unlikely to kill the deal without good reason, partly because the world is watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW NOW?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ng said Coca-Cola was preparing to submit an application to China's Ministry of Commerce. Huiyuan will cooperate fully in the process, he added, but declined comment on how long it might take the ministry to make a ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Straszheim, vice chairman of Roth Capital Partners, was skeptical the deal would be allowed, noting a regulation protecting "famous brands" from foreign acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts however said China had a lot to gain from the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe Beijing will not stand in the way of the takeover even if it may make a point of delaying the approval process. China has more to gain from continued investment by the global U.S. conglomerate...than from a pointless exercise of refusing Coca-Cola's proposal to acquire a juice company," CIMB-GK analyst Renee Tai wrote last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the uncertainties posed by a new U.S. administration next year, Beijing will want to save its firepower."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huiyuan posted a 7.2 percent rise in first-half net profit to 367.3 million yuan ($53.71 million), lagging the scorching pace of 2007 -- when profit nearly tripled -- because of mounting raw material costs, a May earthquake and severe winter snowstorms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huiyuan shares ended 1.5 percent lower on Wednesday at HK$9.75 but outperformed the broader market. The stock is however trading well below Coca-Cola's offer of HK$12.2 each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huiyuan's first-half profit was inflated by an accounting profit of 254 million yuan, derived from changes in the fair value of convertible bonds. Coke has 15.5 percent of China's soft-drinks market, crowded with players including Tingyi (0322.HK), Uni-president (1216.TW) and arch-foe PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), and has little business in the pure juice market, where Huiyuan controls a 44 percent share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese firm is expanding its capacity to tap the fast-growing juice market. It will be able to make 2.9 million tonnes of juice products a year by the end of 2008, up from 2.56 million tonnes at the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=6.838 Yuan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Parvathy Ullatil; Editing by Edwin Chan and Anshuman Daga)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diverse Slate of New Releases Includes Games Based on 'Toy Story
       Mania,' 'Pure,' 'Cars,' 'High School Musical' and 'Bolt'
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
mDisney, part of the Disney Interactive Media Group, announced
today its line-up of mobile games slated for release during fall 2008
which includes new games based on Toy Story Mania, Pure and High
School Musical. The announcement was made at the Wireless
Association's Fall CTIA convention in San Francisco.

   "We have an exciting and diverse line-up of games in the pipeline
for fall based on some of the most popular and highly anticipated
brands and franchises Disney has to offer," stated Larry Shapiro,
executive vice president and managing director, mDisney.

   New game releases for fall include:

   --  Toy Story Mania - Based on the new Disney Parks attraction,
        mobile users can join Woody, Buzz and the gang for wacky and
        fun carnival games on their phone to earn points redeemable
        for unique unlockable prizes. The game features one button
        quick-play for beginners and hidden targets and combo rewards
        for advanced players. The Academy Award(R) nominated song
        "You've Got a Friend in Me" from the original "Toy Story"
        movie is also featured in the game. Release date: just
        released and available now.

   --  Pure - mDisney worked closely with Disney Interactive Studios
        to bring this critically-acclaimed console title to the mobile
        platform. More than a standard racing game, "Pure" is about
        tricks, and, as players progress through the game, new tricks
        are unlocked. The more difficult the trick, the more points
        scored which can be used to unlock items in the garage for
        Quad ATV upgrades. Release date: September 2008.

   --  Cars Radiator Springs 500 - Based on the blockbuster film and
        franchise, this new "Cars" racing game was created by
        mDisney's Living Mobile studio and features fast frame rates,
        great control and dazzling graphics. Players race as Lightning
        McQueen and can unlock six other tricked-out racers, each with
        special abilities. The game includes 15 diverse and
        challenging tracks loaded with power-ups and hazards, and
        build-a-track mode lets players create a custom race. Rascal
        Flatts' hit song "Life is a Highway" is featured in the game.
        Release date: September 2008.

   --  High School Musical: Senior Year - Leading up to the highly
        anticipated theatrical release of "High School Musical 3,"
        mDisney's upcoming game allows players to choose from two
        unique storylines based on Troy or Gabriella. Players can
        improve personal attributes by balancing academics and
        performance skills, and interacting with the other Wildcats to
        become the most popular Wildcat at East High. Mini-games
        include a brain challenge and a dancing rhythm-based game.
        Release date: October 2008.

   --  Bolt - Based on the upcoming animated theatrical release, this
        action-filled game allows players to control Bolt and his
        super power moves: Super Bark, Super Bite and Super Speed to
        defeat the evil Dr. Calico and save the world. The game
        features diverse environments and epic boss battles. Release
        date: November 2008.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds shares, comments on social networks)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Walt Disney's (DIS.N) businesses
are holding up in the face of tough economic conditions thanks
to a strong international presence and a weak U.S. dollar but
the crisis is not over yet, Chief Executive Robert Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our business has been quite resilient," Iger told
journalists at a meeting ahead of the London premiere of the
film "Camp Rock" on Wednesday. "Global theme parks have held up
extremely well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger said the media conglomerate had been helped
"immeasurably" by its businesses outside the United States, and
also by the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar, which had
attracted international visitors to its U.S. theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney, whose businesses span movies, theme parks and
resorts, merchandise and broadcast networks, made almost a
quarter of its $35.5 billion revenues outside north America last
fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger said Walt Disney World Resort in Florida had been
particularly popular. Disney World helped Disney's theme parks
division achieve a 5 percent increase in revenue and 3 percent
increase in operating profit last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he cautioned: "As we go into '09 we believe that the
challenges we faced in '08 will still exist, and as we manage
the company we're managing it with that in mind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares opened higher and by 1435 GMT were trading up
0.8 percent at $32.64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger said Disney's international expansion strategy would be
rooted in fostering creative talent in foreign markets and
allowing local executives to develop the company's brand and
products in ways suited to their own particular market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "From a cultural perspective, we don't believe that the
world is flat," he said. "Disney executives on the ground are
creative, not just distribution executives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He declined to comment on particular countries that might be
attractive new markets for Disney, which is active around the
world including India, China and Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The best way for us to grow in these markets ... is for
those markets to have a sense of ownership," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked whether Disney would consider buying struggling
British commercial broadcaster ITV (ITV.L), Iger said he did not
want to comment on specific companies but said Disney continued
to look at opportunities in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We like companies that fit well within the ESPN and the
Disney brands, companies with a foot in new technology,
companies that are likely to grow because they are part of the
Disney company," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ESPN is Disney's global network of sports broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That's not to suggest that everything we kiss becomes a
prince," he said, adding that Disney preferred companies with
"solid management, a solid growth profile of their own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In terms of organic growth, Iger said video games were
Disney's top investment priority. "We continue to invest pretty
mightily in games," he said, adding that investment for the
fiscal year to end-September would be $250-$300 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales and profits for Disney's self-published video games
fell last quarter, partly due to difficult comparisons with a
strong quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger said Disney was interested in social networking but was
not necessarily interested in acquiring online networks and had
"not really" looked at buying Bebo, which was bought by AOL
(TWX.N) for $850 million earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think the strength of Facebook isn't just social
networking," he said, referring to the world's most popular
online network, which is privately owned. "It gives people the
ability to create and to express themselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Giving kids the ability to express themselves ... you'll
start to see some of this as we roll out newer versions of
Disney.com," he said.

  Complete Securities Lending Over-the-Counter Transactions in Greek and Polish
                                    Equities
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan Securities Lending, a J.P. Morgan Treasury &amp; Securities Services
business, announced today that it has become the first major agent lender to
lend Greek and Polish equities. With the opening of these two markets, J.P.
Morgan is now actively lending in over 30 international markets. This supports
the firm's global expansion efforts, a key area of focus.

"J.P.Morgan's approach to opening new markets means our clients are at the
forefront of opportunities to enhance returns through securities lending,"
explained Nick Rudenstine, Global Securities Lending Product Head, J.P. Morgan
Treasury &amp; Securities Services

J.P.Morgan began lending Greek equities within seven business days after the
Hellenic Capital Market Commission approved using the over-the-counter facility
for securities borrowing and lending. The first trade in Polish equities
followed shortly thereafter. Entering both the Greek and Polish markets ahead of
the competition allows the bank's clients to take advantage of higher fees
driven by increased demand and limited supply.

"We are committed to delivering superior results for our clients, whether
through the opening of new markets, delivery of new product capabilities, or
leveraging the firm's resources and capital strength," said Sandie O'Connor,
Global Head of Financing &amp; Markets Products, J.P. Morgan Treasury &amp; Securities
Services.

J.P. Morgan is a leading global financial services firm and a world-class
securities lending provider, delivering superior client results. As a premier
agent lender, the firm offers full-service capabilities: discretionary,
principal, directed, auctions and exclusives, designed to meet the risk and
reward needs of a sophisticated client base. The scale and scope of the
franchise includes a strong capital base and access to firm-wide resources,
including disciplined risk management, product innovation, operational
excellence, global processing capabilities and top-tier service professionals.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Rod Lurie has sued Touchstone TV, claiming the Disney-owned studio owes him at least $1 million for his failed series "Commander-in-Chief."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, the producer-director-writer claims Touchstone used the Hollywood writers strike as a pretext to stop paying him under his contract for the 2005 series about the first female U.S. president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lurie was ousted early in the series' run, replaced as showrunner by Steven Bochco, who in turn was replaced by the show's executive producer Dee Johnson for its final episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the lawsuit, after his firing, Lurie's contract was amended to include a two-year extension agreement, where he retained executive producer credit on "Commander" and was paid $3 million (in weekly installments) and an overhead allowance of $100,000 per year until June 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement provided for Lurie to remain exclusive to Touchstone and develop, write and supervise other projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Touchstone has not been served with the court papers and declined comment on the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

"Global theme parks have held up extremely well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said the media conglomerate had been helped "immeasurably" by its businesses outside the United States, and also by the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar, which had attracted international visitors to its U.S. theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, whose businesses span movies, theme parks and resorts, merchandise and broadcast networks, made almost a quarter of its $35.5 billion revenues outside north America last fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said Walt Disney World Resort in Florida had been particularly popular. Disney World helped Disney's theme parks division achieve a 5 percent increase in revenue and 3 percent increase in operating profit last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he cautioned: "As we go into '09 we believe that the challenges we faced in '08 will still exist, and as we manage the company we're managing it with that in mind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said Disney's international expansion strategy would be rooted in fostering creative talent in foreign markets and allowing local executives to develop the company's brand and products in ways suited to their own particular market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a cultural perspective, we don't believe that the world is flat," he said. "Disney executives on the ground are creative, not just distribution executives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to comment on particular countries that might be attractive new markets for Disney, which is active around the world including India, China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best way for us to grow in these markets ... is for those markets to have a sense of ownership," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether Disney would consider buying struggling British commercial broadcaster ITV, Iger said he did not want to comment on specific companies but said Disney continued to look at opportunities in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We like companies that fit well within the ESPN and the Disney brands, companies with a foot in new technology, companies that are likely to grow because they are part of the Disney company," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESPN is Disney's global network of sports broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's not to suggest that everything we kiss becomes a prince," he said, adding that Disney preferred companies with "solid management, a solid growth profile of their own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of organic growth, Iger said video games were Disney's top investment priority. "We continue to invest pretty mightily in games," he said, adding that investment for the fiscal year to end-September would be $250-$300 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales and profits for Disney's self-published video games fell last quarter, partly due to difficult comparisons with a strong quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Paul Bolding)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Defense Coalition: Chevron's Environmental Clean-Up in Ecuador Falls Far Short of Company Claims, Report Says

   Court Expert Finds More than 80% of Chevron Waste Pits in Amazon
                     Rainforest Were Never Cleaned

           "Devastating Blow" to Chevron, Assert Plaintiffs
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
An independent court-appointed expert in Ecuador has found that 42
out of 46 toxic waste pits inspected in the Amazon rainforest operated
exclusively by Chevron contain high levels of toxins in violation of
environmental norms in both Ecuador and the U.S.

   The findings are a devastating blow to Chevron's legal strategy in
a class action trial in Lago Agrio, Ecuador filed in 2003 by 30,000
Amazonian residents. The court expert recently assessed damages at
between $7.2 and $16.3 billion. A final decision on liability is
expected in the coming months.

   For years, Chevron has used the prior clean-up as its primary
defense in the trial. New evidence - which includes sampling results
from several pits Chevron claims to have remediated -- has prompted
Ecuador's national prosecutor to open a fraud investigation against
two Chevron employees and former Ecuadorian officials involved in the
remediation.

   The court expert, Ecuadorian professor and geologist Richard
Cabrera, also concluded in his 4,000-page report that more than 83% of
Chevron's 916 waste pits in Ecuador were excluded from the company's
remediation. Chevron performed remediation on only 156 of the 916
waste pits that it built and contaminated.

   Of the 156 pits Chevron claims to have remediated, 54 were
inspected during the trial process. Of those, slightly more than 80%
had levels of toxins in violation of Ecuadorian norms, according to
the report.

   "The findings suggest that Chevron's clean-up was a fraud," said
Humberto Piaguaje, a leader of the Secoyas, one of five indigenous
groups in the region that claims significant population drops due to
the contamination.

   Texaco was the exclusive operator of an oil concession in Ecuador
from 1964 to 1990 that covered an area the size of Rhode Island.
Plaintiffs have accused the company of using sub-standard practices,
creating what experts have referred to repeatedly as the "Amazon
Chernobyl". Chevron acquired Texaco in 2001 and is defending the case.

   Chevron admitted at trial that Texaco dumped more than 18 billion
gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways and abandoned hundreds of
the toxic waste pits, which experts believe have caused dramatic
spikes in cancer and other health problems. For years Chevron asserted
that Texaco cleaned the area and that the trial was a farce, but the
scientific evidence at trial clearly contradicts the claim, according
to the Cabrera report.

   Cabrera, who worked with a team of 14 scientists, reviewed more
than 200,000 pages of evidence from both Chevron and the plaintiffs
and conducted his own soil and water sampling at 47 of the 378 former
Texaco well and production sites. Among his conclusions:

   --  Of 46 waste pits operated exclusively by Texaco, 42 had levels
        of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs) over the Ecuadorian
        norm of 1,000 parts per million -- meaning they pose a serious
        threat to public health. (TPHs contain a variety of
        life-threatening carcinogens such as benzene.)

   --  Thirty-four of the 46 pits operated exclusively by Texaco have
        levels of TPHs above 5,000 parts per million - an amount more
        than 50 times greater than typical norms in U.S. states. To
        secure its release, Texaco had certified that it cleaned up
        pits with more than 5,000 parts per million TPH.

   --  Nine of the pits operated exclusively by Texaco had levels of
        TPHs over 100,000 parts per million - or at least 1000 times
        higher than Ecuadorian legal norms and 10,000 times higher
        than typical U.S. norms.

   --  Chevron separately reported sampling results that violate
        Ecuadorian norms for 53 of the pits that it operated
        exclusively - an example of how the company has helped to
        prove the case against itself, according to lawyers for the
        plaintiffs.

   Chevron's purported clean-up was controversial from the beginning.
When the lawsuit was filed in 1993 in U.S. federal court, Chevron
responded by obtaining a "release" from Ecuador's government before
any clean-up work was done and then used it to try to persuade the
U.S. judge to dismiss the case.

   While the effort failed, Chevron did succeed in transferring the
trial to Ecuador by claiming its courts were fair and a more
appropriate forum for the trial.

   Once the trial began and the evidence became known, Chevron
shifted gears again and tried to claim the Ecuador court was biased
against it. The company has threatened to sue the government of
Ecuador for damages and has hired several high-powered Washington
lobbyists - including former Senator Trent Lott and lobbyist Wayne
Berman -- to pressure the Bush Administration to help quash the case.

   Chevron's latest strategy is to attack Cabrera as unqualified, but
in 2007 Chevron paid him as a court expert without any objection to
his qualifications.

   "No court that accepts competent evidence is good enough for
Chevron," Piaguaje added.

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced the extension and
amendment of its agreement with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This
agreement grants Chevron the right to operate on behalf of the Saudi
government for its 50 percent undivided interest in the petroleum
resources of the onshore area of the Partitioned Neutral Zone (PNZ)
between the Kingdom and the State of Kuwait.

   The agreement extends the existing arrangement for 30 years,
through February 19, 2039. Under the agreement, Saudi Arabian Chevron
(SAC), a subsidiary of Chevron, will continue to explore for and
produce crude oil and natural gas on behalf of the Kingdom in the
onshore PNZ. The field operations are managed jointly by SAC and
Kuwait Gulf Oil Company.

   "We are extremely pleased and honored that Chevron will continue
to partner with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in developing the
petroleum resources of the Partitioned Neutral Zone and the Kingdom,"
said Chevron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David J. O'Reilly.
"Chevron and predecessor companies have worked closely with Saudi
Arabia for more than 75 years and have played a significant role in
the development of its petroleum industry. We are committed to helping
develop the potential of the Partitioned Neutral Zone fully and
responsibly."

   "The extension of the agreement will ensure that important
supplies of much-needed energy continue to reach world markets," said
O'Reilly. "The benefits of the extension will be realized both within
the region and globally."

   "We see tremendous opportunities in the PNZ," said John Watson,
executive vice president, Strategy and Development, Chevron. "With the
extension of this agreement, our partnership expects to apply
innovative technology to grow the recoverable reserves, create jobs
and provide other benefits for the region."

   "In particular, we are very excited about the possibility of
making full-field development of steamflood technology a reality in
the PNZ," said Watson. "We are making solid progress in our series of
projects to validate the feasibility of utilizing steamfloods to
produce the extra heavy oil of the Eocene carbonate reservoirs. If
successful, this would mark the first time that this enhanced oil
recovery technology has been employed to produce commercial quantities
of oil from a carbonate reservoir anywhere in the world."

   Saudi Arabian Chevron and the Kuwait Gulf Oil Company, operator
for Kuwait's equal 50 percent undivided interest in the petroleum
resources of the onshore PNZ, jointly operate four fields in the area
- Wafra, South Umm Gudair, South Fuwaris and Humma - that produce
mainly heavy crude from 10 reservoirs. In 2004, the 3 billionth barrel
of oil was produced in the onshore PNZ. Operations in the PNZ are
managed by the Saudi Arabia/Partitioned Neutral Zone Strategic
Business Unit of the Chevron Europe, Eurasia and Middle East
Exploration and Production Co., one of four Chevron upstream operating
companies.

   Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated
energy companies, with subsidiaries that conduct business across the
globe. The company's success is driven by the ingenuity and commitment
of approximately 59,000 employees who operate across the energy
spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and transports crude oil and
natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels and
other energy products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products;
generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy
efficiency solutions; and develops and commercializes the energy
resources of the future, including biofuels and other renewables.
Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron

   Cautionary Statement Relevant to Forward-Looking Information for
the Purpose of "Safe Harbor" Provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

   Some of the items discussed in this press release are
forward-looking statements about Chevron's activities in the
Partitioned Neutral Zone (PNZ) between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and
the State of Kuwait. Words such as "anticipates," "expects,"
"projects," "intends," "plans," "targets," "projects," "believes,"
"seeks," "estimates" and similar expressions are intended to identify
such forward-looking statements. The statements are based upon
management's current expectations, estimates and projections; are not
guarantees of future performance; and are subject to certain risks,
uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the
company's control and are difficult to predict. Among the factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in demand
for and supply of crude oil and natural gas; selection and successful
execution of additional development plans; actions of competitors;
government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations,
industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on
the scope of the company's operations; the potential disruption or
interruption of project activities due to war, accidents, political
events, civil unrest or severe weather; and general economic and
political conditions. You should not place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this
press release. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no
obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

   U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules permit oil and
gas companies to disclose only proved reserves in their filings with
the SEC. Certain terms, such as "resources," "oil-equivalent
resources," "oil in place," "potentially recoverable volumes,"
"recoverable reserves," and "recoverable resources," among others, may
be used in this press release that are not permitted to be used in
filings with the SEC.

   Editor's Note:

   In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Chevron pursues a wide range of
petroleum and petroleum-related interests with Saudi Aramco and
private firms. Chevron is the only major energy company with a
continuous upstream presence over the past 75 years in the Kingdom.

   Chevron is the world leader in steamflood technology and has an
unsurpassed track record in thermal enhanced oil recovery. Employing
this technology, it currently produces more than 350,000 barrels per
day of heavy oil from reservoirs in the San Joaquin Valley, near
Bakersfield, California, and at Duri, on the Indonesian island of
Sumatra. Steamflood technology involves the injection of steam under
carefully controlled conditions into a reservoir to heat the heavy oil
and reduce its viscosity so the oil will flow readily to producing
wells.

   Active in heavy oil since the early 1900s, Chevron has produced
billions of barrels and offers the energy industry's premier heavy oil
capability, both onshore and offshore. This includes a portfolio of
specialized technologies; production on five continents; a linked
global network of specialists; and a strong research and technology
heritage and proven operating capabilities in heavy oil refining,
conversion and upgrading. Chevron also has an International Heavy Oil
Center in California's San Joaquin Valley, as well as heavy oil
expertise at Chevron Energy Technology Company in Houston, Texas. In
2007, heavy oil accounted for 18 percent of the company's daily 2.62
million barrels of oil-equivalent production.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comments, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 10 (Reuters) - Banc of America Securities cut Goldman
Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) third-quarter and 2008 outlook, citing
continued spread widening, challenging equity markets and
lower-than-expected sales, trading and investment banking
activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Michael Hecht, who had in Aug. 22 reduced his
outlook for the largest U.S. securities firm, on Wednesday cut
his third-quarter earnings view further by 29 percent to $1.77
a share. He also cut his 2008 earnings view for Goldman to
$12.45 a share from $14.70. Hecht, however, said Goldman was
the "best-positioned" global player in high-margin investment
banking businesses, with a well-diversified mix of businesses,
including size and breadth of fixed income sales and trading
businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) stand to benefit from
stronger customer flow activity as other firms face more
substantial de-leveraging pressures, Hecht said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this was "...still not enough to offset recent cyclical
and seasonal pressures across most capital markets businesses
the last three months," Hecht added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst cut his price target on Goldman stock to $182
from $186, and maintained his "neutral" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street research analysts at Oppenheimer  Co, Merrill
Lynch, Fox-Pitt Kelton, Sanford C. Bernstein, Ladenburg
Thalmann  Co, Citigroup and Lehman Brothers have also cut
their estimates on Goldman. Shares of the company closed at
$161.67 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Morgan
Stanley (MS.N) and other banks said Tuesday they are still
trading with embattled Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N,
helping counter speculation Wall Street firms were limiting
their exposure to Lehman's credit woes and plunging stock
price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Goldman is a willing counterparty to Lehman across all our
businesses," spokesman Michael DuVally told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Morgan Stanley continues to trade as usual with Lehman
Brothers," spokesman Mark Lake said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spokesman at Credit Suisse AG (CSGN.VX) and Citigroup Inc
(C.N) also said they continued to trade with Lehman across all
their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The statements indicated Lehman's trading partners would
continue to do business. That sent shares of Lehman rising 3.7
percent in late electronic trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman's stock had plummeted 45 percent to its lowest price
since the 1998 Asian debt crisis as investors worried the No. 4
investment bank was struggling to raise the capital it needs to
offset losses on hard hit mortgage and other assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts estimate Lehman in its third-quarter results could
write down the value of its assets by more than $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors demonstrated the extent of their worries by
bidding up the price of Lehman credit default swaps by 50
percent, fueled by news that takeover talks with Korean
Development Bank had broken down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Five-year CDS on Lehman Brothers traded at 490 basis points
-- or $490,000 a year to protect $10 million of debt. The price
widened by 163 basis points on the day, according to John
Atkins, an analyst at IDEAglobal in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KDB in recent weeks has emerged as the most-likely savior
for Lehman, which has been scrambling to either sell the
company, sell its money management arm or shed a big block of
distressed assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Dena Aubin and Jon Stempel;

&lt;p&gt;ADDING MULTIMEDIA Amazon Defense Coalition: Chevron's Environmental Clean-Up in Ecuador Falls Far Short of Company Claims, Report Says

   Court Expert Finds More than 80% of Chevron Waste Pits in Amazon
                     Rainforest Were Never Cleaned

           "Devastating Blow" to Chevron, Assert Plaintiffs
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
An independent court-appointed expert in Ecuador has found that 42
out of 46 toxic waste pits inspected in the Amazon rainforest operated
exclusively by Chevron contain high levels of toxins in violation of
environmental norms in both Ecuador and the U.S.

   The findings are a devastating blow to Chevron's legal strategy in
a class action trial in Lago Agrio, Ecuador filed in 2003 by 30,000
Amazonian residents. The court expert recently assessed damages at
between $7.2 and $16.3 billion. A final decision on liability is
expected in the coming months.

   For years, Chevron has used the prior clean-up as its primary
defense in the trial. New evidence - which includes sampling results
from several pits Chevron claims to have remediated -- has prompted
Ecuador's national prosecutor to open a fraud investigation against
two Chevron employees and former Ecuadorian officials involved in the
remediation.

   The court expert, Ecuadorian professor and geologist Richard
Cabrera, also concluded in his 4,000-page report that more than 83% of
Chevron's 916 waste pits in Ecuador were excluded from the company's
remediation. Chevron performed remediation on only 156 of the 916
waste pits that it built and contaminated.

   Of the 156 pits Chevron claims to have remediated, 54 were
inspected during the trial process. Of those, slightly more than 80%
had levels of toxins in violation of Ecuadorian norms, according to
the report.

   "The findings suggest that Chevron's clean-up was a fraud," said
Humberto Piaguaje, a leader of the Secoyas, one of five indigenous
groups in the region that claims significant population drops due to
the contamination.

   Texaco was the exclusive operator of an oil concession in Ecuador
from 1964 to 1990 that covered an area the size of Rhode Island.
Plaintiffs have accused the company of using sub-standard practices,
creating what experts have referred to repeatedly as the "Amazon
Chernobyl". Chevron acquired Texaco in 2001 and is defending the case.

   Chevron admitted at trial that Texaco dumped more than 18 billion
gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways and abandoned hundreds of
the toxic waste pits, which experts believe have caused dramatic
spikes in cancer and other health problems. For years Chevron asserted
that Texaco cleaned the area and that the trial was a farce, but the
scientific evidence at trial clearly contradicts the claim, according
to the Cabrera report.

   Cabrera, who worked with a team of 14 scientists, reviewed more
than 200,000 pages of evidence from both Chevron and the plaintiffs
and conducted his own soil and water sampling at 47 of the 378 former
Texaco well and production sites. Among his conclusions:

   --  Of 46 waste pits operated exclusively by Texaco, 42 had levels
        of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs) over the Ecuadorian
        norm of 1,000 parts per million -- meaning they pose a serious
        threat to public health. (TPHs contain a variety of
        life-threatening carcinogens such as benzene.)

   --  Thirty-four of the 46 pits operated exclusively by Texaco have
        levels of TPHs above 5,000 parts per million - an amount more
        than 50 times greater than typical norms in U.S. states. To
        secure its release, Texaco had certified that it cleaned up
        pits with more than 5,000 parts per million TPH.

   --  Nine of the pits operated exclusively by Texaco had levels of
        TPHs over 100,000 parts per million - or at least 1000 times
        higher than Ecuadorian legal norms and 10,000 times higher
        than typical U.S. norms.

   --  Chevron separately reported sampling results that violate
        Ecuadorian norms for 53 of the pits that it operated
        exclusively - an example of how the company has helped to
        prove the case against itself, according to lawyers for the
        plaintiffs.

   Chevron's purported clean-up was controversial from the beginning.
When the lawsuit was filed in 1993 in U.S. federal court, Chevron
responded by obtaining a "release" from Ecuador's government before
any clean-up work was done and then used it to try to persuade the
U.S. judge to dismiss the case.

   While the effort failed, Chevron did succeed in transferring the
trial to Ecuador by claiming its courts were fair and a more
appropriate forum for the trial.

   Once the trial began and the evidence became known, Chevron
shifted gears again and tried to claim the Ecuador court was biased
against it. The company has threatened to sue the government of
Ecuador for damages and has hired several high-powered Washington
lobbyists - including former Senator Trent Lott and lobbyist Wayne
Berman -- to pressure the Bush Administration to help quash the case.

   Chevron's latest strategy is to attack Cabrera as unqualified, but
in 2007 Chevron paid him as a court expert without any objection to
his qualifications.

   "No court that accepts competent evidence is good enough for
Chevron," Piaguaje added.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. government's debt
burden could balloon to $5.3 trillion in the next decade, in
part if it borrows more to finance another fiscal stimulus
program and help ailing U.S. banks and carmakers, Goldman Sachs
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This latest estimate is more than double the $2.3 trillion
baseline forecast from the Congressional Budget Office and 50
percent higher than Goldman's previous forecast of $3.6
trillion, according to Goldman Sachs economists in a research
note released late Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even accounting for stimulus programs and financial
rescues, the two biggest components of the national debt over
the next 10-year span would come from a shortfall in tax
receipts worth $3.2 trillion and military spending, estimated
at about $1.2 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman economists also upwardly revised their federal
budget deficit outlook for the next two fiscal years by more
than $100 billion each compared with their prior forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They now predict the U.S. budget gap will hit $565 billion
in fiscal 2009 and $560 billion in fiscal 2010, adding that
there are risks that could push those figures above $600
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's latest forecasts "entail a much greater degree of
uncertainty than in recent years, with risks tilted heavily to
the side of even larger budget gaps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deterioration in the U.S. economy and turmoil in the
financial markets have compounded the grim budget outlook for
the next couple of years, the bank's analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, the Congressional Budget Office raised its
fiscal deficit forecast for fiscal 2008, which will end on
Sept. 30, to $407 billion from its March estimate of $357
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Congress expected to consider a second fiscal stimulus
package later this month, it could cost about $50 billion, with
most of it recorded in fiscal 2009, Goldman analysts said. This
would follow the $168 billion package enacted earlier this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, the government may be poised to rescue more
failing financial institutions after it seized control of
mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac
FRE.N this past weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said the cost of the move to bail out the two
government-sponsored enterprises was upward of $50 billion,
twice the amount estimated by the Congressional Budget Office
in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, the 11 bank closures so far this year have cost
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp $8.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While aid to the financial sector has gotten the most
attention, Congress is also considering whether to grant as
much as $50 billion in loan and loan guarantees to the
struggling auto industry, Goldman analysts said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Contrary to market speculation, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is not pursuing an acquisition of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N, reflecting concerns that integrating two investment banks would be too disruptive, sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lehman stock plunged 46.5 percent to a new low of $3.88 a share, there was speculation that Goldman, the largest and strongest securities firm on Wall Street, would step in and acquire its struggling rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While reporting a $3.9 billion third-quarter net loss and a series of restructuring plans, Lehman on Wednesday also said it was "examining all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value." Some analysts and investors interpreted the remark as meaning that Lehman was looking to sell the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to comment, citing its policy on market speculation. Lehman also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking over Lehman would be a risky and daunting task for Goldman, particularly in the depths of a global financial crunch, the sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman had 25,935 employees at the end of August, not that many fewer than the 31,495 who worked at Goldman at the end of May. Goldman will report its third-quarter results next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two firms are engaged in essentially all the same businesses, so that there would be considerable overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while Goldman has largely avoided major damage from mortgage securities and buyout financing, it would still be a tall order to absorb a firm with a large amount of risky and illiquid assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman on Wednesday said its books at the end of August included $33 billion of commercial mortgages and property; $13 billion of residential mortgages; $4.6 billion of "other asset-backed positions," such as CDOs; and $10.4 billion of acquisition financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In afternoon trading, Lehman shares had recovered slightly but were still down 36.9 percent or $2.67 to $4.58. Goldman Sachs shares were down 2 percent or $3.10 to $154.49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A. Giannone, editing by Maureen Bavdek and Gerald E. McCormick)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Lehman response, details about Lehman's assets)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Contrary to market
speculation, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is not pursuing an
acquisition of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N, reflecting
concerns that integrating two investment banks would be too
disruptive, sources familiar with the situation said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Lehman stock plunged 46.5 percent to a new low of $3.88
a share, there was speculation that Goldman, the largest and
strongest securities firm on Wall Street, would step in and
acquire its struggling rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While reporting a $3.9 billion third-quarter net loss and a
series of restructuring plans, Lehman on Wednesday also said it
was "examining all strategic alternatives to maximize
shareholder value." Some analysts and investors interpreted the
remark as meaning that Lehman was looking to sell the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman declined to comment, citing its policy on market
speculation. Lehman also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taking over Lehman would be a risky and daunting task for
Goldman, particularly in the depths of a global financial
crunch, the sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman had 25,935 employees at the end of August, not that
many fewer than the 31,495 who worked at Goldman at the end of
May. Goldman will report its third-quarter results next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two firms are engaged in essentially all the same
businesses, so that there would be considerable overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while Goldman has largely avoided major damage from
mortgage securities and buyout financing, it would still be a
tall order to absorb a firm with a large amount of risky and
illiquid assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman on Wednesday said its books at the end of August
included $33 billion of commercial mortgages and property; $13
billion of residential mortgages; $4.6 billion of "other
asset-backed positions," such as CDOs; and $10.4 billion of
acquisition financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In afternoon trading, Lehman shares had recovered slightly
but were still down 36.9 percent or $2.67 to $4.58. Goldman
Sachs shares were down 2 percent or $3.10 to $154.49.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced new services to help healthcare
organizations implement wireless mobility solutions to meet their 21st
century objectives towards efficiency and quality. For many facilities,
an investment in wireless communications is the first step in achieving a
digital "hospital of the future," starting with enhanced communication
networks that improve clinician speed and accuracy in decision-making.

    IBM Enterprise Mobility Services for healthcare providers give clinicians
and nursing staff wireless communications and real-time access to patient
records anywhere on the facility premises. Using critical information and
communications available on demand at the patient bedside, in examination
rooms or in emergency treatment centers, mobility solutions allow
practitioners to stay in continuous contact, to effectively develop and
deliver patient assessments, and to make more informed care decisions
based on collaborative treatment plans.

    Hospitals around the globe are turning to IBM to provide wireless
communication networks and solutions that can help healthcare providers
improve patient response time, while increasing clinical staff
communication and efficiencies.

    Saint Barnabas

    Saint Barnabas Medical Center, New Jersey's oldest and largest nonprofit,
non-sectarian hospital has implemented a wireless communications platform
used by all department managers and Emergency Department physicians. Due
to the success of the initial rollout, Saint Barnabas recently expanded to
obstetrical residents, code team and anesthesia in the near future, as
well as environmental services staff to improve turnover times in the
Operating Room and food service staff to improve patient satisfaction.

    "The clinical value of this platform is exceptional -- we've already seen
incredible benefit from groups including the rapid response team,
pharmacy, transport and operating room staff," said Michael McTigue, chief
information officer, Saint Barnabas Hospital.

    Royal Children's Hospital

    The Royal Children's Hospital (RCH), a specialist paediatric hospital in
Melbourne, Australia, turned to IBM and IBM Business Partners to deliver a
seamless mobile communications architecture that would enable clinicians
to contact each other from anywhere in the hospital, and that would
require minimal end-user training. Because the IBM solution leverages the
hospital's existing wireless Cisco infrastructure, RCH was able to achieve
immediate benefit with limited upfront investment.

    "With its expertise in solving operational problems and enabling
point-to-point or point-to-many communications, IBM was able to take a
strategic objective for RCH and deliver a systematic solution," said Ian
Rodgers, chief information officer, The Royal Children's Hospital. "The
communications architecture allows clinicians to focus their time and
attention on patients and clinical issues, rather than on technology --
this has directly benefited patient care and increased staff morale."

    Toronto East General Hospital

    Toronto East General Hospital (TEGH), a large urban, full-service
community hospital in Ontario, has introduced a state-of-the-art mobile
communications network to the Emergency Department and Complex Continuing
Care Department. The project depends on the availability of a robust and
secure wireless network infrastructure -- a wireless network engineered
to support voice, facilitates integration with various systems and is
"future proofed" to support future demands. The IBM solution included a
unique combination of Cisco wireless network, wireless communication
devices from Vocera, and real-time event driven notification software
from GlobeStar Systems. The hospital estimates that upon project
completion, approximately 800 critical care staff members will be using
the hospital's innovative wireless communicators.

    According to Ralph Fernando, VP Corporate Support &amp; Chief Financial
Officer of Toronto East General, "By introducing IBM wireless
communication and the Vocera System throughout the hospital, we hope to
have multiple positive impacts including improve staff safety, and more
timely communication in the hospital that will help improve patient flow."

    IBM mobility services for healthcare providers help organizations reduce
costs by allowing for the integration of multiple wireless and voice
networks to enhance and simplify communication and reduce redundant system
management processes.

    "In an environment where anytime, anyplace communications is critical,
wireless and mobility solutions allow healthcare providers to dramatically
improve decision-making processes and bring more resources directly to the
patient," said Laurence Guihard-Joly, vice president Integrated
Communications Services, IBM Global Technology Services. "These new
services deliver a communication platform with instant wireless
communications and real time location and event-driven, intelligent
notification to help healthcare organizations improve clinical
effectiveness, productivity and risk management while increasing patient
care."

    IBM Global Technology Services works with leading wireless technology
providers in the industry, including Aeroscout, Cisco, Ekahau, GlobeStar
Systems, Motorola, Polycom, Vocera Communications to provide an integrated
solution allowing clients to benefit from the integration of
next-generation mobile, wireless and real time location technologies
addressing their business objectives.

    "As the BlackBerry platform continues to evolve and broaden its appeal to
mobile users, RIM looks to answer our customers' needs with a broad range
of high-value solutions optimized for use with BlackBerry smartphones,"
said Mark Guibert, Vice President, Corporate Marketing at Research In
Motion. "Offering Live Search on BlackBerry smartphones extends choice
for our customers and allows users to conveniently and quickly search the
Internet when they are mobile."

    "This joint endeavor with RIM is a strategic indicator of our increased
focus on securing broad-scale distribution for Live Search," said Brian
Arbogast, corporate vice president of the Mobile Services organization at
Microsoft, "Microsoft is committed to extending our services across
mobile platforms and we are very pleased to be joining forces with RIM to
help bring Live Search to millions of BlackBerry users worldwide."

    Live Search on BlackBerry smartphones will allow BlackBerry smartphone
users to search the Web's information-whether they're looking for the
latest weather forecasts, images, stock quotes, restaurants, news
headlines, or websites.

Microsoft Windows Live services on BlackBerry smartphones. As a result of
this collaboration, BlackBerry smartphone customers now enjoy easy mobile
access to Windows Live Messenger and an enhanced level of integration
between Windows Live Hotmail and the BlackBerry platform.

    Live Search for BlackBerry Smartphones is expected to be available later
this year with support for multiple languages.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) may incur mark-to-market losses of about $2 billion from its remaining exposure to troubled assets, said Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo, who cut his third-quarter earnings outlook for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette, Woods also cut their quarterly profit forecast on the largest U.S. securities firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman Sachs fell as much as 5 percent in morning trade on Thursday, after analysts cut their estimates and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's LEH.N weak third-quarter results sparked worries over the health of the financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the fall-off of volumes in the latter part of the quarter, drop in commodities prices, derivative volatility and poor performance for hedge funds in the quarter, we believe Goldman equities trading business could be one of the worst in years," KBW analysts Lauren Smith and Joel Jeffrey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith and Jeffrey cut their earnings estimates on Goldman to $1.40 a share from $2.17 for the third quarter and to $13.57 a share from $14.35 for fiscal 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysts cut their price target on the shares to $184 from $200. They have an "outperform" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche's Mayo cut his third-quarter earnings view for Goldman to $1.60 a share from $2.40 to reflect negative markdowns on principal investments and weaker-than-expected capital markets, according to a brokerage note dated September 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayo rates the stock "hold."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street research analysts at Oppenheimer  Co, Merrill Lynch, Banc of America Securities, Fox-Pitt Kelton, Sanford C. Bernstein, Ladenburg Thalmann  Co, Citigroup and Lehman Brothers have also cut their estimates on Goldman. Shares of the company were down $6.58 at $151.01 in late morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research and Markets: This Microsoft Corporation SWOT Analysis is the Essential Source for Top-level Company Data and Information

DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/a735e1/microsoft_corporat)
has announced the addition of the "Microsoft Corporation - SWOT
Analysis" companyprofile to their offering.

   Microsoft Corporation - SWOT Analysis company profile is the
essential source for top-level company data and information. The
report examines the company's key business structure and operations,
history and products, and provides summary analysis of its key revenue
lines and strategy.

   Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) develops, manufactures,
licenses, and supports software products for many computing devices.
Its software products consist of operating systems, server
applications, information worker productivity applications, business
solution applications, high-performance computing applications, and
software development tools. Microsoft also develops the MSN network of
Internet products and services. The company primarily operates in the
US. It is headquartered in Redmond, Washington, United States and
employs about 79,000 people. It provides consulting and product
support services; and trains and certifies computer system integrators
and developers. The Company sells the Xbox 360 video game console, the
Zune digital music and entertainment device, PC games and peripherals.
Online offerings are delivered through its Windows Live, Office Live,
and MSN portals and channels. The company recorded revenues of $51,122
million during the fiscal year ended June 2007, an increase of 15.4%
over 2006. Its revenue growth was driven by the revenue gains from the
licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system and Windows Vista;
increased revenue associated with SQL Server, Windows Server, and
Visual Studio; and increased Xbox 360 console sales. The operating
profit of the company was $18,524 million during fiscal year 2007, an
increase of 12.5% over 2006. Microsoft's operating profit growth was
attributed to the increased revenue and decreased costs for legal
settlements and legal contingencies. During the year, the operating
profit was partially offset by increased cost of revenue associated
with Xbox 360 and Windows Vista, increased OSB data centers costs, and
increased sales and marketing expenses. The net profit was $14,065
million in fiscal year 2007, an increase of 11.6% over 2006. For the
fiscal year 2008, the company expects its operating income growth rate
to exceed its forecasted double digit revenue growth.

&lt;p&gt;NORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney.com, the No. 1 ranked kids entertainment and family
community destination on the Web, again broke records this summer with
new site traffic and "time spent online" records in August. Last month
the Disney Online network of sites scored more than 32.3 million
unique visitors according to comScore Media Metrix, beating the most
recent site record set in June by more than two million unique
visitors and representing a 26 percent increase over the prior year.
Features recently added to the site such as new "Games," "Video,"
"Character" and "My Page" portals contributed to the milestones. Other
drivers included entertainment events and content based on Disney
Channel and Disney music properties as well as a user-generated
content promotion, 'U Rock the Summer on Disney.com.'

   "Our focus on online entertainment is clearly driving success,"
stated Paul Yanover, executive vice president and general manager,
Disney Online. "We are excited to see engagement around our new video,
games, community and character portals as well as user-generated
events like 'U Rock the Summer.'"

   Disney Online also set new all-time records in August in total
time spent on the site and total visits with:

   --  More than 1.7 billion total minutes spent on Disney Online in
        August besting the site's previous record set in July by 16
        percent and representing a 55 percent increase over the prior
        year.

   --  Record breaking site visits totaling close to 152 million,
        topping Disney Online's previous record set in June by 12
        million and representing 49 percent year-over-year growth.

   In August, Disney.com launched several new site enhancements
including the new "Games," "Video," "Character" and "My Page" portals
which are easily accessible from the homepage. The portals bring
together Disney's vast portfolio of online entertainment together in
one place and include new community-based features.

   Content based on Disney Channel and Disney music properties
including Camp Rock, Disney Channel Games, Jonas Brothers, Cheetah
Girls and Miley Cyrus also contributed significantly to Disney
Online's traffic record. Additionally, Disney.com in August ran a
successful month long 'U Rock the Summer on Disney.com' promotion. 'U
Rock the Summer' gave fans the opportunity to create and post their
own music videos to song clips from popular Disney artists and enter
to win once-in-a-lifetime experiences, including a chance to attend
the world premiere of Walt Disney Pictures' "High School Musical 3:
Senior Year," coming to theaters this fall. Guests had the opportunity
to view, share and comment on videos that were uploaded. The promotion
generated more than 12,000 video uploads, one million site visits and
three million video plays (source: internal tracking).

   Announced earlier this month, Disney Online in July broke its all
time online video record with more than 186.7 million video streams
lifting the site's online video streams ranking to the number six
position among all Web sites (source: comScore Video Metrix).

&lt;p&gt;  COLLEYVILLE, TX, Sep 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
digiMedical Solutions, Inc. (PINKSHEETS: DGMS) announced today that the
Company has signed a contract with Dr. Ivan Cvik in Fort Meyers, Florida
to implement the Company's proprietary Microsoft .Net-based digital
prescription handling software, digiRX and digiReauth, and to supply call
center services to support the reauthorization of prescriptions.

    Dr. Cvik chose digiMedical's software and call center support services to
significantly reduce his practice's prescription liability and free up his
office staff's time to spend more time with patients in the office, while
still providing excellent service to patients calling in for prescription
re-authorizations. He also chose the suite of software for its ease of use
and speed in fulfilling his patients' prescriptions. Dr. Cvik sees an
average of 20-30 patients a day at his five-year-old practice. He is
certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine and completed his
residency in internal medicine at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio.

    digiMedical's Prescription Handling Software

    digiMedical has built a suite of proprietary Microsoft .Net-based software
to digitally and securely manage prescriptions in both doctor and clinic
offices and in pharmacies. The software is compatible with most medical
office software and is easy to install. With the software, the digital
prescriptions are routed directly and securely from the physician's office
or clinic to the pharmacy. The digital pack of information also already
contains pertinent patient information, allowing the pharmacy to pre-fill
the prescription prior to the patient's arrival at the pharmacy.

    The Company's digital prescription software suite meets HIPAA and DEA
requirements and helps protect the pharmacist from errors caused by
difficult-to-read handwritten prescriptions and the risk to the pharmacist
of illegally duplicated prescriptions and fraudulent prescriptions.
Additionally, digiMedical manages prescription refills for physicians'
offices and clinics through the Company's digiReauth software and call
center services. The suite of software includes digiRX, digiRxStream,
digiReauth, digiRxComp, and digiAccounting.

    digiRX Expansion in Florida

    digiMedical has operations in both Texas and Florida and, this year, has
been actively expanding in Florida by signing contracts with doctors and
clinics to implement the Company's proprietary digital prescription
software and reauthorization call center services.

    Since launching those efforts, they have signed contracts with a multitude
of doctors in Florida to include: Dr. Steven Bello and Dr. Thomas
Magardino of Collier Otolaryngology, Dr. Richard Wilson, Drs. Angela
Marshall, Wendy Humphrey and Betsy Brothers of Southwest Florida Women's
Group, P.A., Dr. Daniel Kaplan, Dr. Moorthy of Pain Management Center of
Naples, Dr. Shardul Nanavati, founder of Advanced Gastroenterology, Drs.
Romero, Tineo and Seibert of Oaktree Family Practice, Orthopedic Surgeon
Dr. Howard Kapp of Anchor Health Centers, Drs. Santos-Ocampo, Axline and
Spilker of the Collier Heart Group, Dr. John Landi, the Medical Director
of Vanish Vein and Laser Center and Dr. Wey of the Neuroscience and Spine
Associates in Naples, Florida, among others.

    Company Updates and Information

    digiMedical's software, which is currently in use in pharmacies in Naples
and Ft. Meyers, Florida, and in Dallas, Texas, is now available for
implementation nationwide in independent and chain pharmacies. If you are
interested in learning more about digiMedical's software, or implementing
the Company's proprietary technology in your pharmacy, please contact the

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, changes source)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 11 (Reuters) - JP Morgan cut PDL BioPharma (PDLI.O),
which is spinning off its biotechnology operations, to
"underweight" from "neutral" and said the company's strategic
options point to downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage expects the drug maker's shares to trade
lower as investor expectations reflect the true value of the
royalty stream and the biotech spin-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Geoffrey Meacham said he has very little conviction
in the company's pipeline and that PDL is unlikely to
securitize the full value of future royalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also believes that the spin-off should trade at a
discount to cash given a potentially dilutive financing within
3 years and little RD success historically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also said PDL's biotech pipeline will require continued
cash output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of PDL BioPharma closed at $11.62 Wednesday on
Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 11 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded
speciality chemical maker Albemarle Corp (ALB.N) to
"overweight" from "neutral," saying it views the current share
price as an attractive entry point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Fear over the effects of a slowing global economy and lower
oil prices on catalyst demand is creating a purchase
opportunity, analyst Jeffrey Zekauskas wrote in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Albemarle's catalysts are used in petroleum refining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Companies that refine oil to produce gasoline and other
products had struggled to pass through high crude prices to
their customers, and increased the usage of lower grade crudes
to shore up their refining margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zekauskas believes that lower quality crude use and more
stringent environmental regulations should assist catalyst
demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Zekauskas downgraded another speciality chemical
maker H.B. Fuller Co (FUL.N) to "neutral" from "overweight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Fuller has its work cut out for it over the coming
quarters. A large challenge the company faces is to raise
adhesive prices within an industry with a fragmented structure
during a period of decreasing global end-market growth,"
Zekauskas wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Moreover, decreases in the prices of the underlying
commodities (oil and gas) may in fact inhibit price pass
thorough during this period of high inflation," the analyst
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; H.B. Fuller makes adhesives and sealants that are used by
packaging, automotive and textile companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Albemarle closed at $34.38 Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange, while H.B. Fuller shares closed at
$23.28.

&lt;p&gt; (New throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 11 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities assumed coverage
of Medarex Inc MEDX.O and downgraded the stock to "neutral,"
citing timeline concerns related to the biotechnology company's
experimental treatment for advanced melanoma, ipilimumab,  and
lack of near-term upside drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) and Medarex said
they will delay seeking approval for ipilimumab after U.S.
health regulators asked for additional overall survival data to
further demonstrate benefit of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Matthew Roden said the previous "overweight" rating
was based on expected upside from pipeline development or
strategic options, but added that he no longer believes
investors will include ipilimumab in the company's valuation
until late-stage data, expected in the second half of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the weakness in the ipilimumab dataset in 2nd-line
melanoma, we do not believe the Street will pay for 1st-line
melanoma without positive data," Roden added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roden expects ipilimumab to be launched in late 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Medarex shares closed at $6.95 Wednesday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;  BALTIMORE, MD, Sep 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation announces that a class action
lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the
District of Connecticut on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of
General Electric Company ("GE" or the "Company") (NYSE: GE) during the
period between March 12, 2008 and April 10, 2008, inclusive (the "Class
Period").

    Members of the Class will be represented by the lead plaintiff and counsel
chosen by the lead plaintiff. If you wish to choose counsel to represent
you and the Class, you must apply to be appointed lead plaintiff no later
than September 29, 2008 and be selected by the Court. The lead plaintiff
will direct the litigation and participate in important decisions
including whether to accept a settlement and how much of a settlement to
accept for the Class in the action. The lead plaintiff will be selected
from among applicants claiming the largest loss from investment in the
Company during the Class Period. You may contact Brower Piven (through
hoffman@browerpiven.com or 410/332-0030) to answer any questions you may
have in that regard.

    The complaint charges GE and certain of its executives with violations
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. No class has yet been certified
in the above action. According to the complaint, at the beginning of the
Class Period defendants assured investors that the Company would meet its
financial goals for 2008 and, with respect to the Company's financial
services businesses, differentiated GE from other financial service
providers, noting it could "withstand a market slowdown in the U.S. and
still grow earnings." The complaint further alleges that these statements
to investors were false when made because, among other information,
defendants failed to disclose that GE's financial services division's
investments had declined in value such that the Company would have to
record mark-to-market losses and recognize certain asset impairments. As
further alleged in the complaint, only about four weeks after assuring
investors, a period during which pertinent information available to the
Company remained substantially the same, the Company's assurances were
revealed to have been unfounded. When new information about earnings was
disclosed by the Company on April 11, 2008, the value of GE shares
declined significantly.

    If you have suffered a net loss for all transactions in General Electric
Company securities during the Class Period, you may obtain additional
information about this lawsuit and your ability to become a lead plaintiff
by contacting Brower Piven at www.browerpiven.com, by email at
hoffman@browerpiven.com, by calling 410-332-0030, or at Brower Piven, A
Professional Corporation, The World Trade Center-Baltimore, 401 East Pratt
Street, Suite 2525, Baltimore, Maryland 21202. Attorneys at Brower Piven
have combined experience litigating securities and class action cases of
over 40 years. If you choose to retain counsel, you may retain Brower
Piven without financial obligation or cost to you, or you may retain other
counsel of your choice. You need take no action at this time to be a
member of the class.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The current credit depression is more
severe than anything seen in a lifetime and unlikely to end any
time soon, but Goldman Sachs (GS.N) will probably lead the
eventual recovery, Sanford C. Bernstein  Co analyst Brad Hintz
said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We have never seen anything as deep or as severe as this
in the lifetime of anybody working on Wall Street or in the
City of London," Hintz, former chief financial officer at
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N, said on a conference call
with investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is hard to make an argument for a rally in the credit
market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of the four Wall Street investment banks Goldman, Lehman,
Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), 
Hintz said Goldman should have the highest return on equity in
an eventual recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman certainly is ... a play for that upturn," he said.
"But the real issue with the whole sector is that I'm not

&lt;p&gt;Repeated Political Interference in Ongoing Environmental Lawsuit
                     Has Made a Farce of the Trial
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Earlier this week, Ecuador's Prosecutor General indicted two
Chevron attorneys associated with the company's ongoing civil lawsuit
between Chevron and 48 Ecuadorian plaintiffs. The politically
motivated indictments mark a renewal of the Ecuadorian state's
attempts to disavow contractual obligations owed to Chevron from
contracts signed in 1995 and 1998. The actions also ignore the
findings of prior Prosecutor Generals who have repeatedly investigated
fraud allegations and found them to be meritless.

   In response, Chevron Vice President and General Counsel Charles
James issued the following statement:

   "By issuing these baseless indictments, it is clear the government
of Ecuador is trying to intimidate Chevron into forfeiting its legal
rights. This outrageous tactic won't work. Chevron intends to continue
pursuing the rights it is owed under the law and its agreements with
the government of Ecuador.

   "Recent events in Ecuador leave no doubt that there is improper
collaboration between the government and plaintiffs' lawyers. The
systematic denial of Chevron's right to a fair trial is obvious, and
it is clear that the proceeding has been thoroughly corrupted. By
persecuting Chevron's counsel and collaborating with the plaintiffs to
undermine Chevron's legal rights, Ecuador's government has intervened
in the legal proceeding. The Ecuadorian state continues to call into
serious question the legitimacy of its judiciary and its commitment to
the rule of law."

   Chevron's Note to Editors:

   The government of Ecuador, in collaboration with American trial
lawyers, is seeking to avoid its obligation to clean up its share of
oil operations developed with Texaco Petroleum Company (a subsidiary
of Texaco, Inc., which was acquired by Chevron in 2001). In return for
remediating its portion of the operation, Texaco Petroleum received
from state-owned Petroecuador and the Republic of Ecuador a final
release agreement in 1998 that absolved Texaco Petroleum, as well as
personnel and affiliates, of future liabilities and claims.

   In 2004, Chevron commenced arbitration to enforce Petroecuador's
indemnity obligations toward Texaco Petroleum. Petroecuador refused,
and the government of Ecuador now intends to avoid its obligations by
using its legal system to declare that Chevron's release agreement was
obtained by fraudulent means. This allegation ignores the fact that
Texaco Petroleum's remediation work, and the subsequent release
agreement, was reviewed at the highest levels of the Ecuadorian
government.

   It also ignores the fact that officials within the Ecuadorian
government have repeatedly acknowledged that there is no evidence of
fraud on the part of Texaco Petroleum or any of its employees. On
August 9, 2006, the Prosecutor General of Ecuador concluded:

   "A review of the report on the Special Examination referred to by
the Comptroller General shows that he does not find civil or
administrative liability in any of his conclusions, nor does he find
evidence of any criminal liability for any crime
whatsoever....Moreover, there is an obvious contradiction between the
report on the Special Examination (by the Comptroller General), none
of the findings of which indicate any evidence of criminal liability,
and the criminal complaint, which the Controller General alleges to be
based on evidence found in the Examination."

   Former Ecuador Attorney General Jose Maria Borja, in sworn
testimony during a September 2006 U.S. Federal Court case, also
admitted that he had neither facts nor evidence of fraud related to
Texaco Petroleum's remediation program.

   Nonetheless, the government of Ecuador has forged an active
partnership with plaintiffs' attorneys to invalidate the agreements it
has signed. In 2005 email correspondence, one of the Attorney
General's employees wrote to the plaintiffs' attorneys:

   "The Attorney General's Office and all of us working on the
State's defense were searching for a way to nullify or undermine the
value of the remediation contract (between Petroecuador, the Republic
of Ecuador, and Texaco Petroleum)."

   Ecuador's attempts to undermine the remediation contract took on a
new tone in April 2007 when Ecuador's newly elected president, Rafael
Correa, stated in a nationwide radio broadcast that the signatories to
the release agreement were traitors and demanded that the Prosecutor
General seek criminal indictments against all involved. Subsequently
the Prosecutor General's office decided to reopen the investigation
without offering any new facts or evidence.

   Meanwhile, it has become increasingly clear that the Ecuadorian
state and advocates for the plaintiffs are working together to advance
their common goal of shifting Petroecuador's remediation obligations
to Chevron. At the end of July 2008, the plaintiffs' advocates held a
news conference in Quito, Ecuador, calling for the filing of
indictments against Chevron attorneys. In the days that followed,
President Correa announced that he had met with plaintiffs' advocates
to discuss the case and revealed that the Prosecutor General had
reopened the fraud investigation.

sweeping from continent to continent. Only 100 three-person teams will
advance to the World Finals on April 22, 2009 hosted by KTH - Royal
Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.

    The Battle of the Brains has grown to be the largest and most prestigious
computer competition of its kind. It is expected to include tens of
thousands of students from universities in 83 countries on six continents.
Since IBM began sponsoring the Contest in 1997, participation has grown
from 1,100 to 6,100 teams.

    "This contest is about fostering the next generation of industry leaders
in information technology and promoting strong foundations in both
technology and business," said Doug Heintzman, director of strategy, IBM
Software Group and sponsorship executive. "IBM understands the importance

&lt;p&gt;  MANILA, PHILIPPINES, Sep 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Philippine Savings Bank (PSBank) announced today a
major transformation effort to implement the New Enterprise Data Center
(NEDC) strategy -- aimed to address PSBank's increasing business and
technology requirements in support of its expanding customer base, as
well as product and service portfolio.

    PSBank, the country's second largest savings bank, decided to migrate its
database to IBM System z. The bank will use the mainframe for seven
Linux-based online transaction processor (OLTP) applications and its Data
Warehouse. IBM System z's advanced virtualization technology will allow
PSBank to consolidate multiple servers into just one Integrated Facility
for Linux (IFL), while providing 30 times better performance. IBM System z
is a robust, scalable and secured platform perfect to run PSBank's
mission-critical database applications.

    The NEDC strategy allows companies to focus on the services provided by
the infrastructure, while streamlining the underlying technology that
enables these services. Thus, it yields a more productive and satisfied
user community, as well as provides better alignment between business
priorities and information technology investments.

    "With the PSBank's thrust of giving premium to quality customer service,
we embarked on upgrading the technology infrastructure with IBM to improve
capacity and service availability to address issues that may confront us
as our customer base grows rapidly," said Pascual M. Garcia III,
President, PSBank. "With IBM as our partner, we are confident that we can
achieve better response time and minimized downtime, resulting in better
productivity, savings on operating systems and database software license
costs, better capacity for future expansion requirements and a
consolidated operating environment. All these will translate to better
customer experience and satisfaction."

    PSBank, a member of the Metrobank Group, and IBM have been business
partners for many years now.

    "PSBank requires an efficient, flexible and resilient infrastructure that
is primed to anticipate and respond rapidly to its shifting and expanding
business requirements," said IBM Philippines Country General Manager,
James Velasquez. "We are excited to collaborate with PSBank in driving
the new enterprise data center architecture--one that allows for massive
scalability and dynamic responsiveness while also providing an energy
efficient and resilient infrastructure."

    With this NEDC transformation project, PSBank and IBM aim to achieve
similar goals in reducing energy consumption as well as reducing cost,
space and IT maintenance, while enhancing the efficiency and capacity of
its data center facilities.

    This project is an example of how IBM is helping clients develop a new
enterprise data center, which offers dramatic improvements in IT
efficiency and provides for rapid deployment of new IT services to
support future business growth. IBM is supporting clients' move to new
enterprise data centers by focusing on best practice around
virtualization, green IT, service management and cloud computing.

    About PSBank

    PSBank is a key player in consumer banking, ranking 13th in capital among
Philippine Banks. It is also the 13th largest Philippine lender. With
P8.2-billion capital and P69-billion assets as of end-June 2008. A member
of the Metrobank Group, PSBank currently has 163 branches and 165 ATMs

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced the launch of a
U.S.-based public campaign called "I Will." The campaign is designed
to raise awareness of the importance of energy efficiency and
conservation.

   "Energy efficiency is the cheapest and most reliable source of new
energy that we have," said Chevron Vice Chairman Peter Robertson.
"With demand for energy continuing to rise across the United States
and around the world, it's imperative that we use the resources we
already have more efficiently. We hope our new campaign will help
raise awareness of the power of energy efficiency and encourage
individuals to take actions to use energy more wisely."

   "I Will" debuts this weekend on television and will begin
appearing in major print publications and online media.

   The advertisements complement Chevron's updated
www.willyoujoinus.com website that provides useful information on ways
to conserve energy and use it more efficiently. The website, which
launches Sunday, Sept. 14, introduces a number of new tools including
the Energy Generator, an interactive feature that demonstrates how
simple individual actions can yield measurable energy savings.
Individuals can choose from a variety of easy ways to save energy and
learn more about how that saved energy can be applied elsewhere, such
as powering a school or hospital.

   For example, the Energy Generator will demonstrate how lowering
the thermostat in an average U.S. residence by one degree in the
winter will save enough energy to light approximately 5,000 hours of
reading. If 1,000 people join in and lower their thermostat by one
degree, they will save enough energy to power a hospital for 10 days.

   "I Will" is part of Chevron's long-term commitment to efficiency
and conservation. It is a continuation of the dialogue on energy
issues that began last fall with the company's "The Power of Human
Energy" advertising campaign, which sought to raise awareness and
encourage discussion about the major issues surrounding energy.

   Chevron began focusing on energy efficiency as part of its
long-term strategy in 1992, when it began tracking energy use across
its worldwide operations. Since then, the company has improved its
internal energy efficiency by 27 percent.

   "Chevron is committed to expanding its energy efficiency and
conservation efforts both inside the organization and outside,"
Robertson said. "Through our energy efficiency business, Chevron
Energy Solutions, we're helping institutions and businesses become
more efficient."

   Since 2000, Chevron Energy Solutions (CES) has developed hundreds
of projects involving energy efficiency or renewable power for
education, government and business customers across the United States.
Recent projects range in size from $1 million to $100 million and
include:

   --  A solar power installation for the Contra Costa Community
        College District in California, the largest such installation
        at a college district in North America. This project, which
        includes energy efficiency improvements, is expected to save
        the district $70 million over the next 25 years.

   --  The United States Postal Services' largest solar power and
        efficiency project at the Oakland, Calif., Processing and
        Distribution Center. The project reduces the facility's power
        purchases by more than one-third, which translates to 7,400
        fewer tons of carbon dioxide emitted by the local electric
        utility annually.

   CES is helping to reduce the energy costs of its customers by over
$1 billion.

   Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated
energy companies with subsidiaries that conduct business across the

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Widevine Technologies, today announced they are
helping Skynet, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) arm of Penki
Kontinentai group, to provide premium TV content to all 25,000 Skynet
users in Lithuania.

    Skynet turned to IBM and content protection partner Widevine for the
technology needed to better secure content for television and Video on
Demand (VoD) distribution. To meet consumer demands, Skynet will launch a
new service later this year, with basic and premium television channels to
will compete with mainstream cable, satellite and other IPTV providers in
region. Skynet will deliver PayTV services to set top boxes at their
"PenkiTV" subscribers and are planning to expand service delivery to PCs
in the very near future.

    As the primary information technology (IT) vendor and technology
integrator for the deal, IBM manages design, delivery and maintenance for
the digital video headend from Cisco and content protection from
Widevine. Using Widevine, Skynet ensures content providers that content
is secured, offering them the critical access to premium content required
to make their service attractive, regardless of consumer device.

    "IBM and Widevine have delivered an excellent, turnkey video headend and
multiplatform content protection solution that offers us the flexibility
to deliver PayTV services to a wide range of consumer platforms," said
Idrakas Dadasovas, General Manager of Penki Kontinentai group. "Working
with IBM allowed us to speed up our time to market delivery of the
solution."

    IBM's ability to manage the transformation to IPTV is an essential
ingredient for those providers who don't have extensive technology and
business consulting expertise in-house. IBM worked with Skynet on
middleware and VoD pilots, consulted with Skynet on IPTV and delivered and
integrated Penki TV's digital video headend equipment. IBM is currently
providing consulting for Skynet regarding various IPTV areas.

    "IBM's IPTV services are designed to help service providers win market
share, reduce customer churn, and increase average revenue per user," said
Olavi Patja, Global Manager for IPTV and Triple Play infrastructure
services, IBM Global Technology Services. "IBM and Widevine are helping
Skynet build a reliable and secure IPTV infrastructure so it can offer the
most popular content and best choices in Lithuanian programming,
delivering an optimal experience to PenkiTV customers."

    IBM Converged Communications Services for IPTV and triple play
infrastructure delivers technical consulting, integration and
implementation services. The IPTV infrastructure solution incorporates
best-of-breed IBM hardware, software and services along with Cisco
products to provide a complete solution, standard components include: IBM
BladeCenter and xSeries Servers; software products from IBM WebSphere,
Tivoli and Lotus brands; and Cisco end-to-end IP Next-Generation Network
(IP NGN) solutions. The new solution also leverages open source
technology.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) today announced a
successfully collaborative effort to implement the IBM Scalable Modular
Data Center (SMDC) -- in order to meet the company's technology
requirements of its expanding business, while simultaneously saving cost
and energy by installing a "green data center."

    The SMDC solution integrates power, cooling, rack, management, services
and security, allowing for selection of standardized components to create
a solution through modular configurations. By using standardized
components, the architecture of SCB easily scales to meet the evolving
needs of the company. In addition to the data center installation, other
services include project management, recovery plan and network assessment.

    As one of the leading joint-stock commercial banks in Vietnam, SCB teamed
with IBM to deploy the data center consolidation with the explicit goals
of reducing energy consumption as well as reducing cost, space and IT
maintenance, while enhancing the efficiency and capacity of its data
center facilities.

    Through this agreement, IBM will partner with SCB to transform its current
existing data center to a Scalable Modular Data Center, creating a
cost-effective and high quality 50-100 square meters data center. The new
SMDC solution will enable SCB to lower their data center design costs by
approximately 15% compared to that of the old raised-floor data center
solution. Furthermore, adopting SMDC will allow SCB to bring down
implementation costs by 20% and operating costs as much as by 40%. As the
SMDC does not require a raised floor, SCB will reduce close to 40% of
space needed to be used. In short, the SMDC implemented by IBM will allow
SCB to save space, bring down energy costs as well as establish a
scalable data center that is designed to help them meet their present
computing needs, with the ability to scale to meet their future business
needs.

    IBM aims to implement the entire SMDC solution in a record time of eight
to twenty four weeks compared to the industry norm which is about 18-24
months. "IBM's long history and expertise with data center implementations
enabled us to create a solution to save energy and ensure efficient server
performance for SCB," said Vo Tan Long, Deputy General Manager, IBM
Vietnam. "Green data centers are all about efficiency -- equipment and
cooling efficiency, space utilization efficiency and manpower efficiency."

    He further added, "The modular data centers implemented by IBM based on an
'expand as you go' model which radically reduces upfront capital
expenditures. This means that the data center infrastructure will expand
and adapt to actual IT requirements, rather than projected requirements."

    "IBM has deep experience in designing and building more than 30 million
square feet of client data centers as well as running more than 400 IBM
data centers with eight million square feet globally," said Mr. Than Ngoc
Minh, Chief Accountant cum CIO of SCB. "IBM engaged with SCB from the very
beginning to understand our critical business needs and design appropriate
solutions. As one of the leading joint-stock commercial banks in Vietnam,
we are expanding our business impressively. We look forward to IBM's
expertise to design and build a globally benchmarked, standardized,
scalable and energy efficient facility that can support our dynamic growth
plans effectively."

    IBM is a long-standing leader in environmental protection, having taken
early action to establish its environmental affairs policy in 1971. For

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Student computer programmers from universities around the world once
again will merge left with right brain thinking as they begin the quest
to earn coveted spots among the information technology (IT) elite at the
33rd annual Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) International
Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), sponsored by IBM (NYSE: IBM).
Known as the "Battle of the Brains," the competition challenges students
to solve real-world problems using open technology and advanced computing
methods under a grueling, five-hour deadline.

Regional bouts kick off on
September 13 in the South Pacific region and run through January,
sweeping from continent to continent. Only 100 three-person teams will
advance to the World Finals on April 22, 2009 hosted by KTH - Royal
Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.

    The Battle of the Brains has grown to be the largest and most prestigious
computer competition of its kind. It is expected to include tens of
thousands of students from universities in 83 countries on six continents.
Since IBM began sponsoring the Contest in 1997, participation has grown
from 1,100 to 6,100 teams.

    "This contest is about fostering the next generation of industry leaders
in information technology and promoting strong foundations in both
technology and business," said Doug Heintzman, director of strategy, IBM
Software Group and sponsorship executive. "IBM understands the importance
of investing in the bright young minds for the future of our industry and
our world. In a global economy, talent needs to be able to respond to
complex business challenges."

    The contest exposes information technology students to open standard and
open source technologies being adopted by businesses and organizations
around the globe.

    IBM's sponsorship of the Battle of the Brains is one of a number of IBM
university programs focusing on skills in open technology. Through these
programs, IBM offers universities a wide range of technology benefits
including free access to IBM software, discounted hardware, course
materials, training and curriculum development.

    "The ACM-ICPC is the driving force in university life that develops the
zeal to solve problems and innovate on a global stage," said Dr. Bill
Poucher, ICPC Executive Director and Baylor University Professor. "With
the support of IBM, ACM, and the UPE Honor Society, we're challenging
students to deliver the transforming technologies of the future. I had
the pleasure of visiting a training camp at Petrozavodsk State University
where top teams were having a blast outperforming students in
conventional settings by a factor of seven."

    The 2008 ACM-ICPC World Finals took place in Banff Springs, Alberta,
Canada, where a team from St. Petersburg University of Information
Technology, Mechanics and Optics in Russia emerged as the world champion.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) on Monday rejected as "erroneous" an environmental damage report filed in Ecuadorean court just a month after Ecuador's government offered to broker a settlement to the decade-long legal battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peasants and Indians are suing the U.S. oil company for up to $16 billion over charges its Texaco unit polluted the jungle and damaged their health by dumping 18 billion gallons of oil-laden water from 1972 to 1992, before it turned over its operations to state oil company Petroecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report by court expert Richard Cabrera, an Ecuadorian geologist, found 42 sites operated by the company in the Amazon rainforest contained levels of toxins that violate norms in both Ecuador and the United States, according to the Amazon Defense Coalition, which represents plaintiffs in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it believed Cabrera was under a great deal of pressure from the public and government in the Andean country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is clear that the deck is stacked against us in Ecuador and we're not going to receive a fair trial down there," Charles James, Chevron's general counsel, told reporters on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Rafael Correa, a leftist who often scorns foreign oil companies and accuses them of cheating his nation out of billions of dollar in revenue, has said Chevron has done irreversible damage to the Amazon jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ecuador Inspector General Diego Garcia, the country's top attorney, said last month his government could help mediate an out-of-court settlement between the second-largest U.S. oil producer and 30,000 Amazon jungle dwellers suing the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before the recent developments in the case, experts felt a deal was unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs said they expect a ruling in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, denies its operations affected the health of Amazon communities.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced new services to migrate clients to its
System z mainframes to help them regain control of the mushrooming issues
associated with data center sprawl, including increasing energy, cooling,
people, and downtime costs. IBM is expanding its Migration Factory
program for IBM Power Systems to include System z mainframes. The
Migration Factory program includes competitive server assessments,
migration services, and other resources.

    Benefits to current and new customers moving to IBM System z10 mainframes
could include:


--  Energy and Space Savings: A System z10 EC is the equivalent of nearly
1500 x86 servers with an 85% smaller footprint with up to 85% less energy
costs; by comparison, in published benchmarks, a System z used
approximately 14% less energy for comparable workloads than an HP Superdome
system.[1] 
--  Reduced Total Cost of Ownership as the result of fewer software
licenses to purchase; reduced electricity and cooling costs; reduced
downtime costs. 
--  Built to Run a Range of Workloads:  From Linux to Java, and supporting
more than 4,000 unique applications. 
--  Scalability and Security: System z mainframes have unparalleled
scalability[1] based on published benchmarks while delivering the US
government's highest security rating. [2] 
--  The Growing Skills Boom: 400 universities around the globe are teaching
50,000 students about the mainframe. 

    
To help customers assess the full scope of technology options
currently available, the new System z Migration factory builds on IBM's
successful Migration Factory program for Power Systems, storage and
System x. For instance, IBM has helped nearly 1,200 customers migrate
from competitive Sun, HP and other UNIX platforms to IBM's AIX or Linux
on Power. The Power Systems migrations have resulted in more than $1
billion in revenues since the program began several years ago. [3]

    The System z Migration factory offers: no-charge server consolidation
assessment services; no-charge assessment support for SAP migrations;
migration services (porting, migrating software code, controlling risk
associated with application migration) and middleware integration; system
and application upgrades to newer platforms; technical assistance for
customers and Business Partners for successful migrations (e.g. access to
roadshows, educational seminars); and testing and validation of
migrations. [4]

    At its core, the IBM Migration Factory helps clients lower their cost of
ownership, reduce complexity in managing servers, rationalize IT assets,
and run greener IT for stronger social responsibility.

    The Migration Factory for System z is the latest addition to IBM's
company-wide resources to help clients migrate from servers such as those
from HP and other competitors. For 2008 alone, IBM will invest nearly $200
million for server migration programs and has dedicated 800 services
employees around the globe to this effort. This has fueled IBM's server
business as IBM's mainframe has more than doubled its revenue share this
decade*[5]. In Gartner's recently announced 2Q08 worldwide server revenue
share results, IBM broadened its revenue lead as the number one provider
of servers, with growth in System z mainframe and Power Systems. [6]

    "Several years ago, we created the IBM's Migration Factory for Power
Systems. In my opinion, Gartner's worldwide report validates that
customers are buying and responding well to this aggressive program
because of the business benefits afforded by IBM systems," said David
Gelardi, vice president of STG Worldwide Client Centers at IBM. "Tack on
the fact that IBM sold out of the System z10 in the second quarter and
you'll see that customers are ready for a strategic roadmap to consider
the mainframe for their server consolidation needs."

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Sep 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
VMworld - IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced two IBM System x servers
featuring new six-core processor technology from Intel. The new servers
offer exceptional power-efficiency, performance and virtualization
capabilities for today's most demanding datacenters.

    IBM's new servers running Intel's six-core processors recently topped four
benchmarks, including:

--  The first single x86 server to burst through the 1 million transactions
per minute barrier on a TPC-C benchmark. This was achieved with an 8-socket
System x server running 64-bit IBM DB2 9.5 on Red Hat Linux(R) 5.2.
--  The highest 4-socket x86 server TPC-C benchmark, delivering more
transactions per minute than any other 4-processor server. 
--  Highest 4-processor performance and overall best price/performance on
the TPC-E benchmark, outpacing the Dell 4-way server in both performance
and price/performance. 
--  The world record for 8-processor results on two-tier SAP SD Standard
Application Benchmark. 

    
Based on eX4, the fourth generation of IBM's chipset for Intel
processor-based servers, X-Architecture, the new systems include the
following advantages:

--  System x3950 M2: IBM has tuned the memory of the x3950 so clients can
take full advantage of virtualization on the system with mainframe-like
reliability and high efficiency power supplies and memory technology
capable of up to 37 percent lower overall power consumption. 



--  Systems x3850 M2: With special features for fast performance and
efficiency, clients can support a large number of demanding business
applications like those for ERP and database on a single server. The system
offers flexible scalability that allows clients to easily expand their
system from 4 sockets to 16, so clients can pay for more capacity only when
they need it -- not up front as with other vendors. 

    
IBM continues to dominate the high-end scalable x86 market, defined at
8-socket systems and above, with more than 60 percent share in 2007 --
three times more than its closest competitor, according to IDC. IBM has
lead the 8-way space for three years, turning in double digit market
growth in 2Q08, and is the market leader in the Intel 4-socket segment,
according to IDC. (1)

    "As the market leader in high-end x86 servers and the only vendor to
design its own chip set for Intel-based servers, IBM is addressing the
performance needs of our clients and the growing demand for scale up x86
servers," said James Northington, vice president of IBM System x. "The
new System x servers announced today provide the innovation our x86
clients have come to expect, with better performance and power usage than
our competitors' offerings."

    The new servers are an important element in helping clients develop a new
enterprise data center, which offers dramatic improvements in IT
efficiency and provides for rapid deployment of new IT services to
support future business growth. IBM is helping clients move to new
enterprise data centers by focusing on best practices around
virtualization, green IT, service management and cloud computing.

    "The latest world-record database and enterprise resource planning
benchmark results posted by IBM are testaments to the performance of the
Intel Xeon Processor 7400 series with IBM's eX4 chipset," said Kirk
Skaugen, vice president and general manager Intel's Server Platforms
Group. "These represent more compelling examples of how Intel technology
paired with the innovative fourth generation of IBM's X-Architecture is
providing IT managers' greater performance, scalability and investment
protection for their enterprises."

    Both the new System x 3950 M2 and x3850 M2 seamlessly support IBM's
portfolio of virtualization technologies including WebSphere Virtual
Enterprise. As part of a SmartSOA approach, WebSphere Virtual Enterprise
provides application infrastructure virtualization capabilities designed
to deliver greater flexibility, agility and efficiencies to clients. It
virtualizes application servers through policy-based workload, application
health and application edition management. IBM System x servers together
with VMware technology and WebSphere Virtual Enterprise provides a
powerful combination that can enable clients to reap the full benefits of
virtualizing their data center.

    "IBM continues to deliver innovative technology on high-capacity platforms
that are optimized for VMware virtualization," said Brian Byun, vice
president of global partners and solutions at VMware. "IBM and VMware's
joint work and optimization on 'scale-up' virtual server platforms are
targeted at our joint customers looking to implement a virtual datacenter
with a minimum number of server images and an efficient physical
datacenter footprint."

    Pricing and Availability

    The IBM System x3850 M2 and x3950 will be available with Intel Xeon 7400
processors in September, starting at $10,389 and $13,389 respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Launches New Medicine Safety Website to Help Healthcare Professionals and Patients Make Better Informed Decisions about Treatment Options

   Interactive Resource Increases Understanding of Medicine Safety;

         Prominently Features Link for Reporting Side Effects
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc announced today the launch of a new interactive online
educational resource designed to give healthcare professionals,
medical students, patients, patient advocates and the general public
more information about medicine safety, and, in turn, more confidence
when making decisions about appropriate treatment options.

   "We want to increase understanding of the industry's system for
ensuring medicine safety," said Dr. Joseph M. Feczko, chief medical
officer for Pfizer. "Currently, information about drug safety is
available through numerous, but fragmented channels, which can be
challenging for healthcare professionals and patients as they discuss
the risks and benefits of various treatments. Patient safety is the
top priority for Pfizer, and as an industry leader, we are using our
collective experience and knowledge to address this critical public
health need."

   The educational website will be available for widespread use by
everyone engaged in medicine safety communications and decision making
in a unique, user-friendly way. Located at
www.Pfizer.com/medicinesafety, the website uses cutting edge
illustrations and interactive tools to educate about medicine safety.
For example, patients will find information and questions to consider
that will better prepare them for a doctor's visit, as well as
interactive tools on topics like how to read a medicine label. This is
the first pharmaceutical industry website to prominently feature a
link for reporting side effects from all medical products regulated by
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

   More than one-third of Americans surveyed in an April 2007 Harris
Poll decided not to take a prescribed medicine because of safety
concerns about risks and more than a quarter chose not to fill a
prescription at all over safety concerns.

   "With the population aging and medicine use increasing,
information about medicine safety is more important than ever before,"
added Gretchen S. Dieck, Ph.D., senior vice president, Safety and Risk
Management for Pfizer. "Yet surveys of practicing physicians, health
policy experts and the general public have revealed a lack of
understanding of the fundamental safety science, processes and
terminology. This can contribute to misinformed decisions by patients
about treatment options, which can lead to sub-optimal health
outcomes."

   The medicine safety education initiative is the latest in a series
of activities demonstrating Pfizer's continuing commitment to become
more open and accountable with stakeholders.

   --  In 2002, Pfizer began to register its clinical trials on the
        public database www.clinicaltrials.gov. The company now
        registers all trials in patients and has more than 800 trials
        registered.

   --  Also in 2002, Pfizer began publicly reporting U.S. political
        contributions.

   --  In 2004, Pfizer began publicly posting the results of its
        clinical trials at www.clinicalstudyresults.org.

   --  Starting in December 2006, the company launched a regularly
        updated publicly-available website, describing compounds in
        its drug development pipeline and detailing their progress.

   --  In April 2007, Pfizer began reporting on FDA post-marketing
        commitments relating to safety, efficacy or the use of Pfizer
        medicines.

   --  Last May, Pfizer began publicly posting a list of U.S.
        medical, scientific and patient organization grants and
        charitable contributions made in the first quarter of 2008.

   "An important reason for communicating more openly with
stakeholders is to make sure that not just more, but better
information is available to address important public health needs such
as medicine safety," Dr. Feczko said. "We continually look for
innovative ways to improve the medicine safety process and know more
now than ever before about the safety profiles of our medicines. This
is a result of enhanced safety studies, improved technology and
methods of gathering information about patient experiences, and
strengthened regulatory requirements."

   Pfizer: Working Together for a Healthier World Founded in 1849,
Pfizer is the world's largest research-based pharmaceutical company
taking new approaches to better health. We discover, develop,
manufacture and deliver quality, safe and effective prescription
medicines to treat and help prevent disease for both people and
animals. We also partner with healthcare providers, governments and
local communities around the world to expand access to our medicines
and provide better quality health care and health system support. At
Pfizer, 85,000 colleagues work every day to help people stay happier
and healthier longer and to reduce the human and economic burden of
disease worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a blended human capital management
services and software package that helps clients more effectively analyze
key trends and metrics in their workforce to get the most from their
talent investment. It's a way to provide chief human resource officers
with easy access to information with the same rigor as the financial or
operational data available to the CEO, CFO or CIO.

    IBM's Workforce Analytics service package provides reliable, consistent
information regarding key workforce measures such as demographics,
compensation, attrition, and costs in the context of business strategies
and goals. WFA consists of a set of modular, "packaged" components and
services, including IBM Cognos 8 Workforce Performance software pre-mapped
to the major enterprise human resources information systems (Oracle,
PeopleSoft, SAP), rapid implementation services and knowledge transfer and
training focused on how to successfully employ workforce analytics.

    "Today's economic and global marketplace pressures mean organizations have
to find new ways to compete and thrive," said Tim Ringo, vice president
and global leader, Human Capital Management, IBM. "The fact is, what is
not measured is not managed, and that's a terrible waste of such a
significant investment as a company's talent. But while employers do
recognize the importance of analytics, many have limited experience, and
for many employers, workforce analytics is an occasional snapshot rather
than an ongoing process. IBM's Workforce Analytics services package
answers that need."

    According to IBM's Global Human Capital Study 2008, Unlocking the DNA of
the Adaptable Workforce, 48 percent of respondents are already planning to
deploy tools that simplify human capital data and information analysis.
And between now and 2011, 84 percent of executives expect to increase
their use of workforce measures. However, today only 6 percent think they
are effective at using human capital data to make workforce decisions and
only 30 percent use human capital metrics to evaluate their business
needs.

    "Cognos helps companies optimize their business by quickly and
consistently delivering critical insights into how their workforce is
performing. Cognos can drive analytics on the most valuable resource
companies have -- their people," said Steve Lukens, global Cognos
executive, IBM. "Organizations can answer questions like 'How are we
utilizing our people?' 'How are our people and our people programs
performing?' 'What actions can we take to improve performance?' With IBM
Cognos 8 Workforce Performance, blending software with leading-edge
services, IBM has the most powerful tool in the business to help clients
understand and monitor current performance while planning future business
strategies."

    IBM Cognos 8 Workforce Performance is a packaged analytic application that
provides interactive insight into workforce issues such as capacity,
acquisition, development, retention, performance, and compensation with
consolidated analytic reporting from multiple systems. As the industry's
most adaptable solution, IBM Cognos Workforce Performance enables
organizations to modify and change reports as their business changes,
providing organizations with the benefit of industry-leading BI and
leading-edge services.

    The WFA "prepackaged" services are a distinct departure from the
traditional costly and time consuming approach of using tools to build
custom analytic applications. The prepackaging and rapid deployment
approach shortens employer "time to value," while reducing risk associated
with acquiring analytic capabilities. "This announcement underscores IBM's
unique capabilities in delivering services and software," said Ringo. "The
blending of software assets into services will create an entirely new
class of offerings -- offerings that can't be created on labor alone."

&lt;p&gt;Airlines Can Now Choose Type V Phosphate Ester Aviation Hydraulic
       Fluid with Highest-Grade Approvals from Airbus and Boeing
FAIRFAX, Va.--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Aviation Lubricants today introduced HyJet V, a
fire-resistant aviation hydraulic fluid with higher stability and
longer service life than Type IV fluids. HyJet V is the only Type V
phosphate ester aviation hydraulic fluid with highest-grade approvals
from Airbus and Boeing.

   "HyJet V is our response to those in the airline industry
requiring an aviation hydraulic fluid that offers mixed fleets the
highest level of performance," says Mike Hawkins, global marketing
manager, ExxonMobil Aviation Lubricants. "It provides the advantages
you would expect from a global supplier with a long-standing
reputation for leadership in aviation lubricant technology."

   HyJet V is approved against Airbus NSA 307110M, Type V, and is the
first Type V fluid authorized for use in the Airbus A380's 5000-psi
hydraulic system. It is approved against Boeing BMS 3-11N Type V,
Grade A, Boeing-Long Beach DMS 2014H, Type 5, and Bombardier Canadair
BAMS 654-003NC, Type V. HyJet V meets SAE AS1241 Type IV and Type V
requirements. It is qualified for use in ATR turboprop aircraft and
compatible in any ratio with all commercial Type IV and Type V fluids.

   In laboratory testing conducted by ExxonMobil and others, results
confirm that HyJet V offers:

   --  better stability and longer service life than Type IV
        hydraulic fluids,

   --  stronger corrosion control than competitive Type IV and Type V
        hydraulic fluids, and

   --  better wear protection than competitive Type IV and Type V
        hydraulic fluids.

   Flash Point: With a flash point of 345 degrees F, HyJet V is the
first commercial Type V hydraulic fluid to meet and exceed the Airbus
and Boeing Type V, Grade A flash point specification of 320 degrees F.

   Fluid Life: Phosphate ester hydraulic fluids can degrade rapidly
when contaminated with water, especially at high temperatures. The
Airbus NSA 307110 Ampoule Test measures a fluid's resistance to
reaction with water (hydrolytic stability) and molecular breakdown at
high temperatures (thermal stability). Fluid is tested at regular
intervals to determine when it exceeds a 1.5 acid number, signifying
the end of fluid life. Side-by-side testing confirmed that HyJet V
offers better stability and longer service life than Type IV fluids.

   Corrosion Control: Superior rust protection provides a measure of
security against potentially damaging high-level water contamination.
The ASTM D 665A test identifies rust on polished steel rods exposed to
10 percent water in fluid for 24 hours at 60 degrees C. Test results
show that HyJet V combats corrosion better than competitive Type IV
and Type V hydraulic fluids.

   Wear Protection: The Four Ball Wear Test (ASTM D 4172) determines
the lubricity and wear protection properties of a lubricant. The test
is used in Airbus and Boeing Phosphate Ester Aircraft Hydraulic Fluid
Specifications. Three steel bearing balls are clamped together and
covered with the test fluid, while a rotating fourth ball is pressed
against them in sliding contact at various force levels. This contact
produces a wear scar, which is measured and recorded. The test
produced generally smaller scars for HyJet V than for samples of other
Type IV and Type V commercial products.*

   *Results are averages from testing samples from multiple batches
of HyJet V and other commercial products.

   The difference in wear protection performance between HyJet V and
the competitive Type V product was especially pronounced. Better
performance in this test can mean better wear protection for a fleet's
hydraulic system components.

   To learn more about HyJet V, customers can contact their local
ExxonMobil Aviation Lubricants representative or visit

   Ampoule Test @ 0.5% Water, 125 degrees C

   The Airbus NSA 307110 Ampoule Test measures a fluid's resistance
to reaction with water (hydrolytic stability) and molecular breakdown
at high temperatures (thermal stability). Fluid is tested at regular
intervals to determine when it exceeds a 1.5 acid number, signifying
the end of fluid life. Side-by-side testing confirmed that HyJet V
offers better stability and longer service life than Type IV fluids.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 15 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) could incur
increased markdowns from likely disruption in the financial
markets due to Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy filing and rival
Merrill Lynch agreeing to be taken over, said veteran bank
analyst Richard Bove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though JPMorgan says it is not a major lender to Lehman
Brothers Holdings LEH.N, the company is a major counter-party
to a number of Lehman transactions, Ladenburg Thalmann's Bove
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bove also expects a high level of losses for JPMorgan from
its sizable position in credit card loans, home equity loans,
automobile loans and loans to retail establishments that
service the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bove cut his earnings-per-share view for 2008 on the
company by 4 percent to $2.14 and for 2009 by nearly 3 percent
to $2.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, he maintained his "neutral" rating on the stock,
saying the bank has very little exposure to a number of the
more exotic securities that have been created in recent years
and is relatively well protected.

&lt;p&gt;  PETALING JAYA, MALAYSIA, Sep 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and eleven higher education institutions in Malaysia
today announced their collaboration to establish and develop a
multidisciplinary curriculum -- Service Science, Management and
Engineering (SSME) -- in joint efforts to nurture experts and specialized
human resources as the country moves towards an innovation-led economy.

    The participating institutions are Universiti Sains Malaysia, Universiti
Malaya, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Universiti Putra Malaysia,
Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Universiti
Malaysia Sabah, Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Multimedia University, Asia
Pacific University College of Technology and Innovation (UCTI) and INTI
College.

    At the inaugural MOSTI-IBM Innovation Forum where the collaboration was
announced, Datuk Dr. Maximus Johnity Ongkili, Minister of Science,
Technology &amp; Innovation, Malaysia, said, "Innovation is the only way to
create sustainable competitive advantage in a world of relentless change
and increasing global competition. We recognize that human capital is the
driving force of the innovation-led economy, therefore we will continue to
invest in human capital development as it is critical for improving
innovation and ensuring the emergence of a more creative and skilled
workforce."

    The services sector in Malaysia is expected to register an annual growth
rate of 7.5 per cent from 2006 to 2020. The contribution of the services
sector to our GDP by 2020 is expected to be around 59.7 per cent.(1)

    "The launch of Service Science, Management and Engineering in Malaysia
speaks of a shared vision and a sense of urgency that new approaches and
collaborative innovation are needed to propel Malaysia's knowledge economy
to the next frontier," said Dato Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin, Minister of
Higher Education Malaysia.

    Service Science, Management and Engineering is the application of science,
management, and engineering disciplines to tasks that one organization
beneficially performs for and with another "service." It is a proposed
academic discipline and research area that would complement -- rather than
replace -- the many disciplines that contribute to knowledge about Service
Science. The curricula was developed and introduced in 2004 by IBM after
having worked with numerous companies and universities worldwide.

    "IBM's collaboration with the academia and government reflects our
commitment to providing a critical foundation to sustain growth and
success in Malaysia's services sector. It will help differentiate
Malaysia's competitive position globally as we are gearing up to
transcend the level of the nation's service skills and capabilities to
improve service excellence globally," said Ou Shian Waei, Managing
Director, IBM Malaysia.

    Last week, Universiti Sains Malaysia and IBM officially announced the
first of such collaboration in Malaysia and the availability of a Service
Science, Management and Engineering program to be offered as Executive
Masters in Business Administration Program starting in 2009.

    About Service Science, Management and Engineering (SSME)

    SSME is an emerging academic discipline designed to develop the skills
required in the world's increasingly services-based economies.

    This new field will bring together ongoing work in computer science,
operations research, industrial engineering, business strategy, management
sciences, social and cognitive sciences, and legal sciences.

    SSME aims to provide a foundation for the services sector to study and
understand how to create and deliver reusable assets so that services
engagements can be more easily replicated and more effectively delivered.

    Through case studies of real businesses and scientific programs,
particularly in information technology and business services, the SSME
course will focus on the issues involved in aligning people and technology
effectively to generate value for both services providers and services
clients.

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Oncology Presents Safety and Efficacy Results Of CP-751,871 Study At ESMO 2008

  ADVIGO CP-751,871 Global Phase III Clinical Trial Program Underway (ADVancing
                               IGF-1R in Oncology)
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer announced today updated safety and efficacy results surrounding its
investigational compound, CP-751,871, in patients with non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). These results, along with supporting correlative science data,
were presented at the 33rd European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress
in Stockholm, Sweden.

Results from a Phase II, randomized, non-comparative study, "Addition of
CP-751,871, an anti-IGF-1R antibody, to paclitaxel and carboplatin results in
high activity in NSCLC, particularly in squamous subtype," (abstract 229PD)
showed 54 percent of patients with Stage III/IV treatment-naive NSCLC receiving
the combination CP-751,871 plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (n=97) experienced
objective responses. The response rate was 41 percent in patients treated with
carboplatin and paclitaxel alone (n=53).

In addition, 78 percent of a subset of patients with squamous cell carcinoma
(n=9) and 57 percent of a subset of patients with adenocarcinoma (n=28)
receiving 20 mg/kg of CP-751,871 plus carboplatin and paclitaxel experienced
objective responses. Response rates were 46 percent and 25 percent,
respectively, for squamous cell (n=12) and adenocarcinoma patients (n=20)
receiving carboplatin and paclitaxel alone. No response advantage with
CP-751,871 was seen in a subset of patients with undifferentiated tumors (Not
Otherwise Specified, NOS).

"These data contribute to our evolving understanding of the potential safety and
efficacy of CP-751,871 in patients with NSCLC, a devastating disease -- an
estimated 1.5 million new cases are expected worldwide this year - with limited
treatment options," said study presenter Luis Paz-Ares, M.D., Chief, Division of
Medical Oncology, Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, Seville, Spain.

Patients who received CP-751,871 20 mg/kg showed the greatest improvement in
progression-free survival (PFS). PFS was defined as either the length of time
before the cancer progressed or death.

Twenty of the 53 patients in the carboplatin and paclitaxel arm crossed over to
receive CP-751,871. Without censoring for crossover, the median PFS in patients
receiving no CP-751,871, 10 and 20 mg/kg of CP-751,871 plus carboplatin and
paclitaxel was, respectively, 4.3, 3.6 and 5 months. The median PFS in squamous
cell patients receiving 20 mg/kg of CP-751,871 plus carboplatin and paclitaxel
was 5.6 months (4.3 months for patients with squamous cell cancer treated with
carboplatin and paclitaxel alone).

After censoring for crossover, median PFS in patients receiving no CP-751,871,
10 and 20 mg/kg of CP-751,871 plus carboplatin and paclitaxel was, respectively,
3.5, 3.6 and 5 months.

The side effects of CP-751,871 were generally manageable. The most common Grade
3 or 4 side effects reported in this study were fatigue (10 percent),
hyperglycemia (increased blood sugar) (20 percent) and neutropenia (30 percent).

Additional study results presented by Antonio Gualberto, M.D., Ph.D., Director
and Global Clinical Leader (Oncology), Pfizer Global Research and Development,
New London, CT, at the meeting expand the understanding of the relationship
between IGF-1R inhibition and the activity in different populations of NSCLC
patients. Results of the correlative science study, "IGF-1R markers in NSCLC
patients on anti-IGF-1R therapy," (abstract 1320) conducted to investigate the
molecular composition of lung tumours and its relevance to anti-IGF-1R therapy
showed that members of the IGF-1R pathway appear to be expressed differentially
across lung tumor histologies, which may explain the differential activity of
CP-751,871 across these histologies.

"These data provide greater insight into the potential relationship between
tumor histology and response to CP-751,871 observed in the clinical studies,"
said Dr. Gualberto. "Furthermore, the results support the global Phase III
clinical trial program for CP-751,871 in NSCLC."

About CP-751,871

CP-751,871, a fully human monoclonal antibody, is a highly specific inhibitor of
the IGF-1R pathway. The IGF-1R pathway is one of the key signaling pathways in
cancer cells that lead to uncontrolled growth and survival of tumour cells.

Pfizer has a global Phase III clinical trial registration program for CP-751,871
in NSCLC underway. The program initially includes two studies in patients with
non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC: ADVIGO 1016 in first-line patients and ADVIGO 1018 in
refractory patients. In addition, Pfizer is studying CP-751,871 in clinical
trials for the potential treatment of many other cancers, including prostate,
breast and colon cancers and Ewing's sarcoma. To date, more than 700 patients
have participated in CP-751,871 clinical trials in multiple tumor types.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Houlihan Lokey today announced that it has recruited a team of
senior investment banking officers formerly with JP Morgan's Real

  ADVIGO CP-751,871 Global Phase III Clinical Trial Program Underway
                    (ADVancing IGF-1R in Oncology)
STOCKHOLM, Sweden--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer announced today updated safety and efficacy results
surrounding its investigational compound, CP-751,871, in patients with
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These results, along with
supporting correlative science data, were presented at the 33rd
European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress in Stockholm,
Sweden.

   Results from a Phase II, randomized, non-comparative study,
"Addition of CP-751,871, an anti-IGF-1R antibody, to paclitaxel and
carboplatin results in high activity in NSCLC, particularly in
squamous subtype," (abstract 229PD) showed 54 percent of patients with

CP-751,871 plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (n=97) experienced
objective responses. The response rate was 41 percent in patients
treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel alone (n=53).

   In addition, 78 percent of a subset of patients with squamous cell
carcinoma (n=9) and 57 percent of a subset of patients with
adenocarcinoma (n=28) receiving 20 mg/kg of CP-751,871 plus
carboplatin and paclitaxel experienced objective responses. Response
rates were 46 percent and 25 percent, respectively, for squamous cell
(n=12) and adenocarcinoma patients (n=20) receiving carboplatin and
paclitaxel alone. No response advantage with CP-751,871 was seen in a
subset of patients with undifferentiated tumors (Not Otherwise
Specified, NOS).

   "These data contribute to our evolving understanding of the
potential safety and efficacy of CP-751,871 in patients with NSCLC, a
devastating disease -- an estimated 1.5 million new cases are expected
worldwide this year - with limited treatment options," said study
presenter Luis Paz-Ares, M.D., Chief, Division of Medical Oncology,
Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, Seville, Spain.

   Patients who received CP-751,871 20 mg/kg showed the greatest
improvement in progression-free survival (PFS). PFS was defined as
either the length of time before the cancer progressed or death.

   Twenty of the 53 patients in the carboplatin and paclitaxel arm
crossed over to receive CP-751,871. Without censoring for crossover,
the median PFS in patients receiving no CP-751,871, 10 and 20 mg/kg of
CP-751,871 plus carboplatin and paclitaxel was, respectively, 4.3, 3.6
and 5 months. The median PFS in squamous cell patients receiving 20
mg/kg of CP-751,871 plus carboplatin and paclitaxel was 5.6 months
(4.3 months for patients with squamous cell cancer treated with
carboplatin and paclitaxel alone).

   After censoring for crossover, median PFS in patients receiving no
CP-751,871, 10 and 20 mg/kg of CP-751,871 plus carboplatin and
paclitaxel was, respectively, 3.5, 3.6 and 5 months.

   The side effects of CP-751,871 were generally manageable. The most
common Grade 3 or 4 side effects reported in this study were fatigue
(10 percent), hyperglycemia (increased blood sugar) (20 percent) and
neutropenia (30 percent).

   Additional study results presented by Antonio Gualberto, M.D.,
Ph.D., Director and Global Clinical Leader (Oncology), Pfizer Global
Research and Development, New London, CT, at the meeting expand the
understanding of the relationship between IGF-1R inhibition and the
activity in different populations of NSCLC patients. Results of the
correlative science study, "IGF-1R markers in NSCLC patients on
anti-IGF-1R therapy," (abstract 1320) conducted to investigate the
molecular composition of lung tumours and its relevance to anti-IGF-1R
therapy showed that members of the IGF-1R pathway appear to be
expressed differentially across lung tumor histologies, which may
explain the differential activity of CP-751,871 across these
histologies.

   "These data provide greater insight into the potential
relationship between tumor histology and response to CP-751,871
observed in the clinical studies," said Dr. Gualberto. "Furthermore,
the results support the global Phase III clinical trial program for
CP-751,871 in NSCLC."

   About CP-751,871

   CP-751,871, a fully human monoclonal antibody, is a highly
specific inhibitor of the IGF-1R pathway. The IGF-1R pathway is one of
the key signaling pathways in cancer cells that lead to uncontrolled
growth and survival of tumour cells.

   Pfizer has a global Phase III clinical trial registration program
for CP-751,871 in NSCLC underway. The program initially includes two
studies in patients with non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC: ADVIGO 1016 in
first-line patients and ADVIGO 1018 in refractory patients. In
addition, Pfizer is studying CP-751,871 in clinical trials for the
potential treatment of many other cancers, including prostate, breast
and colon cancers and Ewing's sarcoma. To date, more than 700 patients
have participated in CP-751,871 clinical trials in multiple tumor
types.

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Defense Coalition: Criminal Indictment of Chevron Lawyers in Ecuador Based on Wide Body of Scientific Evidence

  Seven Ecuadorian Government Officials Also Charged with Conspiring
              with Chevron to Falsify Remediation Results

         Company Hit with Multiple Scandals in Matter of Days
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
A criminal indictment in Ecuador against two Chevron lawyers, one
an executive vice-president, is based on scientific evidence that the
oil giant conspired with Ecuadorian government officials to falsify
the results of an environmental clean-up to escape a potential
multi-billion dollar civil liability pending in U.S. federal court.

   Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the ongoing civil trial, which
alleges Texaco (now Chevron) dumped billions of gallons of toxic waste
into Amazon waterways, say Chevron is misrepresenting the indictment
as "politically motivated" when it is actually based on a large body
of soil samples generated by an independent investigative agency and
corroborated by three other sources, including Chevron itself.

   "Chevron has a serious problem because there is extensive evidence
that a fraud was committed and much of that evidence comes from
Chevron," said Pablo Fajardo, the Ecuadorian lawyer for the plaintiffs
and a recent winner of the prestigious Goldman Environmental Award.

   "Chevron always cries 'political interference' when it lacks a
defense," he added.

   Chevron's potential liability in the civil trial, which is being
heard in Ecuador at Chevron's request, was assessed at between $7.2
billion and $16.3 billion, according to a report by a court-appointed
expert released in March. A final decision in the civil trial, which
began in 2003, is expected in the coming months.

   Those indicted include Ricardo Reis Veiga, a Chevron vice
president based in Miami who oversees legal affairs for the company in
Latin America, and Rodrigo Perez Pallares, Chevron's legal
representative in Ecuador for more than three decades. Reis Veiga and
Perez Pallares supervised the purported clean-up for Texaco in the
mid-1990s that is the focus of the indictment, and both continue to
play active roles in supervising Chevron's defense in the civil trial.

   The indictment also targeted seven former Ecuadorian government
officials who signed documents certifying the remediation. Among them
is Patricio Rivadeneira, Garcia, a former Minister of Energy and
Mines.

   Residents of the Amazon region, including the leaders of five
indigenous groups, have alleged for years that the Chevron remediation
was a fraud and was orchestrated to secure a release that could be
used to dismiss the class action civil case then pending in U.S.
federal court in New York. Texaco's lawyers at the time tried
repeatedly to use the release - provided before any clean-up work was
actually done - to persuade the U.S. court to dismiss the case.

   The U.S. judge at the time refused to accept Texaco's contention
that the release applied to private claims being pressed by the
rainforest residents, and the lawsuit continued. However, Texaco did
win a hotly contested motion to transfer the case to Ecuador by
claiming its courts were fair and a more appropriate forum for the
trial. An Atlanta-based firm, King &amp; Spalding, represented Texaco at
the time.

   The indictment, released by Chevron on Friday, is based largely on
soil sampling of remediated pits and was performed in 2001 by an
independent Ecuadorian government agency, called the Controlaria. The
sampling by the agency, which is similar to the General Accounting
Office in the U.S., is part of the civil trial's official record.

   The indictment alleges that Reis Veiga and Perez Pallares signed
documents certifying the remediation had been carried out when in fact
it had not. Signing the documents violates various anti-fraud
provisions in Ecuador's penal code, according to the indictment. The
fraud charges carry maximum prison sentences of ten years under
Ecuador's penal code.

   To defend against the charges, Reis Veiga and Perez Pallares also
will have to deal with scientific evidence from the civil trial
provided by three separate sources - Chevron, the plaintiffs, and the
independent court expert, Professor Richard Cabrera. When Cabrera
reviewed roughly 64,000 analytic results produced by these parties, he
found that more than 80% of the supposedly "remediated" pits have
levels of toxins that violate the law.

   Evidence in the civil trial shows "remediated" waste pits with
Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) of up to 206,512 parts per million
(ppm), or 206 times higher than the Ecuadorian norm of 1,000 ppm,
according to Douglas Beltman, a scientist at Stratus Consulting in
Boulder who works with the plaintiffs. TPH are a body of toxic
chemicals that include benzene, a known human carcinogen.

   A complete list of the so-called remediated pits that violate
Ecuadorian norms - taken from the Cabrera report -- can be found at
www.chevrontoxico.com.

   Fajardo indicated that there is additional evidence available in
the public record that could be used to broaden the prosecutor's case.
This includes proof that the two Chevron officials utilized a secret
laboratory test that made it technically impossible to detect amounts
of toxins in violation of norms.

   "Texaco gamed the laboratory test to guarantee acceptable
results," said Fajardo.

   The timing of the indictment appears to result from the fact the
statute of limitations would have expired on Sept. 28, ten years to
the day after the final documents were signed indicating the end of
the clean-up.

   News of the indictment came just one day after Chevron was
implicated in a drugs and sex scandal related to the payment of oil
royalties to the Department of Interior, and just weeks before Chevron
will stand trial in U.S. federal court in San Francisco on charges it
violated the human rights of local villagers in Nigeria. The
plaintiffs in Ecuador have alleged they have been subjected to death
threats and a series of robberies.

   The civil lawsuit alleges Chevron dumped 18.5 billion gallons of
toxic waste water into Amazon waterways and abandoned hundreds of
unlined waste pits gouged out of the jungle floor, causing a spike in
cancer rates and forcing five indigenous groups to abandon most of
their ancestral land. As the exclusive operator of a large oil
concession, Texaco extracted 1.3 billion barrels of oil from the
country between 1964 and 1990.

service. Metito employees can now access and share information anywhere
inside the headquarters complex whether they are using PDAs, smartphones,
or laptop PCs. The move to the new corporate headquarters at TechnoPark

processes", said Zaki. "We found that the seamless integration of Nortel
and Microsoft solutions to provide a unified communications solution is
just not available from any other technology provider."

    "Metito's global success depends on having great products and services,
maximizing operational efficiency and driving employee productivity,"
said Hassan Hamadani, marketing manager, Nortel Middle East. "Recent
studies show that unified communications can boost corporate productivity
by up to 18 percent(1) and lead to a return on investment of up to 250
percent(2). These are the kinds of business benefits that ensure a
customer like Metito can maximize return on investment through technology
that also ensures the longest possible solution lifecycle."

    Tareq Mandou, product marketing manager, Microsoft Gulf, said, "Metito's
Unified Communications platform consists of an integrated, modular set of
solutions that brings together voice, audio and video conferencing , data
and mobile applications to optimize operational efficiencies,
significantly reduce operating costs and streamline business processes.
Unified Communications solutions harness the power of software to deliver

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve intervened aggressively to shore up the U.S. financial system this week, providing at least $87 billion to help underpin trades with units of bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, court documents show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed's action is the latest sign of how U.S. authorities have been seeking to prop up financial markets following the failure of Lehman LEH.P and as big insurer American International Group (AIG.N) fights for survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the government had pledged not to fund a rescue of Lehman, the disclosure on Tuesday showed that authorities were taking other financial steps to prevent markets from descending into chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) advanced $87 billion to the units on Monday to help clear and facilitate securities transactions with customers and clients of Lehman "to avoid disruption of financial markets," according to documents filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman and the New York Fed had requested the advance, known as a "commencement date advance" and the New York Fed repaid it, according to filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In effect, the New York Fed lent the funds to the units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for the New York Fed declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This expansion of the Fed's credit program is unprecedented," said David Pauker, a managing director with restructuring adviser Goldin Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It should provide the liquidity necessary to facilitate the sale of Lehman's core brokerage and banking business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court on Tuesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck said he would provide a "comfort order" for JPMorgan, allowing it to continue providing the advances to Lehman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harold Novikoff, a lawyer for JPMorgan, told the court that the firm has regularly provided these advances for Lehman to facilitate its trading, but was typically paid back by other parties who would step in overnight to repay JPMorgan. However, some of those third parties have disappeared since Lehman's bankruptcy, filing necessitating the intervention from the Fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in court that services provided by JPMorgan were "integral" to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we stop, the broker dealer stops. It's that simple," Novikoff told reporters after the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman had provided JPMorgan with $17 billion in collateral for the advancing services prior to the bankruptcy filing, Lehman's lawyer Shai Weisman told the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of Lehman's broker-dealer business appeared closer on Tuesday, as a source said Britain's Barclays (BARC.L) had agreed to buy Lehman's core broker-dealer business for about $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman's holding company filed for bankruptcy in the early hours of Monday, in the largest U.S. bankruptcy ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Lehman's broker-dealer units are not covered under the filing, customers typically unwind trades with a dealer whose holding company is bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, at the request of Lehman and the New York Fed, JPMorgan advanced $51 billion to Lehman as part of a so-called second-day advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court documents did not specify whether the New York Fed would repay the second amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan may elect to advance additional money to Lehman units as part of a "post-petition advance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All post-petition advances are guaranteed by Lehman and collateralized, according to the documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy is taking the restructuring industry into uncharted waters," Pauker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Chelsea Emery, Dan Wilchins, and Emily Chasan in New York; Additional reporting by Glenn Somerville in Washington; Editing by Ted Kerr, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Analysts may be tweaking Chevron Corp (CVX.N) profit forecasts in response to oil prices falling and damage from Hurricane Ike, but increased refining margins after the storm could even help its earnings a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several Chevron platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were toppled by the latest storm, the second-largest U.S. oil company said on Tuesday. Its new Blind Faith and Tahiti platforms suffered no significant damage, but a spokesman said details on other platforms were not yet available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet with most U.S. Gulf Coast refining capacity still out of action, the fact that Chevron's Mississippi refinery made a relatively quick recovery means the company can sell products into a market with margins fattened by overall lack of supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil Weiss, energy analyst at Argus Research Co, said he trimmed his Chevron estimates last week in response to the lower price of U.S. crude oil CLc1, which is down 20 percent in September and 10 percent in the last week alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil prices are looking to be a little lower on average for Q3 than when I did my report," Weiss said, although he added that increased refining margins because of Ike could potentially partly offset that downward pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 15 Wall Street analyst estimates for Chevron's 2008 earnings compiled by Reuters Estimates, 10 have most recently been trimmed. The average earnings per share estimate is now $12.06.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's 330,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi, the eighth-largest in the United States, was back to normal after operating with reduced runs, the Energy Department said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But 13 refineries representing just under one-fifth of total U.S. refining capacity remain shut after the storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any widening of margins will come on top of that driven by improved demand as oil prices fall, said Michael Cuggino, chief executive of Pacific Heights Asset Management, which manages about $3.8 billion and holds Chevron shares as a long-term bet on global demand growth for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't expect Ike to have a significant impact on output long term," Cuggino said. "Chevron got back up pretty quickly and the others are going to follow soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares were 2 percent higher at $81.72 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with a 1.6 percent rise in oil stocks .OIX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quarter of San Ramon, California-based Chevron's 2 million bpd of company-owned refining capacity is at its two big home-state refineries at El Segundo and Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Richard Valdmanis in New York and Tom Doggett in Washington; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Tuesday third-quarter earnings plunged 70 percent as one of the worst market slumps ever weighed on banking and trading results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. investment bank reported net income of $845 million, or $1.81 a share, for the quarter ended August 29, down from $2.85 billion, or $6.13 a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking revenue dropped 40 percent as deal activity dried up. Fixed-income trading revenue plummeted by two thirds from last year, reflecting weak credit and mortgage trading results, while equities trading revenue fell by half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net revenue fell by half to $6.04 billion from $12.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares fell about 4 percent before the bell Tuesday following the earnings report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from industry analysts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN  CO., GREENWICH,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONNECTICUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Revenues were weaker than expected, and the stock is trading down. All eyes are really on the eye of the storm, which is AIG and the systematic risk it poses to the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it's a tough environment and there are mumblings going on. People wondering whether (the remaining investment banks) should find some partners who can stem their liquidity concerns. They haven't been affected so much today, but they may be tomorrow. It may seem far-fetched, but a lot of things that seemed far-fetched have come to fruition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MIKE HOLLAND, CHAIRMAN OF HOLLAND  CO, IN NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an heroic effort... (it will) continue to add to the deserved luster of the reputation of the top management at the firm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we have probably not seen a more challenging environment than the one that we are going through right now, for them to perform in this manner in this environment is nothing short of heroic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think in this environment it will only reflect on them... Goldman Sachs will not reassure the market other than to show that Goldman Sachs can do a great job in any market environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PETER DIXON, ECONOMIST, COMMERZBANK IN LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's all about spin isn't it? You look at them and think 'Q3 profit down ... what is good about them?' It's a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market seems to generally have a very positive view of Goldman, in contrast to what was happening to Lehman last week. Goldman does have a habit of nudging ahead of expectations so it reinforces the reputation they have on the Street as being a little bit smarter than the average bank."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The thing is, if you have expectations low enough and you've got some decent numbers, then you're always going to surprise markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman didn't give us the impression that they were going to be stellar numbers anyway. We go into these and we get some numbers which suggest it's a business which is still making money when the rest of the world is falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It gives the markets a bit of faith that the whole of the U.S. financial system isn't rotten to the core and that there is still occasionally the odd shaft of good news to come through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MIKE LENHOFF, CHIEF STRATEGIST AT BREWIN DOLPHIN IN LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're obviously a clever lot....they have a lot of corporate business and there's enough corporate activity still going on. They're a survivor, along with Morgan Stanley. But the two can't hold up the financial edifice which is crumbling all round us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think they'll have an impact on markets, as Goldman is just one company in the midst of a financial system the backbone of which appears to have been broken. There's almost a sense of hysteria in the market, and however good the results, they're not going to stand in the way of markets wanting to push values lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DAVID BUIK, PARTNER, BGC PARTNERS, LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nothing wrong with Goldman Sachs ... but the company has got investments in Tokyo which are performing badly and property stocks as well. We are use to earnings per share of $4-$5 at Goldman ... the market is saying: 'so what?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company is trading down in pre-market trade as the market has high expectations for the group. The market is depressed and no one wants to buy Goldman shares when the market is going down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ROBERT LUTTS, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CABOT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MONEY MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the surface, they look like they were stable, they are not writing-off additional problematic assets or things like that so you would think that would make people look more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first look at them makes you think they (Goldman's results) are positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock is falling because "people are worried, are fearful. I'd continue to expect volatility. The initial reaction may be this is a good stock to sell because it's good news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WALTER TODD, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GREENWOOD CAPITAL ASSOCIATES,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GREENWOOD, SOUTH CAROLINA:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman's tier one capital ratio was 11.6 percent, but Lehman's was 11 percent and they went into bankruptcy, so why even look at that number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Principal investments recorded a loss of $453 million, and until now that's been a very positive area for them. To think that any financial firm can avoid being scathed by this meltdown is naive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CLEVELAND RUECKERT, BIRINYI ASSOCIATES INC, STAMFORD, CT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that Goldman had earnings this morning probably didn't outweigh the fact that you've had two major institutions pretty much fail this week and AIG seems to be well underway. Unless the Fed cuts this afternoon, I don't think it's going to be a good day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THOMAS DI GALOMA, HEAD OF GOVERNMENT TRADING, JEFFERIES  CO.,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It certainly calms fear. Treasuries are coming off on the Goldman (earnings) and announcement of upcoming Fed open market operation. It is just very volatile out there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Wilchins, Richard Leong, Elinor Comlay, Steve Johnson, Ellis Mnyandu, Joanne Frearson, Juan Lagorio))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with details from court proceeding)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Chelsea Emery and Dan Wilchins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve
intervened aggressively to shore up the U.S. financial system
this week, providing at least $87 billion to help underpin
trades with units of bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc,
court documents show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fed's action is the latest sign of how U.S. authorities
have been seeking to prop up financial markets following the
failure of Lehman LEH.P and as big insurer American
International Group (AIG.N) fights for survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the government had pledged not to fund a rescue of
Lehman, the disclosure on Tuesday showed that authorities were
taking other financial steps to prevent markets from descending
into chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) advanced $87 billion to the
units on Monday to help clear and facilitate securities
transactions with customers and clients of Lehman "to avoid
disruption of financial markets," according to documents filed
in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New
York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman and the New York Fed had requested the advance,
known as a "commencement date advance" and the New York Fed
repaid it, according to filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In effect, the New York Fed lent the funds to the units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A representative for the New York Fed declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This expansion of the Fed's credit program is

agreed to buy Lehman's core broker-dealer business for about $2
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman's holding company filed for bankruptcy in the early
hours of Monday, in the largest U.S. bankruptcy ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Lehman's broker-dealer units are not covered under
the filing, customers typically unwind trades with a dealer
whose holding company is bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, at the request of Lehman and the New York Fed,
JPMorgan advanced $51 billion to Lehman as part of a so-called
second-day advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Court documents did not specify whether the New York Fed
would repay the second amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan may elect to advance additional money to Lehman
units as part of a "post-petition advance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All post-petition advances are guaranteed by Lehman and
collateralized, according to the documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy is taking the restructuring
industry into uncharted waters," Pauker said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The two largest U.S. investment banks, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley, reported lower quarterly profits, but beat expectations on Tuesday even as the worst market slump in decades rattled Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said its third-quarter earnings plunged 70 percent on weaker-than-expected revenues, knocking its shares to nearly three-year lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller rival Morgan Stanley, which reported after the close of North American markets, trounced expectations partly on the back of strong equity trading results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan's earnings fell less than 3 percent even as the year-old credit crunch slowed deal activity and created one of the toughest trading environments in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Between Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, we are getting some modest positive news in what has been an otherwise dark five-day period," said Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment officer of Fifth Third Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After closing down 11 percent, Morgan Stanley shares gave up after-hours gains of nearly 9 percent to trade around their close of $28.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc filing for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch  Co Inc rushing into the arms of Bank of America Corp in the last couple of days, questions have grown about the viability of the financial sector as it stands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Colm Kelleher told Reuters he remains confident in the broker-dealer model and dismissed the need to merge with a deposit-taking bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm very confident about the business model. I'm clearly cautious about the markets," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call with investors, Kelleher said he hoped the results would serve as "a building block in a bridge to rebuilding confidence in this market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Things are frankly getting out of hand," he said. "Ridiculous rumors are being repeated, some of which if I wrote down today and re-read tomorrow, I'd probably think I was dreaming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment bank said $2.7 billion in revenue from equity sales and trading included record results in prime brokerage. Results also included a $745-million pre-tax gain related to the follow-on offering of index company MSCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is great news for the whole financial sector," said Marshall Front, chairman at Front Barnett Associates. "I think the key to this whole thing was that they looked better than Goldman Sachs' earnings earlier in the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' results were marked by sharply lower banking, trading and investment results. It was the investment bank's biggest earnings decline since it went public in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman beat profit expectations, despite $1.1 billion in write-downs and losses from principal investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares closed down 1.8 percent after falling as much as 14 percent early in the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors said Goldman deserved credit for reporting any profit at all, while its executives expressed confidence in the firm's business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For them to perform in this manner, in this environment, is nothing short of heroic," said Holland  Co Chairman Mike Holland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Lehman Brothers reported a quarterly loss of $3.9 billion, fueled by nearly $8 billion in write-downs. The losses and worries about a lack of capital ultimately forced the 158-year-old firm into bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares of big insurer American International Group Inc, a leading underwriter of credit default swaps, sank 21 percent on Tuesday on worries that it too would go bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People were hoping for some good news in a sea of gloom and I don't think they got it," said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager and analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HALF A TRILLION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks and brokers have recorded more than half a trillion dollars in write-downs over the past year as the U.S. mortgage crunch has widened into a full-blown credit crisis that shows no signs of abating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman so far has navigated the turmoil better than its peers, avoiding big write-downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Goldman executives acknowledged their business follows the global economy and that, right now, conditions are grim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, the company is playing defense -- hoarding capital and cash, and shedding risky assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've become even more cautious in our approach," Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told reporters. "There's a lot of fear in the marketplace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings beat analysts' reduced expectations of $1.75 a share, but revenue fell short of the consensus target of $6.3 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Goldman shares dropped 12 percent to a five-year low, the biggest one-day drop in more than eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With three of the top five U.S. investment banks -- Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns -- leaving the stage, some analysts have speculated Goldman and Morgan Stanley could themselves face market pressure. Several observers forecast Goldman would acquire a deposit-rich bank to provide stable funding in jittery markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Viniar batted down suggestions that investment banks need to merge with commercial banks to save themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not the business model. It's performance that matters," he said. "We've been able to compete just fine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, Goldman's investment banking revenue dropped 40 percent amid a dearth of deal activity. Fixed-income trading revenue plummeted by two-thirds, reflecting weak credit and mortgage trading results. Equities trading revenue fell by one- half in a period when many investor clients were forced to "de-leverage," or sell off their holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest quarter included $1.1 billion in losses on corporate loans, residential and commercial mortgages, all areas where Goldman has been trying to trim its exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the firm lost $453 million on principal investments, showing the occasional downside of making aggressive bets with house money. Asset management revenue fell 6 percent, reflecting declining markets and clients withdrawing a net $7 billion of assets from funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One bright spot was a 20 percent jump in securities services, reflecting in part a strong increase in prime brokerage services for hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the backlog of pending investment banking deals increased in the quarter, Viniar said, fueled by new MA advisory assignments. That increase could lead to rising revenue in future periods as deals are completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said Goldman beat expectations because it paid unusually low taxes, an effective rate of 12 percent compared with 34 percent last year. That alone boosted earnings by 32 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay, Dan Wilchins and Jennifer Ablan; Editing by John Wallace, Maureen Bavdek, Jeffrey Benkoe, Gary Hill, Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs, the No. 1 U.S. investment bank, said on Tuesday it has doubled its risk in commodities trading from a year ago, leading to strong quarterly results from the sector despite a 70 percent plunge in net profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman said its Value-at-Risk (VaR) for commodity prices stood at $51 million for the third quarter ended August 29, against $48 million in the second quarter and $24 million in the third quarter of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VaR is a measure of the money that a company could lose in a single day from a particular trade. In the case of investment banks, which seldom break down profit and loss figures for commodities, VaR is one way of gauging their appetite for proprietary trading in raw materials markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said net revenues from trading in fixed income, currency and commodities as a group totaled $1.6 billion in the third quarter, down 67 percent from the second quarter. It attributed the fall to weak results in credit products and mortgages, affected by broad declines in asset values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But commodities still produced "strong results", higher when compared with the third quarter of 2007, said Goldman, which is one of a few global banks involved in both futures and physical trading of commodities, including crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commodities from oil to metals and grains saw one of their most powerful bull runs in history during the first two quarters of 2008, before fears of a global economic slowdown brought prices down sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is the second U.S. bank in a week to report a greater tolerance to commodities' risk during the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers, the country's No. 4 investment bank which filed for bankruptcy this week, said its commodities VaR averaged $15 million in the third quarter versus $12 million in the quarter to May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, however, said that fourth quarter VaR for commodities could be lower at most U.S. banks as commodity prices continue to fall from a global flight to safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think what we are seeing is literally just an evaporation of liquidity," said Zachary Oxman, senior trader at Wisdom Financial in Newport Beach, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Selling is begetting more selling and we're getting pockets of nonexistent liquidity. That's what is such a dangerous situation," Oxman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Barani Krishnan; Editing by Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said quarterly profit plunged 70 percent as the worst market slump in decades led to weaker-than-expected revenues, knocking the stock to its lowest level in nearly three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the larger of the two major U.S. investment banks still standing, beat profit expectations on Tuesday, even as it recorded $1.1 billion in write-downs and losses from its principal investments. It was the biggest earnings decline since Goldman went public in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares dropped 2.5 percent in afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results upset investors during a week in which Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch agreed to sell itself to Bank of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People were hoping for some good news in a sea of gloom, and I don't think they got it," said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager and analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks and brokers have recorded more than half a trillion dollars in write-downs over the past year as the U.S. mortgage crunch has widened into a full-blown credit crisis that shows no signs of abating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman so far has navigated the turmoil better than its peers, avoiding big write-downs. Yet Goldman executives acknowledged their business follows the global economy and right now conditions are grim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, the company is playing defense -- hoarding capital and cash, and shedding risky assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've become even more cautious in our approach," Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN THE BLACK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income fell to $845 million, or $1.81 a share, for the fiscal quarter ended August 29, from $2.85 billion, or $6.13, a year earlier. Net revenue fell by half to $6.04 billion as deal activity slowed, trading conditions worsened and a broad range of assets fell in price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings beat analysts' reduced expectations of $1.75 a share, but revenue fell short of the consensus target of $6.3 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares fell $3.40 to $132.10 after dropping as low as $117.24 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday they dropped 12 percent to a five-year low, the biggest one-day drop in more than eight years, as the credit crunch picked up momentum in its second year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which is to report its quarterly results on Thursday, saw its shares drop as much as 27 percent. In afternoon trade, they were down 13.4 percent to $27.99 as investors worried that its report will be equally grim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, while a struggling Merrill Lynch  Co Inc rushed into the arms of Bank of America Corp over the weekend. Six months ago, Bear Stearns collapsed and was acquired by JPMorgan Chase  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, insurer American International Group Inc scrambled Tuesday to avert a cash crunch, urging government officials to help sustain it. Efforts by Goldman and JPMorgan to raise $75 billion in debt from private sources have been fruitless so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With three of the top five U.S. investment banks leaving the scene, some analysts have speculated that Goldman and Morgan Stanley could themselves face market pressure. Several observers predicted Goldman would acquire a deposit-rich bank to provide stable funding in jittery markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar, though, contended Goldman that neither wants nor needs to merge with a commercial bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It feels like we've been able to compete just fine," he said. Problems seen at other banks reflected "their execution, not their business model."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANKING REVENUE DROPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, Goldman's investment banking revenue dropped 40 percent amid a dearth of deal activity. Fixed-income trading revenue plummeted by two-thirds, reflecting weak credit and mortgage trading results. Equities trading revenue fell by one-half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backlog of pending investment banking deals increased in the quarter, Viniar said, fueled by new MA advisory assignments. That increase could lead to rising revenue in future periods as deals are completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman wasn't completely unscathed by the crisis. The latest quarter included $1.1 billion in losses on loans for junk-rated companies, residential and commercial mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover the firm lost $453 million on principal investments, showing the occasional downside of making aggressive bets with house money. Asset management revenue fell 6 percent, reflecting declining markets and clients withdrawing a net $7 billion of assets from funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said Goldman beat expectations because it paid unusually low taxes -- an effective rate of 12 percent compared with 34 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, some investors said Goldman deserves credit for reporting a profit at all. Indeed Goldman shares, down as much as 14 percent earlier in the session, recovered in midday trading after an analyst conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have probably not seen a more challenging environment than the one that we are going through right now," said Holland  Co chairman Mike Holland. "For them to perform in this manner, in this environment, is nothing short of heroic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Lehman reported a third-quarter loss of $3.9 billion, on the heels of a $2.8 billion second-quarter loss, fueled by nearly $8 billion in write-downs as well as steep declines in banking, underwriting and trading revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The losses, and worries that it lacked enough capital, ultimately forced the 158-year-old firm into bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jonathan Spicer, Elinor Comlay and Dan Wilchins; Editing by John Wallace, Maureen Bavdek and Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's two biggest investment banks on Tuesday both reported strong performances from their commodities operations in an otherwise troubled third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS.N), the No. 1 U.S. investment bank, said it has doubled its risk in commodities trading from a year ago during the quarter ended Aug 29, leading to strong results from the sector despite a 70 percent plunge in net profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Wall Street's second largest investment bank, also reported strong commodities performance in its latest quarter but did not give details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said its Value-at-Risk (VaR) for commodity prices stood at $51 million for the third quarter ended August 29, against $48 million in the second quarter and $24 million in the third quarter of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VaR measures the money a company could lose in a single day from a particular trade.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Analysts may be tweaking Chevron Corp (CVX.N) profit forecasts in response to oil prices falling and damage from Hurricane Ike, but increased refining margins after the storm could even help its earnings a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several Chevron platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were toppled by the latest storm, the second-largest U.S. oil company said on Tuesday. Its new Blind Faith and Tahiti platforms suffered no significant damage, but a spokesman said details on other platforms were not yet available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet with most U.S. Gulf Coast refining capacity still out of action, the fact that Chevron's Mississippi refinery made a relatively quick recovery means the company can sell products into a market with margins fattened by overall lack of supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil Weiss, energy analyst at Argus Research Co, said he trimmed his Chevron estimates last week in response to the lower price of U.S. crude oil CLc1, which is down 20 percent in September and 10 percent in the last week alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil prices are looking to be a little lower on average for Q3 than when I did my report," Weiss said, although he added that increased refining margins because of Ike could potentially partly offset that downward pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 15 Wall Street analyst estimates for Chevron's 2008 earnings compiled by Reuters Estimates, 10 have most recently been trimmed. The average earnings per share estimate is now $12.06.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's 330,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi, the eighth-largest in the United States, was back to normal after operating with reduced runs, the Energy Department said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But 13 refineries representing just under one-fifth of total U.S. refining capacity remain shut after the storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any widening of margins will come on top of that driven by improved demand as oil prices fall, said Michael Cuggino, chief executive of Pacific Heights Asset Management, which manages about $3.8 billion and holds Chevron shares as a long-term bet on global demand growth for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't expect Ike to have a significant impact on output long term," Cuggino said. "Chevron got back up pretty quickly and the others are going to follow soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares were 2 percent higher at $81.72 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with a 1.6 percent rise in oil stocks .OIX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quarter of San Ramon, California-based Chevron's 2 million bpd of company-owned refining capacity is at its two big home-state refineries at El Segundo and Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Richard Valdmanis in New York and Tom Doggett in Washington; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds text to earlier brief and adds details throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Chelsea Emery and Dan Wilchins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of
New York took the unusual step of providing some $87 billion in
financing to units of bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc
LEH.N to prevent disruption in trading markets as customers
flee, according to a filing on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) advanced $87 billion to Lehman
on Monday to help clear and facilitate securities transactions
with customers and clients of Lehman "to avoid disruption of
financial markets," according to documents filed in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York Fed then repaid the advance, according to
filings. A Fed representative declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman's holding company filed for bankruptcy on Monday,
and although its broker-dealer units are not covered under the
bankruptcy filing, customers typically unwind trades with a
dealer whose holding company is bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, at the request of Lehman and the New York Fed,
JPMorgan advanced $51 billion to Lehman as part of a so-called
second day advance. Court documents did not specify whether the
New York Fed will repay the second amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan may elect to advance additional money to Lehman
units as part of a 'post-petition advance."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The meltdown in the U.S. financial sector could lower New York office rents by 20 percent from its recent peak and boost vacancies by 5 to 7 percentage points from its lows, JP Morgan analysts said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We think the outlook is fairly negative," JP Morgan analyst Anthony Paolone said during an investor call. "We think you're going to see a notable pullback in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's bad news for several of the biggest real estate investment trusts such as Vornado Realty Trust, SL Green Realty Corp, Brookfield Properties Corp, and Boston Properties Inc, which were downgraded on Monday by Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan didn't specify the market peak in its outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the average asking rent for Manhattan offices hit a high of $72.95 per square foot in August, according to real estate services firm Cushman  Wakefield, and the vacancy rate was the lowest in the second quarter of 2007, at 5.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan analysts said they believe Wall Street job losses may top the 30,000 to 40,000 typically seen in a downturn, considering this week's bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, Bank of America Corp's buyout of Merrill Lynch  Co Inc, and the precarious state of American International Group Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a very good chance that direct securities layoffs blow through what they were in the '87 cycle and as well as what they were in the 2000 cycle," Paolone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most office REIT shares on Tuesday reversed some of their double-digit losses from Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the New York Stock Exchange, Brookfield rose 4.31 percent, or 75 cents, to $18.15; Boston Properties was up 2.34 percent, or $2.08, at $91.08; and Vornado gained 5.11 percent, or $4.53, at $93.23 at mid-afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SL Green, which has the most exposure to New York, continued to see its stock fall, down 1.22 percent, or 86 cents, to $69.60, also on the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ilaina Jonas, editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Defense Coalition: Ecuador Court Report Underestimates Damages for Chevron's "Amazon Chernobyl" in Ecuador

      $16 Billion Chevron Liability Could Rise If Groundwater and
             Surface Water Damage Included, Plaintiffs Say

              New Criminal Indictment of Chevron Lawyers
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
An independent court-appointed expert in the environmental trial
against Chevron in Ecuador should impose additional damages on the oil
giant for groundwater and surface water contamination that could
significantly increase the current $16.3 billion liability estimate,
lawyers for the plaintiffs say.

   In a response to the expert's 4,000-page report, the plaintiffs
today submitted papers to the court asking the expert to calculate how
much it would cost to remediate the damage to groundwater and surface
water, both of which were not included in the expert's assessment. The
surface water contamination comes from Chevron's deliberate discharge
of 18.5 billion gallons of toxic "produced water" into the Amazon from
1964 to 1990, when it was the exclusive operator of an oil concession
that covered an area the size of Rhode Island.

   "There is significant evidence of groundwater and surface water
contamination in the record, yet there are no damages imposed to
remediate the impacts," said Pablo Fajardo, the Ecuadorian lawyer for
dozens of Amazon communities and five indigenous groups who are suing
Chevron.

   Fajardo said it was up to the expert to calculate the amount of
the additional damages, but he estimated the number could be
significant if the expert accepts the request. An earlier assessment
by a plaintiff's expert had estimated groundwater clean-up alone at
more than $2 billion.

   A final decision in the case, which Chevron has fought for years
to delay since it was filed in 1993 in U.S. federal court, is expected
in the coming months. If the Ecuador court expert's damage assessment
is accepted by the judge, Chevron could be hit with the largest
environmental damages claim in history-not unexpected, according to
the plaintiffs, given that scientists believe the magnitude of damages
is the largest ever for an oil-related contamination.

   In any event, any Ecuador judgment likely will be enforceable in
the U.S. because Chevron voluntarily submitted to jurisdiction there
as a condition of having the case transferred to Ecuador in 2002. At
the time, Chevron submitted ten sworn affidavits from legal experts
praising Ecuador's courts as transparent and fair.

   The plaintiff's response to the expert report is based on a
technical review by over a dozen prominent scientists from the U.S.,
Ecuador, and Spain. In additional, Richard Cabrera, the
court-appointed expert, worked with a team of 14 scientists who
reviewed roughly 64,000 chemical sampling results and more than
200,000 pages of trial evidence, and conducted their own field
analyses.

   In all, more than 25 scientists -- most from the U.S. or Ecuador
-- were involved in either preparing the Cabrera report or reviewing
it.

   In its response, the plaintiffs made the following points:

   --  The overall damages assessment, once the excluded categories
        are included, is a reasonable amount and consistent with
        damages imposed in other large environmental disasters around
        the world. Several examples were cited.

   --  The report underestimated the number of deaths from cancer due
        to the oil contamination by failing to take into account
        population growth in the region. Cabrera estimated 428 excess
        cancer deaths due to oil contamination, while the plaintiffs
        believe the number of cancer deaths could be at least three
        times that high if current population data is used.

   --  An amount for "unjust enrichment" -- $8.3 billion -- should be
        added to actual damages because it is simply impossible, from
        a clean-up standpoint, to restore the rainforest to its
        original condition given the extent of the damages. That
        amount raises the total damages award to $16.3 billion plus
        the additional categories, said Fajardo.

   The Cabrera report, released last March, estimated Chevron's
damages in the long-running trial between $7.2 billion and $16.3
billion. The lower number covers actual damages, which includes soil
cleanup, a water system to provide clean water, health care services,
compensation for cancer deaths, and the buying back of ancestral land
of indigenous groups.

   The higher number -- called "unjust enrichment" -- includes $8.3
billion for the disgorgement of monies Chevron saved by using
sub-standard production practices that violated Ecuadorian law and
industry custom. At the time Chevron began operating in Ecuador, for
example, it was customary to re-inject the formation waters into the
ground instead of dumping them where they could poison fresh water
sources.

   Lawyers for the plaintiffs also blasted Chevron for using "junk
science" in its own rebuttal. Chevron claimed Cabrera used
"fabricated" evidence to reach "erroneous" conclusions.

   In fact, most of the scientific evidence used by Cabrera was
provided by Chevron itself.

   "Chevron has been trying for years to deceive the court by
manipulating its interpretation of lab results for litigation
purposes," said Fajardo. "The company has never even funded a health
evaluation after more than four decades of contaminating the
rainforest, but it spends millions to attack those like us who dare to
try to hold the company accountable."

   "There is no court in the world that is good enough for Chevron if
that court acts independently," he added.

   Cabrera was paid by Chevron in an earlier part of the trial when
he served as a court-appointed expert for a judicial inspection.
Chevron did not object to his qualifications at the time.

   The court submission comes just days after two Chevron lawyers,
including a high-level executive based in Miami, were indicted in
Ecuador on fraud charges for allegedly lying about the results of a
purported remediation of the contamination. The lawyers, Ricardo Reis
Veiga and Rodrigo Perez Pallares, are continuing to supervise
Chevron's defense in the civil trial.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The market is already
expecting massive sales of assets from bankrupt Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc LEH.P, so when the sales take place, prices may
not move that much, said Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) chief
financial officer, David Viniar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Speaking on a call with analysts on Tuesday, Viniar said
Lehman Brothers' attempts to sell its residential mortgage
assets and other complex securities were well-known and had
already driven prices lower in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That overhang was largely in the market," Viniar said.
"After a couple of months, if (those) assets get sold, it might
actually take some of that overhang out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts and investors have been concerned the sale of
these assets at fire-sale prices, resulting from a liquidation
at Lehman's and Bank of America Corp's (BAC.N) acquisition of
Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N, could force other banks to mark
their holdings at lower levels.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Procter  Gamble Co (PG.N)
sees a slight benefit from the recent drop in the price of oil,
but not enough to change its forecast for overall commodity
price increases, Chief Financial Officer Clayton Daley said on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; When PG, the world's largest consumer products company,
gave its financial outlook in August, spot prices for oil were
around $120 per barrel and the company had set its forecast
based on oil staying at around $110 to $120 per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But oil has since retreated, with futures CLc1 trading at
about $91.75 on Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While PG does not buy any oil directly, it buys products
made from oil and other ingredients, such as agricultural
materials and phosphates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While oil prices have fallen, costs for non-oil based
materials that had risen rapidly have not pulled back to the
same degree that oil has, Daley said at an investor
conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daley said that PG still expects to spend $3 billion more
on commodities and energy this year and must raise prices by
about 3 percent to offset those costs. The expected cost
increase for fiscal 2009 is twice the increase PG saw in the
last fiscal year. The company's fiscal year began on July 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strengthening U.S. dollar, meanwhile, pressures sales
overseas, Daley said, but added that it was not a significant
 issue. A strengthening dollar lessens the dollar value of
international sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PG did not change its profit forecast on Tuesday, calling
for a 9 percent to 11 percent increase this year, excluding a
one-time gain from the sale of the Folgers coffee business and
one-time tax benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cincinnati-based PG is also seeing U.S. consumers
switching more of their shopping trips to lower-priced
mass-market and club stores, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc
(WMT.N) and Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O). Daley said some
shoppers in the United States and Western Europe are also
buying lower-priced private-label brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But PG, whose products include Pampers diapers and
Gillette deodorant, said consumers are still trying new
products, such as clinical-strength deodorants, despite higher
prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest new product that Daley touted was a new pad,
Always Infinity, which he called the biggest innovation in
feminine hygiene in at least a decade. That product, set to hit
store shelves in mid-October, even has a countdown clock on the
Always web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PG shares were up 4 cents at $72.19 in midday trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft UK DCOE Uses Shunra Virtual Enterprise WAN Emulation for Deployment Solution Demonstrations and Proof of Concept Workshops

     Microsoft's UK Deployment Centre of Excellence extends their
     capabilities with Shunra, addressing the real world scenarios
                   customers face during deployment.
PHILADELPHIA--(Business Wire)--
Shunra Software, the global leader in WAN emulation technology,
today announced that the Microsoft UK Deployment Centre of Excellence
(DCOE) has adopted Shunra VE as their central WAN emulation solution,
expanding their proof of concept capabilities to customers. Using
Shunra, the DCOE is now able to address the real world scenarios their
customers face by applying a replica of the customer's actual wide
area network to the testing phase, enabling customers to understand
the exact end user experience before rollout.

   The Microsoft UK DCOE is a dedicated resource which provides
workshop style sessions for customers and partners to review their
current deployment processes, short and longer term application
performance goals, deployment hurdles, and perceived deployment
issues, then relate these to the 'art of the possible', Microsoft
deployment's best practices and infrastructure roadmap. The DCOE
environment provides the facilities to demonstrate deployment
solutions, delivering client and server operating systems plus
applications, configuration and user data and setting migration. The
DCOE utilizes diverse hardware types to replicate real world
challenges faced by customers and partners.

   The DCOE, going through an 'environment refresh,' needed to extend
their capabilities to provide demonstrations of solutions which
addressed the real world scenarios their customers were facing,
including: deployment and management of applications in branch and
remote environments; network impairments; and reduced bandwidth and
resources. These constraints introduce unique technical and support
challenges for customers and the Centre identified this as a core
requirement in their new environment design.

   The DCOE chose Shunra VE as their core WAN emulation tool. Not
only does Shunra meet their original design requirements, but the
advanced reporting and market proven accuracy delivers a number of
additional testing opportunities.

   "The Shunra STN forms a fundamental component of our new DCOE
environment. It allows us to provide predefined demonstrations which
accurately reflect head office and branch type scenarios and differing
variations on deployment and management based around these, as per our
original intentions," said Keith Baker, security and management
deployment specialist, Microsoft UK. "In addition to this core
functionality, we are able to use some of the Shunra VE advanced
capabilities to offer more specific proof of concept work replicating
a customer's actual environment by recording the physical network
characteristics at the customer location and then replaying this and
recreating the client environment within the DCOE."

   Currently, Shunra Software is the only company to provide both
hardware and software WAN emulation solutions with market-leading best
practices for application development and performance testing.
Increased demand for consistent and reliable enterprise application
performance drives customers like the DCOE to fully incorporate Shunra
VE into their testing processes.

   "We worked closely with the Microsoft Deployment Centre of
Excellence to provide a flexible platform to quickly emulate their
customer's network environments which in turn provides end-users the
ability to deploy the diverse set of Microsoft products faster and
more reliably to meet the high level of quality of experience that
Microsoft's customers are accustomed to," said Ben Boulnois, Shunra VP
EMEA.

   "Shunra VE has not only allowed us to meet our original aims, but
has presented the possibility for the DCOE effectiveness to be greatly
enhanced for future engagements," concluded Keith.

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, Sep 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) has announced a three-dimensional Virtual Green Data
Center (VGDC) that gives visitors a chance to learn how to manage and
improve their data center energy efficiency without leaving the office.
The VGDC, the world's first interactive green data center, is on the IBM
Virtual Business Center Island in Second Life(R) and was demonstrated at
the Virtual Worlds Expo in Los Angeles, September 3 &amp; 4.

    Last year, IBM launched a $1 billion initiative to address the critical
issue of energy efficiency in IT environments. As part of the initiative,
IBM has created this virtual exhibit, in place of a physical briefing
center, as a way to demonstrate IBM's leading eco-friendly technologies
covering energy efficiency, virtualization, and resiliency.

    Through the use of avatars, visitors are able to explore the green data
center by taking a self-guided, individual, or group tour. The VGDC is
available 24 hours a day and, with IBM's Virtual Business Center staffed
by live multi-lingual sales avatars five days a week, it is very easy for
visitors to get the information and answers they need.

    Part of IBM's Roadmap to a Green Data Center, the VGDC enables clients to
get the experience of walking through a data center, without the travel
costs associated with a physical visit. In addition, this opens up the
doors of a data center to a larger audience who, due to security or other
restrictions, might never be able to enter a real IBM data center.

    The immersive experience and interaction help simplify the understanding
of complex concepts and processes, such as:


--  Energy management and efficiency
--  Power and cooling solutions and heat exchange
--  Data center and lab services

    
As energy costs continue to rise and additional expense control
pressures are applied, Web 2.0 technologies like the VGDC become
increasingly important as a means to increase productivity and control
costs. Based on the number of in-person visits to physical briefing
centers, IBM estimates the use of the VGDC as an alternative could
provide millions of dollars in cost savings to IBM customers in travel
expenses and to offset CO2 emissions.

    "The VGDC is as green as it gets," said Joanne Bald, program director,
ibm.com 3-D Internet. "It allows our customers and potential clients to
interact with IBM's green portfolio in a very environmentally-friendly
way. No airplanes burning fuel or rental cars... not even the hassle and
time of travel arrangements."

    The center provides a flexible, relaxed atmosphere for visitors to learn
at their own pace. It is available for on demand education and client
briefings any time from anywhere with a computer and an
Internet
connection.

   Background

   With pressure mounting in Ecuador from a major environmental
lawsuit and criminal fraud indictment against Chevron lawyers, four
residents of the Amazon rainforest will travel to Washington to
discuss the devastating impact of the oil company's operations over
three decades in what once was one of the world's most pristine
jungles. Meetings are set with members of Congress and Congressional
staff. (Media can obtain the names of the members of Congress and
congressional staff on September 17th by emailing or phoning the media
contact. We are not releasing the names until then to prevent Chevron
from interfering with the meetings.)

   The lawsuit, filed in 2003 after Chevron insisted the case be
shifted to Ecuador from a U.S. federal court, is expected to result in
one of the largest civil judgments in history. An independent
court-appointed expert recently assessed damages between $7.2 billion
and $16.3 billion. Chevron recently hired several A-list Washington
lobbyists, including McCain Campaign finance chair Wayne Berman and
former Senator Trent Lott, to try to convince the Bush Administration
and Congress to deny Ecuador trade benefits as "punishment" for
letting these individuals press their private legal claims against
Chevron. Further, two Chevron lawyers were indicted last week in
Ecuador for conspiring to falsify the results of a purported
environmental clean-up as a ruse to avoid liability in the civil case.

   The Ecuadorians have accused Texaco (bought by Chevron in 2001) of
committing the worst oil-related disaster on the planet on their
ancestral lands - one at least 30 times worse than the Exxon Valdez
spill. They also believe the scientific evidence at trial from various
sources, including Chevron itself, demonstrate the presence of massive
and life-threatening levels of toxins in the area where Chevron
operated. Chevron has claimed the trial is a "farce" and "rigged" -
claims that have been vigorously rejected by the plaintiffs and
several independent observers.

   Members of Delegation

   The delegation will include a medical care provider who helps
residents who suffer from cancer, skin disease and respiratory
illnesses as a result of the contamination; a tribal leader whose
indigenous group has seen a dramatic drop in population since Texaco
entered Ecuador's rainforest in the mid 1960s; and Pablo Fajardo and
Luis Yanza, recently honored with the Goldman environmental prize
(called the "Nobel" of the environment). In April Chevron took out a
full page advertisement in the San Francisco Chronicle accusing
Fajardo and Yanza of having misled the Goldman jury, a charge the
Goldman Foundation rejected vigorously. Fajardo also was honored last
December as a CNN "Hero" award in the Justice category for leading the
fight to hold Chevron accountable and is one of the attorneys
representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

   Chevron's Practices

   Chevron is accused of dumping 18.5 billion gallons of toxic
"produced water" into Amazon waterways from 1964 to 1990, when it was
the exclusive operator of large oil concession in the rainforest. The
company is also accused of creating 916 unlined toxic waste pits and
filling them with toxic sludge that has leeched for decades into soils
and groundwater that Amazon residents rely on for drinking water. The
company is also accused of being responsible for hundreds of oil
spills. In 1992, Texaco turned over its entire operation to Ecuador's
state-owned oil company, Petroecuador. To this day, the system
originally designed and built by Texaco continues to contaminate the
environment. Five indigenous groups have been severely impacted, with
significant drops in population and health problems. Cancer rates and
other oil-related health problems in the region have spiked, according
to several peer-reviewed health studies.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) does not want or need to buy a commercial bank, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on Tuesday, countering market speculation that Wall Street companies need the stability of a deposit-taking business to survive the current turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year there was rampant talk that Goldman was studying a bank takeover, specifically Wachovia Corp WB.N, as it looked ahead to tougher market conditions and the prospect of stricter federal regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said buying a bank was off the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really interesting when I hear people talking about the model doesn't work because you have to have a deposit base, because the deposit base funds the banking assets," he said in a news briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The capital markets businesses that we do, and that our commercial bank competitors do, are all funded in the capital markets -- by us and by them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, analysts and investors have argued that the traditional Wall Street securities firms, and their reliance on funds from capital markets, was a creature of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collapse of both Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.P, as well as Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N rushing into a takeover by Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) has fueled speculation that Goldman and Morgan Stanley have little choice but to merge with a big, deposit-rich commercial bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said investors may be surprised to learn that when compared with big banks such as JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), UBS AG (UBS.N) and Bank of America, Goldman derives the lowest amount of its long-term debt from capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The banking deposits fund the banking business, the capital markets fund the capital markets business. That's the business model," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Viniar said, the troubles at other banks reflected mistakes made in tactics rather than in their business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a performance question," he said. "It's tactics more than strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past performance would appear to back up Viniar's views. Until recently, Goldman generated the highest returns by far and suffered lower losses than commercial bank rivals thus far. It also has remained the top deal adviser and stock underwriter worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five or six years ago "there was a big groundswell that the investment banks couldn't compete independently," Viniar told reporters in a briefing. "We wouldn't get through five minutes of a meeting without talking about Goldman Sachs combining with a commercial bank. Well, it feels like we've been able to compete just fine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SEATTLE, WA and REDMOND, WA, Sep 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (NASDAQ: CRAY) and Microsoft Corporation
(NASDAQ: MSFT) today introduced the new Cray CX1 supercomputer
pre-installed with Windows HPC Server 2008. With U.S. list prices
starting at $25,000 to over $60,000, "ease-of-everything" features and
the ability to fit into standard office environments and workflows, the
new product reflects Microsoft and Cray's shared goal to drive high
productivity computing farther into the mainstream in a broad array of
markets including financial services, aerospace, automotive, petroleum,
life sciences, government, academic and digital media.

    Studies released by the Council on Competitiveness and the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) found that nearly all large
firms using HPC consider it indispensable for their ability to compete
and survive, but smaller companies, as well as workgroups and departments
in larger firms, have been hampered by the cost of HPC systems and a lack
of access to in-house experts to help them use these systems.

    The Cray CX1 supercomputer was designed from the ground up to address
these barriers. It is the most affordable supercomputer ever offered by
Cray and is designed to be easy to purchase, deploy, operate and upgrade.
Purpose-built for offices, laboratories and university departments, the
Cray CX1 is the world's highest-performing computer that uses standard
office power.

    The Cray CX1 product incorporates up to 8 nodes and 16 Intel Xeon
processors, either dual or quad core; delivers up to 64 gigabytes of
memory per node; and provides up to 4 terabytes of internal storage.
Systems can be configured with a mix of compute, storage and
visualization blades to meet customers' individual requirements. The
quiet, deskside supercomputer features Windows HPC Server 2008 and
interoperates with Linux. A three-year warranty with next-day, on-site
Cray-certified support is standard.

    "Windows HPC Server 2008, in combination with the Cray CX1 supercomputer,
will provide outstanding sustained performance on applications," said
Vince Mendillo, director, HPC at Microsoft Corp. "This combined solution
will enable companies in various sectors to unify their Windows desktop
and server workflows. Many Microsoft financial services customers, for
example, want to unify back-office modeling and simulation with the work
of front-office trading desks."

    "IDC research shows that HPC has been one of the highest-growth IT markets
during the past five years and the segment for HPC systems priced below
$100,000 is headed for continued growth," said Earl Joseph, IDC's HPC
program vice president. "The Cray HPC brand name and experience, combined
with Microsoft's strategy of extending the familiar Windows environment
upward to the server level, gives the Cray CX1 solution strong potential
for exploiting the anticipated growth of this market segment."

    "Cray sees Microsoft Windows becoming an increasingly important force in
the HPC market," said Ian Miller, senior vice president of sales and
marketing at Cray. "With the Cray CX1 high productivity system and Windows
HPC Server 2008, we're bringing the power of Cray supercomputing to a much
wider range of new users with an affordable and adaptable system that
provides incredible value and is easy to install, program and use with a
broad array of applications from independent software vendors (ISVs)."

    The Cray CX1 high productivity system is also the first Cray product to
incorporate Intel processors and the first milestone of the unique
collaboration Cray and Intel announced in April to develop a range of HPC
systems and technologies over the next several years to address various
segments of the HPC industry.

    "Taking advantage of the energy-efficient performance of the Intel Xeon
processor 5400 series, Cray's CX1 system will bring many HPC capabilities
to the office that were previously confined to the datacenter, enabling
more users to employ supercomputing to help them solve some of their most
difficult computational problems," said Richard Dracott, Intel's General
Manager of High Performance Computing, "In addition, we continue to
collaborate with Cray on developing the supercomputing technologies of the
future, aimed at all segments of the HPC market."

    Scientists at the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at UCLA plan to use a Cray
CX1 with Microsoft HPC Server 2008 for mathematical modeling and
visualization. This will support their development of advanced
computational algorithms and scientific approaches for the comprehensive
and quantitative mapping of brain structure and function.

    "We are very excited about utilizing the Cray CX1 to support our research
activities," said Rico Magsipoc, Chief Technology Officer for the
Laboratory of Neuro Imaging. "The work that we do in brain research is
computationally intensive but will ultimately have a huge impact on our
understanding of the relationship between brain structure and function, in
both health and disease. Having the power of a Cray supercomputer that is
simple and compact is very attractive and necessary, considering the
physical constraints we face in our data centers today."

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 16 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded
drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) to "underweight" from
"neutral," and said the company faces the loss of patent
protection on $7.5 billion in product sales by 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This trend only gets worse over time with the 2014
expiration of Cymbalta," analyst Chris Schott said in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cymbalta is Eli Lilly's antidepressant that in June won
approval for addressing pain condition fibromyalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Lilly's pipeline remains modest, consisting of a number of
assets with either significant regulatory or clinical risk that
are unlikely to drive the shares over the next 12 months,"
Schott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schott expects a delay of one year related to the company's
new blood-clot preventer Effient. Effient, which is waiting for
approval from U.S. regulators, has been widely touted as a
medicine that could supplant Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's (BMY.N)
$5 billion-a-year Plavix as the standard treatment to prevent
heart attacks among heart patients, including those receiving
stents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts believe that because of Effient's potency it
will be approved as soon as Sept, 26, while others predict U.S.
regulators will demand another time-consuming safety trial
because of an unfavorable bleeding trend and risk to three
subgroups of patients in a study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan's Schott does not believe Effient is enough to
offset upcoming patent expirations, regardless of the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Eli Lilly were trading down almost 2 percent at
$45.27 early Tuesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, share price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 16 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities raised its
rating on CA Inc (CA.O) to "overweight" from "neutral," saying
the business software maker had a relatively stable business
model against difficult macro backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst John DiFucci said the company's first-quarter
results were an indicator of its strong underlying operational
performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 70 percent of CA's total revenue is from maintenence,
while much of the remaining license revenue is for mainframe
software, which we consider to be among the more stable
software license sales, DiFucci said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's cash to be collected has increased in the
last three quarters, which provides a relatively good gauge of
the momentum of the business and indicates the trend in cash
flow, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DiFucci, who has a price target of $28 on the stock, said
CA should be able to at least meet earnings expectations for
the rest of the year. He expects the company to earn 40 cents a
share in the second quarter and $1.55 a share in fiscal 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were up 32 cents at $21.85 in early
morning trade on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a powerful new solution to help
organizations slash virtual desktop infrastructure storage requirements
by up to 80 percent, allowing them to take advantage of new cloud
computing models at significantly reduced costs while increasing energy
efficiency.

    The new phase of "cloud computing" gives end-users access to the critical
information they need remotely, from any device, anywhere. IBM helps
organizations benefit from this new model with its Virtual Infrastructure
Access (VIA) services that give end users with internet enabled PCs and
other devices the ability to access applications and data through a
centrally managed computing environment. Until now, virtual desktop
deployments have been hampered by the cost and complexity of managing
storage, one of the most expensive hardware components of any virtual
desktop environment.

    Available beginning today, the new IBM Virtual Storage Optimizer (VSO)
solution for VIA directly addresses this challenge, helping businesses
further optimize their virtual desktop environments, while saving time and
money on storage requirements. Based on an algorithm developed by IBM
Research, VSO dramatically reduces the large physical storage requirements
associated with storing virtual images. The solution also allows
organizations to streamline operations by creating new desktop images in
mere seconds or minutes, a process which previously could take up to 30
minutes -- a 75% reduction in the time required to create and deploy new
virtual machines. This represents a tremendous operational savings for
clients, and allows them to realize more immediate returns on their
investments.

    "IBM's Virtual Storage Optimizer is a great provisioning component in our
virtual desktop infrastructure. The value of the VSO allows us to save
money in storage requirements while scaling out our environment. We can
deploy a number of fully customized desktops that are created in minutes
instead of hours," said Lance Hundt, Computer and Network Support
Specialist at Gainesville State College. "Our virtual environment
experienced around 80% storage savings. IBM's VSO is a 'no-brainer' for
anyone planning to offer a high number of virtual desktops."

    "IBM has created a value-added solution for that simplifies VMware VDI
deployments and drives cost savings into the overall VDI solution," said
Jeff Jennings, vice president of desktop products and solutions at VMware.
"We look forward to continuing to work closely together to enhance the VIA
offering to meet customer needs and accelerate the adoption of VDI."

    "VSO helps businesses more efficiently manage physical storage
requirements and improve utilization rates, energy efficiency,
availability, and scalability of critical applications," said Jan
Jackman, vice president, End-User Services, IBM Global Technology
Services. "VSO further extends our ability to help businesses and schools
embrace cloud computing models that accommodate employee mobility and
enhance end-user productivity."

    Through key technology and business partnerships with VMware and Desktone
IBM is helping public sector, academic institutions and financial
organizations around the world resolve Internet access parity problems,
address PC replacement dilemmas, and deliver resilience and reliability
for critical information, all at a fraction of the price of competing
solutions.

    IBM Virtual Infrastructure Access Services helps businesses of all sizes
transform their IT architectures by providing virtually anytime, anywhere
access to applications, information and resources, from devices including,
but not limited to the traditional PC.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Tuesday third-quarter earnings plunged 70 percent as one of the worst market slumps ever weighed on banking and trading results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. investment bank reported net income of $845 million, or $1.81 a share, for the quarter ended August 29, down from $2.85 billion, or $6.13 a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking revenue dropped 40 percent as deal activity dried up. Fixed-income trading revenue plummeted by two thirds from last year, reflecting weak credit and mortgage trading results, while equities trading revenue fell by half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net revenue fell by half to $6.04 billion from $12.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares fell about 4 percent before the bell Tuesday following the earnings report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from industry analysts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN  CO., GREENWICH,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONNECTICUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Revenues were weaker than expected, and the stock is trading down. All eyes are really on the eye of the storm, which is AIG and the systematic risk it poses to the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it's a tough environment and there are mumblings going on. People wondering whether (the remaining investment banks) should find some partners who can stem their liquidity concerns. They haven't been affected so much today, but they may be tomorrow. It may seem far-fetched, but a lot of things that seemed far-fetched have come to fruition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MIKE HOLLAND, CHAIRMAN OF HOLLAND  CO, IN NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an heroic effort... (it will) continue to add to the deserved luster of the reputation of the top management at the firm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we have probably not seen a more challenging environment than the one that we are going through right now, for them to perform in this manner in this environment is nothing short of heroic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think in this environment it will only reflect on them... Goldman Sachs will not reassure the market other than to show that Goldman Sachs can do a great job in any market environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PETER DIXON, ECONOMIST, COMMERZBANK IN LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's all about spin isn't it? You look at them and think 'Q3 profit down ... what is good about them?' It's a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market seems to generally have a very positive view of Goldman, in contrast to what was happening to Lehman last week. Goldman does have a habit of nudging ahead of expectations so it reinforces the reputation they have on the Street as being a little bit smarter than the average bank."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The thing is, if you have expectations low enough and you've got some decent numbers, then you're always going to surprise markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman didn't give us the impression that they were going to be stellar numbers anyway. We go into these and we get some numbers which suggest it's a business which is still making money when the rest of the world is falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It gives the markets a bit of faith that the whole of the U.S. financial system isn't rotten to the core and that there is still occasionally the odd shaft of good news to come through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MIKE LENHOFF, CHIEF STRATEGIST AT BREWIN DOLPHIN IN LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're obviously a clever lot....they have a lot of corporate business and there's enough corporate activity still going on. They're a survivor, along with Morgan Stanley. But the two can't hold up the financial edifice which is crumbling all round us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think they'll have an impact on markets, as Goldman is just one company in the midst of a financial system the backbone of which appears to have been broken. There's almost a sense of hysteria in the market, and however good the results, they're not going to stand in the way of markets wanting to push values lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DAVID BUIK, PARTNER, BGC PARTNERS, LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nothing wrong with Goldman Sachs ... but the company has got investments in Tokyo which are performing badly and property stocks as well. We are use to earnings per share of $4-$5 at Goldman ... the market is saying: 'so what?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company is trading down in pre-market trade as the market has high expectations for the group. The market is depressed and no one wants to buy Goldman shares when the market is going down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ROBERT LUTTS, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CABOT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MONEY MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the surface, they look like they were stable, they are not writing-off additional problematic assets or things like that so you would think that would make people look more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first look at them makes you think they (Goldman's results) are positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock is falling because "people are worried, are fearful. I'd continue to expect volatility. The initial reaction may be this is a good stock to sell because it's good news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WALTER TODD, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GREENWOOD CAPITAL ASSOCIATES,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GREENWOOD, SOUTH CAROLINA:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman's tier one capital ratio was 11.6 percent, but Lehman's was 11 percent and they went into bankruptcy, so why even look at that number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Principal investments recorded a loss of $453 million, and until now that's been a very positive area for them. To think that any financial firm can avoid being scathed by this meltdown is naive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CLEVELAND RUECKERT, BIRINYI ASSOCIATES INC, STAMFORD, CT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that Goldman had earnings this morning probably didn't outweigh the fact that you've had two major institutions pretty much fail this week and AIG seems to be well underway. Unless the Fed cuts this afternoon, I don't think it's going to be a good day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THOMAS DI GALOMA, HEAD OF GOVERNMENT TRADING, JEFFERIES  CO.,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It certainly calms fear. Treasuries are coming off on the Goldman (earnings) and announcement of upcoming Fed open market operation. It is just very volatile out there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Wilchins, Richard Leong, Elinor Comlay, Steve Johnson, Ellis Mnyandu, Joanne Frearson, Juan Lagorio))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - European shares fell further in
afternoon trade on Tuesday, led by financials after U.S.
investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) reported a 70 percent fall
in its quarterly earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By 1238 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top
European companies was down 3.2 percent at 1,083.66 points, its
lowest since May 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks were the top-weighted losers, with UBS (UBSN.VX) down
19 percent, HBOS HBOS.L slumping 31 percent, Royal Bank of
Scotland (RBS.L) losing 11 percent and Fortis FOR.BR down 18.4
percent.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - It's getting lonely on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns melted down in March and has disappeared inside JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), Merrill Lynch absorbed more than $40 billion in write-downs and rushed into the arms of Bank of America, and Lehman Brothers is being sold for scrap after it declared bankruptcy on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now investors and analysts worry whether even the largest securities firms, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), may be vulnerable as markets lose confidence in the financial foundations on which investment banks are built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you accept that the broker-dealer model is broken -- for now at least -- it does reasonably lead you to question whether Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley can survive. I think that's an increasingly reasonable question to ask," said Les Satlow, a fund manager at Cabot Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts, which manages about $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That uncertainty was reflected as shares of Goldman sank 12 percent and Morgan dropped 14 percent on Monday, the day Lehman filed for bankruptcy and a day after Merrill agreed to be acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Goldman, which is expected on Tuesday to report its worst quarterly results since going public in 1999, it was the stock's biggest one-day drop in eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which has been shedding assets since an embarrassing fourth quarter loss last year, likewise will be under pressure to show its house is in order when it reports results on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: the formula that powered Wall Street profits for most of the past decade -- tapping capital markets for debt that can multiply trading and investment returns -- is now a liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The days of the gun slingers are gone," said Greg Church, president of Church Capital Management in Philadelphia. "Going out to the market, borrowing money and leveraging up is over. Down the road, they'll all be owned by banks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overnight, investors began to pay close attention to leverage, which helps measures how much debt firms use to increase their trading bets, the quality of assets on the balance sheet and the sources of funds used to keep the firms running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after shedding big parts of its mortgage book during the second and third quarter, Lehman still held roughly $80 billion in hard-to-sell property assets that have been falling in value. Gross leverage remained lofty, with total assets that were 21.1 times the size of its stockholders' equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this more hostile environment, where investors will punish companies seemingly flush with cash and capital, Goldman and Morgan Stanley may also feel pressure to merge with a big deposit-rich bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These companies also probably thought, not too long ago, that a crisis of confidence couldn't happen to them. Recent events demonstrate no rational presumptions can be made simply based on fundamentals," Fox-Pitt, Kelton analyst David Trone said. "These two will look at potential commercial bank partners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUST FINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most analysts and investors stress they do not expect Goldman and Morgan to melt down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS analyst Glenn Schorr said Goldman and Morgan have less concentrated risk positions than Lehman or Merrill, relative to their equity; deeper pools of ready cash and more reliable sources of funding. Goldman and Morgan also have valuable asset management and private wealth advisory businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman for example held risky "problem" assets that were 4 times the size of its tangible equity, Schorr said. Morgan Stanley's risk asset ratio was 1.7 times equity and Goldman's ratio was closer to 1.4 times equity, by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Big Two also have done better jobs spreading bets across markets and countries. Lehman still derived the majority of its profit from mortgage securities, despite years of banking and equities expansion, while Merrill dove into mortgages and leveraged lending just as these markets peaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman and Morgan Stanley are more diversified, much less leveraged and have negotiated these risk issues more soundly," said Timothy Ghriskey, head of Solaris Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surviving firms are also likely to gain more business with the competition thinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, even successful investment banks may take another look at joining forces with a commercial bank to gain access to deposits, a more reliable funding source in bad times. Federal regulators, meanwhile, are expected to introduce more restrictive, bank-like regulation for investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No less an authority than Ken Lewis, Bank of America's CEO, forecast more consolidation among banks and brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For seven years, I've said that the commercial banks would eventually own the investment banks because of funding issues. I still think that," Lewis said on Monday on a conference call to discuss the Merrill acquisition. "The Golden era of investment banking is over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to reflect Goldman results)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures hit
session lows on Tuesday after Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N)
reported quarterly earnings and investors worried whether
insurer American International Group (AIG.N) would be able to
secure fresh capital after credit agency downgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc2 fell 17 points and were below fair

interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Peter Starck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRANKFURT, Sept 16 (Reuters) - European shares fell to their
lowest level in more than three years by midday on Tuesday with
financials leading the way amid ongoing uncertainty about the
fate of U.S. financial institutions, notably insurer AIG
(AIG.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interbank lending rates jumped, with overnight dollar Libor
rates fixed at 6.4375 percent compared with 3.10625 on Monday,
hurting bank stocks further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heavyweight energy and mining shares also lost ground as
prices for crude oil and metals fell amid worries that the
financial crisis would hurt economic growth, reducing demand for
commodities and hence revenue and earnings for sector companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 1140 GMT, the FTSEurofirst .FTEU3 index of leading
European shares was down 2.7 percent at 1,089.40 points, having
earlier hit 1,088.40 points, its lowest since May 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European benchmark index lost 3.6 percent on Monday
after Lehman Brothers LEH.P filed for bankruptcy protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The troubles faced by Lehman, Wall Street bank Merrill Lynch
MER.N, which is being taken over by Bank of America (BAC.N),
and American International Group -- under pressure as credit
rating agencies downgraded its debt -- weighed heavily on
European financials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It increases the uncertainty and that is poison for the
markets," said Dennis Nacken, capital markets analyst at Allianz
Global Investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European banks .SX7P fell 5.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in HBOS HBOS.L fell 32 percent, Dutch-Belgian
financial group Fortis FOR.AS was down 14 percent, UBS
(UBSN.VX) lost 13 percent and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L)
dropped 12.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The capital ratios of many banks are already very tight and
an additional 1-2 billion euro loss from a Lehman line might
push certain banks into rights issue territory again," Dresdner
Kleinwort said in a note, which did not single out any bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Very few banks have disclosed detailed exposures to Lehman
and, faced with uncertainty, investors have sold the sector in
block," Dresdner Kleinwort said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FC Investments said speculation was building about which
institutions would be the next to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Markets are increasingly concerned about the stability of
the financial system," FC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; British bank Barclays (BARC.L) was down 7.9 percent after
confirming it was in talks about a possible acquisition of
certain Lehman assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG EXPOSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among insurers, which fell 4.5 percent on the DJ Stoxx
European sector index .SXIP, Swiss Re RUKN.VX fell 13
percent after a spokesman declined to comment on the company's
AIG exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; German insurer Allianz (ALVG.DE) shed 5.3 percent and French
rival AXA (AXAF.PA) sank 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miners suffered as metals prices fell. Anglo American
(AAL.L), Rio Tinto RIO.l and BHP Billiton (BLT.L) dropped
between 4 and 6.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy shares tumbled after the price of crude oil CLc1
fell to $91 a barrel. BP (BP.L) slid 3 percent, Total (TOTF.PA)
lost 3.2 percent and ENI (ENI.MI) shed 3.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But airlines gained from the fall in oil prices, with
British Airways BAY.L up 1.9 percent and Lufthansa (LHAG.DE)
up 2.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recruiter Adecco (ADEN.VX) was 2.6 percent higher after
saying it would not go ahead with a bid for UK rival Michael
Page (MPI.L), which was down 26 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE, Germany's DAX .GDAXI and
France's CAC 40 .FCHI were down between 1.9 and 3.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later in the session, U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) will report third-quarter results, and the U.S. Federal
Reserve announces its rate decision at 1815 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a serious danger that what so far has been defined
as a credit squeeze may turn out to be a credit slump as even
more stringent credit terms are applied by banks," Commerzbank
said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This will prevent the U.S. economy from recovering quickly,
and growth will remain depressed well into 2009. The Fed may
respond with a rate cut today but that is far from a done deal,"
Commerzbank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Henk Potts, strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers, said
expectations of a Fed rate cut had increased dramatically in the
last few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If rates are cut, you could argue both ways. The optimists
will say it shows the Fed will use every weapon in their armoury
to help the markets. The pessimists will say it shows
desperation, and it's a sign of how weak the economy is."

        completed mergers and acquisitions for the calendar
        year-to-date. (2)

   --  Securities Services produced its second best quarterly net

   "This was a challenging quarter as we saw a marked decrease in
client activity and declining asset valuations," said Lloyd C.
Blankfein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Despite the
deteriorating market conditions, the focus of our people and strength
and breadth of our client franchise produced a solid performance in a
tough environment. We remain well-positioned to meet the needs of our

   Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.29 billion, 40% lower
than the third quarter of 2007 and 23% lower than the second quarter
of 2008.

   Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $619 million, 56% lower
than a particularly strong third quarter of 2007, primarily reflecting
a decrease in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net
revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $675 million, 8%
lower than the third quarter of 2007, due to lower net revenues in
equity underwriting, primarily reflecting a decrease in industry-wide
initial public offerings. Net revenues in debt underwriting were
essentially unchanged from the third quarter of 2007. The firm's
investment banking transaction backlog increased during the
quarter. (4)

Trading and Principal Investments
---------------------------------
*T

   Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were
$2.70 billion, 67% lower than the third quarter of 2007 and 52% lower
than the second quarter of 2008.

   Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were
$1.60 billion, 67% lower than a very strong third quarter of 2007,
primarily reflecting particularly weak results in credit products and
mortgages, which were adversely affected by broad-based declines in
asset values. Credit products included very weak results from
investments and a loss of approximately $275 million (including
hedges) related to non-investment-grade credit origination activities.
Mortgages included net losses of approximately $500 million on
residential mortgage loans and securities and approximately
$325 million on commercial mortgage loans and securities. Commodities
produced strong results, which were higher compared with the third
quarter of 2007. Net revenues in currencies and interest rate products
were also strong, although essentially unchanged from the third
quarter of 2007. During the quarter, FICC operated in an environment
generally characterized by wider mortgage and corporate credit
spreads, volatile markets and lower levels of client activity.

   Net revenues in Equities were $1.56 billion, 50% lower than a
particularly strong third quarter of 2007. During the quarter,
Equities operated in a challenging environment characterized by a
significant decline in global equity prices, deleveraging by clients
and generally lower client activity levels towards the end of the
quarter. The decline in net revenues reflected very weak results in
principal strategies. In addition, net revenues in derivatives were
significantly lower than a particularly strong third quarter of 2007.
Commissions were strong, but lower, compared with the third quarter of
2007.

   Principal Investments recorded a net loss of $453 million for the
third quarter of 2008. These results included losses from corporate
and real estate principal investments, partially offset by a
$106 million gain related to the firm's investment in the ordinary
shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC).

Asset Management and Securities Services
----------------------------------------
*T

   Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were
$2.05 billion, 4% higher than the third quarter of 2007 and 5% lower
than the second quarter of 2008.

   Asset Management net revenues were $1.13 billion, 6% lower than
the third quarter of 2007, reflecting lower management and other fees,
as well as lower incentive fees. The decrease in management and other
fees primarily reflected the impact of one fewer week in the firm's
fiscal third quarter of 2008 compared with the third quarter of 2007.
During the quarter, assets under management decreased $32 billion to
$863 billion, due to $25 billion of market depreciation, primarily in
equity assets, and $7 billion of net outflows. Net outflows reflected
outflows in equity and money market assets, partially offset by
inflows in alternative investment and fixed income assets.

   Securities Services net revenues were $916 million, 20% higher
than the third quarter of 2007. The firm's prime brokerage business
continued to generate strong results and customer balances were higher
compared with the third quarter of 2007.


                               Expenses

   Operating expenses were $5.08 billion, 37% lower than the third
quarter of 2007 and 23% lower than the second quarter of 2008.

*T
Compensation and Benefits
-------------------------
*T

   Compensation and benefits expenses were $2.90 billion, 51% lower
than the third quarter of 2007, commensurate with lower net revenues.
The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 48.0% for
the first nine months of 2008, consistent with the first nine months
of 2007. Employment levels increased 3% during the quarter, primarily
reflecting the seasonal timing of school hires.

-0-
*T
Non-Compensation Expenses
-------------------------
*T

   Non-compensation expenses were $2.18 billion, 1% higher than the
third quarter of 2007 and 6% higher than the second quarter of 2008.
Excluding consolidated entities held for investment purposes (5),
non-compensation expenses were 3% lower than the third quarter of
2007, primarily reflecting lower brokerage, clearing, exchange and
distribution fees.

*T
Provision for Taxes
-------------------
*T

   The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2008
was 25.1%, down from 27.7% for the first half of 2008 and down from
34.1% for fiscal year 2007. The decreases in the effective income tax
rate were primarily due to changes in geographic earnings mix and an
increase in permanent benefits as a percentage of lower earnings.


                                Capital

   As of August 29, 2008, total capital was $221.97 billion,
consisting of $45.60 billion in total shareholders' equity (common
shareholders' equity of $42.50 billion and preferred stock of
$3.10 billion) and $176.37 billion in unsecured long-term borrowings.
Book value per common share was $99.30 and tangible book value per
common share (1) was $87.11, each increasing 2% during the quarter.
Book value and tangible book value per common share are based on
common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to
employees with no future service requirements, of 428.0 million at
period end.

   The firm repurchased 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an
average cost per share of $180.07, for a total cost of $271 million
during the quarter. The remaining share authorization under the firm's
existing share repurchase program is 60.9 million shares.

   The firm's Tier 1 Ratio (3) was 11.6% as of August 29, 2008.


               Other Balance Sheet and Liquidity Metrics

   --  Total assets (6) were $1.08 trillion as of August 29, 2008.

   --  Level 3 assets (7), including those for which the firm bears
        no economic exposure, were approximately $68 billion as of
        August 29, 2008 and represented 6% of total assets. Level 3
        assets excluding those for which the firm bears no economic
        exposure (7) were approximately $58 billion as of
        August 29, 2008 and represented 5% of total assets.

   --  Average global core excess (8) liquidity was $102.33 billion
        for the quarter ended August 29, 2008.


                               Dividends

   The Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the
Board) declared a dividend of $0.35 per common share to be paid on
November 24, 2008 to common shareholders of record on
October 27, 2008. The Board also declared dividends of $236.98,
$387.50, $252.78 and $252.78 per share of Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and
Series D Preferred Stock, respectively (represented by depositary
shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred
stock), to be paid on November 10, 2008 to preferred shareholders of
record on October 26, 2008.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
----------------------------------------------------
*T

   This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within
the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not historical
facts but instead represent only the firm's beliefs regarding future
events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and
outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual
results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from
the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these
forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and
important factors that could affect the firm's future results and
financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the
firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 2007 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of
the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 2007.

   Certain of the information regarding the firm's capital ratio,
total assets, level 3 assets and global core excess liquidity consist
of preliminary estimates; these estimates are forward-looking
statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm
completes its quarterly financial statements.

   Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog
also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are
subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be
modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net
revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions
may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected.
Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of
a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the
case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic
conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities
markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer
of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions,
a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate
financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the
transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For
a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect
the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in
Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended November 30, 2007 and "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in
Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended November 30, 2007.

(1) Tangible common shareholders' equity equals total shareholders'
    equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible
    assets, excluding power contracts. Identifiable intangible assets
    associated with power contracts are not deducted from total
    shareholders' equity because, unlike other intangible assets,
    less than 50% of these assets are supported by common
    shareholders' equity. Management believes that return on average
    tangible common shareholders' equity (ROTE) is meaningful because
    it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether
    they were acquired or developed internally. ROTE is computed by
    dividing net earnings (or annualized net earnings for annualized
    ROTE) applicable to common shareholders by average monthly
    tangible common shareholders' equity. Tangible book value per
    common share is computed by dividing tangible common
    shareholders' equity by the number of common shares outstanding,
    including restricted stock units granted to employees with no
    future service requirements. The following table sets forth a
    reconciliation of total shareholders' equity to tangible common
    shareholders' equity:

(3)  The firm is regulated by the SEC as a Consolidated Supervised
     Entity and, as such, is subject to group-wide supervision and
     examination by the SEC and to minimum capital adequacy standards
     on a consolidated basis. The Tier 1 Ratio equals tier 1 capital
     divided by total risk-weighted assets. For a further discussion
     of the firm's Tier 1 Ratio, see "Equity Capital" in Part I, Item
     2 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
     and Results of Operations" in the firm's Quarterly Report on
     Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended May 30, 2008. This ratio
     represents a preliminary estimate as of the date of this
     earnings release and may be revised in the firm's Quarterly
     Report on Form 10-Q for the firm's third fiscal quarter.

(4)  The firm's investment banking transaction backlog represents an
     estimate of the firm's future net revenues from investment
     banking transactions where management believes that future
     revenue realization is more likely than not.

(5)  Consolidated entities held for investment purposes are entities
     that are held strictly for capital appreciation, have a defined
     exit strategy and are engaged in activities that are not closely
     related to the firm's principal businesses. For example, these
     investments include consolidated entities that hold real estate
     assets, such as hotels, but exclude investments in entities that
     primarily hold financial assets. Management believes that it is
     meaningful to review non-compensation expenses excluding
     expenses related to these consolidated entities in order to
     evaluate trends in non-compensation expenses related to the
     firm's principal business activities.

(6)  This amount represents a preliminary estimate as of the date of
     this earnings release and may be revised in the firm's Quarterly
     Report on Form 10-Q for the firm's third fiscal quarter.

(7)  SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," establishes a fair value
     hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
     used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
     priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
     identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the
     lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
     Level 3 assets reflect prices or valuations that require inputs
     that are both significant to the fair value measurement and
     unobservable. Level 3 assets excluding those for which the firm
     bears no economic exposure excludes assets which are financed
     by nonrecourse debt, attributable to minority investors or
     attributable to employee interests in certain consolidated
     funds. For a further discussion of the firm's level 3 assets,
     see "Critical Accounting Policies - Fair Value - Fair Value
     Hierarchy - Level 3" in Part I, Item 2 "Management's Discussion
     and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
     in the firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal
     period ended May 30, 2008. These amounts represent preliminary
     estimates as of the date of this earnings release and may be
     revised in the firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
     firm's third fiscal quarter.

(8)  Global core excess represents a pool of excess liquidity
     consisting of unencumbered, highly liquid securities that may be
     sold or pledged to provide same-day liquidity, as well as
     overnight cash deposits. This liquidity is intended to allow the
     firm to meet immediate obligations without the need to sell
     other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-
     sensitive markets in a difficult funding environment. This
     amount represents the average loan value (the estimated amount
     of cash that would be advanced by counterparties against these
     securities), as well as overnight cash deposits in the global
     core excess. For a further discussion of the firm's global core
     excess liquidity pool, please see "Liquidity and Funding Risk"
     in Part I, Item 2 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
     Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the firm's
     Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended
     May 30, 2008. This amount represents a preliminary estimate as
     of the date of this earnings release and may be revised in the
     firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the firm's third fiscal
     quarter.

(9)  Excludes 4,909, 4,948 and 4,904 employees as of August 29, 2008,
     May 30, 2008 and August 31, 2007, respectively, of consolidated
     entities held for investment purposes. Compensation and benefits
     includes $63 million, $66 million and $40 million for the three
     months ended August 29, 2008, May 30, 2008 and August 31, 2007,
     respectively, attributable to these consolidated entities.

(10) VaR is the potential loss in value of Goldman Sachs' trading
     positions due to adverse market movements over a one-day time
     horizon with a 95% confidence level. The modeling of the risk
     characteristics of the firm's trading positions involves a
     number of assumptions and approximations. While management
     believes that these assumptions and approximations are
     reasonable, there is no standard methodology for estimating VaR,
     and different assumptions and/or approximations could produce
     materially different VaR estimates. For a further discussion of
     the calculation of VaR, see Part II, Item 7A "Quantitative and
     Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in the firm's Annual
     Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007.

(11) Equals the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs
     for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the
     four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated.

(12) Substantially all assets under management are valued as of
     calendar month end. Assets under management do not include the
     firm's investments in funds that it manages.

(13) Represents investments included within the Principal Investments
     component of the firm's Trading and Principal Investments
     segment.

(14) Includes interests of $4.51 billion as of August 29, 2008 held by
     investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs. The fair value of the
     investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, which trade on The
     Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, includes the effect of foreign
     exchange revaluation for which Goldman Sachs maintains an
     economic currency hedge.

(15) Excludes the firm's investment in the convertible preferred stock
     of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. The firm has hedged all
     of the common stock underlying the investment.

&lt;p&gt;MannKind and Pfizer Announce Collaboration for Certain Exubera Patients to Transition to MannKind's Inhaled Insulin Therapy

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


MannKind Corporation (Nasdaq: MNKD) and Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) announced today
that MannKind will transition certain Exubera patients with a continuing need
for inhaled insulin to MannKind's inhaled insulin product, Technosphere(R)
Insulin. Technosphere Insulin is an investigational product that has recently
completed Phase 3 clinical trials.

In October 2007, Pfizer announced that it would stop marketing Exubera (insulin
human (rDNA origin)) Inhalation Powder because it did not meet customers' needs
or Pfizer's financial expectations. Since that time, Exubera patients have been
transitioning to other diabetes therapies, although there remains a small number
of patients with a continuing medical need for inhaled insulin. Pfizer began
discussions with MannKind to give these patients access to Technosphere Insulin.
Pfizer will reimburse some of MannKind's costs relating to the transition of
patients.

According to MannKind's Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Peter Richardson, "For
some Exubera patients, continued treatment with inhaled insulin is needed. These
patients generally fall into two categories: those with severe needle-phobia or
a very poor response to subcutaneous insulin. This small number of patients
represents a group with particularly high medical need who will benefit from
using an inhaled insulin such as Technosphere Insulin."

Hakan Edstrom, MannKind's President and Chief Operating Officer, commented,
"We're pleased to work with Pfizer as we transition these patients and to help
them manage their diabetes."

&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Frost &amp; Sullivan, the Growth Partnership Company, today announced
that IBM Retail Store Solutions has been named winner of the 2008
Point of Sale Green Excellence of the Year award for its outstanding
efforts in energy conservation and its commitment to safeguarding
natural resources. The award cites IBM's "firm sense of environmental
responsibility in developing the highly-innovative SurePOS 700 series
of point of sale systems."

   An important part of IBM's overall "Green Retail Store" portfolio,
the SurePOS 700 system is powered by high-performance,
energy-efficient processors that help customers reduce system energy
consumption by nearly 36 percent. IBM's flagship point-of-sale product
was specifically designed for environmentally-conscious retailers and
includes a built-in power management system and new front-vent airflow
feature that help with power and cooling requirements.

   "Retailers across the world are increasingly aware of the need for
green initiatives," explains Prasanna Prakash, Research Analyst, Frost
&amp; Sullivan. "Retailers as well as their customers are realizing the
adverse effects of technology and its alarming results on the
environment. IBM's SurePOS 700 series squarely addresses this need to
reduce retail systems' energy consumption through its unique design
and increased focus on reducing the total cost of ownership(TCO) of
its customers."

   IBM focused on three main factors when developing this system:
manageability, serviceability, and energy efficiency. These features
help keep total cost of ownership low by reducing service and energy
expenses. Remote installations and maintenance, along with low-power
processors and disposable components, all help drive down potential
expenses that could be incurred by retailers. Other design innovations
include board flex testing, power cycling, and pre-shipment
integration.

   "IBM is honored to receive this recognition from Frost and
Sullivan. We have a long history of social responsibility -- from
implementing IT recycling programs, to developing systems that help

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded PGE Corp
(PCG.N) to "neutral" from "buy," but upgraded Consolidated
Edison Inc (ED.N) to "neutral" from "sell," mainly on
valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also raised Westar Energy Inc (WR.N) to "buy"
from "neutral" and said smaller-cap regulated utilities provide
slightly more upside potential than large-capones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman maintained an "attractive" coverage view on the
U.S. regulated utilities sector, despite recent outperformance
of the shares, saying valuation and earnings growth were
attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The regulated utilities have outperformed the Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX by about 1500 basis points since March,
Goldman noted. This outperformance is expected to continue into
the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009, it
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Multiple company-specific catalysts, including project
approvals for large-scale transmission, environmental and
renewable generation efforts, as well as rate cases and
regulatoryproceedings exist in the coming months, the brokerage
wrote in a note dated Sept. 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP.N)
remained its favorite large-cap regulated utility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised its price target on PGE shares by a
dollar to $43, while lowering its target on Westar stock to $26
from $27. It lifted the price target on Consolidated Edison
shares to $44 from $40.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell on Tuesday as global equities continued their slide amid turmoil in the financial sector, which led losers after a debt downgrade for American International Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FTSEurofirst index of leading European shares was down 1.2 percent at 1,106.09 points, following a 3.6 percent slide on Monday after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection. The index has fallen about 27 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DJ Stoxx European insurer index fell 2.7 percent, led by a 9.7 percent tumble in Swiss Re. Allianz, AXA Prudential and Aviva fell between 3.1 and 3.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underlining the unease among investors in financial stocks, the DJ Stoxx European banks index slid 3.5 percent. HBOS slid 11.3 percent, UBS fell 9.6 percent and Natixis lost 8.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a smell of cordite in the air. It's like the day after the explosion. People are still extremely nervous. They're wondering what happens next," said Justin Urquhart Stewart, investment director at Seven Investment Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors are looking at what other companies have weak balance sheets. Now we need a bit of leadership from the central banks and the regulators," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil shares fell after another drop in the price of crude, now trading below $93 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP, Total and ENI were between 1.6 and 2.5 percent lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miners also suffered, as copper and gold prices fell. Anglo American, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton dropped between 3.7 and 4.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airlines gained from a $2.8 per barrel fall in the crude price, with British Airways up 3.1 percent and Lufthansa up 2.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recruiter Adecco was 1.5 percent higher after saying it would not go ahead with a bid for UK rival Michael Page, which was down 28.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 were down between 1.5 and 2.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares pared losses after Germany's ZEW economic sentiment index indicator came in stronger than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FED, GOLDMAN WATCHED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve announces its rate decision at 1815 GMT. Fed fund futures point to an 86 percent chance of a 25-basis point rate cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Expectations of a rate cut have increased dramatically in the last few days, with most people now expecting a cut, though we still think rates will be held," said Henk Potts, strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If rates are cut, you could argue both ways. The optimists will say it shows the Fed will use every weapon in their armory to help the markets. The pessimists will say it shows desperation, and it's a sign of how weak the economy is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokyo's Nikkei share average dropped nearly 5 percent to its lowest level in three years. Markets in Japan, South Korea, China and Hong Kong had been closed on Monday, and quickly followed the sell-off in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK shares remained lower after the Office for National Statistics said inflation rose to 4.7 percent in August, from 4.4 percent in July. This reduces the chances of a cut in interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lafarge and Holcim were 1.4 and 2.9 percent higher respectively on rumors they would merge. Both companies declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will report third-quarter earnings later in the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've managed to dodge the sub-prime bullets so far. What will be perhaps most interesting is what they say about trading going forward," said Potts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Rory Channing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IronDoor 3.5 makes it simple and affordable for over 100 million
    licensed SharePoint users to access Microsoft SharePoint Server
             without opening the SharePoint Firewall Port
MOUNT LAUREL, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
WorldExtend(R), a leading provider of remote data and application
access software, today announced that its IronDoor(TM) 3.5 remote
network access software is uniquely positioned to make it simple for
over 100 million licensed Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) SharePoint Server
users to significantly enhance system security. As the only non-VPN
solution to enable users to access Microsoft SharePoint Server without
opening any inbound firewall ports, IronDoor 3.5 eliminates the high
costs and technical hurdles associated with a VPN - making secure
access to SharePoint a cost-effective reality for any organization.

   Thanks to WorldExtend's 0-Port (Zero-Port) technology, which
guarantees there are no open inbound firewall ports, IronDoor 3.5
ensures that organizations do not have to sacrifice network security

   "With over 100 million SharePoint licenses sold and over 2,250
SharePoint integration partners, security is becoming a major
concern," said Steven Landau, CEO, WorldExtend, LLC. "IronDoor 3.5
makes it simple and affordable to eliminate the security risk
associated with intruders gaining access via an open firewall port,
and as a result, IronDoor 3.5 enables organizations to benefit from
all the advantages of Microsoft's ingenious server without having to
worry about weakening system security," Landau continued. "The user
simply logs on to the WorldExtend portal, clicks on the SharePoint
Tunnel icon (to establish the secure tunnel), and then clicks on the
SharePoint Web link...it's as easy as that."

   Delivered via an extremely-simple and intuitive wizard-driven
download that requires no dedicated hardware or dedicated IT
resources, IronDoor 3.5 makes it easy for any organization to enjoy
the increased business agility and productivity gains of remote access

&lt;p&gt; * U.S. stock index futures mixed at 0938 GMT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * AIG troubles fuel fears over embattled financial sector&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Eyes on Goldman earnings, Fed rate decision and statement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Blaise Robinson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PARIS, Sept 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were
mixed early on Tuesday following Monday's sharp drop, ahead of
the Fed's rate decision and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) results, and as
AIG's (AIG.N) woes rattled markets worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 0938 GMT, SP 500 futures SPc2 were down 0.1 percent,
Dow Jones futures DJc2 were up 0.1 percent and Nasdaq 100
futures NDc2 were up 0.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street on Monday had its worst day since markets
reopened after the September 11 attacks in 2001, on rising
worries over the financial system's stability after Lehman
Brothers Holdings LEH.N filed for bankruptcy protection and
insurer AIG struggled for survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG, which received a $20 billion lifeline from New York
state, came under renewed pressure on Tuesday as ratings
agencies downgraded the insurer's debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in AIG traded in Frankfurt (AIG.F) were down 10
percent. The stock plunged nearly 61 percent on Monday in New
York and the U.S. Federal Reserve hired investment bank Morgan
Stanley (MS.N) to review options for the firm, a person familiar
with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG's ratings downgrade could force it to post more
collateral and nullify insurance contracts, possibly setting in
motion a chain reaction that could threaten its survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The problems in the financial market will hit the real
economy, whose prospects are already quite negative," said Emiel
van den Heiligenberg, Head, Asset Allocation  Balanced Mandates
at Fortis Investments, in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Federal Reserve seems likely to stop short of
lowering interest rates when it announces its decision on
Tuesday, but could signal a willingness to do so soon as it
seeks to calm financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through last week, markets had seen almost no chance of a
rate cut at Tuesday's policy-setting meeting. However, Lehman's
downfall and troubles at AIG raised hopes of a rate cut, with
Fed fund futures on Tuesday implying as much as a 92 percent
chance of a cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Van den Heiligenberg, however, said that the Fed's decision
was difficult to predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a very tight call for the Fed. We think it's going to
be "no move", but if they do anything, I would guess they will
go for a 50 basis-point cut to send a signal that they are ready
to support the market in the current turmoil," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That would trigger a relief rally on the market, but given
the economic fundamentals, we think that the relief will be
temporary and that stocks will drift lower again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The central bank's decision is due at 1815 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Macroeconomic data expected on Tuesday includes consumer
price inflation figures for August, which are expected to show a
monthly fall of 0.1 percent, led primarily by sinking energy
prices, and an annual rise of 5.5 percent. Excluding food and
energy, analysts polled by Reuters expected a monthly rise of
0.2 percent, and an annual rise of 2.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors were also bracing for quarterly results from
Goldman Sachs, expected on Tuesday, for insight on the Wall
Street firm's exposure to risky assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A sharp drop in commodity prices could also weigh on shares
of energy and mining companies. Oil fell over 4 percent to a
seven-month low on rising fears that the turmoil in the
financial market would spread to the global economy.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, share price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 16 (Reuters) - JP Morgan cut downgraded Big Lots Inc
(BIG.N) to "neutral" from "overweight" on valuation and said
the retailer will find it difficult to deliver the kind of
earnings growth expected from it in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although we believe that Big Lots likely has enough
earnings power in its model to exceed its second half earnings
guidance, we think that buyside expectations already reflect
the upside potential," analyst Charles Grom said in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Big Lots has exceeded Street expectations over the past 10
quarters, said Grom, adding that it runs the risk of becoming a
'victim of its own success' if it does not deliver similar
earnings upside over the next two quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grom said although the company had reported good August
same-store sales, this trend was unlikely to improve given Big
Lots product mix, deceleration in retail sales across the board
post Back-to-school and high unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looking ahead to 2009, it will be a challenge for the
company to exceed market expectations given tougher comparisons
and diminishing administrative cost saving opportunities, said
Grom.     Shares of Columbus, Ohio-based Big Lots closed at
$31.56 Monday on New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Arup Roychoudhury in Bangalore; Editing by

&lt;p&gt;Sept 16 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded
vehicle control systems maker Wabco Holdings Inc (WBC.N) to
"neutral" from "overweight", citing a faster-than-expected
slowing European truck market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We remain concerned about a lack of near-term catalysts to
move the stock higher in the face of increasingly negative
sentiment in its key European truck end market," said the
brokerage in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rationale behind the decline has been that customers
continue to wait on the original equipment manufacturers to
work through long backlogs before placing additional orders,
the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, we believe it is possible that order growth may
not rebound as much as expected even when backlogs come down,"
JP Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The stock did not gain traction following a strong second
quarter and we doubt the cycle has been discounted prior to any
bad news, which looks like its coming," it added.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 16 (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch  Co MER.N explored
selling a minority stake to Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) at
the weekend before deciding on its $50 billion takeover by Bank
of America Corp (BAC.N), the Wall Street Journal said, citing
people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman was interested in Merrill's wealth-management
business, according to a person close to the firm, the Journal
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill's strategy head and former Goldman executive, Peter
Kraus, talked with Goldman about a possible sale on Saturday and
early Sunday, two of the people said, according to the
newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Journal said Merrill President Gregory Fleming and other
supporters of a takeover by Bank of America urged Kraus and
Merrill Chief Executive John Thain, who previously worked at
Goldman, to pursue the bank deal, according to a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fleming and others argued that the sale of as little as 9.9
percent of the firm to Goldman might not be enough to ease the
situation, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
Goldman was not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill executives also discussed a possible merger with
Morgan Stanley (MS.N) briefly, but this did not lead to
anything, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill sold itself to Bank of America on Monday, a
tumultuous day in financial markets that also saw the largest
U.S. bankruptcy as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.P filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after failing to find a
buyer over the weekend.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Anxious investors hacked away at Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) on Wednesday, sending shares of the two largest investment banks lower and boosting their debt-insurance prices higher amid rising fears over their ability to survive a deepening financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stronger-than-expected earnings from Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley Tuesday failed to reassure investors who staged a run on Bear Stearns in March and drove Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.P into bankruptcy Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And despite assurances from Goldman and Morgan Stanley -- the two remaining major investment banks -- that they had ample cash and capital, investors fled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley shares sank 42 percent, below the depths reached during the 1998 Asia debt crisis and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management a decade ago. Goldman stock dropped as much as 26 percent to a three-year low. This year, Goldman shares have tumbled 53 percent, while Morgan's are down by two-thirds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's very clear to me -- we're in the midst of a market controlled by fear and rumors, and short sellers are driving our stock down," Morgan Stanley Chief Executive John Mack told employees in a memo obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no rational basis for the movements in our stock or credit default spreads."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More ominously, investors bid up the price of protecting against a default by the banks, indicating concern that Wall Street's biggest companies are at risk and may seek some measure of safety by merging with a commercial bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley bonds also fell, with some issues trading at distressed levels. Its 6 percent notes due in 2015 traded at 61 cents on the dollar, down from 94 cents a week ago, and yield 12.25 percentage points over Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The credit crunch and credit contraction is intensifying," said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak  Co in New York. "The action in Morgan Stanley in light of what were better-than-expected numbers last night is disconcerting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS FAIL TO UPLIFT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday evening, Morgan Stanley rushed to release quarterly results, a day ahead of schedule, after investors sent its shares reeling 11 percent and increased debt-default insurance costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan out-earned larger Goldman, which posted a 70 percent decline in profit but exceeded expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the same panic that pushed Lehman into bankruptcy Monday and prompted Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N to agree to a merger with Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) over the weekend weighed on Goldman and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reported great earnings. But the thing is, it doesn't matter," said William Smith, president of Smith Asset Management in New York. "You'll see Morgan Stanley owned by a bank this weekend. You won't see them fail, but you could see more shotgun marriages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of analysts argue that investment banks, which tap capital markets to fund their business, need to combine with commercial banks and their stable pools of deposits to avoid a Lehman-like collapse when markets turn jittery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are also punishing investment banks because their extensive use of leverage -- piling up debt to boost trading and investment returns -- puts them at risk when markets tumble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar and Morgan CFO Colm Kelleher both said their companies performed very well despite unprecedented turmoil. They also contended they do not want or need to merge with a commercial bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think the markets will positively differentiate those financial institutions that have global, diversified business models and that outperformed through his crisis," Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag said. "The issue that really matters is performance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the New York Stock Exchange, Goldman shares were off $21.92, or 16 percent, to $111.30 after falling as low $97.78. Morgan Stanley stock dropped $7.71, or 27 percent, to $20.90, after falling as low as $16.55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOND MARKET PRESSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, many of the same market pressures that weighed on Bear Stearns in March and against Lehman last week are now turned on Morgan Stanley and Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting $10 million of Morgan Stanley debt against default jumped to a point where sellers are demanding buyers make an upfront payment equal to 16 percent of the debt insured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That indicates traders view the company as distressed and at a high risk of default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's credit default swaps earlier traded at an annual cost of $825,000 a year for five years, up $144,000 from Tuesday's close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's swap costs likewise surged, rising by $190,000 to $610,000 a year from Tuesday's close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are looking at this business model and questioning it. They're trying to figure out how they are going to resolve all these problems," said William Larkin, fixed-income manager at Cabot Money Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ellis Mnyandu, Jonathan Spicer, Elinor Comlay, Dan Wilchins and Karen Brettell; Editing by John Wallace, Maureen Bavdek and Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  EATONTOWN, NJ, Sep 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Quintum Technologies, an innovator in VoIP technologies and a subsidiary
of Network Equipment Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: NWK), announced today
that, under an agreement with Microsoft, it has developed a VoIP
T1/E1/PRI gateway and an FXS gateway for digital phone systems that use
Microsoft's Response Point phone system software.

    Response Point offers small and medium businesses the ability to deploy
VoIP throughout their networks with IP PBX telephony advantages usually
enjoyed only by larger enterprises. These features include SIP trunking,
click-to-call functionality for contacts using the Assistant software,
Call Detail Records (CDR), and the ability to select music for parked
calls and hold time. The Response Point systems feature innovative voice
recognition that responds to voice commands. This feature allows
employees to call people within the company without dialing, verbally
access contacts from Outlook and voicemail, as well as transfer calls.
Outside callers can simply state with whom they would like to speak.

    Quintum will release two Response Point Gateways that are compatible with
all of the IP telephone systems based on Response Point. The digital
gateway will support a T1, E1 or PRI connection, and the analog gateway
will support up to 4 FXS ports. These gateways have been specifically
designed to work with any Response Point based IP telephony system. The
Quintum Response Point gateways allow you to set up your system in a
matter of minutes. When installing the analog gateway, the Response Point
application configures the gateway for you. When installing a T1 or E1
Gateway, the Response Point customized configuration wizard will step you
through the process for simple set up.

    "Small businesses want PBX functionality without the PBX complication and
cost," said Xuedong Huang, general manager of Microsoft Response Point.
"Quintum's Response Point Gateways will allow businesses to easily deploy
the Response Point system via a T1, E1 or PRI connection."

    "Quintum recognizes that all sizes of companies need to support and
maximize the investment in their existing organization infrastructure,
particularly in this economy," said Chuck Rutledge, Vice President of
Marketing for NET/Quintum. "We are very excited about working closely
with Microsoft to meet the needs of Response Point customers."

    "Quintum's gateways are a perfect complement to D-Link's VoiceCenter IP
Phone System," said Brian Nickell, Product Manager of D-Link. "Response
Point customers will be pleasantly surprised at the ease with which they
can be installed and how quickly their new phone systems will be up and
running."

    Syspine's Digital Operator Phone System is an all-in-one communications
solution which, when coupled with Quintum's latest technology, will give
businesses even more flexibility in connecting voice to the network. "We
think Quintum is right on the mark. On top of the analog and SIP trunk
capability we currently offer with the Syspine solution, the
custom-designed Quintum VoIP T1/E1/PRI gateway adds digital trunk
capability any small or medium business could deploy," said Syspine's
Director, Robert Gordon.

    Quintum has created a microsite in which all new Response Point
information can be found. The microsite can be found at:

"The action in Morgan Stanley in light of what were better-than-expected numbers last night is disconcerting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS FAIL TO UPLIFT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday evening, Morgan Stanley rushed to release quarterly results, a day ahead of schedule, after investors sent its shares reeling 11 percent and increased debt-default insurance costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan out-earned larger Goldman, which posted a 70 percent decline in profit but exceeded expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the same panic that pushed Lehman into bankruptcy Monday and prompted Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N to agree to a merger with Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) over the weekend weighed on Goldman and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reported great earnings. But the thing is, it doesn't matter," said William Smith, president of Smith Asset Management in New York. "You'll see Morgan Stanley owned by a bank this weekend. You won't see them fail, but you could see more shotgun marriages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of analysts argue that investment banks, which tap capital markets to fund their business, need to combine with commercial banks and their stable pools of deposits to avoid a Lehman-like collapse when markets turn jittery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are also punishing investment banks because their extensive use of leverage -- piling up debt to boost trading and investment returns -- puts them at risk when markets tumble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar and Morgan CFO Colm Kelleher both said their companies performed very well despite unprecedented turmoil. They also contended they do not want or need to merge with a commercial bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think the markets will positively differentiate those financial institutions that have global, diversified business models and that outperformed through his crisis," Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag said. "The issue that really matters is performance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the New York Stock Exchange, Goldman shares were off $21.92, or 16 percent, to $111.30 after falling as low $97.78. Morgan Stanley stock dropped $7.71, or 27 percent, to $20.90, after falling as low as $16.55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOND MARKET PRESSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, many of the same market pressures that weighed on Bear Stearns in March and against Lehman last week are now turned on Morgan Stanley and Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting $10 million of Morgan Stanley debt against default jumped to a point where sellers are demanding buyers make an upfront payment equal to 16 percent of the debt insured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That indicates traders view the company as distressed and at a high risk of default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's credit default swaps earlier traded at an annual cost of $825,000 a year for five years, up $144,000 from Tuesday's close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's swap costs likewise surged, rising by $190,000 to $610,000 a year from Tuesday's close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are looking at this business model and questioning it. They're trying to figure out how they are going to resolve all these problems," said William Larkin, fixed-income manager at Cabot Money Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ellis Mnyandu, Jonathan Spicer, Elinor Comlay, Dan Wilchins and Karen Brettell; Editing by John Wallace, Maureen Bavdek and Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft UK DCOE Uses Shunra Virtual Enterprise WAN Emulation for Deployment Solution Demonstrations and Proof of Concept Workshops

      Microsoft's UK Deployment Centre of Excellence extends its
     capabilities with Shunra, addressing the real world scenarios
                   customers face during deployment.
PHILADELPHIA--(Business Wire)--
Shunra Software, the global leader in WAN emulation technology,
today announced that the Microsoft UK Deployment Centre of Excellence
(DCOE) has adopted Shunra VE as their central WAN emulation solution,
expanding its proof of concept capabilities to customers. Using
Shunra, the DCOE is now able to address the real world scenarios its
customers face by applying a replica of the customer's actual wide
area network to the testing phase, enabling customers to understand
the exact end user experience before rollout.

   The Microsoft UK DCOE is a dedicated resource which provides
workshop style sessions for customers and partners to review their
current deployment processes, short and longer term application
performance goals, deployment blockers, perceived deployment issues
and then relate these to the 'art of the possible', Microsoft
deployment's best practices and infrastructure roadmap. The DCOE
environment provides the facilities to demonstrate deployment
solutions delivering client and server operating systems plus
applications, configuration and user data and setting migration. The
DCOE utilises diverse hardware types to replicate the sort of real
world challenges faced by customers and partners.

   The DCOE, going through an 'environment refresh,' needed to extend
its capabilities to provide demonstrations of solutions which
addressed the real world scenarios customers were facing, including:
deployment and management of applications in branch and remote
environments; network impairments; and reduced bandwidth and
resources. These constraints introduce unique technical and support
challenges for customers and the Centre identified this as a core
requirement in their new environment design.

   The DCOE chose Shunra VE as their core WAN emulation tool. Not
only does Shunra meet their original design requirements, but the
advanced reporting and market proven accuracy delivers a number of
additional testing opportunities.

   "The Shunra STN forms a fundamental component of our new DCOE
environment. It allows us to provide predefined demonstrations which
accurately reflect head office and branch type scenarios and differing
variations on deployment and management based around these, as per our
original intentions," said Keith Baker, security and management
deployment specialist, Microsoft UK. "In addition to this core
functionality, we are able to use some of the Shunra VE advanced
capabilities to offer more specific proof of concept work replicating
a customer's actual environment by recording the physical network
characteristics at the customer location and then replaying this and
recreating the client environment within the DCOE."

   Currently, Shunra Software is the only company to provide both
hardware and software WAN emulation solutions with market-leading best
practices for application development and performance testing.
Increased demand for consistent and reliable enterprise application
performance drives customers like the DCOE to fully incorporate Shunra
VE into their testing processes.

   "We worked closely with the Microsoft Deployment Centre of
Excellence to provide a flexible platform to quickly emulate their
customer's network environments which in turn provides end-users the
ability to deploy the diverse set of Microsoft products faster and
more reliably to meet the high level of quality of experience that
Microsoft's customers are accustomed to," said Ben Boulnois Shunra VP
EMEA.

   "Shunra VE has not only allowed us to meet our original aims, but
has presented the possibility for the DCOE effectiveness to be greatly
enhanced for future engagements," concluded Keith.

&lt;p&gt;IBM and Mentor Graphics to Develop 22nm Computational Lithography Solution for the Integrated Circuit Industry

ARMONK, N.Y. &amp; WILSONVILLE, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Mentor Graphics Corporation (Nasdaq: MENT)
today announced an agreement to jointly develop and distribute
next-generation computational lithography (CL) software solutions to
enhance the imaging capability of lithographic systems used in the
manufacturing of integrated circuits at the 22 nanometer (nm) node and
beyond. The agreement is part of IBM's computation scaling initiative
to create the industry's first computationally based process for
production of 22nm semiconductors, also announced today.

   "The industry faces a critical challenge at 22nm, where
traditional approaches to device scaling are no longer feasible due to
the laws of physics," said Gary Patton, vice president of IBM's
Microelectronics Division. "Instead, we have to look to computational
scaling solutions to take us to the next couple of process nodes.
We're extremely excited about this unique partnership, which will
allow us to deliver IBM's preeminence in lithography process
technology, algorithms, and high performance computing through the
proven, market-leading Calibre(R) nmPlatform. In the coming weeks IBM
will have more to say about our plans and strategies regarding a
comprehensive computational scaling (CS) ecosystem to support our
strategy for computational scaling for 22nm, which we announced
earlier today."

   "This partnership is the continuation of a successful relationship
that has been in place since IBM and Mentor first started working
together on model-based optical proximity correction (OPC) solutions
for the 130nm node, and extends the collaboration we both described
last February
(http://www.mentor.com/company/news/calibrenmopccellbeibm) around the
Cell Broadband Engine(TM) processor," said Joseph Sawicki, vice
president and general manager of the Design to Silicon Division at
Mentor Graphics. "We've moved beyond the typical EDA customer-supplier
relationship to a true joint R effort that will result in great
benefits for our customers--not just the ability to successfully image
critical features for the 22nm node, but also innovative solutions to
manage turnaround time and cost of computing, which are extremely
important to our customers' overall success."

   Joint development work will take place at Mentor's San Jose, IBM's
East Fishkill and IBM Research's Yorktown locations. IBM and Mentor
Graphics will develop unique methods and software, utilizing advanced
mathematical techniques and software architectures, to achieve
enhanced computational lithography capabilities enabling 22nm
manufacturing.

   About Computational Lithography

   Today, most integrated circuits are manufactured at 45nm or larger
technology nodes. Producing circuits at 22nm is a challenging
milestone in developing smaller, more powerful, more energy efficient
microprocessors and system-on-chip (SoC) ICs that can be used in
advanced computer servers, laptop, cell phones, and consumer
electronics. However, current lithography methods--the process of
designing photomasks to image circuit patterns on silicon wafers in
mass quantity--are not adequate for critical layers at 22nm due to
fundamental physical limitations.

   Computational lithography is a method of overcoming limitations in
the manufacturing process by using computationally intensive numerical
methods to modify the shape of the masks and characteristics of the
illuminating source at each layer of an IC in such a way that the
result after exposure is closer to the intended shapes. One popular CL
technique is optical proximity correction (OPC), which is a key
element of IBM's overall computational scaling initiative.

 (Adds quotes, Goldman comment; updates share prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jack Reerink and Douwe Miedema&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Shares of Wall Street
firms Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs plummeted on Wednesday
and Britain's biggest mortgage lender looked set to be sold in
the latest signs of extreme distress in the financial industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tuesday's surprise $85 billion rescue of insurer American
International Group (AIG.N) by the U.S. Federal Reserve did
little to calm investors' nerves, and U.S. stocks dropped as
much as 3.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fed move capped a week of bailouts, a bankruptcy on
Wall Street, and central banks around the world flooding the
financial system with money to prevent it from seizing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result: a seismic shift in the financial industry, with
some of Wall Street's biggest names disappearing overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The fear is who is next," said John O'Brien, senior vice
president at MKM Partners LLC in Cleveland. "It almost feels
like people scour the books and say who is the next likely
target that we can put a short on. And that spreads continuous
fear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and larger rival Goldman
(GS.N) fell as much as 43 percent and 27 percent, respectively,
even after both reported better-than-expected quarterly
earnings on Tuesday. [ID:nN16266672]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm assuming that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are
lining up dancing partners. They don't want to be ... this
week's victim," said William Larkin, fixed income manager at
Cabot Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cost of protecting the investment banks' debt spiked,
reflecting investor fears that their debt issues are no safer
than junk bonds. Both are currently rated investment grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The credit crunch and credit contraction is intensifying,"
said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak  Co in
New York. "The action in Morgan Stanley in light of what was
better-than-expected numbers last night is disconcerting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag said, "We think the
markets will positively differentiate those financial
institutions that have global, diversified business models and
that outperformed through this crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Jeanmarie McFadden declined
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PROPPING UP THE SYSTEM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the latest sign of regulatory anxiety, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission tightened enforcement of
rules against abusive short-selling, or investor bets on
declining share prices. [ID:nN17527485]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Seems like the SEC is a day late on the rule ... Morgan
Stanley is clearly in the short sellers' sights," said Andrew
Brenner, senior vice president at MF Global in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other distress signals had popped up earlier: The cost of
borrowing overnight dollars spiked above 10 percent, indicating
a deep lack of trust spooking the inter-bank lending market in
Europe. [ID:nLG518337]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Bank of Ireland (BKIR.I) became the latest bank to cut
its dividend, causing a sell-off in Irish banking shares.
[ID:nLH684053]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; British bank Lloyds TSB (LLOY.L) was in advanced talks to
buy domestic rival HBOS Plc HBOS.L to create a 28 billion
pound ($50 billion) mortgage giant. [ID:nLH437309]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The talks underscore how quickly authorities around the
world are ditching long-held beliefs about free markets and
competition as they seek to counter the credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lloyds, for example, was previously blocked from buying a
smaller mortgage bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then there was the shock British government decision in
February take over troubled bank Northern Rock -- the first
major nationalization in Britain since the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. authorities also have moved to prop up the financial
system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The AIG rescue comes just over a week after the bailout of
mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac
FRE.N, and six months after the Fed brokered the sale of
failed investment bank Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG's bailout brings to about $900 billion the total of
U.S. rescue efforts to stabilize the financial system and
housing market. [ID:nN161263] Authorities may get much of that
money back -- if asset prices don't slide further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The week has already seen two legendary firms bite the
dust: Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N filed for
bankruptcy, and Merrill Lynch  Co MER.N threw itself into
the arms of Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; British bank Barclays Plc (BARC.L) gave Wall Street a small
boost on Tuesday by agreeing to buy Lehman's Manhattan
headquarters and investment bank for $1.75 billion and taking
aboard 10,000 staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; YARD SALE AT AIG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG's newly appointed chief, former Allstate Corp (ALL.N)
CEO Edward Liddy, was poised to hold a big yard sale to pay off
the Fed loan. There are plenty of interested bidders, AIG's
main regulator told business television channel CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG, which has businesses ranging from life insurance to
airplane leasing in 130 countries, has a big incentive to raise
cash: It is currently paying more than 11.4 percent interest on
the $85 billion loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japan's cash-rich insurers and Australia's top player, QBE
Insurance (QBE.AX), are seen as potential buyers.
[ID:nHKG137039]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Its a no-brainer," said CLSA analyst Yuin Lim in Hong
Kong. "If you have a non-growing mature market, excessive
capital, you have a big war chest there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG faced a cash crunch after $18 billion of losses over
three quarters, largely because of complex securities that are
tied to mortgages, and which plunged in value as the U.S.
housing crisis deepened. The rescue kept AIG from surpassing
Lehman as the largest corporate failure ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it was meant to prevent a deepening of the credit crisis
or sooth investors, it didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The system will remain unstable and fragile," the chief
executive of top bond fund Pimco, Mohamed El-Erian, told
Reuters. "Further action will be required that targets both,
and I stress both, institutions and the system as a whole.
Otherwise, and as has been repeatedly the case in this crisis,
seemingly bold policy actions will turn out to be too little,
too late."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
In response to ever increasing demands for smaller, more powerful and
energy-efficient devices for cloud computing and high-performance
servers, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the semiconductor industry's
first computationally based process for production of next generation
22nm semiconductors. Known as Computational Scaling (CS) -- a process
that enables the production of complex, powerful and energy-efficient
semiconductors at 22nms and beyond -- this new initiative will feature
support from several of IBM's key partners initially including Mentor
Graphics and Toppan Printing.

    Today, most integrated circuits are manufactured at 45nm or larger
technology nodes. Producing circuits at 22nm is a challenging milestone
since current lithography methods -- the process of designing photomasks
to image circuit patterns on silicon wafers in mass quantity -- are not
adequate for critical layers at 22nm due to fundamental physical
limitations. Computational Scaling overcomes these limitations by using
mathematical techniques to modify the shape of the masks and
characteristics of the illuminating source at each layer of an integrated
circuit.

    This initiative directly links to IBM's Cloud Computing strategy, which
offers highly scalable, more energy efficient Web services. Through cloud
computing, enterprises and individuals can access these services in a
highly flexible and open environment. As demand for these services grows,
more powerful and flexible servers based upon advanced technologies will
be required.

    "The traditional scaling approach is optical-resolution centric," said
Gary Patton, vice president, IBM Semiconductor Research and Development
Center. "IBM's Computational Scaling approach is centered on advanced
mathematical techniques encapsulated in software tools that use high
performance computing systems. This technique also makes technology
complexity transparent to the designer and maximizes flexibility through
integrated flows and automation."

    IBM's CS solution is an ecosystem that includes the following components:
a new resolution enhancement technique (RET) that uses source-mask
optimization (SMO); virtual silicon processing with TCAD; predictive
process modeling; design-rule generation and corresponding models; design
tooling; design enablement; complex illumination; variance control; and
mask fabrication, along with necessary partnerships.

    The strategy of combining the strengths of industry leading partners for
CS will leverage IBM's core strengths in successful management of
innovative partnerships, semiconductor processing, high performance
computing, IC design, design tooling and system integration.

    The individual components of IBM's CS solution include:

    Source Mask Optimization

    IBM has partnered with Mentor Graphics on a new resolution enhancement
technique to enable cost-effective printing of two dimensional patterns
for the 22nm semiconductor technology generation. This new technology,
know as source mask optimization, will provide a means to minimize the
use of double patterning by employing highly customized sources with
optimized mask shapes.

    "Our partnership with IBM will ensure production-ready technologies are in
place when they are needed for the 22nm node," said Joseph Sawicki, vice
president and general manager for the design-to-silicon division at Mentor
Graphics. "Because this next generation solution will be built on the
familiar Calibre platform, designers will see a smooth transition path to
22nm, and will also enjoy added benefits in managing turnaround time and
the cost of computing."

    Virtual Fabricator

    Together with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the State of New York,
IBM has made significant investments in the area of high performance
computing and remains devoted to the advancement of semiconductor
technology through the establishment of the Computational Center for
Nanotechnology Innovations (CCNI). CCNI provides the unprecedented
computational power to enable accurate predictions of advanced
manufacturing processes. When combined with predictive models and TCAD,
this platform will allow virtual co-optimization of semiconductor unit
processes and critical circuit design elements to cut development learning
cycles and improve time-to-market for advanced semiconductor technology.

    Design Technology Co-Optimization

    Within semiconductor fabrication, design 'rules' are created as an
abstract representation of the information or model that describes the
technology being created. Often, these rules are only defined after an
exhaustive negotiation process between the technology and design team. To
improve the timeliness and certainty of this process, IBM's Design
Technology Co-optimization (DTCO) process helps integrate and automate
this complex procedure, cutting the time it takes to reach a clear and
stable set of rules for use by the circuit design teams.

    Design Enablement Tools

    As a result of using IBM's DTCO, a semiconductor modeling process will
have a new class of design rules that are simpler and more prescriptive
(what to do vs. what not to do). Working with engineering design
automation (EDA) suppliers, IBM will be providing new design enablement
solutions for a seamless transition.

    Critical Dimension Variance Control

    Working with leading equipment suppliers, IBM will play the role of lead
integrator of providing an adaptive control system to minimize critical
dimension variance. As a result production yield and circuit parameters
will be more stable reducing the cost of production.

    Photomask Fabrication

    To address the gap in raw optical resolution, aggressive resolution
enhancement techniques such as SMO drive unprecedented minimum feature
sizes on the photomask -- the opaque plate with holes or transparencies
that allow light to shine through in a defined guide for casting the
circuit patterns. IBM has partnered with Toppan to ensure timely
availability of masks with the required feature sizes.

    "It has been more than three years since Toppan and IBM launched our joint
development project for advanced photomask process," said Toshiro Masuda,
managing director and head of Semiconductor Solutions Division of Toppan
Printing. "We believe our ongoing engineering collaboration will
significantly enhance the success of IBM's computational scaling
solution."

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 17 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded
Tupperware Brands Corp (TUP.N) to "neutral" from "overweight,"
saying a strong U.S. dollar and economic softness in
international markets might weigh on results, sending its
shares down more than 13 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given Tupperware's high international exposure at 92
percent of profits, a strong U.S. dollar will result in
significant negative currency translation, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Bottom line, after sharply exceeding consensus EPS over
the last two years, we think international risk factors could
drive negative EPS revisions over the next few quarters,"
analyst Dara Mohsenian wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International risk for the company, whose food storage
containers are sold at in-home parties, is heightened by its
high emerging markets exposure and volatile trends in emerging
markets, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has presence in the United States, Europe and
Asia-Pacific regions and gets the bulk of its revenue from
Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said there is less upside left in the stock
given strong 20.7 percent year-to-date outperformance in 2008
and 65.4 percent out-performance versus the SP 500 since the
beginning of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan recommended "overweight"-rated Newell Rubbermaid
Inc (NWL.N) instead of Tupperware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tupperware's shares touched a low of $29.51 before paring
some losses to trade down $4.17 at $29.96 Wednesday morning on
the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Toronto-based rating agency
DBRS on Wednesday lowered its outlook on Morgan Stanley and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc ratings to 'negative' from 'stable' and
said the events of the past week and turmoil in global
financial markets could batter their earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; DBRS confirmed its current ratings on the firms -- a rating
of "AA", the second-highest investment grade, for the senior
debt of both companies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The negative trend reflects the impact of the sustained
disruptions in the financial markets, unprecedented recent
market events and the weakening of economies around the world
at a time of increased concern over inflation," chief credit
officer Roger Lister said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These events have resulted in diminished investor
confidence, increased volatility in asset prices, lower client
activity, increased risk aversion and higher funding costs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman (GS.N) and Morgan (MS.N) earnings are likely to
come under pressure in the near term. The companies are also
facing increased skepticism from investors about the outlook
for the stand-alone broker-dealer business model following the
recent problems suffered by their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman Brothers on Monday filed for bankruptcy after
suffering huge losses on mortgage-related assets, while Merrill
Lynch was acquired by Bank of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the constraints on the use of bank deposits for
funding capital markets activities, DBRS does not view access
to deposits as a replacement for solid financial results," said
Lister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the two firms continue to enjoy a strong franchise
and solid credit fundamentals, "irrational exuberance has
turned into excessive fear," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If earnings remain positive until markets normalize, the
ratings trend will revert back to stable," he said. "However,
any quarterly losses that are not offset by capital raises
would likely result in negative rating pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cost of protecting Morgan Stanley and Goldman debt with
credit default swaps rose on Wednesday, reflecting investor
uncertainty about the financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Five-year CDS on Morgan Stanley rose by 40 basis points to
796 basis points, or $796,000 a year to protect $10 million of
debt. Goldman CDS rose 16 basis points to 462 basis points,
according to data from CMA Datavision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley's CDS are trading as though it were rated
deep in junk territory at "B2," according to data from Moody's
Investors Service's credit strategy group. That is 10 steps
below its actual rating of "A1."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's swaps were trading as though it were rated "Ba3,"
a junk level that is nine steps below its actual rating of
"Aa3," Moody's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ciara Linnane; Additional reporting by Dena

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Trikona Capital Ltd., the leading fund management firm for

Trikona strengthened the partnership with a $150 million deal and
realized a gain of 115%. The proceeds from all three transactions
total approximately $300 million to earn an average return of 117%.

   "We are very pleased to have successfully completed the third
stage of our portfolio sales to SachsenFonds. Our most significant
deal with Sachsen to date, this agreement further illustrates the
strength of our relationship, as well as our robust business model,"
said Aashish Kalra, Co-founder and Managing Director. "Despite
challenging market conditions, we have consistently earned over 100%
return on our strategic investments, demonstrating our execution
capability in India and confirming our ability to create significant
value for our shareholders."

   As part of the $156 million deal, SachsenFonds and Trikona will
invest more than $70 million in four new projects focused on
infrastructure development in India.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Several Wall Street analysts cut their fiscal 2008 earnings outlook on Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) citing difficult market conditions, even as they see the investment bank as the best positioned player in the financial services sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As they say, you can not make apple sauce if you do not have an apple. In Goldman's case, you cannot have strong earnings in a market that provides few opportunities," veteran banking analyst Richard Bove said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman on Tuesday posted a 70 percent drop in quarterly profit, its biggest earnings decline since it went public in 1999. It, however, beat profit expectations and has so far survived the credit turmoil better than its peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite lower third-quarter results and a challenging near-term outlook, Goldman is still in a "power position" within the financial services industry, Douglas Sipkin, analyst at Wachovia Capital Markets, said. He upgraded the stock to "outperform" from "market perform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banc of America Securities' Michael Hecht, however, said Goldman's results show that even the largest U.S. investment bank is not immune from cyclical challenges the industry is facing. He forecast 2008 earnings of $11.90 for Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hecht's estimate is the lowest yet among Wall Street analysts, who expect Goldman to post 2008 earnings in the range of $11.90 a share to $14.13, down from their prior forecast of $12.45 a share to $15.53.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although GS continues to outperform peers and valuations may seem attractive, we remain cautious on brokers as they battle, in our opinion, a protracted period of negative operating leverage," Oppenheimer  Co analyst Meredith Whitney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's third-quarter net income fell to $845 million, or $1.81 a share, for the fiscal quarter ended August 29, from $2.85 billion, or $6.13, a year earlier, as one of the worst market slumps ever weighed on banking and trading results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results upset investors and came during a week in which Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N filed for bankruptcy, and Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N agreed to sell itself to Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Morgan Stanley, Sanford C. Bernstein, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, UBS, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and SP Equity Research also turned more downbeat on Goldman's outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman were down about 10 percent at $120 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Anxious investors continued to hack away at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc Wednesday, sending the two largest investment banks' shares lower and boosting default-insurance prices higher amid lingering worries about their ability to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early trade, shares of Morgan Stanley sank 13 percent to their lowest level in a decade, while Goldman Sachs fell 8 percent to a three-year low. So far this year, Goldman shares have fallen by 43 percent and Morgan's have lost half their value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More distressing was the rise in the cost of protecting against a default in debt issued by the banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting $10 million of Morgan debt against default for five years rose to $796,000 a year, up $40,000, according to CMA DataVision. Insurance policies on the debt, known as credit default swaps, were trading as though the firm were rated deep in junk territory at "B2" by Moody's, or 10 steps below its actual rating of "A1."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of Goldman debt default insurance rose to $462,000 a year, up $16,000, trading as if the firm were rated "Ba3," nine steps below its actual "Aa3" rating at Moody's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two remaining major Wall Street investment banks posted better-than-expected third-quarter results on Tuesday, but the news was not enough to slow the spreading fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The credit crunch and credit contraction is intensifying," said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak  Co in New York. "The action in Morgan Stanley in light of what was better-than-expected numbers last night is disconcerting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley on Tuesday rushed to release its quarterly results after investors pushed its shares down 11 percent and led to widening swap spreads. Morgan out-earned the larger Goldman, which also exceeded analysts' expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives from both firms insisted their businesses remain vibrant and have performed well in unprecedented turmoil. Both argued they do not want or need to merge with a commercial bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet contraction in the capital markets has convinced some analysts that investment banks need to combine with big deposit-rich banks so they can tap pools of deposits for funding when debt and stock markets grow jittery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the same panic that pushed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc into bankruptcy and prompted Merrill Lynch  Co to seek a merger with Bank of America Corp continues to weigh on Goldman and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Dena Aubin and Ellis Mnyandu; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARY, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Today, New York-based Pfizer, the world's largest research-based
biomedical and pharmaceutical company, was accredited with the CEO
Cancer Gold Standard(TM) certification, recognizing the company's
commitment to the health of their employees and family members by
certifying their efforts to meet an exceptionally high standard of
cancer prevention, screening and care guidelines. In doing so, Pfizer
becomes the twenty-fourth organization that has demonstrated exemplary
effort to prevent cancer in the workplace and achieved Gold Standard
accreditation.

   William C. Weldon, chairman and chief executive officer of Johnson

health professionals.

   "Adopting the Gold Standard is a tribute to Pfizer's standing as a
global health leader and their commitment to helping us win the battle
against cancer," said Weldon.

   The CEO Cancer Gold Standard(TM), calls for companies to evaluate
their benefits and culture and take extensive, concrete actions in
five key areas of health and wellness to fight cancer in the
workplace. To earn Gold Standard accreditation, a company must
establish programs to reduce cancer risk by discouraging tobacco use
and encouraging physical activity, healthy diet and nutrition; detect
cancer at its earliest stages; and provide access to quality care,
including the availability of clinical trials.

   The most recent President's Cancer Panel report, "Promoting
Healthy Lifestyles: Policy, Program, and Personal Recommendations for
Reducing Cancer Risk," identified the CEO Cancer Gold Standard(TM) as
an initiative that is helping reverse negative, unhealthy lifestyle
trends and creating hope in the fight against cancer for America's
workers and their families.

encouraging its widespread adoption in workplaces across the country.

&lt;p&gt;  AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS, Sep 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Dutch Ministry of Defense and IBM (NYSE: IBM) have signed an
agreement to streamline maintenance and logistics processes within the
Royal Navy and to set up a centralized armed forces data management
system. IBM will be working with Stork Asset Management Solutions and
Ordina on the implementation.

    The agreement is part of the Ministry of Defense's SPEER program -- the

    The agreement for the Royal Navy includes streamlining and integrating the
maintenance and logistics processes on ships and within the Navy's
operations, based on a reference process model, and a SAP kernel developed
by the Defense Department. During this business transformation project,
organizational changes, the introduction of new work processes and SAP
implementation will be done simultaneously.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 17 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded Annaly
Capital Management (NLY.N) to "overweight" from "neutral" on
valuation and said the asset management firm was a prime
beneficiary of the recent nationalization of
government-sponsored enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Agency mortgage-backed securities have rallied
significantly since last Monday as the U.S. government has now
explicitly guaranteed the full payment of principal and
interest to bondholders," the brokerage said in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based on JP Morgan's evaluation, Annaly's bonds are priced
to yield more than 18 percent next year and recommended
investors to buy the stock given the ample yield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also said it was clear that the Federal
Reserve is unlikely to raise rates at any point this year, and
may even cut if market turmoil continues, which benefits
Annaly's funding cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's stock was trading up about 3 percent at
$15.18 before the bell. It closed at $14.76 Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 17 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities started coverage
of upscale retailer Saks Inc SKS.N with an "underweight"
rating, partly due to cloudy same-store sales outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Both the strengthening dollar and material job losses on
Wall Street over the past six months could crimp sales at Saks'
flagship New York City store, which has been a source of
strength up until recently," JP Morgan wrote in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said it expects the Saks Fifth Avenue stores
operator's sales at stores open at least a year to be flat, on
average, through 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $10.83 Tuesday on the New

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The two largest U.S. investment banks, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), reported lower quarterly profits, but beat expectations on Tuesday even as the worst market slump in decades rattled Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the largest securities firm, said third quarter earnings fell 70 percent on weaker-than-expected revenues, knocking its shares to nearly three-year lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, No. 2 Morgan Stanley, which reported a day ahead of schedule after U.S. markets closed, trounced expectations paced by one-time gains, robust equity and commodities trading results and record prime brokerage fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan's earnings fell 3 percent even as the year-old credit crunch slowed deal activity and created one of the toughest trading environments in decades. Its shares fell 11 percent on Tuesday in regular trading, though they pared most of those losses in electronic trading after New York markets closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares also climbed after the bell, up 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Between Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, we are getting some modest positive news in what has been an otherwise dark five-day period," said Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment officer of Fifth Third Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results come a day after No. 4 investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.P filed for bankruptcy, swamped by mortgage losses. No. 3 broker Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N meanwhile rushed into the arms of Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) to avoid a similar fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These moves had prompted questions about the viability of investment banks. Several analysts predicted these firms would merge with commercial banks, which can tap pools of deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Morgan Stanley and Goldman dismissed those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not the business model. It's performance that matters," said Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar. "We've been able to compete just fine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley CFO Colm Kelleher also played down the need to merge with a deposit-taking bank: "I'm very confident about the business model, he told Reuters in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's quarter was marked by sharply lower banking, trading and investment results. It was the investment bank's biggest earnings decline since it went public in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still it beat expectations, despite $1.1 billion in write-downs and losses from principal investments. Some investors said Goldman deserved credit for reporting any profit at all when rivals go bust or bleed red ink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For them to perform in this manner, in this environment, is nothing short of heroic," said Holland  Co Chairman Michael Holland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's investment banking revenue dropped 40 percent amid a dearth of deals. Debt trading revenue fell by two-thirds, primarily on weak credit and mortgage markets, while equities trading revenue fell by one-half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest quarter included $1.1 billion in losses on corporate loans, residential and commercial mortgages, and $453 million of principal investment losses, showing the downside of making aggressive bets with house money. Asset management revenue fell 6 percent as clients withdrew a net $7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People were hoping for some good news in a sea of gloom and I don't think they got it," said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager at Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said Goldman beat expectations because it paid unusually low taxes, an effective rate of 12 percent compared with 34 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORGAN RESULTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan easily out-earned its archrival and generated a higher return on equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is great news for the whole financial sector," said Marshall Front, chairman at Front Barnett Associates. "I think the key to this whole thing was that they looked better than Goldman Sachs' earnings earlier in the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results included a $745 million one-time gain from its sales of MSCI Inc MXB.N stock and $1.4 billion of gains recorded because the credit spreads on its own debt widened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the banking and trading division posted strong results, wealth management results and asset management results both fell. The ranks of brokers grew, rising 2 percent to 8,500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan also absorbed nearly $1.1 billion of losses and charges from mortgage trades, investments, leveraged buyout loans and repurchase of illiquid auction rate securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year banks and brokers have recorded more than $500 billion in write-downs as the mortgage crunch expanded into a sprawling crisis that continues to claim new and larger victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman acknowledged its earnings follow the global economy and that conditions will remain challenging. The company said it is increasing capital and cash while shedding risky assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've become even more cautious in our approach," Viniar told reporters. "There's a lot of fear in the marketplace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay, Dan Wilchins and Jennifer Ablan; Editing by John Wallace, Maureen Bavdek, Jeffrey Benkoe, Gary Hill, Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background, updates prices)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs, until now the
most bullish bank on oil prices, slashed its average 2009 U.S.
crude oil forecast by $25 to $123 a barrel on Wednesday after
this summer's price surge tapped the brakes on demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We stand by our bullish view on oil, but just think it
will now take longer to get to our previous price targets," the
bank's commodity research team said in a note to clients dated
Sept. 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "...The overshoot in June and July increased the forward
price elasticity of demand (making demand more price sensitive)
and restrained economic activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also cut its three-month forecast to $115 a barrel
from $149, and its six-month target to $125 a barrel from $142.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This week's turmoil in the U.S. financial system -- led by
the collapse of Lehman Brothers LEH.P -- sent global markets
into free fall early this week, with oil tumbling to a
seven-month low as investors fled to safe-haven assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, U.S. crude futures for October delivery
CLc1 rebounded $2.76 a barrel to $93.91 by 0822 GMT after two
days of spiralling lower, as an $85 billion bailout of American
International Group sparked a relief rally on Wall Street.
[O/R]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prices have slumped from a record high above $147 in July
and are now little changed from the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market has overshot to the downside and is now
substantially oversold as ... financial concerns, scepticism,
and real and perceived demand weakness (have) pushed prices
below the long-term economics of the petroleum industry," it
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While maintaining a bullish stance for oil, Goldman's
analysts led by Jeffrey Currie said prices could drop to $75 a
barrel in the event of a global recession, which it viewed as
relatively unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, given the tight inventory situation and high
price volatility, should shortages develop this autumn ... we
believe that the market could spike $10 to $15 a barrel higher
than our targets," it also said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's previous $148 forecast for 2009 was the highest
in a Reuters poll of more than 30 analysts late last month. The
new target of $123 still puts it above that poll's mean of
$113.21 a barrel, but in line with long-term fellow bull
Barclays. [O/POLL]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street bank joins a growing list of investment
banks, including BNP Paribas and Credit Suisse as well as
Lehman Brothers, who have cut some of their oil price
forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cut by Goldman's commodities analysts comes just days
after the bank's energy equity analyst Arjun Murti left his
forecast for oil prices unchanged but added at the time prices
could fall below $100 a barrel in the event of a global
recession. [ID:nL8680408]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murti was one of the first analysts to predict several
years ago that crude would hit $100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs cut its price targets for
a number of European energy companies, including BP Plc (BP.L),
Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) and ENI SpA (ENI.MI).

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 17 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded
European telecoms sector to "overweight" from "neutral," but
cut its rating on the staples sector to "neutral" from
"overweight" as a part of its European equity strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The ability to pass through input costs enabled them
(staples) to maintain high margins over the past two years.
However, this inflation appears to be rolling over, which is
likely to hurt the sector's relative prospects," said the
brokerage in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said staples appeared to be at peak pricing power
with the high food inflation rates and expected the rollover in
general inflation rates to help the telecom sector's
valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Telecoms offer nearly double the dividend yield of
Staples," said the brokerage noted that earnings revisions for
telecoms have been positive over the past few months, while
that of staples were deteriorating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan upgraded OTE (OTEr.AT) to "overweight" from
"neutral". It also raised Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) and Telecom
Italia (savings shares) (TLITn.MI) to "neutral" from
"underweight".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan's top picks in the telecoms sector were Vodafone
(VOD.L), Deutsche Telecom (DTEGn.DE), KPN (KPN.AS), Telecom
Austria (TELA.VI) and Belgacom (BCOM.BR).

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hanwha Group has hired investment bank JPMorgan (JPM.N) to sell a 9.9 percent stake in its Korea Life insurance unit, sources said on Wednesday, in a deal that could value the unit at more than $7.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affinity Equity, Carlyle Group and MBK Partners are among several private equity firms interested in the stake, which is targeting $500 million to $750 million from foreign investors, sources with direct knowledge of the deal told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanwha has previously laid out plans to publicly list the life insurance company. A minority stake from a foreign investor would not only help give Korea Life a pre-IPO valuation, but would raise cash for Hanwha's bid for a stake in Daewoo Shipbuilding  Marine Engineering (042660.KS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Daewoo Shipbuilding deal is expected to fetch up to $8 billion. Hanwha's ability to finance a bid is seen as relatively weak compared to its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have a firm plan for such a deal yet," Ju Cheol-beom, a Hanwha Group spokesman, said, referring to the Korea Life stake sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sources involved in the process said that private equity firms are already poring over bid-related documents in an auction that will likely kick off in the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the process has focused on foreign private equity firms because the size of the stake on offer. A more than $500 million equity check would fit well with the kind of cash big buyout firms are willing to pay in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With financing markets hit by the deepening global credit crunch, a private equity firm would probably have to pay all cash for a Korea Life stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is something private equity firms are typically loathe to do, but finding big-ticket deals in Asia with strong growth prospects is something major private equity players are struggling with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affinity, an Asia focused private equity firm, has a successful track record in South Korea. It was among the investors that bought South Korean electronics chain Hi-Mart in 2005 for $833 million, which later sold for more than $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Group has a long standing presence in Asia, and has invested in the insurance sector in the region before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MBK Partners, founded by a former Carlyle member, is a South Korea-based private equity firm, with investments in three domestic companies according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three are among the firms interested in the Korea Life stake, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlyle and JPMorgan declined to comment. Affinity and MBK did not return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conglomerate Hanwha Group said last month it had cleared all hurdles to the Korea Life IPO after the insurance company cleaned up accumulated losses as the end of April, adding that it would kick off the offering process as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanwha Group, led by chemical and trading company Hanwha Corp (000880.KS), runs businesses ranging from construction to petrochemical production (009830.KS) and stockbroking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (003530.KS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Rhee So-eui in Seoul, Editing by Jonathan Hopfner)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More Expensive Than Gold, Cocaine, or Heroin -- New Class Of Hydroponics Hormones Pushing Outer Fringes of Plant Science For Bigger Yielding Crops

   Advanced Nutrients Testing Astronomically-Priced Plant Growth
Regulators
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
A Seattle-based international hydroponics nutrients company is
conducting innovative hydroponics plant science research with ultra
expensive auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins and other plant growth
substances.

   According to hydroponics experts Evegeniy Stefanov Yordanov,
Michael Straumietis, and Robert Charles Higgins, teams of Advanced
Nutrients plant scientists are testing exclusive hormones and other
innovative substances that control plant flowering, root growth, and
plant health.

   Michael Straumietis, Robert C. Higgins and Eugene Stefanov
Yordanov are described by colleagues as the world's number one
authorities on hydroponics and bigger hydroponics yields.

   The trio founded Advanced Nutrients, which manufactures and
distributes highly-respected hydroponics nutrients products in 41
countries worldwide.

   "Some of these hormones cost almost $500,000 USD per gram, of
course, at that price we didn't produce a whole gram. For instance,
right now we have discovered a part of a Gibberellin chain that
stimulates profuse flower production that initially cost $19,000 USD
per gram to make.

   "We have got the cost down to $1,000 USD right now and will be
able to mass produce this hormone for $40.00 USD per gram and at that
point it will be commercially viable for high value crops," says
Michael Straumietis. "What we're learning about hydroponics plant
growth and yield is worth the research dollars we're investing."

   According to company co-founder Robert C. Higgins, Advanced
Nutrients scientists on two continents are unlocking the mysteries and
secrets of hydroponics plant metabolism, root formation, and flower
development using high-value hormones that other hydroponics companies
can never obtain.

   "Our chemists are creating experimental synthetic and naturally
derived hormones never before used which create unprecedented growth
that turn plants into super-powered machines," says Robert C. Higgins.

   Advanced Nutrients co-founder Evegeniy Stefanov Yordanov outlined
some of the specific research findings that he and his colleagues are
so excited about.

   "Our researchers are using these new classes of hormones to create
bushier plants with superior lateral branching and others that promote
very fast and abundant rooting in cuttings," Yordanov explains.
"They're finding handcrafted gibberellins that control when and how
successfully plants flower. And there are designer cytokinins that
create huge lateral buds and keep buds flowering in peak bloom
longer."

   Michael Straumietis says his company's plant scientists are
accumulating reams of proprietary data about how auxins, gibberellins,
cytokinins and other plant growth compounds control the inner workings
of plant cell replication, flowering and vigor.

   "At first, we winced when the chemists would come to us for a
teeny-tiny vial of plant hormone and ask us for tens of thousands of
dollars to produce it," Michael Straumietis explains. "But when our
scientists proved how these costly new forms of auxins, gibberellins,
cytokinins and other plant growth compounds totally revolutionize our
understanding and control of all major plant functions, we realized
that all the money we're spending is obviously worth it. With some of
these substances, you can easily more than double your harvest in some
crops!"

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


J.P. Morgan, a full-service provider of cash management, trade finance, and
treasury solutions, today introduced its Asia offshore clearing capability
designed to expedite the time it takes to process payments from initiation to
settlement. This new capability addresses the global trading needs of the bank's
financial institution partners and their customers, allowing them to keep
liquidity in the region, clear in multiple regional infrastructures, concentrate
their accounts and benefit from same-day finality.

J.P. Morgan has leveraged its U.S. dollar clearing leadership and infrastructure
to integrate with all independent in-country and regional offshore clearing
capabilities across major financial centers in Asia. J.P. Morgan's Asia offshore
clearing services streamline workflow by reducing cover payments and improving
operational efficiency. Transactions are cleared within the trading and clearing
times of the local currency, allowing banking clients to receive same-day
payment finality within Asian markets, so they can put funds to use within the
same time zone.

"In the past, clearing U.S. dollars out of Asia took a minimum of two days,
costing businesses valuable opportunities to maximize their liquidity," said
Greg Murray, U.S. Dollar Clearing product executive for J.P. Morgan Treasury
Services. "With our new offshore clearing capability, J.P. Morgan has improved
business processes by removing time zone challenges. Our clients can now make
same day payments to beneficiary banks and expedite U.S. dollar payments."

J.P. Morgan allows client banks to access a larger regional banking network for
inter-Asia payments, as well as to all formal USD settlement systems (FED and
CHIPS). In addition to faster turnaround and greater efficiency in liquidity
management, clients benefit from better account consolidation and cash
concentration, centralized credit management and simplified funding
arrangements. No additional software or features are required to take advantage
of these capabilities.

"As the leader in U.S. dollar clearing, J.P. Morgan has brought its global
reach, regional expertise and considerable resources to bear in ensuring that
client banks can take advantage of the tremendous offshore clearing growth in
Asia, and around the world," said Murray. "Our market-leading payment services
make it possible for client banks to improve service to their customers, while
reducing payment expenses."

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Hanwha Group has hired
investment bank JPMorgan (JPM.N) to sell a 9.9 percent stake in
its Korea Life insurance unit, sources said on Wednesday, in a
deal that could value the unit at more than $7.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Affinity Equity, Carlyle Group and MBK Partners are among
several private equity firms interested in the stake, which is
targeting $500 million to $750 million from foreign investors,
sources with direct knowledge of the deal told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hanwha has previous plans in place to publicly list Korea
Life. A minority stake from a foreign investor would not only
help give Korea Life a pre-IPO valuation, but would raise cash
for Hanwha's bid for a stake in Daewoo Shipbuilding  Marine
Engineering (042660.KS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      (Reporting by Michael Flaherty, Editing by Jonathan

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve
intervened aggressively to shore up the U.S. financial system
this week, providing at least $87 billion to help underpin
trades with units of bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc,
court documents show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Fed's action is the latest sign of how U.S. authorities
have been seeking to prop up financial markets following the
failure of Lehman LEH.P and as big insurer American 
International Group (AIG.N) fights for survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the government had pledged not to fund a rescue of
Lehman, the disclosure on Tuesday showed that authorities were
taking other financial steps to prevent markets from descending
into chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) advanced $87 billion to the 
units on Monday to help clear and facilitate securities
transactions with customers and clients of Lehman "to avoid
disruption of financial markets," according to documents filed
in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New
York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman and the New York Fed had requested the advance,
known as a "commencement date advance" and the New York Fed
repaid it, according to filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In effect, the New York Fed lent the funds to the units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A representative for the New York Fed declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This expansion of the Fed's credit program is
unprecedented," said David Pauker, a managing director with
restructuring adviser Goldin Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It should provide the liquidity necessary to facilitate
the sale of Lehman's core brokerage and banking business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In court on Tuesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck said
he would provide a "comfort order" for JPMorgan, allowing it to
continue providing the advances to Lehman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harold Novikoff, a lawyer for JPMorgan, told the court that
the firm has regularly provided these advances for Lehman to
facilitate its trading, but was typically paid back by other
parties who would step in overnight to repay JPMorgan. However,
some of those third parties have disappeared since Lehman's
bankruptcy, filing necessitating the intervention from the Fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A representative for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
said in court that services provided by JPMorgan were
"integral" to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we stop, the broker dealer stops. It's that simple,"
Novikoff told reporters after the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman had provided JPMorgan with $17 billion in collateral
for the advancing services prior to the bankruptcy filing,
Lehman's lawyer Shai Weisman told the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale of Lehman's broker-dealer business appeared closer
on Tuesday, as a source said Britain's Barclays  (BARC.L) had
agreed to buy Lehman's core broker-dealer business for about $2
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman's holding company filed for bankruptcy in the early
hours of Monday, in the largest U.S. bankruptcy ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Lehman's broker-dealer units are not covered under
the filing, customers typically unwind trades with a dealer
whose holding company is bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, at the request of Lehman and the New York Fed,
JPMorgan advanced $51 billion to Lehman as part of a so-called
second-day advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Court documents did not specify whether the New York Fed
would repay the second amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan may elect to advance additional money to Lehman
units as part of a "post-petition advance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All post-petition advances are guaranteed by Lehman and
collateralized, according to the documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy is taking the restructuring
industry into uncharted waters," Pauker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Chelsea Emery, Dan Wilchins, and Emily Chasan

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Sep 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced new software to help businesses take
advantage of the surge in new mainframe software applications and the
growing momentum behind enterprise mashups.

    Driven by the popularity of running Linux on the mainframe, the growth of
the System z client base in emerging markets such as China, India and
Brazil, and strong utilization of specialty engines, the total number of
commercially-available mainframe software applications now adds up to more
than 4,000.

    With today's announcement, IBM is making it easier for clients to consider
the mainframe first when deciding which platform to run new computing
workloads. The new software, based on open standards, allow businesses to
more easily develop, deploy and manage mainframe applications and mashups
using the same programming skills and management tools they are accustomed
to for distributed computing environments and contemporary Web
applications.

    "New mainframe mashup software allows clients to merge news feeds, maps,
traffic conditions and other data streams with enterprise content and
services," said Dr. Kristof Kloeckner, vice president of strategy and
technology, IBM Software Group. "We're helping clients tap enterprise data
on a mainframe for fresh, exciting Web 2.0 applications."

    The new products also help both existing and new mainframe customers to
differentiate themselves from their competition. For example, the world's
top 50 banks and 22 of the top 25 U.S. retailers running on System z can
use the mainframe to provide proven, revenue-generating capabilities such
as:

    Better online store or Web experiences, featuring consumer mashups that
detail location-specific data; Stronger consumer loyalty from data
mashups that combine similar types of media and information from multiple
sources for enhanced credibility; Increased employee productivity from
business mashups that aggregate data into a single presentation; and
Collaboration between globally-dispersed business and software
development teams using social networking environments based on Web 2.0
technologies.

    The new IBM software products are:

    IBM Rational Asset Analyzer -- available today, it allows project
managers, developers and other users to examine interdependencies between
applications developed for the mainframe or distributed platforms using a
new Web interface. The Web-based user interface reduces the
administration cost of maintaining several client installations, and
makes it easier to scale up to handle hundreds of millions of lines of
code. IBM Rational Asset Analyzer scans the composition of an enterprise
application to help project managers understand how all assets would be
affected by a proposed change to a program. For example, as applications
have evolved over the years they sometimes resemble a tangled web of
"spaghetti code." IBM Rational Asset Analyzer determines how tightly
intertwined an organization's applications are -- given that even the
most knowledgeable developer can't be expected to know all the
interactions in a complex application infrastructure. When linked with
IBM Rational Asset Manager, Rational Asset Analyzer provides a key
governance capability for Service Oriented Architectures.

    IBM Rational Team Concert for System z -- available in the fourth quarter
of 2008, this new software helps geographically-distributed software
delivery teams write, manage and deploy applications on a mainframe. Built
on IBM's Jazz collaborative technology platform, the new software improves
productivity and efficiency by having application developers collaborate
across platforms and technologies, while breaking down geographic or
organizational boundaries. In the future, Rational Team Concert for System
z will integrate with Rational Developer for System z for SOA Construction
-- providing in context collaboration of artifacts, allowing developers to
use the same software and processes for mainframe and distributed
environments.

    IBM Rational Developer for z for SOA Construction -- available in the
fourth quarter of 2008, this new software allows developers to maintain
and extend existing mainframe applications, and integrate those
applications with Web applications. This software exploits the latest Web
technologies, such as Web 2.0 and rich Internet applications, thereby
lowering the learning curve for end-users and helping organizations
become more competitive. Two versions of this offering are available for
either Java experts or users of IBM's Enterprise Generation Language
(EGL) geared towards the novice Web developer who needs to create Web
components, but lacks the necessary skills. The EGL version includes a
Web 2.0 visual builder and full EGL support for all the popular Web 2.0
toolkits, including Google and dojo. This allows customers to embrace Web
2.0 capabilities by creating mainframe mashups linked to back-end
processing from the COBOL and PL/I , CICS, IMS, and Java-based WebSphere
environments.

    IBM WebSphere Portal for System z -- planned to be available in the fourth
quarter, it brings complete Web 2.0 support including the ability to do
mashups. Dubbed IBM WebSphere Portal Enable for z/OS, version 6.1, it is
designed to securely combine information from both the enterprise and the
Web. A portal is a technology for providing external and internal Web
sites which can deliver information, applications and processes to give a
personalized experience to individuals. Organizations in a variety of
industries -- including IBM itself, with its award-winning and secure
intranet used by its 380,000 employees -- have reaped the benefits of IBM
portal software on System z. The expanded Web 2.0 features will help users
be more productive and find information faster. A new live text tagging
feature allows a user to click on text, in context of the business process
being used, and see supporting information related to the job at hand. For
example, a sales representative who clicks on the address of her customer
could see a map with directions appear; or she could click on the name of
a customer and an electronic business card could pop up.

    IBM Tivoli zSecure suite -- available in December, this family of software
helps customers manage mainframe security administration, compliance and
auditing. It is designed to help administer the mainframe security server,
monitor for threats, audit access and configurations and enforce policy
for compliance initiatives. The new release provides several new features,
including the ability to help identify and remove obsolete, unneeded or
out of policy security definitions. This capability, provided through
Tivoli zSecure Admin, helps organizations improve and streamline
company-wide compliance and risk management efforts.

    IBM Tivoli Business Service Manager for z/OS -- available on September 26,
it enables effective decision making by providing businesses with
real-time visibility into the health and performance of critical business
services across mainframe and distributed environments directly from the
z/OS platform with new zLinux operating system support. The new Tivoli
Business Service Manager for z/OS can directly collect event and data
feeds from a wide range of z/OS sources and link together with IBM
monitoring products such as Tivoli Event Pump for z/OS, Tivoli OMEGAMON
XE and Tivoli NetView for z/OS. This can help customers maximize the
power of the mainframe and improve visibility into z/OS health and
performance. Tivoli Business Service Manager for z/OS is a strategic
component of the IBM Tivoli Service Management Center for z, delivering
these benefits, plus greater value when linked with other Tivoli
software, for improved visualization, navigation, security, data
warehouse and reporting.

    IBM Information Management System for System z -- IBM is also announcing
the start of its rigorous beta phase -- or Quality Partnership Program --
for the next version of Information Management System (IMS). The
combination of IMS application and data server software and System z
delivers the performance and reliability required by many of the world's
most demanding business solutions. Building on SOA and XML technologies
introduced in IMS 10, IMS 11 enhances business flexibility with easier
access to the world's highest volume and most reliable applications and
data services. With more than 95% of Fortune 1000 companies using IMS, and
more than 200 Million IMS users per day, integration of IMS services as
part of modern Service Oriented Architectures has already been embraced by
hundreds of IMS clients. IMS 11 will also continue to raise the bar for
availability and performance while reducing the resources needed to manage
the system. The IMS 11 beta program begins immediately, with availability
planned for the fourth quarter of 2009.

    For companies like information services provider Thomson Reuters'
Transaction Services and German banks  HypoVereinsbank Information
Services (HVB IS), member of UniCredit Group and BayernLB, IBM software
is key to delivering and managing mainframe applications in a timely
manner. Other IBM clients also note that these enhancements bring strong
future support for their business.

    "IMS Transaction Manager and Database Manager are our most reliable
front-ends for our highest critical applications. I am excited to hear
about the upcoming new features and functions of IMS 11. This shows IBM's
commitment to a long -- another 40 years -- and successful future for
IMS," said Manuel Gomez, DBA Manager, Confederacion Espanola de Cajas de
Ahorros (CECA), which represents 46 Spanish Savings Banks and provide
services to 96.3% of the population across the entire nation.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Spreading fears of a growing U.S. financial crisis dragged down shares of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and U.S. asset managers on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which tumbled as much as 45 percent lower to $11.85 in midday trading, was off 26 percent in early afternoon trading. Goldman Sachs fell nearly 11 percent to $102.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of trust bank and asset manager State Street Corp slumped 15 percent on concerns of losses in its investment portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Trust Corp fell as much as 32.3 percent, Bank of New York Mellon Corp as much as 34.7 percent and Federated Investors as much as 42.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; INDUSTRY REACTION: ALAN LANCZ, PRESIDENT OF ALAN B. LANCZ  ASSOCIATES INC, AN INVESTMENT ADVISORY FIRM, TOLEDO, OHIO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market hates uncertainty and Morgan Stanley is an uncertain situation. You're not going to have the market moving up anything significant with that uncertainty around."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 ANTHONY CONROY, HEAD TRADER FOR BNY CONVERGEX, AN AFFILIATE OF THE BANK OF NEW YORK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are no safe havens right now. There are so many moving parts and so many variables."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said central banks' efforts to pump money into the markets were helpful, "but fear and greed dictate the short-term market and that's what we are living through right now. There's a lot of anxiety, and anxiety breeds volatility." 
TOM McCROHAN, ANALYST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT LLC, PHILADELPHIA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a combination of factors driving this. There is a spillover of the panic from earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is concern about capital levels at State Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bank of New York is known as a back-office securities processor for the broker-dealer community. It is also a large provider of tri-party repurchase agreements. It has a litany of products it offers broker-dealers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At Northern Trust, the concern may be its money market mutual funds, and its exposure to AIG and Lehman Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's no different from what we're seeing in other financials: shoot first, and ask questions later. There is guilt by association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Custody banks are much more focused on institutional investors and their balance sheets are considered less risky. But when dominoes are falling, portfolio managers are looking for the potential next group to fall, and custody banks have lower capital ratios than other types of banks."

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombians do not like outsiders portraying their country as a cocaine nation, but that's not keeping many from watching a smash local soap opera about their multibillion-dollar narcotics trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Betrayal, murder and the lust for quick riches, while not the stuff of national pride, make for gripping television in "Cartel de los Sapos" (Cartel of the Snitches) about the powerful Norte del Valle drug smuggling organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracing how the cartel supplanted the once-mighty Medellin and Cali gangs, the series is the first to spotlight Colombia's drug lords, their surgically-enhanced girlfriends, violent lackeys and the dirty politicians and police who permit the world's biggest cocaine trade to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The No. 1-rated show is tinged with nostalgia for the early days of cocaine trafficking and the explosion of wealth it brought Colombians willing to use crime to escape the country's rigid class structure and dead-end economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We identify with the story," said Diana Ramirez, 24, a waitress from Cali and fan of the show. "Sure it's ugly and violent, but it also has its charm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The series puts the flamboyant characters of the 1980s and 1990s into historical context and shows how deeply the cartels have corrupted Colombian society, a taboo subject in the popular media until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show accurately points out that many of the founders of the Norte del Valle cartel were former police officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Names are changed and the fun for many viewers is in identifying which characters are based on real-life criminals and their cronies, such as a top fashion model whose trafficker husband was famously chopped into pieces by a rival gang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SAY NICE THINGS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show's success does not mean Colombians would tolerate the same from outsiders. Moviegoers still hiss at foreign films showing the country's cocaine trade and news accounts portraying Colombia as a nest of drug violence are angrily dismissed here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea is that we are allowed to criticize our country, but foreigners are only allowed to observe and say nice things," Bogota-based TV critic Omar Rincon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This idea is typical of Mafia families, not modern democracies," he said. "We remain in an epic state of denial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show premiered in June, days before the United Nations reported that the planting of crops used to make cocaine in Colombia increased 27 percent in 2007. Exports of the drug hover at about 600 tons per year, the United Nations says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country is attracting record investment as its cities and highways grow safer under a U.S.-backed security push. But many rural areas are still controlled by cocaine-funded groups including left-wing rebels fighting a 44-year-old insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focused on a middle-class Colombian named Martin tempted into the drug business by promises of easy cash, the series touches on the story of the country's first cocaine king, Pablo Escobar, whose Medellin cartel was dominant in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes viewers through the war between the Medellin and Cali gangs, which started when a member of one group seduced the girlfriend of a member of the other. At least one character is killed off in every episode as Colombia's best-known actors play its most notorious cocaine personalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not everyone is a fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National police chief Oscar Naranjo, whose brother is in prison on drug charges, says the series unfairly paints Colombian law enforcement as corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who want to change the channel might have trouble finding anything more upbeat. The country's No.2 show is about an accountant who steals the lover of his drug-smuggler boss and enters a witness protection program after testifying against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Patricia Zengerle)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is well-positioned to deal with current market conditions, although not immune to it, as the U.S. investment bank has strong capital ratios, healthy liquidity and manageable levels of problem assets, an analyst at UBS said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We think Goldman is in a much better position to deal with this storm versus where Bear Stearns, Lehman and Merrill were," analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, a crisis of confidence is causing credit default swaps spreads to blow out and stock prices to fall for Goldman and others, Schorr added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst, who met Goldman's chief financial officer, David Viniar, said if push came to shove, Goldman had other options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we don't see any material movement of client balances, we came away pretty confident that management is lining up all viable options and we think there are many financial institutions globally that would love to team up with Goldman in several forms," Schorr wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stronger-than-expected earnings from Goldman and Morgan Stanley Tuesday have failed to reassure investors who staged a run on Bear Stearns in March and drove Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc into bankruptcy Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And despite assurances from Goldman and Morgan Stanley -- the two remaining major investment banks -- that they had ample cash and capital, investors fled, sending their shares lower and boosting their debt-insurance prices higher. The analyst maintained his "neutral" rating and price target of $145 on Goldman stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares were down more than 8 percent at $104.91 before the bell Thursday. They closed at $114.50 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)&lt;/p&gt;

software development and design tools and new collaborative workflow
methodologies. Uniblue are working with Microsoft's WPF platform to
enhance their end users experience as well as improve the visual
performance of their entire solution. If only all companies were this
forward thinking..."

   Uniblue will be utilizing this Microsoft(R) technology in their
future consumer products, and is confident that this development will
add value to customers using their software. Download times will
become much shorter and the installation process will be seamless -

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) outperformed storage software vendors EMC and HP as well
as the overall storage software segment in the second quarter of 2008 on
a rolling four quarter basis, measuring revenue for the named quarter
plus revenue for the prior three quarters, according to new revenue share
data released by IDC[1]. IBM grew storage software revenue more than 14
percent year-over-year on a rolling four quarter basis, nearly three
times the growth rate of EMC and nearly double that of HP, as reported by
IDC.

    According to the IDC report, IBM marked thirteen consecutive quarters of
surpassing the overall storage software segment, which was measured at
nearly 12 percent year-over-year growth, on a rolling four quarter basis.
The worldwide storage software segment experienced its 19th consecutive
quarter of year-over-year growth in the second quarter of 2008 with
revenues of $3.1 billion, according to IDC. This marked the first time
that the worldwide storage software revenue exceeded $3 billion in a
single quarter.

    IBM grew in numerous storage software categories, according to the IDC
report. Among all the vendors measured by IDC, IBM maintained its
long-standing leadership position in the Archive Software category.
Additionally, the IDC report indicated that on a rolling four quarter
basis, IBM outgrew the overall segment in the following categories:
Storage Replication, Storage Management, Storage Infrastructure and
Storage Device Management.

    "Customers are looking to storage software to provide stronger data
protection, retention and recovery capabilities, improved resource
utilization for constrained IT budgets and better energy efficiency," said
Craig Smelser, Vice President, Storage and Security Development, IBM
Tivoli. "To address the explosion of data, IBM provides customers with an
extensive portfolio of storage solutions -- including software, hardware
and services -- to arm them with the tools they need to manage and protect
their data."

    IDC's report highlights IBM's momentum in the storage landscape. Earlier
this week, IBM launched new storage hardware, software and services that
serve as the building blocks for the world's strongest information
infrastructure portfolio.

    "Egypt faces a major opportunity; the seat of one of the world's oldest
civilizations is now an emerging player onto the world stage of a new,
globalized economy," Mr. Palmisano said. "I am impressed and optimistic
about its future because of the way it is nurturing its talent, its human
resources and its technical potential. These initiatives announced today
mark IBM's deep commitment to strengthening that process of growth and
opportunity and extending the long and highly successful partnerships we
have enjoyed in Egypt."

    The Service Delivery Center, IBM's first such center in the region,
initially employs 100 persons and is expected to grow to as many as 1,000
employees within the next few years. It provides a full range of business
consulting, cross-industry expertise, application development and
maintenance, software testing and embedded software development services.

    In addition to clients in the region, the delivery center already is
serving clients in France, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the U.S. because of
the strong language skills found in Egypt and the government's focus on
building IT skills.

    One of the agreements signed today by the Government of Egypt and IBM will
establish a center in Cairo for research and development in nanotechnology
with advanced cooperation between Egyptian and international scientific
teams. Under a second agreement, Egypt and IBM will work together to
introduce Services Science, Management and Engineering (SSME) into the
Egyptian National Curriculum.

    The two agreements are effective immediately and form multi-year strategic
commitments between IBM and the Egyptian Government.

    Dr. Tarek Kamel, Minister of Communications and Information Technology,
praised IBM's plans to increase the number of employees working in the
service global delivery center, which he said will contribute to Egypt's
drive to export more IT services. He said governmental support for the
service delivery center, the nanotechnology center and the SSME curriculum
will advance Egypt's National Agenda for growth.

    "The launch and successful development of a 100-person center that is
expected to grow to eventually employ 1,000 people will result in a
culture that will foster and promote a stronger knowledge-based export
economy for Egypt," Dr. Kamel said. "Nanotechnology is a new and exciting
field for innovation, impacting every industry and has been identified as
the way to position Egypt to become part of the next generation
technological revolution. The SSME curriculum will provide our students
with skills currently in high demand by organizations around the world."

    With the assistance of IBM, the Egyptian nanotechnology research center
will be equipped with leading-edge equipment and lab facilities. Egyptian
scientists and engineers will work side-by-side with IBM scientists and
engineers on advanced nanoscience and nanotechnology programs. The work
will be coordinated with the efforts of IBM Research labs in Zurich,
Switzerland; Almaden, California; and Yorktown Heights, New York.

    Nanotechnology is the field of applied science focused on the reliable and
repeatable design and control of the structure of very small objects. The
length scales range from the atomic to the macroscopic -- generally, from
one to 100 nanometers. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter -- roughly
100,000 times thinner than a human hair.

    The agreement to introduce SSME into the Egyptian University Curriculum is
recognition of the increased importance of the services industry in the
global economy. SSME is a new academic discipline designed to develop the
skills required in an increasingly services-based global economy and
brings together ongoing work in computer science, operations research,
industrial engineering, business strategy, management sciences, social
and cognitive sciences, and legal sciences to develop the skills required
in services-led organizations.

    "The set-up of the nanotechnology center and the introduction of SSME by
Egypt and IBM are key to the implementation of Egypt's science and
technology strategy that will lead to the development of a knowledge
economy," said Dr. Hany Helal, Minister of Higher Education and State
Minister of Scientific Research. "The Government of Egypt's profound
commitment to investing wisely in the development of highly skilled,
capable young people to take their place in competitive global markets is
reflected in our work with IBM to develop the most innovative and relevant
learning programs for our students."

    IBM has been operating in Egypt since 1954 and has based technology
development operations in the country for almost 25 years. The IBM Cairo
Technology Center Development currently employs more than 500 software
developers, architects and professionals.

    The IBM facilities in Egypt play key roles in IBM's ability to serve
customers across geographic boundaries, bringing skills to the customer no
matter where those skills are based in the world. To sharpen its focus on
Egypt and other growth countries in the world, IBM has formed a Growth
Markets organization based in Shanghai with regional headquarters in Dubai
and Sao Paulo.

&lt;p&gt;  KIRKLAND, QUEBEC, Sep 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Editors Note: A video is included with this press release.

    Together with the Starlight Children's Foundation, Pfizer Canada - the
country's leading pharmaceutical company - is encouraging Canadians to
help prove that love, support and courage can sometimes be amongst the
most powerful medicines of all.

    To benefit the Starlight Children's Foundation, Pfizer Canada is
introducing a new viral awareness campaign - and, as part of a guaranteed
$50,000 donation, the company will donate $5 every time someone views the
online film and forwards it to a friend or loved one.

    The powerful 90-second online film, entitled Graffiti, was created in
collaboration with advertising partner zig. Filmed in downtown Toronto,
the short film about courage follows a teen graffiti artist spraying an
unseen paint message in a dark, urban alleyway. As the teen returns home,
he is met by his seemingly disapproving mother, before entering into a
room where his seriously ill younger sister lies in a hospital bed. He
pulls back the curtains and a beautiful and moving message of hope and
optimism appears in her window.

    Playing now at morethanmedication.ca/bebrave Pfizer Canada is encouraging
Canadians to view the online film and send it to a friend or loved one
with a customized graffiti message of hope. Senders can choose one of six
messages. Every time a recipient views Graffiti at morethanmedication.ca
and sends it to a friend, Pfizer Canada will give $5 to the Starlight
Children's Foundation Canada as part of a guaranteed $50,000 donation.

    The We Can Be Brave section of the site also features articles and advice
from experts that deal with the emotional impacts of serious illnesses on
individuals and their families. The website also offers people links to
local support groups and Canadian resources.

    We Can Be Brave

    "Pfizer Canada recognizes that to be truly healthy, it takes more than
medication and that sometimes, love and support are the most powerful
medicines of all," says John Helou, Vice President, Public Affairs and
Stakeholder Relations, Pfizer Canada. "Canadians can also find links to
local support groups and advice from renowned Canadian experts on how to
cope with the emotional toll serious illnesses can have on families."

    "In addition to offering innovative medicines, we believe it's important
to give back to Canadian communities. We are dedicated to supporting
inspiring organizations, like Starlight, who bring optimism, hope and
support into the lives of seriously ill children and their families to
help them be brave and fight for wellness each and every day," he says.

    "Graffiti is a powerful and moving tribute to the thousands of families
across Canada who need our help and support," says Laura Mountjoy,
Executive Director, Starlight Children's Foundation. "Programs like this
help us fund important home and hospital-based programs that brighten the
spirits of seriously ill children and their families. We hope this short
film about courage will also inspire Canadians to reach out to help a
family they know to cope with the fear, isolation and pain families face
when a child is seriously ill."

    As with all Pfizer Canada More than Medication initiatives, Graffiti and
the website never mention medications or products. The online film closes
with an invitation to visit morethanmedication.ca, a made-in-Canada site
devoted completely to helping Canadians live healthier lives by providing
comprehensive, non-medicinal health information.

    The We Can Be Brave campaign was developed by Pfizer Canada in
collaboration with advertising agency partner zig, interactive agency
partner Klick, media agency partner Mediacom Canada and database
management partner Health Connect.

    We Can Be Brave is being supported in French and English Canada via

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Defense Coalition: Chevron's Troubles in Ecuador Continue to Mount with Fraud Indictment of High-level Executive

       Ricardo Reis Veiga among Nine who Face Criminal Trial For
         Conspiring to Falsify Scientific Results of Clean-up

           45 Chevron Pits That Were "Cleaned" Violate Norms
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
A fraud indictment in Ecuador against a Chevron executive and
seven government officials is based on a theory by the country's
national prosecutor that the accused conspired to lie about an
environmental clean-up so Chevron could escape a potential
multi-billion dollar civil liability then pending in a U.S. court,
lawyers for Amazonian residents say.

   Chevron announced last week that Ricardo Reis Veiga, a vice
president in charge of the company's legal affairs in Latin America
and the Caribbean, was charged in Ecuador with fraud for his work in
the mid 1990s on a purported environmental remediation in the
country's Amazon rainforest. Also indicted was Rodrigo Perez Pallares,
a Chevron lawyer in Ecuador, and a former Ecuadorian government oil
minister.

   Texaco (now Chevron) used the results of the purported remediation
to secure a release in 1995 - oddly, before any clean up work was done
- from Ecuador's government that was used at the time to try to
dismiss a civil case over environmental damages then pending in U.S.
federal court in New York. The U.S. judge in the case refused to
accept Chevron's argument that the release applied to private claims
of the type being pressed in the civil suit, and the case continued in
the U.S. and later in Ecuador after Chevron succeeded in getting it
transferred there in 2002.

   Earlier this year, an independent court-appointed expert in the
civil case working with a team of 14 scientists found Chevron is
liable for between $7.2 and $16.3 billion for environmental damage in
Ecuador's Amazon region. Texaco (now Chevron) was the exclusive
operator of an oil concession in the area from 1964 to 1990 that
dumped 18.5 billion gallons of toxic "water of formation" into Amazon
waterways, according to the lawsuit.

   A final decision in the case is expected in the coming months.

   The indictment of the Chevron officials is based on a wide body of
scientific evidence generated by an independent government
investigative agency and corroborated by three sources that have
analyzed soil samples of waste pits that Chevron claims to have
remediated, according to the lawyers.

   When Richard Cabrera, the court expert, reviewed roughly 64,000
analytical results in the civil trial produced by these parties, he
found that more than 80% of the pits supposedly "remediated" by
Chevron have levels of toxins that violate the law.

   Evidence in the civil trial shows "remediated" waste pits with
Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) of up to 206,512 parts per million
(ppm), or 206 times higher than the Ecuadorian norm of 1,000 ppm,
according to Douglas Beltman, a scientist at Stratus Consulting in
Boulder who works with the plaintiffs. TPH are a body of toxic
chemicals that include benzene, a known human carcinogen.

   A complete list of the 45 so-called remediated pits that violate
Ecuadorian norms - taken from the Cabrera expert report -- can be
found at www.chevrontoxico.com.

   The leaders of five indigenous groups in the area have alleged for
years that the Chevron remediation was a fraud and was orchestrated by
Reis Veiga to secure a release that could be used to dismiss the class
action civil case then pending in U.S. federal court in New York.
Texaco's lawyers at the time tried repeatedly to use the release -
provided before any clean-up work was actually done - to persuade the
U.S. court to dismiss the case.

   An Atlanta-based firm, King &amp; Spalding, represented Texaco at the
time.

   The indictment is based largely on soil sampling of remediated
pits and was performed in 2001 by an independent Ecuadorian government
agency, called the Controlaria. The sampling by the agency, which is
similar to the General Accounting Office in the U.S., is part of the
civil trial's official record.

   The indictment alleges that Reis Veiga and Perez Pallares signed
documents certifying the remediation had been carried out when in fact
it had not. Signing the documents violates various anti-fraud
provisions in Ecuador's penal code, according to the indictment. The
charges carry maximum sentences of ten years.

   Chevron has charged the indictment results from "political
interference" in the case, but the claim was rejected by lawyers for
the plaintiffs.

   "Chevron always cries 'political interference' when it lacks a
real defense," said Pablo Fajardo, the lawyer for 30,000 Ecuadorians
who are suing Chevron.

   The timing of the indictment appears to result from the fact the
statute of limitations would have expired on Sept. 28, ten years to
the day after the final documents were signed indicating the end of
the clean-up.

   The civil lawsuit alleges Chevron dumped 18.5 billion gallons of
toxic waste water into Amazon waterways and abandoned hundreds of
unlined waste pits gouged out of the jungle floor, causing a spike in
cancer rates and forcing five indigenous groups to abandon most of
their ancestral land. As the exclusive operator of a large oil
concession, Texaco extracted more than one billion barrels of oil from
the country between 1964 and 1990.

   Background

   With pressure mounting in Ecuador from a major environmental
lawsuit and criminal fraud indictment against Chevron lawyers, four
residents of the Amazon rainforest will travel to Washington to
discuss the devastating impact of the oil company's operations over
three decades in what once was one of the world's most pristine
jungles. Meetings are set with members of Congress and Congressional
staff. (Media can obtain the names of the members of Congress and
congressional staff on September 17th by emailing or phoning the media
contact. We are not releasing the names until then to prevent Chevron
from interfering with the meetings.)

   The lawsuit, filed in 2003 after Chevron insisted the case be
shifted to Ecuador from a U.S. federal court, is expected to result in
one of the largest civil judgments in history. An independent
court-appointed expert recently assessed damages between $7.2 billion
and $16.3 billion. Chevron recently hired several A-list Washington
lobbyists, including McCain Campaign finance chair Wayne Berman and
former Senator Trent Lott, to try to convince the Bush Administration
and Congress to deny Ecuador trade benefits as "punishment" for
letting these individuals press their private legal claims against
Chevron. Further, two Chevron lawyers were indicted last week in
Ecuador for conspiring to falsify the results of a purported
environmental clean-up as a ruse to avoid liability in the civil case.

   The Ecuadorians have accused Texaco (bought by Chevron in 2001) of
committing the worst oil-related disaster on the planet on their
ancestral lands - one at least 30 times worse than the Exxon Valdez
spill. They also believe the scientific evidence at trial from various
sources, including Chevron itself, demonstrate the presence of massive
and life-threatening levels of toxins in the area where Chevron
operated. Chevron has claimed the trial is a "farce" and "rigged" -
claims that have been vigorously rejected by the plaintiffs and
several independent observers.

   Members of Delegation

   The delegation will include a medical care provider who helps
residents who suffer from cancer, skin disease and respiratory
illnesses as a result of the contamination; a tribal leader whose
indigenous group has seen a dramatic drop in population since Texaco
entered Ecuador's rainforest in the mid 1960s; and Pablo Fajardo and
Luis Yanza, recently honored with the Goldman environmental prize
(called the "Nobel" of the environment). In April Chevron took out a
full page advertisement in the San Francisco Chronicle accusing
Fajardo and Yanza of having misled the Goldman jury, a charge the
Goldman Foundation rejected vigorously. Fajardo also was honored last
December as a CNN "Hero" award in the Justice category for leading the
fight to hold Chevron accountable and is one of the attorneys
representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

   Chevron's Practices

   Chevron is accused of dumping 18.5 billion gallons of toxic
"produced water" into Amazon waterways from 1964 to 1990, when it was
the exclusive operator of large oil concession in the rainforest. The
company is also accused of creating 916 unlined toxic waste pits and
filling them with toxic sludge that has leeched for decades into soils
and groundwater that Amazon residents rely on for drinking water. The
company is also accused of being responsible for hundreds of oil
spills. In 1992, Texaco turned over its entire operation to Ecuador's
state-owned oil company, Petroecuador. To this day, the system
originally designed and built by Texaco continues to contaminate the
environment. Five indigenous groups have been severely impacted, with
significant drops in population and health problems. Cancer rates and
other oil-related health problems in the region have spiked, according
to several peer-reviewed health studies.

Amazon region. The mission of the Coalition is to protect the
environment and secure social justice through grass roots organizing,
political advocacy, and litigation.

&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Opens New International Image Deposit Centers in Bahrain, Jakarta and Pakistan

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


J.P. Morgan, a full-service provider of cash management, trade finance, and
treasury solutions, today announced the opening of new International Cash Letter
Image Deposit Centers in Bahrain, Jakarta and Pakistan, bringing the total
number of Centers to 17. The new centers enable J.P. Morgan to provide its
financial institution clients with the ability to clear their U.S. dollar cash
letters in more locations, reducing check transportation costs and risks, all
without changing their cash letter operations. The addition of these new centers
strengthens the firm's imaging capabilities in Asia and the Middle East.

The Bahrain, Jakarta and Pakistan International Image Deposit Centers join 14
other J.P. Morgan Centers outside the United States that enable financial
institutions to process their U. S. dollar cash letters in an automated
electronic environment. J.P. Morgan unveiled its inaugural International Image
Deposit Center in Frankfurt, Germany, in October 2005. The firm continues to
explore other markets to establish centers as part of its goal to expand its
global footprint.

"The opening of the new image deposit centers will only enhance the already
robust products and services we offer clients who do business both in their home
countries and around the world," said Alan Koenigsberg, Treasury Services EMEA
Cash Management Product Executive. "We look forward to delivering the
world-class services our clients have come to expect and rely on to meet their
cash letter needs."

J.P. Morgan was the first global treasury management service provider to
establish centers in local markets around the world. The Bahrain, Jakarta and
Pakistan locations join centers located in Bangkok, Bournemouth, Frankfurt, Hong
Kong, Madrid, Milan, Mumbai, Paris, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo
and Zurich.

"With these three new centers, we will extend the delivery of our clearing
services to a global market, making it easier and more convenient for clients to
clear their U.S. dollar check items regardless of their home country location,"
said Linda McLaughlin-Moore, Asia Pacific Cash Management Product Executive. "As
a leader in image processing solutions, J.P. Morgan continues to deliver new
products and services that help clients succeed in today's increasingly
competitive global marketplace."

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A U.S. Senate subcommittee told JP Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) on Wednesday to immediately start turning over a year's worth of internal documents about the bank's view on oil prices, The New York Times said citing a letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move came after the subcommittee obtained a private message in which an investment officer seemed to contradict testimony other bank executives gave to the Senate this week, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JP Morgan Chase spokesman told the paper the bank would "respond appropriately" to the demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan Chase could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times said the letter was sent to JP Morgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon by Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota and the chairman of the Senate Energy subcommittee, which held a hearing on Tuesday on the role of speculators in moving oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawrence Eagles, who joined the bank as head of global commodity research recently after several years as the head of the International Energy Agency's (IEA) markets division, told the hearing the bank believed high energy prices are fundamentally the result of supply and demand, not speculation, the NYT said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However on Wednesday, Senator Dorgan released what he said was a contradictory e-mail message sent to banking clients on Tuesday by the bank's global chief investment officer, Michael Cembalest, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That message blamed "an enormous amount of speculation pent up in energy markets," for the high price and added, "It wasn't just the supply-demand equation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Dorgan asked Dimon for an explanation in the letter, according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ajay Kamalakaran in Bangalore; Editing by Anshuman Daga)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norkom and IBM to Deliver Financial Crime and Compliance Solutions for the Financial Services Industry

VIENNA, Austria--(Business Wire)--
Norkom Technologies today announced it is partnering with IBM
(NYSE: IBM) to deliver new Financial Crime and Compliance (FCC)
software solutions to the world's leading financial institutions.

   Announced at SIBOS, the financial services industry's premier
annual event, the solutions will combine the expertise of IBM's Global
Business Services and Norkom's FCC software. Under the terms of the
agreement, which spans software development, marketing and sales, both
organizations have committed to develop new and innovative solutions
to help meet client needs. To fuel this development, the two companies
have already aligned research and development around the IBM
InfoSphere Entity Analytic Solutions (EAS) portfolio including the IBM
Relationship Resolution product.

   The financial services industry experiences an estimated $19
billion in losses each year due to financial crimes. Compounding these
losses is a fluid regulatory environment that has driven up
operational costs by 43 percent annually.

   As the recognized global leader in the provision of FCC software
solutions, Norkom works with clients such as HSBC, Credit Agricole,
ANZ, American Express and Washington Mutual to meet their business and
regulatory requirements. Over the past two years, Norkom has enjoyed
tremendous worldwide success and expansion into Australia, Asia and
the Middle East, building on its market leading position in North
America and Europe.

   Paul Kerley, CEO of Norkom Technologies said, "Working with IBM
will enable us to further expand our global footprint and enter new
markets and geographies through IBM's vast network of global
relationships. But the real winners will be our current and future
clients within the global financial services sector. Together with
IBM, Norkom will deliver solutions, developed on leading-edge
platforms, which will help financial organizations comply quickly and
affordably with regulatory requirements and defend against operational
and reputation risk and loss posed by external and internal financial
attacks."

   "Our customers face monumental challenges for evolving risk
management requirements and to defend against illegal activities.
Incremental, siloed investments are expensive and ineffective in
dealing with the growth and sophistication of multi-channel threats,"
said June Felix, general manager, global banking and financial
markets, IBM. "We are pleased to partner with Norkom to help customers
better defend against attack efficiently and effectively across the
enterprise."

   Through the newly-formed partnership, Norkom and IBM will be
co-hosting a series of seminars and events together over the coming
weeks and months. Norkom is also a sponsor at IBM's Information on
Demand Conference, in Las Vegas, Nevada, from 26-31 October 2008. For
more information on these events, please visit www.norkom.com.

   Norkom and IBM are exhibiting at SIBOS 2008 in the Messeplatz 1 in
Vienna, Austria, from 15-19 September 2008 at stands C623 and A110
respectively.

   About Norkom Technologies (www.norkom.com)

   Established in 1998, Norkom Technologies (AIM: NORK.L, IEX:
NORK.IE) enables financial organizations to take intelligent action,
control defenses, and evolve strategies against fraud, money
laundering, and other types of financial crime. By combining a unique

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
and Citadel Investment Group resumed trading with each other on
Friday, one day after the bank had cut off the hedge fund over
a hiring dispute, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The dispute has been resolved," a person familiar with the
hedge fund said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citadel's officials could not be reached for comment at the
office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citadel, one of the world's largest hedge fund firms with
roughly $20 billion in assets, clashed with JP Morgan because
it had hired a string of executives from America's second
largest bank this year, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They said JP Morgan told employees to stop trading stocks,
bonds and currencies with Citadel on Thursday morning,
essentially prohibiting anyone from buying or selling with the
hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Friday, the differences had been resolved and business
was back to normal, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Standoffs over hiring occur relatively frequently between
hedge funds and banks as ever more people are trying to move to
hedge funds where salaries are considered to be significantly
higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These matters rarely become public however and this one
created a special stir because it came at an awkward time on
Wall Street after financial stocks had dropped dramatically
this week and some top executives had blamed short sellers at
hedge funds for the decline.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) blamed short sellers for their problems this week, an interesting twist for two investment banks known for making money from short sellers and even betting on weakening shares themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Morgan Stanley and Goldman took a real beating in the middle of this week. The market activity seemed to threaten Morgan Stanley's survival, forcing the investment bank to consider selling itself. If Goldman's shares had fallen long enough, it could have looked at similar measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while pursuing capital, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive John Mack also lobbied the government for relief, which arrived on Friday, when the Securities and Exchange Commission took the highly unusual step of banning short-selling in 799 financial stocks, including Morgan Stanley and Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall market cheered the move, but some investors were not pleased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I did not hear the big Wall Street banks complaining until short sellers began shorting the financial stocks," said Harry Strunk, partner at Treflie Capital Management, which invests in hedge funds that short, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs believe there is a difference between the shorting of their shares, and the shorting they facilitate for clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both banks believe they are the victims of "bear raids," where short sellers gang up on a stock to try to push its shares lower, rather than having a considered investment thesis. Short sellers bet a company's shares will drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's happening out there? It's very clear to me -- we're in the midst of a market controlled by fear and rumors, and short sellers are driving our stock down," wrote Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack in a memo obtained by Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conspiring with other investors to manipulate a share price is illegal, as is knowingly spreading false rumors to move a stock price. But so far no evidence has emerged publicly that any such thing has happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some hedge funds believe that Morgan Stanley and Goldman were not victims, but were instead legitimately reevaluated by a world where investors are increasingly skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We get very little disclosure from investment banks about their positions, and when savvy banks looked inside Bear's and Lehman's kimonos, they didn't like what they saw," said James Ellman, president at hedge fund Seacliff Capital. "It's rational to lose faith."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Morgan Stanley said the bank has been fully transparent about its mortgage-related exposures and has broken out the write-downs it has taken on each asset category within its mortgage business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skepticism about investment banks has run high for some time, reaching a fever pitch this year as Bear Stearns faced a run on the bank, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, and Merrill Lynch  Co MER.N agreed to sell itself to Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short sellers are key clients for Goldman and Morgan Stanley, but quantifying their importance is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some clues as to the importance of short sellers to both firms. Morgan Stanley and Goldman are top firms in prime brokerage, which entails trading and financing securities for hedge funds, including helping them short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advisory firm TABB Group estimated earlier this year that prime brokerage in the United States alone would generate $11.5 billion of revenue for banks. The group surveyed 61 hedge funds with an average of $4.3 billion under management, and more than half had a prime brokerage relationship with either Goldman or Morgan Stanley or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OVERSTATED ASSETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faith is in short supply after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK filed for bankruptcy on Monday. That investment bank had sparred for months with short-sellers who accused the firm of understating its bad assets, even as Lehman said it was strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short sellers turned out to be right -- last weekend, prospective buyers that scrutinized Lehman's books refused to buy the firm because there were too many toxic assets, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Goldman have successfully fended off short sellers for now. Their shares surged 20 percent on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And ticking off some of the short-selling clients may be a small price to pay, said Brad Alford, president at investment advisor Alpha Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hedge funds are getting nailed today, which will hurt Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, but at least their shares won't go to zero now," Alford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Svea Herbst in Boston and Michael Flaherty in Hong Kong; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

razors, said it paid more than $6 billion in federal income
taxes for the tax years of 2000 to 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2005, the IRS started auditing PG's tax returns for the
tax years of 2001 through 2005, PG said in a complaint filed
on Sept. 10. Then, the IRS sent PG a notice of deficiency on
June 5, 2008, claiming adjustments should be made to some items
and assessing more tax for the 2000 tax year, PG said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The consumer products company said "virtually all" of the
adjustments made by the IRS were erroneous, but it paid the
extra taxes and interest as it was required to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now it wants a refund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PG said the IRS asked for more money after looking into
tax credits the company claimed for technology donated to
colleges and universities, as well as artwork donated to the
Cincinnati Art Museum and the National Underground Railroad
Freedom Center. The IRS also denied certain credits related to
spending on patent work and research, among other items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for Cincinnati-based PG said the company
could not comment on pending litigation. A spokesman for the
IRS said it generally does not comment on pending litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit, Procter  Gamble Co v. United States of
America, was filed on Sept. 10 in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Summonses to the IRS and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the
Southern District of Ohio to answer to the complaint were filed
with the court on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jessica Wohl, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and SINGAPORE, Sep 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
A team of scientists at IBM (NYSE: IBM) and the Genome Institute of
Singapore (GIS) have discovered that microRNAs --small molecules that are
an important regulatory component in the machinery of living cells --
actually regulate the differentiation of stem cells and have roles that
go way beyond what was previously thought.

    The work uncovers new ways by which microRNAs regulate how genes are made
and could provide alternative explanations for some observations that
biologists have made in recent years.

    The work is expected to provide new insights on cell process regulation
and how it relates to the onset of diseases such as cancers,
neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes and others. It is also expected to
suggest future avenues for novel diagnostics and the development of
therapeutics.

    In 2003, IBM scientists developed a mathematical model for predicting
microRNA targets. The model led to conjectures about an expanded role for
microRNAs, which IBM set out to study with GIS scientists by focusing on
mouse stem cells. IBM used computation to guide the experimental effort
that was carried out at GIS.

    "We have made yet another step towards understanding the intricate nature
of microRNAs and the roles they play in the regulation of cellular
processes," said Isidore Rigoutsos, Manager of the Bioinformatics Group in
IBM Research's Computational Biology Center. "The finding that microRNAs
can extensively target locations in the amino acid coding regions of a
transcript is an exciting discovery and reveals another important aspect
of microRNA activity."

    GIS Senior Group Leader, Dr. Bing Lim, added, "We learn from this study
that the targeting of coding regions by microRNAs can also have a real
impact on cells. We observed that a single microRNA forced into the
powerful embryonic stem cell can impose differentiation. This is exciting
because one could envisage using microRNAs as a small molecule to control
the differentiation of stem cells, or to make new stem cells. The fun part
of this research was the visualization of a trend of thought from
computational prediction all the way to cell transformation."

    Details of Discovery

    For more than a decade, microRNAs were assumed to primarily interact with
their targets through the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the targets'
mRNA. The nucleotide sequences of the targeted locations were believed to
be generally conserved across different organisms whereas interactions
with mRNA regions beyond the 3'UTR were thought to be atypical.

    Some of the new research findings suggest that microRNA targets in the
amino acid coding region (CDS) of a gene's mRNA may in fact be as frequent
as those in the mRNA's 3'UTR, providing experimental evidence to a
conjecture put forth in an earlier publication by the two teams. It also
shows that a gene's CDS serves as template of microRNA targeting activity,
in addition to its coding for the corresponding protein's amino acid
sequence.

    Working with three microRNAs whose expression increases upon
differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), the teams show that
Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2, three transcription factors that are central to
maintaining the pluripotency of mouse ESCs and determining the initiation
of differentiation, are controlled through their CDS region by the three
studied microRNAs. By introducing mutations at the identified target
locations, the two teams showed that they could prevent the downregulation
of these transcription factors and delay stem cell differentiation.

    For the majority of the validated microRNA targets, their sequence is not
conserved in the rhesus and mouse counterparts of Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2.
This suggests that seeking putative microRNA targets by aligning the
instances of a gene across different organisms will underestimate the
number of bona fide microRNA targets. Additionally, the studied microRNAs
generally have multiple targets in the CDS region of the same gene
possibly suggesting an underlying need for redundancy that can ensure the
downregulation of the intended target. Finally, several of the studied
targets stride exon-exon junctions: this finding suggests a role for
microRNAs that of the selective targeting of a gene's splice variants.

    "This discovery has vast implications for the role that computational
models can play in biological science," said Ajay Royyuru, Senior Manager
for the Computational Biology Center at IBM Research. "Computational
biology allows scientists to develop theories using powerful computers and
even preliminarily prove those theories prior to conducting experiments in
wet labs -- which reduces the time spent on trial and error throughout the
process of scientific discovery."

    Prof Edison Liu, Executive Director of GIS, said, "This work is a great
example of how future medical discovery will progressively require the
joint efforts of computer scientists working in conjunction with
biologists. The complexity of the control of human cells through
regulatory networks demands computational modeling in order to decipher
the signals from the noise. But in the end, it still boils down to doing
the lab experiment."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 19 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it remained
"neutral" on U.S. gaming operators as it expects tighter
consumer spending, falling home prices, increased unemployment
and tougher credit to keep gaming revenue negative through
2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regional gaming operators continue to face external
pressures as states are rolling out more gaming (i.e. more
competition) to fill budget shortfalls and increasingly
implementing commercial casino smoking bans which tend to drive
revenue down, analyst Betsy Gorton said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The smoking bans tend to drive down revenue about 10
percent to 20 percent in the first year and only 5 out of 19
commercial gaming states have smoking bans so far, Gorton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs began coverage of Ameristar Casinos ASCA.O
and Isle of Capri Casinos Inc (ISLE.O) with a "sell" rating,
saying both the regional gaming operators were vulnerable to
macro economic headwinds as well as increased competition and
low growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, the brokerage upgraded Penn National Gaming (PENN.O)
to "buy," saying it is the only regional operator with the
balance sheet strength to take advantage of lower multiples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Ameristar Casinos were up 4 percent at $17.23,
while those of Isle of Capri Casinos were up 7 percent at
$8.05. Penn National Gaming's stock was up 7 percent at $31.29
Friday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes, details, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Nancy Leinfuss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Securities said on
Friday the actions taken by the U.S. government aimed at
stemming systemic risk have created a bottom in prices for cash
and derivative segments of the asset-backed securities market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The actions taken this week and those that are forthcoming
make it extremely likely that we have seen the bottom in ABS,
ABX and non-agency MBS prices," said Chris Flanagan, analyst at
JPMorgan Securities. "Even after Friday morning's sharp rally,
we still see extraordinary value and move to overweight," the
analyst said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Friday called for the
U.S. government to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to
take so-called toxic mortgage assets off the books of financial
firms to restore financial stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The surprise move comes as the Treasury and Federal Reserve
consider broad government intervention to prevent the collapse
of the financial system, shaken in recent days by a crisis at
insurer American International Group (AIG.N) that required a
$85 billion government rescue and the bankruptcy of investment
bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK. For details, see
[ID:nLJ642958]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What the RTC-type response along with the other policy
moves does is address -- and put a floor on -- the capital
inadequacy issue for the banking system, which had been
deteriorating rapidly as the events of this week were
transpiring," said Flanagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With good policy now in place, we look to expand risk
taking and look for returns in the lowest priced, longest
duration risk in ABX," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Flanagan also said top slices of subprime mortgage indexes
including, the ABX 07-1 and ABX 07-2 "PENAAA" and "AAA"
segments as well as the "AA" layer of the ABX 06-1 index, offer
the best value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In consumer ABS, top-tier credit card and auto ABS issues
offer the best value, the analyst said, and recommended
investors rotate out of FFELP student loans.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs energy equities analyst Arjun Murti, one of the first to predict $100 a barrel crude, cut his 2009 oil price forecast to $110 from $140 a barrel this week due to global economic weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have moderated our 2008 and 2009 oil price forecasts both to account for the recent pullback and better reflect oil demand uncertainty," Goldman Sachs said in a research note prepared by Murti and other Goldman analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murti roiled oil markets in 2005 by forecasting oil above $100 a barrel -- a prediction that came true late in 2007. Murti said earlier this year crude oil prices could rise further to $150-$200 a barrel before the end of 2009 in what he called a "super spike."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our bullish oil macro framework has been based on the fairly straightforward logic that in an environment of limited spare capacity and lackluster supply growth, prices would need to rise to ration demand down to levels of available supply," Goldman said in the note released Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the essence of this call remains intact. However, over the next several quarters, we now see slowing global GDP growth as being the driver of weaker demand, reducing the need for high and rising prices to ration demand," Goldman said in the note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's commodity research team, which sometimes carries oil price forecasts that differ from Murti's equities-focused group, said earlier in the week it slashed its average 2009 U.S. crude oil forecast by $25 to $123 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Richard Valdmanis, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  POUGHKEEPSIE, NY, Sep 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today officially announced that registration for the
fourth annual "Master the Mainframe" competition is underway. The annual
competition is designed to familiarize students with concepts for the
growing large enterprise computing industry and build mainframe skills,
enabling them to become the business and IT leaders of tomorrow.

    The announcement was formally made at IBM's Poughkeepsie, New York
facility -- the manufacturing and development home of the IBM System z
mainframe. Last year, more than 1,750 students from 325 high schools and
colleges from across the United States and Canada entered the competition.

    The "Master the Mainframe" competition began in 2005 and is comprised of
three challenges which become increasingly more difficult as the
contestant moves on to the next level. The students are asked to become
familiar with and operate the mainframe user interface, perform systems
programming and application developing tasks and complete real-life
situations encountered by experienced systems programmers. The thousands
of anticipated registered students will be able to remotely connect into
an IBM mainframe from anywhere in the world they can access the Internet,
further demonstrating the mainframe's feature-rich security and
transaction capabilities.

    The contest is part of IBM's Academic Initiative for System z program, a
global project by IBM to align with colleges, universities and businesses
across the globe to develop mainframe and large enterprise skills for
future employment and Fortune 500 companies across the globe. The Academic
Initiative for System z program has now worked with more than 400 colleges
and universities across the globe to help train and educate more than
50,000 students.

    "Since 2000, IBM System z market share has doubled -- growing from 17 to
34 percent, so it is clear clients have looked to the IBM mainframe as the
foundation for their new enterprise data center," said Kathleen Pfeiffer,
Program Manager, IBM Academic Initiative for System z. "Companies like HP
and Sun have struggled for decades to try and create a technology platform
as reliable as the IBM mainframe, which is why students looking for a
career in a technology platform that has continually reinvented itself for
40 years and used by the top banks and retail companies all over the world
can look no further than IBM and System z."

    Registration for students is now open. The competition will run from
October 1, 2008 thru December 29, 2008. The winners will be announced on
or about February 2, 2009. Students can log on to the following web site
to register for the competition and receive full instructions:

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. corporate bond
market will be damaged for an extended period after Lehman
Brothers' LEH.N LEHMQ.PK bondholders suffered a more than
$90 billion loss from the investment bank's default, JPMorgan
said in a report on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings on
Monday, Sept. 15, was a devastating loss for high-grade
investors," JPMorgan said. Lehman had about $110 billion of
long-term debt on its balance sheet that is now trading on
average in the mid-teens dollar price, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment-grade bond spreads, or their yields relative to
U.S. Treasuries, surged this week to record highs as
significant default risk was priced into several other
financial companies after Lehman's bankruptcy, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, spreads are not high enough to attract investors,
the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman's default also caused a 1.6 percent drop in
high-grade corporate bond investment returns, leaving the
market with a 4.6 percent year-to-date loss, exactly offsetting
last year's gains, JPMorgan said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The two major investment banks left standing after a financial hurricane undermined confidence in their business model advised their clients on Friday to keep buying each other's shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc analyst William Tanona issued a research note saying rival bank Morgan Stanley was "sound as an ongoing entity" and reiterated the stock as a "conviction buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley analyst Patrick Pinschmidt returned the favor, saying, "We continue to believe that business model fears are overdone." He rated the stock as "overweight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks soared on Friday as a series of sweeping steps to contain fallout from the credit crisis eased worries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Morgan Stanley, pummeled earlier this week as investors fretted about the outlook for the last two remaining U.S. investment banks, jumped 22.7 percent to $27.70 by mid-morning. Shares of Goldman Sachs climbed 18 percent to $127.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early Friday, U.S. securities regulators temporarily banned short sales of many financial shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the note on Morgan Stanley, Tanona said that although some of the price declines this week may have been understandable, given the issues at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, Merrill Lynch  Co Inc and American International Group Inc, most of the downward spiral was exaggerated by short sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Claudia Parsons; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethical Corporation: Siemens, The Coca-Cola Company, ArcelorMittal, Dell, and ING Group Discuss Anti-Corruption at Hague Conference

THE HAGUE--(Business Wire)--
A conference for big business is set to explore the growing case
against corporate corruption.

   Today, large companies find themselves constantly in the firing
line over bribery and corruption. Regulators and prosecutors are
becoming ever more vigilant. Convictions and fines for business
corruption are rapidly increasing.

   Still many large companies are unaware of the growing legal
liability they face under laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act. KPMG data points out that many companies lack basic compliance
programmes yet face hugely increased criminal risks.

   Now, to help companies both understand and tackle this important
issue, Ethical Corporation, the leading global business ethics
magazine and events company, will hold a major business summit on the
topic in The Hague on October 6 - 7.

   The 2nd Annual European Anti-corruption Summit will discuss the
risks big companies now face on corruption, and focus on practical
programmes and actions firms can use to manage their anti-corruption
risk every day.

   "Between true globalization of the world's economy and the
increased demand for greater transparency on how corporations conduct
business, a company's well-earned ethical reputation can be at risk if
not properly safeguarded with sufficient anticorruption efforts" said
Alex Brigham, President &amp; CEO at Corpedia, the global ethics and
compliance service provider.

   Speakers at the conference are confirmed from:

   AkzoNobel, Alcatel-Lucent, ArcelorMittal, BP, Bayer CropScience,
Cisco

   Danfoss, Dell, EADS, European Investment Bank, Ferring
Pharmaceuticals, General Electric, F Investment, Falck, Halcrow, ING
Group, Intel, Roshan, SES, Telekom, TNK-BP, The Coca-Cola Company,

&lt;p&gt; (Updates from brief, adds dateline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) plans to
sell its fuels marketing business in Nigeria to Panamanian
company Corlay Global S.A., the oil company said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's upstream production operations in Nigeria are not
affected by the sale. No financial terms of the deal were
disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fuels marketing business is operated via Chevron
Nigeria Holdings Ltd, which is a Bermudan company that holds 60
percent of the issued shares of Chevron Oil Nigeria PLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The transaction is subject to Bermuda regulatory consent
and is expected to close quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Militants in Nigeria have declared an "oil war" against the
oil industry and have regularly attacked energy installations
in the oil rich country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier Friday, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) warned that an
escalation of violence in Nigeria in the past week is likely to
weigh on its earnings.

&lt;p&gt;  WATERLOO, ONTARIO, Sep 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Research In Motion (RIM) (NASDAQ: RIMM)(TSX: RIM) today announced support
for Microsoft(R) Office Communications Server 2007 providing an enhanced
real time instant messaging and presence experience for corporate
customers using the BlackBerry(R) Enterprise Solution.

    Support for Office Communications Server 2007 advances the features and
functionality already available on the BlackBerry(R) platform for
Microsoft(R) Live Communications Server 2005. The new offering includes
an instant messaging application (BlackBerry IM client) for BlackBerry
smartphones that provides enhanced presence information and deeper
integration with core BlackBerry smartphone applications including the
phone, browser, address book and calendar for a highly intuitive and
interactive experience.

    Key features of the complete solution, which requires BlackBerry(R)
Enterprise Server 4.1.6 or higher, handsets running BlackBerry Device
Software 4.1 or higher, and the new BlackBerry IM client for use with
Office Communications Server 2007, include:

    - One-to-one or multi-party instant messaging - Engage in one-to-one or
multi-party instant messaging sessions from a BlackBerry smartphone.
Users can also send instant messages with hyperlinks included that can
initiate an email, phone call or launch a web page and can save
conversations to the smartphone for archiving or sharing via email.

    - New presence statuses - In addition to setting their presence status as
Available, Busy, Do Not Disturb, Be Right Back, Away, or Offline,
BlackBerry smartphone users can now create a customized notification
about their location, such as "home" or "office".

    - Auto presence setting based on activity - View the presence of others
automatically based on activity from their desktop computer, desk phone
(requires integration between an organization's PBX system and Office
Communications Server 2007), and activities scheduled in their Microsoft
Outlook calendar, which can show a more granular level of presence with
notifications such as "Out of Office" and "In a Meeting".

    - Control access to presence and contact information - Users can control
who sees their presence by setting their availability to individuals,
teams, the entire company, and people outside the organization, or they
can block the information outright.

    - Click to communicate from contact list - From within the BlackBerry IM
client, users can click on a contact in the contact list and select to
initiate a phone call, email, MMS or SMS with the contact. Users can also
initiate an instant messaging session with a contact from within the
BlackBerry Address Book.

    - Picture association in contact list - Users can associate a photo to
each contact in their list.

    - Determine presence of contacts from address book, receive alerts - View
the presence information of a contact in the BlackBerry Address Book and
receive an alert when a person becomes available.

    - Usage controls for the enterprise - New IT settings and controls have
been added to BlackBerry Enterprise Server allowing administrators to
control access by individual users or groups as well as control specific
functionality, such as the ability to save conversations.

    - Market-leading security - Leverages the market-leading security and
encryption of the BlackBerry Enterprise Solution to help ensure that
presence information and conversations remain protected and secure.

    - Ease of deployment - The BlackBerry IM client can be easily deployed
via side loading or over the air. IT administrators can also 'push' the
application to users through BlackBerry(R) Enterprise Server.

    - Optimized for mobility - BlackBerry smartphone users benefit from the
BlackBerry platform's push-based architecture, supporting battery
efficiency, network optimization and automatic delivery of instant
messages, even while the application is running in the background.

    The new BlackBerry IM client for use with Office Communications Server
2007 is a powerful choice for large and small organizations alike.
Tayside Fire and Rescue in Scotland, which provides planning, community
safety as well as fire and other emergency response services to over
400,000 people throughout the Tayside area located in the North East of
the UK, recently extended their Office Communications Server 2007
capabilities for instant messaging and presence on the BlackBerry
platform as part of their strategy to strengthen the reliability and
responsiveness of communications for their services.

    "Instant messaging and presence on the BlackBerry platform is improving
our ability to find members of our mission critical teams that are often
mobile, and bring them together quickly into live and interactive
meetings, regardless of their locations," said Gary Bellfield,
Information and Communications Technology Manager at Tayside Fire and
Rescue. "Mobile access is an essential component of our complete unified
communications initiative, and we trust the BlackBerry solution to
support our mobile instant messaging capabilities in a highly reliable,
secure and intuitive way."

    "BlackBerry support for Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007
brings the latest advances in enterprise instant messaging and presence
into a seamless user experience on BlackBerry smartphones for businesses
and government organizations," said Mark Guibert, Vice President,
Corporate Marketing, Research In Motion. "The complete solution presents
opportunities for significant gains in productivity and responsiveness
for teams in an increasingly mobile world."

    Support for Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 requires
BlackBerry(R) Enterprise Server 4.1.6 or higher, handsets running
BlackBerry Device Software 4.1 or higher, and the new BlackBerry IM
client for use with Office Communications Server 2007.

investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CIC official was responding to speculation that the
fund was in talks to raise its 9.9 percent stake in Morgan
Stanley, Xinhua said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIC bought its initial stake last December and is in talks
to raise its stake to as high as 49 percent, according to
sources familiar with the plans [ID:nN18387625].

&lt;p&gt;First Offshore, Gravity-Based LNG Terminal to Add to Europe's LNG
                 Import Capacity and Energy Diversity
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today announced that the
world's first offshore liquefied natural gas or LNG terminal arrived
at its final location off the Italian coast, where it will be capable
of supplying about 10 percent of Italy's natural gas requirements.

   The Adriatic terminal is designed to store and regasify LNG to
deliver 775 million cubic feet per day (8 billion cubic meters per
year) of clean-burning natural gas when it reaches full operational
capacity in 2009. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and members
of his cabinet will visit the terminal site tomorrow to mark this
major step in meeting Italy's energy demand.

   The Adriatic LNG terminal left its construction site in Algeciras,
Spain, August 30, for the 1700-mile (3,000-kilometer) trip to its
final destination, where it arrived September 15. The terminal has
been positioned at about 10 miles (15 kilometers) offshore Porto
Levante, Italy in the Adriatic Sea, in approximately 95 feet (28
meters) of water and will be connected via pipeline to Italy's
natural-gas grid.

   The Adriatic LNG project is owned by ExxonMobil Italiana Gas,
Qatar Terminal Limited (a Qatar Petroleum 100% owned subsidiary) and
Edison and will be part of the world's rapidly expanding natural gas
supply network.

   "ExxonMobil is a pioneer in the LNG industry," said Neil Duffin,
president of ExxonMobil Development Company. "We were involved in one
of the world's first LNG facilities. Now, in partnership with Qatar
Petroleum, we are employing new technology to build four of the
largest LNG production facilities in the world, as well as the
industry's largest vessels to carry LNG to market. We are also working
together to build LNG regasification terminal projects in Italy, UK
and the US. Advanced technologies, project execution capabilities and
economies of scale have reduced costs, thereby extending our ability
to bring LNG to more people around the world."

   The Adriatic LNG terminal will receive natural gas produced from
Qatar's North Field, which has resources of more than 900 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas, making it the largest non-associated
natural gas field in the world.

   "Italy represents just one of many nations around the world that
Qatar now has the ability to deliver natural gas to in the form of
LNG," said Saad Al-Kaabi, Director Oil &amp; Gas Ventures for Qatar
Petroleum and Chairman of Terminale GNL Adriatico. "Qatar Petroleum
and ExxonMobil's long term partnership was able to successfully build
this excellent facility through the application of industry leading
expertise and innovative technologies."

   Liquefied Natural Gas is one of the fastest growing energy
resources, supplying worldwide energy demand that is growing by 1.2
percent each year. Global LNG demand is expected to reach 480 MTA by
2030, an increase of 380 MTA since 2000.

   "Through the combination of advanced technology and strong project
expertise, ExxonMobil is helping to add significant new supplies of
energy to meet consumer demand," said Duffin. "This terminal will
provide Italy with the ability to access global LNG supplies."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds private equity, other details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michael Flaherty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Kookmin Bank 060000.KS has
hired Merrill Lynch, replacing Goldman Sachs, as lead adviser
to the South Korean lender's estimated $4 billion stake sale, a
deal that has attracted interest from private equity funds,
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman (GS.N) lost the advisory mandate a week after its
research analyst issued a sell rating on Kookmin shares on Aug.
30, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. Kookmin
shares have fallen 13 percent from the date the note was issued
through Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kookmin, the country's top retail lender, plans to convert
into a holding company structure on Sept. 29, a move that will
prompt two auctions for stakes in the group. Afterwards,
Kookmin will engage in a complex process of selling stakes over
the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kookmin, Goldman and Merrill declined to comment on the
mandate. A Kookmin official confirmed the Aug. 30 research
note, but declined to give any other details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kookmin Bank will have to sell a 5 percent stake within six
months, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Kookmin's holding group, the integrated company, will have a 12
percent stake up for grabs, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The holding company is expected to be publicly listed on
Oct. 10, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kookmin, with a market value of $16 billion, has to sell
the shares it owns in itself within the next three years under
domestic law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hwang Young-key, who leads the holding group, said last
week Kookmin was in talks with foreign institutions to sell the
shares it owns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; South Korea's merger and acquisition market has heated up
recently. Year to date, Goldman and Merrill are ranked four and
five respectively in the country's MA league table, according
to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill has five announced deals so far this year worth
$7.5 billion, Goldman has three, worth $7.7 billion, according
to Dealogic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman was also dropped as the preferred adviser for the
Daewoo Shipbuilding (042660.KS) auction earlier this year, a
deal that could fetch up to $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, Kookmin's stock was up 6.3 percent amid a rally
in the broader market and after HSBC (HSBA.L) (0005.HK)
withdrew its $6.3 billion offer for Korea Exchange Bank
004949.KS. Kookmin said it was watching the KEB situation
with interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citing industry sources, the Korea Economic Daily reported
this month that the Government of Singapore Investment Corp
(GIC) and Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui (8316.T) were in talks to
each acquire a 3-4 percent stake in Kookmin's holding company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The prospective sale would be part of Kookmin's efforts to
improve its capital base and boost foreign currency liquidity,
Jun Kwang-woo, chairman of South Korea's Financial Services
Commission, has said.

hired Merrill Lynch MER.N to advise the South Korean lender on
the sale of stakes in the group after its restructuring, sources
said on Friday, replacing Goldman Sachs as the lead advisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kookmin, the country's top retail lender, plans to convert
into a holding company structure on Sept. 29. That will prompt
two auctions for stakes in the group, which are estimated to
fetch $4 billion in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman (GS.N) lost the advisory mandate after its research
analyst issued a sell recommendation on Kookmin in late August, a
source familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After Sept. 29, the company will engage in a complicated
process of selling stakes over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kookmin Bank will have to sell a 5 percent stake within six
months, according to a source familiar with the matter. Kookmin's
holding group, the integrated company, will have a 12 percent
stake up for grabs, the source said. The holding company is
expected to be publicly listed on Oct. 10, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kookmin, with a current market capitalisation of $16 billion,
has to dispose of the shares it owns in itself within the next
three years under domestic law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hwang Young-key, who leads the holding group, said last week
that the company was in talks with foreign institutions to sell
the shares it owns. The South Korean government wants Kookmin's
stake sale to help draw more foreign currency into the country to
mitigate the won's KRW= decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; South Korea's merger and acquisition market has heated up
recently. Year to date, Goldman and Merrill are ranked four and
five respectively in the country's MA league tables, according
to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal is a big gain for Merrill and a loss for Goldman,
which was also dropped as the probable advisor for the Daewoo
Shipbuilding (042660.KS) auction earlier this year, a deal that
could fetch up to $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daewoo's top shareholder, Korea Development Bank, said at the
time that Goldman could not accept the company's requests related
to the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the case of Kookmin however, neither the bank nor Goldman
will publicly say why Goldman was replaced. Both declined to
comment on the mandate. Merrill also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a source familiar with the matter said Goldman was
dropped only after its analyst issued a "sell" recommendation on
Kookmin's shares on Aug. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Kookmin official confirmed the Aug. 30 research note but

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) blamed short sellers for their problems this week, an interesting twist for two investment banks known for making money from short sellers and even betting on weakening shares themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Morgan Stanley and Goldman took a real beating in the middle of this week. The market activity seemed to threaten Morgan Stanley's survival, forcing the investment bank to consider selling itself. If Goldman's shares had fallen long enough, it could have looked at similar measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while pursuing capital, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive John Mack also lobbied the government for relief, which arrived on Friday, when the Securities and Exchange Commission took the highly unusual step of banning short-selling in 799 financial stocks, including Morgan Stanley and Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall market cheered the move, but some investors were not pleased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I did not hear the big Wall Street banks complaining until short sellers began shorting the financial stocks," said Harry Strunk, partner at Treflie Capital Management, which invests in hedge funds that short, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs believe there is a difference between the shorting of their shares, and the shorting they facilitate for clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both banks believe they are the victims of "bear raids," where short sellers gang up on a stock to try to push its shares lower, rather than having a considered investment thesis. Short sellers bet a company's shares will drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's happening out there? It's very clear to me -- we're in the midst of a market controlled by fear and rumors, and short sellers are driving our stock down," wrote Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack in a memo obtained by Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conspiring with other investors to manipulate a share price is illegal, as is knowingly spreading false rumors to move a stock price. But so far no evidence has emerged publicly that any such thing has happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some hedge funds believe that Morgan Stanley and Goldman were not victims, but were instead legitimately reevaluated by a world where investors are increasingly skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We get very little disclosure from investment banks about their positions, and when savvy banks looked inside Bear's and Lehman's kimonos, they didn't like what they saw," said James Ellman, president at hedge fund Seacliff Capital. "It's rational to lose faith."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Morgan Stanley said the bank has been fully transparent about its mortgage-related exposures and has broken out the write-downs it has taken on each asset category within its mortgage business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skepticism about investment banks has run high for some time, reaching a fever pitch this year as Bear Stearns faced a run on the bank, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, and Merrill Lynch  Co MER.N agreed to sell itself to Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short sellers are key clients for Goldman and Morgan Stanley, but quantifying their importance is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some clues as to the importance of short sellers to both firms. Morgan Stanley and Goldman are top firms in prime brokerage, which entails trading and financing securities for hedge funds, including helping them short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advisory firm TABB Group estimated earlier this year that prime brokerage in the United States alone would generate $11.5 billion of revenue for banks. The group surveyed 61 hedge funds with an average of $4.3 billion under management, and more than half had a prime brokerage relationship with either Goldman or Morgan Stanley or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OVERSTATED ASSETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faith is in short supply after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK filed for bankruptcy on Monday. That investment bank had sparred for months with short-sellers who accused the firm of understating its bad assets, even as Lehman said it was strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short sellers turned out to be right -- last weekend, prospective buyers that scrutinized Lehman's books refused to buy the firm because there were too many toxic assets, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Goldman have successfully fended off short sellers for now. Their shares surged 20 percent on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And ticking off some of the short-selling clients may be a small price to pay, said Brad Alford, president at investment advisor Alpha Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hedge funds are getting nailed today, which will hurt Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, but at least their shares won't go to zero now," Alford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Svea Herbst in Boston and Michael Flaherty in Hong Kong; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve released the following statement on Sunday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve Board on Sunday approved, pending a statutory five-day antitrust waiting period, the applications of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to become bank holding companies. To provide increased liquidity support to these firms as they transition to managing their funding within a bank holding company structure, the Federal Reserve Board authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to extend credit to the U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley against all types of collateral that may be pledged at the Federal Reserve's primary credit facility for depository institutions or at the existing Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF); the Federal Reserve has also made these collateral arrangements available to the broker-dealer subsidiary of Merrill Lynch. In addition, the Board also authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to extend credit to the London-based broker-dealer subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch against collateral that would be eligible to be pledged at the PDCF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) today announced that it
will become the fourth largest Bank Holding Company and will be
regulated by the Federal Reserve.

   In recent weeks, particularly in view of market developments,
Goldman Sachs has discussed with the Federal Reserve our intention to
be regulated as a Bank Holding Company. We understand that the market
views oversight by the Federal Reserve and the ability to source
insured bank deposits as providing a greater degree of safety and
soundness. We view regulation by the Federal Reserve Board as
appropriate and in the best interests of protecting and growing our
franchise across our diverse range of businesses.

   Since the spring of this year, the Federal Reserve has been
reviewing our liquidity and funding profile, capital adequacy and
overall risk management framework. We are pleased that the Federal
Reserve recognizes the strength and health of our liquidity and
funding and the overall quality of our risk management. We have
maintained our Tier 1 capital levels well above the Federal Reserve's
"well-capitalized" threshold of 6 percent since these ratios were
first calculated in 2004. For the past several quarters, in light of
the difficult market environment, we have been reducing our risk
exposures and increasing our capitalization. Our Tier 1 capital ratio
at the end of the third quarter was 11.6 percent.

   "When Goldman Sachs was a private partnership, we made the
decision to become a public company, recognizing the need for
permanent capital to meet the demands of scale. While accelerated by
market sentiment, our decision to be regulated by the Federal Reserve
is based on the recognition that such regulation provides its members
with full prudential supervision and access to permanent liquidity and
funding," said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs.
"We believe that Goldman Sachs, under Federal Reserve supervision,
will be regarded as an even more secure institution with an
exceptionally clean balance sheet and a greater diversity of funding
sources."

   Goldman Sachs already has two active deposit taking institutions -
Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe PLC - which,
together, hold more than $20 billion in customer deposits. We are
moving assets from a number of strategic businesses, including our
lending businesses, into GS Bank USA. With over $150 billion in
assets, GS Bank USA will be one of the ten largest banks in the United
States. While these assets are fully funded for term, they also are
available to be funded by the Federal Reserve. We intend to grow our
deposit base through acquisitions and organically.

   Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking, securities
and investment management firm that provides a wide range of services
worldwide to a substantial and diversified client base that includes
corporations, financial institutions, governments and high net worth
individuals. Founded in 1869, it is one of the oldest and largest
investment banking firms. The firm is headquartered in New York and
maintains offices in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong and other
major financial centers around the world.

348,500 barrel per day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery
restarted a portion of its electrical cogenerating unit late

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Sep 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Scientists at the IBM (NYSE: IBM) Almaden Research Center in San Jose, CA
have forged a breakthrough in understanding an intriguing phenomenon in
fundamental physics: the Kondo effect. They report their findings today in
the scientific journal Nature Physics.

    The Kondo effect, one of the few examples in physics where many particles
collectively behave as one object (a single quantum-mechanical body), has
intrigued scientists around the world for decades. Now, using a technique
that was developed by the same team in 2007, the IBM researchers have
shown, for the first time anywhere, that it is possible to predict when
the Kondo effect will occur -- and to understand why.

    The key turns out to be in the geometry of a magnetic atom's immediate
surroundings. By carefully studying how this geometry influences the
magnetic moment (or "spin") of the atom, the emergence of the Kondo effect
can now be predicted and understood. This result represents a major
advancement in fundamental physics.

    The achievement is one of the latest in IBM's more than two decades of
nanotechnology leadership and exploration of the world of magnetism at
the atomic scale. Starting with the invention of the Scanning Tunneling
Microscope (STM) in 1981, IBM has been at the forefront of research aimed
at expanding our abilities to investigate and manipulate individual atoms.

    A look at the Kondo Effect

    When a single magnetic atom is located inside a metal, the free electrons
of the metal 'screen' the atom. That way, a cloud of many electrons around
the atom becomes magnetized. Sometimes, if the metal is cooled down to
very low temperatures, the atomic spin enters a so-called 'quantum
superposition' state. In this state its north-pole points in two opposite
directions at the same time. As a result, the entire electron cloud around
the spin will also be simultaneously magnetized in two directions.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs energy equities analyst Arjun Murti, one of the first to predict $100 a barrel crude, cut his 2009 oil price forecast to $110 from $140 a barrel this week due to global economic weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have moderated our 2008 and 2009 oil price forecasts both to account for the recent pullback and better reflect oil demand uncertainty," Goldman Sachs said in a research note prepared by Murti and other Goldman analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murti roiled oil markets in 2005 by forecasting oil above $100 a barrel -- a prediction that came true late in 2007. Murti said earlier this year crude oil prices could rise further to $150-$200 a barrel before the end of 2009 in what he called a "super spike."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our bullish oil macro framework has been based on the fairly straightforward logic that in an environment of limited spare capacity and lackluster supply growth, prices would need to rise to ration demand down to levels of available supply," Goldman said in the note released Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the essence of this call remains intact. However, over the next several quarters, we now see slowing global GDP growth as being the driver of weaker demand, reducing the need for high and rising prices to ration demand," Goldman said in the note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's commodity research team, which sometimes carries oil price forecasts that differ from Murti's equities-focused group, said earlier in the week it slashed its average 2009 U.S. crude oil forecast by $25 to $123 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Richard Valdmanis, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has cut
the selling price in China of one of its software products by
over 70 percent to counter rampant piracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It is the first special offer since Microsoft entered the
Chinese market in 1992, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it had slashed the price for Office 2007 Home
and Student Edition to 199 yuan ($29) from 699 yuan ($102). The
promotion, which started on Monday, will last through next week's
National Week holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The price cut is designed to make Microsoft's products in
China more affordable and more promotions are likely in future,
said Jim Lin, the company's public relations manager in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With this price, we believe more customers can enjoy
authorised software products," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Violation of intellectual property rights has been a running
sore in China's relations with its trading partners, including
the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. movie, music, software and book industry groups alone
estimate they lost $3.5 billion in China due to piracy last year,
three times more than in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's largest software firm, is among the
hardest-hit victims. Pirated versions of Microsoft's Office
software can sell in China for less than 10 yuan ($1.50).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month police detained the operator of a website, "Tomato
Garden", from which millions of pirated versions of Microsoft
software had been downloaded, according to media reports.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of several major U.S. banks suffered steep declines Monday as investors speculated that Wachovia Corp WB.N won't merge with Morgan Stanley (MS.N), while JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) were downgraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In afternoon trading, Wachovia shares were down $3.90, or 21 percent, at $14.85; JPMorgan fell $6.08, or 13 percent, to $40.96, while Wells Fargo fell $5.26, or 13.2 percent, to  $34.54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 24-member KBW Bank Index .BKX was down 10 percent in afternoon trading. It had risen 28.2 percent on Thursday and Friday combined, as the government announced a series of measures to calm financial markets and stabilize lenders, now including plans to buy as much as $700 billion of troubled assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sector got the adrenaline shot last week, and that's wearing off," said Michael Nix, who helps invest $750 million at Greenwood Capital Associates LLC in Greenwood, South Carolina. "The near-term outlook for financials still remains pretty difficult."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Wachovia and Wells Fargo are respectively the third-, fourth- and fifth-largest U.S. banks by assets. Shares of larger banks Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) also fell as the broader market tanked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia shares declined after Morgan Stanley won U.S. Federal Reserve approval to become a bank holding company, boosting its ability to attract deposits. Morgan Stanley also agreed to sell a possible $8.5 billion stake to Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both moves increased the Wall Street bank's perceived ability to survive independently, without merging with a lender with a more stable funding base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia Chief Executive Robert Steel is trying to shed non-core assets, cut 11,350 jobs and reduce annual costs by $1.5 billion as the bank manages a "distressed" $122 billion portfolio of option adjustable-rate mortgages. Even so, Wachovia shares more than doubled on Thursday and Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nix said not merging with Morgan Stanley could even be positive for Wachovia. "It will allow Robert Steel to focus on Wachovia and fix the franchise, without having to integrate a significant merger at the same time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia was also downgraded to "hold" from "buy" by Stifel Nicolaus  Co analyst Christopher Mutascio, who called the bank's recent share run-up "too much too soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo were downgraded by Sandler O'Neill  Partners LP analysts, who said their stock valuations already reflected the banks' positions as among the best-run and best-performing large banks in a tough credit environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Jeff Harte downgraded JPMorgan to "hold" from "buy," while Scott Siefers cut Wells Fargo to "sell" from "hold." Wells Fargo shares had hit a record high on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia is based in Charlotte, North Carolina; JPMorgan in New York, and Wells Fargo in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are not the companies they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both became bank holding companies on Sunday evening and both will be able to sell assets into a new $700 billion government fund for distressed debt. Early Monday, Morgan Stanley agreed to sell up to 20 percent of itself to Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are unsure about what all this means.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters.com) -- John Talbott, a former investment banker for Goldman Sachs, isn't so sure transforming Goldman and Morgan Stanley into bank holding companies will preserve their independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It won't be enough on its own, he said in a Q  A with Reuters.com. "We'll have to see what happens with TARP," he said, referring to the "troubled asset relief program" rescue directed by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. "If you have a trillion-dollar balance sheet and $40 billion of book equity and now in market cap of equity, it doesn't take selling many assets at a loss to wipe out your equity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talbott is the author of five books, including "Obamanomics: How Bottom-Up Economic Prosperity Will Replace Trickle-Down Economics" this year. In 2003, he wrote "the Coming Crash in the Housing Market" on the financial problems facing the banks as well as mortgage finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: What are the ramifications of this change in regulatory status to a banking holding company?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talbott: Goldman Sachs gives up a lot by becoming a bank holding company, especially as they are going to be much more closely regulated. They're going to have to reduce their leverage dramatically and it's not clear that a number of businesses they're in can be supported by a bank model, given their riskiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't see that the re-identification of Goldman Sachs as a bank gets them very much. On the plus side, technically, it must make them easier to be acquired by other banks. It sounds like it's probably easier to inject capital into them and buy assets from them under the TARP plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the problems with the bailout are significant and aren't just faced by Goldman Sachs. This is not a liquidity crisis; this is just like Japan in 1991. This is a bad loan problem and a failure by the banks to recognize those losses because it threatens their solvency. Going in and buying a bunch of assets from these banks and investment banks at 30 cents to the dollar makes the problem worse, not better. The problem does not go away if you are a financial institution that decides not to take any government money under TARP. TARP, through their reverse auctions, will create a market price and it will be difficult for these other banks not to have to mark their assets to this new mark. TARP may cause more immediate recognition of losses than the banks want and end up causing more insolvencies and bankruptcies than it prevents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question for Goldman is how can they possibly reduce leverage by half and what does it mean for the existing book of businesses. A lot of people have claimed Goldman Sachs is the gold standard. Maybe they have been on profits to date but they certainly aren't the gold standard on their risk profile, on the short-term nature of their cap structure and the businesses they've entered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: Bear Stearns was bailed out; Lehman is in bankruptcy; Merrill Lynch put itself up for sale and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are becoming banks. Which of these transformations makes the most sense?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talbott: The only one that makes any sense at all is Bank of America buying Merrill Lynch. When I say it makes sense, I mean there's a higher probability of long-term survival for Merrill Lynch and Bank of America. But these problems are so serious that one cannot presume that Bank of America is big enough to weather an acquisition like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: What businesses at Goldman Sachs might not survive the change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talbott: The obvious candidate to reduce leverage is to get out of a lot of the trading businesses -- they are very asset heavy -- but imagine what that does to profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying they exit completely from trading -- they have to have some trading to support their public offering business from the investment banking side. But I don't see how they can go forward without paring back the big, big bond trading businesses and take them out as profit generators and just run a much more lean operation to support the investment banking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: You worked on Wall Street in the 1980s. What does the break in the investment banking model mean for the business of finance in New York?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talbott: A lot of the headlines now declare that this is the end of Wall Street. Back when I was on Wall Street, these were much smaller firms and they were much more focused on the investment banking front. People never understood how they could compete with the big commercial banks in the world. The reason was pretty straight forward. It was an entrepreneurial culture that attracted the best people and paid them well. They didn't want to work in a commercial bank with all the bureaucracy. Now, if that opportunity leaves because of this, it's sad. As for investment banking, and by that I mean the advisory business to our largest corporations, I guess it will fold into bigger commercial and international banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings is evaluating the potential short- and long-term
rating implications of both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley against
recent market events and their recent change in status as Financial
Holding Companies.

   Fitch currently rates both entities as follows:

   --Long-term IDR 'AA-';

   --Senior debt 'AA-';

   --Short-term IDR 'F1+'

   --Individual 'B'

   --Support '5'.

   --Support Floor 'NF'.

   The Rating Outlook on Morgan Stanley's long-term IDR is Negative,
while the Rating Outlook is Stable for Goldman Sachs' long-term IDR.

   Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are now under direct supervision
of the Federal Reserve. Conditions of approval included strong
liquidity and being well-capitalized under current regulatory
requirements. These conditions are consistent with Fitch's current
ratings.

   Ratings impact will be measured against several positive
expectations, including:

   --Reduced leverage;

   --Permanent and direct access to the Federal Reserve Discount
window;

   --Greater efficiencies in counterparty netting with a potential
for fewer legal entities and less trapped regulatory capital; and

   --Potential of the Paulson plan to provide an opportunity to shed
higher risk assets.

   Both firms will benefit from direct access to the Fed Discount
window and while the primary dealer credit facility (PDCF) is similar,
they benefit from the permanency and broader collateral eligibility at
the Fed Discount Window, including the ability to pledge whole loans.
The firms already possess bank charters that may be converted from
industrial loan companies to national or state banks. A national bank
charter would relieve the firms from branching restrictions. In
addition, branching internationally may reduce the multiple legal
entities in various jurisdictions, allowing more counterparty netting
which could then lower collateral and contingency funding requirements
and concerns.

   Fitch will evaluate other benefits of financial holding company
status in addition to any changes in the overall risk appetites of
these institutions and subsequent profitability. The transition to and
ongoing development of the universal bank model has not been an
automatic success for other firms in the industry. Current global
economic conditions add to the challenges.

   Capital has been adequate under Fitch's leverage expectations and
strong under regulatory capital rules of the Securities Exchange
Commission. Both institutions have obtained approval to use internal
models to evaluate both market and credit risks and reported high
levels of Tier 1 capital for the past two quarters. Fitch also notes
however; that the reporting of strong capital ratios has not been
sufficiently convincing for other investment banks to garner
additional capital. Equity and CDS prices have had substantial
influence on financial flexibility across several financial
institutions not just broker dealers in this extreme environment. In
certain cases, this has increased the risk of liquidity calls placing
significant financial pressures on several firms. Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley may experience some liquidity and capital pressures
despite the strength of core performance as they respond to
counterparties' discomfort with the broker dealer business model.

   Fitch expects trading operations to continue to be reliant on
secured and unsecured funding sources and dependent upon prudent
management of collateral and appropriate evaluations of client risk.
The tenor and diversification of both secured and unsecured sources of
funding remain very relevant. Fitch will evaluate the firms' plans for
usage of retail deposits, legal entity constructs and alternative
sources of funds. An important element of this review will be
regulatory tolerance for usage of retail deposits in trading
operations and what, if any, compensating factors will be required to
mitigate inherent risks.

   Fitch will also evaluate any changes to risk appetite, business
model and legal entities. Potential efficiencies through consolidation
and greater use of netting may improve liquidity and or reduce capital
requirements. Fitch will evaluate the extent to which business
strategies are modified and capital needs change. Profitability may be
negatively impacted by lower leverage and reduced risk appetite.
Innovation may also be hampered by reduced incentives either through
equity ownership or other compensation. Ratings may be negatively
affected or wider notching employed for select issues based on capital
composition. These firms will continue to be evaluated against a broad
peer group of complex financial institutions.

   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings
are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.
Published ratings, criteria and methodologies are available from this
site, at all times. Fitch's code of conduct, confidentiality,
conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance and other
relevant policies and procedures are also available from the 'Code of
Conduct' section of this site.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Nike Inc (NKE.N) said on Monday they plan to buy back up to $53 billion of their own shares at a time when most U.S. companies are slowing the rate of share repurchases to hoard cash over liquidity concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it plans to buy back up to $40 billion of its own stock over the next five years, while HP plans to repurchase up to $8 billion worth of its own stock and Nike unveiled a $5 billion share buyback program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent market declines have driven down valuations, making share buybacks a more attractive use of capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howard Silverblatt, a senior analyst at Standard  Poor's, said many cash-rich companies are holding tightly to their cash during the financial market turbulence with buybacks falling below $100 billion in the second quarter, the lowest levels since the third quarter of 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are choosing not to spend a lot on share buybacks," said Silverblatt, noting that many companies are now only buying back shares to offset share dilution, not to drive down the share count to raise earnings per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many companies also opt not to use the entire share buyback allotment authorized to them by their board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most cash-rich companies in the tech industry, Microsoft introduced a $2 billion commercial paper program and said it may issue as much as $6 billion of debt. Standard  Poor's and Moody's Investors Service assigned their top credit ratings to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The openness to debt was the most surprising of this morning's announcements and is a positive signal of management's increasing openness to developing a more efficient capital structure," wrote Charles Di Bona, a research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 33 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $25.39 on the Nasdaq. The stock is down 27 percent in the year to date, compared with a 16 percent slide on the SP 500 and the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which had $23.7 billion in cash on its balance sheet at the end of June, also said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 13 cents a share, up from 11 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been aggressive in buying back shares. It started a $36.2 billion five-year share repurchase program in 2006, but spent that amount in two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the fourth quarter of 2004, Microsoft has repurchased $67 billion of its own stock, according to SP. By comparison, H-P has bought back nearly $30 billion worth of stock while Nike has repurchased $3.4 billion of its own shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP, the world's largest PC manufacturer, said its latest share repurchase authorization comes on top of the $8 billion buyback program approved by the board in November 2007. The company had $14.8 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of July 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The way we look at it is a vote of confidence in the company's ability to generate strong cash flow and also a vote of confidence in its stock price," said Shaw Wu, analyst at American Technology in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stock price has held up really well -- they feel it's undervalued and feel it's a good use of their cash. Any vote of confidence in this climate is a good thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP shares, which have fallen 6 percent, fell $1.12, or 2.3 percent, to $47.14 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Nike shares were down 13 cents on the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Lawsky and Alexandria Sage in San Francisco, Franklin Paul and Martinne Geller in New York; Editing by Brian Moss and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of several major U.S. banks suffered steep declines Monday as investors speculated that Wachovia Corp WB.N won't merge with Morgan Stanley (MS.N), while JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) were downgraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In afternoon trading, Wachovia shares were down $3.90, or 21 percent, at $14.85; JPMorgan fell $6.08, or 13 percent, to $40.96, while Wells Fargo fell $5.26, or 13.2 percent, to $34.54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 24-member KBW Bank Index .BKX was down 10 percent in afternoon trading. It had risen 28.2 percent on Thursday and Friday combined, as the government announced a series of measures to calm financial markets and stabilize lenders, now including plans to buy as much as $700 billion of troubled assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sector got the adrenaline shot last week, and that's wearing off," said Michael Nix, who helps invest $750 million at Greenwood Capital Associates LLC in Greenwood, South Carolina. "The near-term outlook for financials still remains pretty difficult."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Wachovia and Wells Fargo are respectively the third-, fourth- and fifth-largest U.S. banks by assets. Shares of larger banks Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) also fell as the broader market tanked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia shares declined after Morgan Stanley won U.S. Federal Reserve approval to become a bank holding company, boosting its ability to attract deposits. Morgan Stanley also agreed to sell a possible $8.5 billion stake to Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both moves increased the Wall Street bank's perceived ability to survive independently, without merging with a lender with a more stable funding base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia Chief Executive Robert Steel is trying to shed non-core assets, cut 11,350 jobs and reduce annual costs by $1.5 billion as the bank manages a "distressed" $122 billion portfolio of option adjustable-rate mortgages. Even so, Wachovia shares more than doubled on Thursday and Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nix said not merging with Morgan Stanley could even be positive for Wachovia. "It will allow Robert Steel to focus on Wachovia and fix the franchise, without having to integrate a significant merger at the same time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia was also downgraded to "hold" from "buy" by Stifel Nicolaus  Co analyst Christopher Mutascio, who called the bank's recent share run-up "too much too soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo were downgraded by Sandler O'Neill  Partners LP analysts, who said their stock valuations already reflected the banks' positions as among the best-run and best-performing large banks in a tough credit environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Jeff Harte downgraded JPMorgan to "hold" from "buy," while Scott Siefers cut Wells Fargo to "sell" from "hold." Wells Fargo shares had hit a record high on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia is based in Charlotte, North Carolina; JPMorgan in New York, and Wells Fargo in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK (Reuters.com) -- John Talbott, a former investment 
banker for Goldman Sachs, isn't so sure transforming Goldman 
and Morgan Stanley into bank holding companies will preserve 
their independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It won't be enough on its own, he said in a Q  A with 
Reuters.com. "We'll have to see what happens with TARP," he 
said, referring to the "troubled asset relief program" rescue 
directed by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. "If you have a 
trillion-dollar balance sheet and $40 billion of book equity 
and now in market cap of equity, it doesn't take selling many 
assets at a loss to wipe out your equity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talbott is the author of five books, including 
"Obamanomics: How Bottom-Up Economic Prosperity Will Replace 
Trickle-Down Economics" this year. In 2003, he wrote "the 
Coming Crash in the Housing Market" on the financial problems 
facing the banks as well as mortgage finance firms Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: What are the ramifications of this change in regulatory 
status to a banking holding company?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talbott: Goldman Sachs gives up a lot by becoming a bank 
holding company, especially as they are going to be much more 
closely regulated. They're going to have to reduce their 
leverage dramatically and it's not clear that a number of 
businesses they're in can be supported by a bank model, given 
their riskiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't see that the re-identification of Goldman Sachs as 
a bank gets them very much. On the plus side, technically, it 
must make them easier to be acquired by other banks. It sounds 
like it's probably easier to inject capital into them and buy 
assets from them under the TARP plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the problems with the bailout are significant and 
aren't just faced by Goldman Sachs. This is not a liquidity 
crisis; this is just like Japan in 1991. This is a bad loan 
problem and a failure by the banks to recognize those losses 
because it threatens their solvency. Going in and buying a 
bunch of assets from these banks and investment banks at 30 
cents to the dollar makes the problem worse, not better. The 
problem does not go away if you are a financial institution 
that decides not to take any government money under TARP. TARP, 
through their reverse auctions, will create a market price and 
it will be difficult for these other banks not to have to mark 
their assets to this new mark. TARP may cause more immediate 
recognition of losses than the banks want and end up causing 
more insolvencies and bankruptcies than it prevents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The question for Goldman is how can they possibly reduce 
leverage by half and what does it mean for the existing book of 
businesses. A lot of people have claimed Goldman Sachs is the 
gold standard. Maybe they have been on profits to date but they 
certainly aren't the gold standard on their risk profile, on 
the short-term nature of their cap structure and the businesses 
they've entered.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: Bear Stearns was bailed out; Lehman is in bankruptcy; 
Merrill Lynch put itself up for sale and Goldman Sachs and 
Morgan Stanley are becoming banks. Which of these 
transformations makes the most sense?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talbott: The only one that makes any sense at all is Bank 
of America buying Merrill Lynch. When I say it makes sense, I 
mean there's a higher probability of long-term survival for 
Merrill Lynch and Bank of America. But these problems are so 
serious that one cannot presume that Bank of America is big 
enough to weather an acquisition like that.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: What businesses at Goldman Sachs might not survive the 
change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talbott: The obvious candidate to reduce leverage is to get 
out of a lot of the trading businesses -- they are very asset 
heavy -- but imagine what that does to profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not saying they exit completely from trading -- they 
have to have some trading to support their public offering 
business from the investment banking side. But I don't see how 
they can go forward without paring back the big, big bond 
trading businesses and take them out as profit generators and 
just run a much more lean operation to support the investment 
banking business.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: You worked on Wall Street in the 1980s. What does the 
break in the investment banking model mean for the business of 
finance in New York?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talbott: A lot of the headlines now declare that this is 
the end of Wall Street. Back when I was on Wall Street, these 
were much smaller firms and they were much more focused on the 
investment banking front. People never understood how they 
could compete with the big commercial banks in the world. The 
reason was pretty straight forward. It was an entrepreneurial 
culture that attracted the best people and paid them well. They 
didn't want to work in a commercial bank with all the 
bureaucracy. Now, if that opportunity leaves because of this, 
it's sad. As for investment banking, and by that I mean the 
advisory business to our largest corporations, I guess it will 
fold into bigger commercial and international banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SAN MATEO, CA, Sep 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Researchers at IBM's (NYSE: IBM) Silicon Valley Lab have teamed with
educators from San Jose State University, California State University
Long Beach and Sacramento State University campuses, Illinois State
University and Tongii University in Shanghai, China to develop new
courses that provide students with marketable business and IT skills for
the mainframe.

    This first-ever collaboration of this type between IBM and these
universities will help increase and prepare the number of qualified job
candidates entering the workforce. According to labor analysis firm
SkillPROOF, the average number of job openings for IT professionals in
California increased 60 percent since 2004. This amounted to about 16,220
jobs, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor. Employers are seeking job
candidates with a balance of business skills such as consulting and
management combined with specific "hot" mainframe skills including
database administration, SOA and virtualization, to fill these positions.

    IBM and the partner universities are creating four courses focused on
using and configuring IBM's DB2 and database applications running on the
IBM System z mainframe, the most powerful enterprise computer platform in
the world today.

    This project is part of IBM's continued commitment to cultivate and grow
opportunities for database engineers, systems integrators, and business
process consulting experts for the mainframe computing environment.

    This Fall and Spring, San Jose State University expects several dozen
students to complete its newly created Intro to DB2 for z/OS course which
is also currently being taught at Tongjii University in Shanghai, China.
California State University in Long Beach and Illinois State University
both plan to incorporate the course into their respective Enterprise
Computing programs this winter with other schools to follow. The remaining
three courses will be available later this year and into 2009 at all four
institutions. Topics include: Application Development for DB2 on System z
and Optimization and SQL Performance for DB2 for z/OS. IBM is currently
putting a team together to develop a fourth course called DB2 for z/OS
Database Administration to be completed in Fall, 2009.

    All courses were developed by the cross IBM - University team focused on
developing key skills such as using and configuring DB2 and database
applications on the mainframe.

    "IBM is building skills for globally integrated enterprises by fostering
collaboration between worldwide academic teams who are developing enhanced
courses on skill areas that are in increasing demand, such as database
engineering and mainframe experts," said Gene Fuh, Distinguished Engineer
at IBM Silicon Valley Lab who oversees the collaboration. "As companies
have grown more complex, there is a need to have a more detailed
understanding of data generated by the organization. Helping companies
unlock the value of data is what IBM's Information on Demand strategy is
all about. Since IBM has built a track record of growing mainframe and
database skills in emerging markets, the company is teaming with
California's state universities to do the same in this hot job market
area."

    "IBM's first ever academic collaboration to develop courses that combine
the complexities of databases and mainframes will give students an
opportunity to get exposed to the kind of in-depth knowledge that will set
them apart from their peers," says Amy Cho, a graduate student from San
Jose State University who is preparing for a career in database quality
assurance. "It's difficult for a company to hire new graduates that have
no knowledge of these systems whatsoever. They'll have an advantage if
they take these well structured classes to ease them into the industry."

    Besides teaming on all four courses, San Jose State University is one of
the first schools in California to implement a new interdisciplinary
approach to curriculum design called Science Service Management and
Engineering (SSME) with over 60 students taking part so far. The SSME
approach gives business students exposure to key IT skills, while
engineering students obtain a greater understanding of business dynamics.
As a result, employers can tap higher value job candidates for IT
positions.

    Similarly, more than 300 business students at San Francisco State
University, San Jose State University and the University of Southern
California are now learning Business Process Management (BPM) skills with
IBM's "serious video game" called Innov8. Innov8 simulates real-world
business challenges using a video game environment to bridge gaps in
understanding between business leaders and IT teams in an organization. As
the 'gamer' generation enters business, computer science and engineering
college classes, professors are using IBM's Innov8 as a teaching tool to
attract and maintain student interest in services science such as Service
Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Business Process Management (BPM).

    "In a fast paced, globally-integrated business world, IT skills are
important for a wide range of graduates around the world. In particular
Computer Science and Computer Engineering graduates should have these
skills as well as IT and MIS graduates. This is why it is crucial for
academia and the industry to work together to get these skills into the
classroom, whether it is China or Silicon Valley, and whether it is CS or
IT," said Kenneth Louden, Professor and Chair of the Computer Science
Department at San Jose State University.

    Virtual access to DB2 for z Skills

    IBM Academic Initiative members can now participate in the new Information
Management instructor-led, online (ILO) training courses focused on data
management. These courses allow members to interact with the instructor
and other students in a remote classroom environment enabled by Citrix
software. Students can also use voice-over-internet protocol (VoIP) to
communicate with instructors and classmates -- saving travel time and
travel costs while advancing their skills. These resources can be found
at: http://www.ibm.com/university/scholars/products/data/education.html

    In addition, two of the courses developed by international academic teams
on the topics of Application Development and Optimization and SQL
Performance covering both DB2 and System z will also be offered online in
2009 through IBM's Academic Initiative's website.

    IBM Academic Initiative faculty members world-wide can access over 1000
other hardware, software and services training resources at no cost by
visiting: ibm.com/university/scholars/academicinitiative/

    IBM Academic Initiative members may also participate in hands-on training
sessions at any of its 40 IBM Innovation Centers worldwide. For more

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Standard  Poor's and Moody's Investors Service on Monday assigned their top credit ratings to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) after the company unveiled plans to tap the debt market with its first issue of commercial paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SP said it is the first 'AAA' rating it has assigned in 10 years to a U.S. corporate issuer. Only five U.S. nonfinancial issuers currently hold triple-A ratings from SP, compared with about 30 in the early 1980s, reflecting an overall deterioration in credit quality in corporate America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top investment-grade ratings from credit agencies typically mean a borrower has lower borrowing costs than others further down the scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 70 percent of SP ratings for U.S. nonfinancial companies are currently below investment grade and classified as "junk", or speculative-grade bonds. That's up from 32 percent in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Assigning a 'AAA' rating to Microsoft is a rare development in U.S. credit history and represents an unusual combination of qualities that are shared by few others companies," SP analyst Nicholas Riccio said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top investment-grade rating came after the company unveiled a $2 billion commercial paper program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft's strengths, SP cited factors including the size and scope of its business, its dominant competitive position and strong growth outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has also maintained a level of financial conservatism that reflects very limited credit risk," SP analyst Nicholas Riccio said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moody's said it has assigned a senior unsecured rating of 'Aaa' and a short-term rating for commercial paper of 'Prime-1' to Microsoft. Microsoft carried an issuer rating from Moody's from 1999 to 2004. The company had an 'Aa2' rating, or third-highest investment grade, when it was withdrawn in September, 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new ratings are backed by more than $22 billion in operating profit and over $14 billion of free cash flow for the fiscal year to June, Moody's said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft derives additional credit strength from the 'stickiness" of its installed base that contributes to long product cycles in terms of both development and adoption, which is supported by a recurring revenue stream that approximates 30 percent of total revenue," said Moody's analyst Richard Lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result, the company is well positioned to address the general challenges related to technology evolution and substitution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's $2 billion commercial paper program will be supported by $2 billion of committed revolving credit facilities, "reflecting financial conservatism that is consistent with the highest credit rating," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said earlier its board has authorized it to tap the debt market from time to time for up $6 billion in funds. As part of that approval, the company has established the $2 billion commercial paper program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will use net proceeds from any financings for general corporate purposes, including funding for working capital and share buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company made the announcement as it unveiled a fresh share buyback program of up to $40 billion and said it is raising its quarterly dividend to 13 cents a share from 11 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Walker Simon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  DUBLIN, IRELAND, Sep 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) has selected IBM (NYSE: IBM) to
create and implement the infrastructure for an Integrated Ticketing
System (ITS) across all public transport in the greater Dublin area. The
e-payment system will enable commuters to use a single pre-paid smart
card for travel on all buses, trains, trams and coaches in the city. The
next generation automatic fare collection solution has the capacity to
process up to 2 million transactions a day and can be extended to include
other value added services such as Internet top-ups and micro-retail
payments.

    The new system is part of Ireland's "Transport 21" project, the largest
investment ever in the country's transport system. Ireland plans to invest
a total of 34 billion euro until the year 2015, to deliver world class
transport to its citizens.

    The ITS system eliminates the need to carry cash to pay for tickets,
ensures fast, secure and convenient transactions and the smart card is
simply "re-charged" as needed. It also makes for seamless travel and
transfers across different operators and modes of transport and enables
flexible fares and ticket products. The integrated IBM back-office system
will provide ticket and smart card management, central reconciliation and
settlement services to all public transport providers.

    David O'Callaghan, Chairman of the Integrated Ticketing Project Board,
which is tasked with overseeing the project, welcomed this significant
development. "We are delighted to be able to link up with such a
significant scheme as Singapore and to have a world leader like IBM
overseeing the development," said O'Callaghan.

    The ITS Solution to be implemented in Dublin will use IBM's proven
technology platform running Integrated Ticketing application software from
MSI Global from Singapore. In 2006, Singapore chose the IBM technology
platform to support its customized smart card e-payment infrastructure and
enable the long-term growth of the public transport ticketing system.

    "With this project we are helping the Irish authorities to maximize the
utilization of existing public transport assets across all modes of
transport, while helping to ease the commute for consumers," says Dermot
Walsh, Partner, Global Business Services, IBM Ireland. "IBM's intelligent
transportation solutions are already helping many other cities and
transport authorities worldwide to begin addressing the issues of keeping
cities sustainable."

    In addition to working with the city of Dublin, IBM is also assisting the
cities of London, Stockholm, Singapore and Brisbane, to meet traffic
management and congestion challenges. IBM has established a global team of
professionals working on a range of technologies and solutions, including
researching, testing and developing new Intelligent Transport system
management capabilities.

    Work on the Dublin project begins immediately and a phased deployment of
the live system will system will begin in late 2009.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Investors should sell U.S. mid-sized regional banks' shares and take profits as these stocks may only have an indirect benefit from the U.S. government's rescue plan for troubled banks, a J.P. Morgan Securities analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities have proposed a $700 billion bailout plan, which will help troubled banks to offload hundreds of billions of dollars of bad debt from their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, analyst Steven Alexopoulos said once the temporary ban on short selling financials is lifted, a better buying opportunity will likely be created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks with residential construction portfolios in Nevada, Arizona and Florida will see near-term benefits of the Treasury's plan as there is pent up demand for real estate given an inability of potential borrowers to secure credit, Alexopoulos wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexopoulos believes the Treasury's plan, which will reintroduce liquidity into the banking system and mortgage market, could set the platform for an eventual recovery of the housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any improvement in the ability of homebuilders to sell homes means cash flow to repay debt," Alexopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexopoulos sees Synovus Financial and Colonial BancGroup as the prime beneficiaries of the Treasury's plan, but said he was incrementally more cautious on the quality of home equity loans and remained "underweight" on TCF Financial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of regional banks had rallied on Friday as government's efforts, including temporary ban on short selling and the rescue plan, to restore stability in the financial markets was cheered by investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KBW Regional Banking index, which closed up 5 percent at 87.27 on Friday, was down 8 percent at 80.0 Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Deepak Kannan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc announced today that for the second consecutive year it was
recognized for its approach to improving the environment by being named to the
Climate Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) by the Carbon Disclosure Project
(CDP). The CDP is a not-for-profit coalition of 385 global investors with $57
trillion in assets under management.

Pfizer was one of 383 Fortune 500 companies -- and one of nine in the chemical
and pharmaceutical sector -- named in the CDLI, a prestigious honor roll for
global corporations addressing the challenges of climate change.

"Pfizer is a leader among its peers through its voluntary reductions in
greenhouse gas emissions and commitment to renewable energy," CDP Chief
Executive Paul Dickinson said. "Good corporate governance in respect of climate
change disclosure will inevitably reap its rewards. As carbon regulation
increases, those companies that have implemented climate change related
strategies are clearly going to be in a far better position to meet the
challenge of higher carbon prices than companies that have procrastinated. Good
disclosure practices are synonymous with good management."

Pfizer's purpose is working together for a healthier world(TM) and while its
primary commitment is to the discovery and provision of innovative medicines, it
recognizes that increasingly this goal extends beyond products alone. Improving
health occurs not only through this commitment but also by advancing programs
that deliver sustainable solutions to the health care challenges facing the
changing world.

"Our Energy and Climate Change program addresses sustainability through our
conservation guidelines, energy efficient projects, emission reduction goals,
and green buildings. Energy teams and colleagues at Pfizer facilities around the
world completed more than 430 conservation-related projects during 2007, an
increase of 40 projects over the previous year, and a commendable achievement,
demonstrating our commitment to program advancement," said Steve Brooks, vice
president of Global Environment Health &amp; Safety for Pfizer.

Pfizer has had a company standard requiring the conservation of energy and
reduction of greenhouse gases since 1996. In 2002, Pfizer became a charter
member of the Climate Leaders Program, a partnership between the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and industry that aims to develop
long-term, comprehensive climate change strategies and sets greenhouse gas
emissions reduction goals. As a Climate Leader, Pfizer established a
company-wide intensity goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 35 percent per million
dollars of revenue and most recently, a second generation CO2 goal that targets
a 20% reduction on an absolute basis by 2012. The company is also evaluating and
implementing a number of projects that generate electricity from clean energy
sources.

Pfizer Inc: Working together for a healthier world(TM)

Founded in 1849, Pfizer is the world's largest research-based pharmaceutical
company taking new approaches to better health. We discover, develop,

&lt;p&gt; (Adds previous sale, details, share price, NEW YORK dateline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Oil giant Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) said on Monday it had agreed to sell several of its
West African fuels marketers to Corlay Global SA as part of its
effort to shrink its marketing operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, Chevron announced it planned to sell its fuels
marketing business in Nigeria to Corlay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No details of the transactions were released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the move was designed to align the company's
marketing operations with its refinery assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those refineries, which can process more than 2 million
barrels of oil per day, are located in the United States,
Singapore, Thailand, South Korea and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The operations to be sold in the latest divestment are in
Benin, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Cote d'Ivoire and Togo,
Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This sale is in line with our ongoing effort to
concentrate downstream resources and capital on strategic
global assets," Mike Wirth, executive vice president of
Chevron's Global Downstream operations, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Chevron were down 5 cents, or  0.1 percent, at
$87.75 in Monday trade on the New York Stock Exchange, in line
with the decline in the Standard and Poor's Energy index

Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that its subsidiary

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 22 (Reuters) - JP Morgan downgraded four U.S trucking
and logistics majors, including Con-Way (CNW.N), citing
weakness in the less-than-truckload (LTL) market, where pricing
pressure from increased competition has added to the troubles
of slowing demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Thomas Wadewitz of JP Morgan cut rating on Old
Dominion (ODFL.O) and Con-Way to "neutral" from "overweight."
YRC Worlwide (YRCW.O) and Arkansas Best ABFS.O were cut to
"underweight" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The falling tonnage trend in the LTL market has worsened in
the recent months and is expected to persist through 2009,
Wadewitz said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The recent rise in stock values, in the face of a weakening
LTL demand, have left the reward to risk profile of the
companies' stocks not so compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Con-Way and YRC Worldwide, Wadewitz sees added pressure
on margins from rising costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We do not expect YRCW to run into liquidity issues in
2008, but we believe there is significant risk to consensus EPS
forecasts," Wadewitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LTL market is a dominant factor driving Con-Way's earnings
and stock, Wadewitz said, adding that the compnay will not
benefit much from lower fuel prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Old Dominion closed at $34.19, while those of YRC
Worldwide and Arkansas Best closed at $15.82 and $40.02,
respectively, Friday on Nasdaq. Shares of Con-Way closed at
$50.38 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 (Recasts first paragraph, updates prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks headed for bounce
at the open on Monday as news that Japan's largest bank planned
to buy a stake in Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley (MS.N)
tempered worries about the proposed $700 billion financial
sector bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.T) said it planned to
buy a stake of as much as 20 percent in Morgan Stanley,
sparking a surge of more than 11 percent in Morgan Stanley's
shares before the bell. For details, see [ID:nT130486].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) shares climbed more than 5 percent
to $26.45 before the bell after the software maker raised its
quarterly dividend and set a $40 billion stock repurchase
plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even so, investors remained cautious about the likely shape
of the proposed $700 billion bailout to mop up hundreds of
billions of dollars worth of bad mortgage debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors worried Congress would seek to change the Bush
administration's plan, which Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson
announced on Friday. The proposal, coupled with earlier
bailouts, bankruptcies and arranged mergers, would do nothing
short of reshape the U.S. financial landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Some skepticism about whether or not the bill is going to
be passed the way Paulson wants it to be might be giving the
market a bit of a hiccup," said Peter Cardillo, chief market
economist at Avalon Partners in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Will they add things to it? So that raises the level of
skepticism. Secondly, what does it mean for inflation? This
could be very inflationary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 rose 2.90 points and were above fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 climbed
18 points and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures gained 8 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rising oil prices could be another headwind for the market,
with U.S. front-month crude CLc1 up 2.6 percent at $107.30 a
barrel as the dollar weakens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In another development, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan
Stanley, whose shares were pummeled last week, are abandoning
their investment bank model of two decades to become bank
holding companies. They will have an additional safety net from
the Federal Reserve but may not be as profitable as in the
past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials have said the plan, in which the government will
buy soured mortgage-related debt from financial institutions,
will cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 22 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities said it saw too
many risks for the U.S. chicken industry and cited concerns
about a slowdown in domestic demand, while initiating coverage
of three chicken producers, including Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Ken Goldman started Tyson, the largest U.S. meat
producer, with an "overweight" rating. He initiated smaller
rivals Sanderson Farms Inc (SAFM.O), the No. 4 U.S. chicken
producer, with an "underweight" rating and Pilgrim's Pride Corp
PPC.N, the No. 1 chicken producer, with "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said he expects chicken exports to suffer if
the dollar strengthens and if Russia limits chicken imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We wonder not only whether production cuts will be
sustained but also if they are sufficient to drive margins back
to historical norms," Goldman wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russia is the biggest market for U.S. poultry exporters.
The United States last year exported nearly $1 billion worth of
poultry, mainly frozen chicken leg quarters, and other meat
products to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said he was more pessimistic about Pilgrim's
Pride's near-term fundamentals than Tyson's as the latter is
less tethered to chicken, relative to its peers, and has large,
profitable pork and beef businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pilgrim's Pride, however, has a solid business model and is
poised for continued growth in the longer-term, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman expects Sanderson Farms to be hurt, more than
Pilgrim's or Tyson, by the risks surrounding the chicken
industry. About 25 percent of Sanderson's exports go to Russia,
he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If Russia follows through on its threats to cut chicken
imports from the U.S., Sanderson would have to find new homes
for a larger percent of meat than its peers," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman expects Tyson to earn 41 cents a share in the
fourth quarter. He forecast a loss of 56 cents a share for
Pilgrim's Pride and a loss of 34 cents a share for Sanderson
during the quarter.

it prudent to take profits," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worthington expects the challenging market to impact trading

&lt;p&gt;Chase, Bank of America, PNC Bank, Wachovia and Wells Fargo First
to Launch Visa SavingsEdge
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), a global leader in payments, today announced
the launch of Visa SavingsEdge, a new program designed to help small
business owners save money with automatic discounts at top-tier
business merchants. Visa SavingsEdge provides Visa Business

a Visa Business card at select merchants.(1) By enrolling their Visa
Business credit or check card at www.visasavingsedge.com, cardholders
automatically receive statement credits for the purchase of qualifying
purchases at participating merchants.

   "Small business owners are looking for simple ways to cut costs
and extend their purchasing power," said Raghav Lal, Head of Global
Small Business, Visa Inc. "Visa SavingsEdge is the latest addition to
Visa's assortment of discount programs that can give businesses easy
access to savings on products and services that are important to the
daily function of their business."

   The Visa SavingsEdge program is currently available to Visa
Business cardholders with cards issued by Chase, Bank of America, PNC
Bank, Wachovia and Wells Fargo. Visa plans to continue to add merchant
and financial institution partners throughout 2008 and 2009.

   Merchants currently enrolled in the Visa SavingsEdge program range

in categories important to small businesses - such as office supplies,

discounts that are relevant to their business customers.

&lt;p&gt;I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!(R), Interpolls and Microsoft Report Groundbreaking Results at Conclusion of "Spraychel for President" Next-Generation Rich Media Ad Campaign

      Interactive Ad Units Help Spraychel Campaign Rock the Vote,
     Achieving as High as 16 Percent Interaction Rates Across MSN
PASADENA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Interpolls, a leading rich media and next-generation advertising
technology company, has joined I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!(R) and
Microsoft Corp. to announce the results of the recent "Spraychel for
President" rich media advertising campaign which concluded July 27.
The election-themed campaign incorporated a mix of tongue-in-cheek
humor and a high degree of user interactivity to successfully showcase
the I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!(R) brand across MSN, the
Microsoft Advertising global media network.

   Microsoft Advertising supports a wide variety of rich media
partners to make executing campaigns on its network as easy as
possible for its advertisers. In this "Spraychel for President"
campaign, Interpolls brought a unique set of rich media executions
including Interpolls Rich Media Widgets(R) and its polling
functionality, which engages users and encourages interactivity by
asking them a compelling question.

   Throughout the life of the campaign, the Interpolls system
continually optimized question selection so that the best performing
questions rotated at a higher frequency. As users responded to a
question, they were guided to a results panel that housed additional
features and campaign messaging including streaming video and a call
to action that prompted the user to click through to the brand's
microsite and "Vote for Spraychel." Voters received the chance to win
a presidential salary of $400,000.

   "Using Interpolls rich media ad technology on MSN sites, we were
able to utilize rich media polling and widget ad formats throughout
the life of the campaign," said Victoria Barbadoro, Associate Brand
Building Manager, I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!(R) "The
question-based ad units helped engage site visitors and bring the
campaign to life, while providing a perfect fit for our highly
original, election-themed campaign."

   Interpolls' rich media ad units for I Can't Believe It's Not
Butter!(R) achieved tremendous results. User interaction rates with
the Interpolls question based ad units were as high as 16.04% on MSN.

   "This campaign is a clear testament to the power and effectiveness
of rich media advertising and demonstrates what advertisers can
achieve by combining cutting-edge solutions with a high degree of
interactivity," said John Genna, director, Display Product Marketing,
Advertiser &amp; Publisher Solutions Group, Microsoft. "Working with
brands like I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!(R) and Interpolls is
another example of our commitment to making it easier for advertisers
to deliver innovative rich media ad experiences to consumers."

   From the results panel, users also had the opportunity to download
a "Vote for Spraychel" Rich Media Widget. After grabbing the widget
from the site, users were then able to share it with their friends by
placing it on personal and social pages such as Facebook and MySpace,
creating a viral impact for the brand. The widget incorporated
campaign elements including the popular "Spraychel for President"
webisode series, an interactive election pitting Spraychel against
sinister rival Maxwell Butterman for president of the fridge, and
brand-centric games designed to engage users and promote interaction.

   "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!(R) understands the impact that
rich media can provide, and it's great to work with a brand who can
take so many creative ideas and bring them to life using this form of
next-generation advertising on MSN," said Peter Kim, CEO, Interpolls.
"The results we achieved with the campaign are exceptional. We are
excited to build on this momentum on behalf of I Can't Believe It's
Not Butter!(R)."

   I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!(R) worked separately from MSN and
Interpolls to produce an animated webisode series and a gaming area at
www.VoteSpraychel.com. The company also created a fan page on
Facebook, with a behind-the-scenes campaign blog hosted by Mark
McGrath, who also lent his voice as Spraychel's big brother and
campaign manager, Mr. More. MSN further promoted the "Spraychel for
President" games within the MSN Games community.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 22 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded
Buckle Inc (BKE.N) to "neutral" from "overweight," saying the
apparel and footwear retailer's stock has doubled this year and
is trading close to an all time high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company, which closed at $61.55 Friday, have
more than doubled since touching their 52-week low in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said Buckle is still expected to deliver some of
the best comparables in retail with upside to sell side
earnings estimates, but the multiple could be capped given
limited square footage growth and higher operating margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said Buckle is one of the few retailers "out
there with a fashion trend that is working", JP Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even assuming this trend lasts longer, the brokerage said
it was concerned about other retailers like J.C. Penney Co Inc
(JCP.N), Macy's Inc (M.N) and Dillard's Inc (DDS.N) starting to
carry a similar mix of brands in some of Buckle's markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kearney, Nebraska-based Buckle currently operates 382

&lt;p&gt;Cluster Resources and Microsoft Demonstrate Moab Hybrid Cluster Solution for Windows HPC Server 2008 at HPC on Wall Street

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Cluster Resources Inc. will present the Moab Hybrid Cluster
solution at HPC on Wall Street today in New York. The company will
demonstrate how to maximize mixed Windows and Linux environments by
leveraging the Moab Cluster Management toolset from Cluster Resources.

   The latest version of Moab Hybrid Cluster--an HPC solution that
dynamically changes cluster servers between Linux and Windows based on
workload, defined policies, and application needs--now includes added
support for the release of Microsoft Windows HPC Server 2008.
Improvements include the automation of setup through added wizards,
added policies to apply fine-grained control over multiple operating
systems, and additional documentation.

   Windows HPC Server 2008, the successor to Windows Compute Cluster
Server 2003, is based on the Windows Server 2008 operating system and
is designed to increase productivity, scalability and manageability.
Key features include new high-speed networking, highly efficient and
scalable cluster-management tools, advanced failover capabilities, and
support for partners' clustered file systems.

   "Cluster Resources is the leader for dynamically managing workload
across multiple mixed Windows and Linux platforms," said Kyril Faenov,
general manager, Microsoft HPC Division. "Together with Microsoft,
Cluster Resources has repeatedly proven its leadership with successful
deployments of the Moab Hybrid Cluster solution at multiple joint
Microsoft and Cluster Resources customer sites."

   Mixed dual-boot clusters can improve cluster efficiency because of
their ability to serve both Linux and Windows users. The hybrid
solution overcomes the capacity-planning problem of estimating the
number of servers allocated to different OS resource pools and
increases utilization rates by creating an efficient shared resource
pool. Traditionally, these static resource pools have different peak
usage times when one OS remains idle while the other has a backlog of
workload. The hybrid model breaks down OS resource silos, letting OS
pools grow and shrink to take advantage of otherwise idle compute
servers. Moab also intelligently overcomes hardware and job failures
by reallocating resources with the proper OS to compensate for the
failures.

   The supercomputer known as Firefly, located at Holland Computing
Center in Nebraska, one of the largest hybrid-OS supercomputing
facilities, runs both Linux and Windows operating systems. The Moab
Hybrid Cluster solution has made platform choice a thing of the past
on Firefly and allowed the center to meet the needs of a wider range
of users, dynamically switching between operating systems based on
workload and application needs.

   "We have seen a steady increase in demand from our Windows
customer base. The features and scalability associated with Windows
Server 2008, combined with Moab's ability to switch between running
Windows and Linux on the same cluster, are critical to our success and
ability to meet customer demand," said Jim Skirvin, president and CEO
of Holland Computing Center. "We continue to see increased interest in
Windows-based clusters, and we created this solution to help enable
organizations to facilitate a highly efficient migration to and
co-existence with Windows HPC Server 2008," stated Michael Jackson,
president of Cluster Resources. "So whether your business is a
financial institution migrating off of Solaris or an organization
expecting to have applications that need different operating systems
in the foreseeable future, the Moab Hybrid Cluster solution mitigates
the need for inefficient siloed clusters, eliminates capacity-planning
problems and unifies administration and management to improve your
experience and reduce overall costs."

   A short video showing how Moab Hybrid Cluster can be applied to
both new and existing clusters to help yield maximum hardware
utilization and ROI can be viewed at

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Cluster Resources Inc. joins IBM to offer the Moab Hybrid
Cluster(TM) solution with IBM's new iDataPlex to enable both Windows
and Linux OSes to run on the same platform. This solution set will
address the technology needs of massive data centers while enabling
more efficient computing.

   Cluster Resources and IBM will demonstrate the Moab Hybrid Cluster
solution on an iDataPlex server in IBM's booth, #208, today at HPC on
Wall Street.

   Cluster Resources developed Moab Hybrid Cluster--a
high-performance computing solution that dynamically changes cluster
servers between Linux and Windows based on workload, defined policies,
and application needs--to improve cluster efficiency through its
ability to cater to the needs of multi-platform users. The hybrid
solution surmounts capacity-planning challenges that stem from trying
to estimate the number of servers to allocate to different OS-specific
resource pools. In the hybrid paradigm, a cluster is a single, unified
resource, with Moab intelligently creating efficiencies within shared
resource pools.

   "Cluster Resources' Moab Hybrid Cluster solution allows
administrators to efficiently and dynamically manage workload across
mixed-OS environments," said Herb Schultz, marketing executive for
IBM's HPC business. "Customers require greater ease of use along with
the ability to manage mixed workloads effectively; Moab Hybrid Cluster
fills those needs."

   "For years Cluster Resources has used Moab in standard single-OS
environments to deliver the industry's highest utilization and
broadest policy controls," stated Michael Jackson, president of
Cluster Resources. "Taking our multi-OS cluster solution to IBM's new,
affordable scale-out iDataPlex platform provides ultra-efficiency and
flexibility at a mass-market price."

   IBM's System x(TM) iDataPlex(TM) is a cost-effective computing
system for organizations facing power, cooling, or physical-space
constraints. Its innovative design has a smaller footprint yet
accomodates double the number of servers in a single rack,
facilitating better overall space utilization; it uses up to 40
percent less energy while increasing data center computing power up to
5x. The iDataPlex also features front-access cabling and a liquid
cooling system designed to significantly reduce cooling costs. Adding
the Moab Hybrid Cluster solution to the iDataPlex gives organizations
cost-effective, high-power computing in an energy- and space-efficient
system.

&lt;p&gt; Sept 22 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded
Lloyds TSB Group Plc (LLOY.L), Barclays Plc (BARC.L) and Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS.L) to "underweight" from
"neutral" citing capital concerns.

 J.P. Morgan said the Lloyds' transaction with HBOS Plc
HBOS.L was not in the best interests of shareholders.

 Last week, Lloyds rescued Britain's biggest mortgage lender
HBOS in a $22 billion takeover as the government swept aside
competition rules to ease the deal through.

 "Whilst the combined entity should have significant pricing
power when the deal completes, based on our calculations we see
the company severely capital constrained," the brokerage said.

 RBS is also capital constrained, the brokerage said, and
added that the bank suffers from a poor earnings mix and that
synergies from the ABN takeover do not appear feasible.

 J.P. Morgan retained its "underweight" rating on Bradford 
Bingley Plc BB.L, saying the British mortgage bank was not a
viable standalone entity.

 Shares of the company rose 9 percent in morning trade,
supported by press reports that the Financial Services
Authority is sounding out potential bidders for the group.

 By 1010 GMT, shares of Lloyds were up 0.61 percent at 287.5
pence, while those of Barclays were up 2.7 percent at 399.5
pence.

 HBOS shares were down 1.24 percent at 219.75 pence.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were granted approval on Sunday to become bank holding companies regulated by the U.S. Federal Reserve, effectively killing off the investment banking model that has dominated Wall Street for more than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move enables Goldman (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to take deposits, gain easier access to financing and gives them more flexibility to buy retail banks. It was initiated by the only two big and independent U.S. investment banks left after the failure of Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK and the agreed takeover of Merrill Lynch MER.N last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change, part of a wrenching transformation of the Wall Street landscape amid financial markets turmoil in the past two weeks, means that previously freewheeling firms will be subject to much tighter regulation by the Fed, including tough capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could curb their ability to leverage up their proprietary trading and other activity with mountains of borrowed money.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts throughout, adds analyst comments, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Mark Felsenthal and Jessica Hall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/PHILADELPHIA, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs
and Morgan Stanley were granted approval on Sunday to become
bank holding companies regulated by the U.S. Federal Reserve,
effectively killing off the investment banking model that has
dominated Wall Street for more than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move enables Goldman (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N)
to take deposits, gain easier access to financing and gives
them more flexibility to buy retail banks. It was initiated by
the only two big and independent U.S. investment banks left
after the failure of Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK and the agreed
takeover of Merrill Lynch MER.N last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The change, part of a wrenching transformation of the Wall
Street landscape amid financial markets turmoil in the past two
weeks, means that previously freewheeling firms will be subject
to much tighter regulation by the Fed, including tough capital
requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That could curb their ability to leverage up their
proprietary trading and other activity with mountains of
borrowed money. This will reduce their chances of producing the
kind of mega profits they had been making until the credit
crisis started to hit home this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The timing of this move, in conjunction with all of the
other unprecedented steps taken in the past week, shows the
seriousness with which the government and the banks themselves
are still taking the short-term risks to systemic stability in
the financial markets," said Kirby Daley, senior strategist at
Newedge Group in Hong Kong. "The implications of all these
measures taken together are mind-boggling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the new set-up, the primary regulator of the parent
companies switches to the Federal Reserve from the Securities
and Exchange Commission but the SEC continues to regulate their
U.S. securities businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In exchange for the increased scrutiny, Goldman and Morgan
gain long-term access to the Fed's discount window and access
to bank deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORGAN, WACHOVIA MARRIAGE LESS LIKELY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley is also now less interested in a merger with
the banking group Wachovia Corp WB.N. That is no longer
Morgan's first priority, though talks with other parties
continue, a person familiar with negotiations said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It held a board meeting over the weekend to discuss
Wachovia and the possibility that China's sovereign wealth fund
China Investment Corp could increase its stake in Morgan
Stanley, according to sources familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley declined comment on the talks but it did say
in a statement that the new status would give it "flexibility
and stability to pursue new business opportunities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In some ways this makes it easier for them to buy a retail
bank, but they may argue that this makes them self-sufficient
and they don't need to buy a bank now," said the head of global
mergers at a U.S. investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But they can't raise deposits fast enough organically to
stabilize their problems, it has to come through MA," said the
banker, who declined to be identified because he was not
authorized to speak with the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman intends expanding its deposit base by acquiring
deposits wholesale from other banks, particularly those in
distress, said the firm's spokesman Lucas van Praag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It began to feel that it needed to consider something like
Sunday's move after the government-financed fire sale of
another investment bank, Bear Stearns, to JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) in March, and the events of the past week accelerated
this thinking, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Last week the markets were looking for a 'belt and braces'
approach to safety and soundness -- now we have the central
bank as our regulator and permanent access to the lender of
last resort," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman saw its shares plunging as much as 45 percent in
the first four days of last week as even once seemingly
untouchable Wall Street firms appeared vulnerable to the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its stock partially recovered amid news of a planned $700
billion bailout of the U.S. financial system by the government
and a ban on short selling of financial stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To provide increased liquidity to the companies while they
go through the transition, the Fed agreed to lend to the firms'
broker-dealer subsidiaries on the the same terms as the Fed
discount window for banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fed said it was making the same collateral deals
available to the broker-dealer subsidiary of Merrill, which is
being acquired by Bank of America (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It creates a perception of greater safety and supervision.
It really rationalizes the regulatory system. It should be good
for both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley," said Chip
MacDonald, mergers partner at law firm Jones Day. "It gives
them better sources of funds through a commercial bank
subsidiary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The approval by the Fed came at the request of Goldman and
Morgan, according to a source familiar with the application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RETAIL BANK ACQUISITIONS EASIER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs said it would move assets from a number of
businesses into an entity called GS Bank USA that would have
more than $150 billion in assets, making it one of the ten
largest banks in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under a commercial banking model Goldman and Morgan will be
able to take deposits which during this shaky financial
environment are considered a stable source of funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their ability to take risks will not only be more
thoroughly questioned but also be more measured because
regulators will require stringent capital levels relative to
the risks they take. They will also be required to maintain
managerial and operational soundness and be subject to a strict

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian stock markets were jittery on Wednesday, as fears that U.S. lawmakers will stall a proposed $700 billion bailout of the battered financial sector haunted investors and a firmer yen hurt Japanese exporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares in Honda Motor (7267.T) and Canon Inc. (7751.T) fell nearly 4 percent, but financial shares gained in Sydney and Hong Kong and U.S. Treasury yields rose after Warren Buffett surprised the market with a $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody is just following god, Warren Buffett has shown the way," said Francis Lun, general manager with Fulbright Securities in Hong Kong, as the move by the world's most famous investor was taken as a sign their may now be value in the beaten-down sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's third-biggest bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) (8316.T) also planned to invest several billion dollars in Goldman, according to the Kyodo news agency, though SMFG said it had no plans to do so for now. SMFG shares added 2.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude oil futures rose nearly 0.5 percent above $107 a barrel, paring Tuesday's losses of nearly $3, ahead of U.S. government inventory data expected to show declines in crude and gasoline stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's Nikkei .N225 fell 1.2 percent in the morning session, with car maker Honda down 3.7 percent and cameras and copiers firm Canon losing 3.9 percent. Japanese markets had been closed for a holiday on Tuesday, when Asian markets mostly fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We now have a delicate situation about whether the U.S. Congress will approve the bailout plan and this is weighing on the market," said Takahiko Murai, general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS, which slumped to a 2-year low last week, was up 0.6 percent at 0300 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI and SP 500 .SPX both losing around 1.5 percent, amid congressional wrangling over Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's plan to buy up toxic mortgage debt on financial institutions' balance sheets in an effort to resolve the root cause of the current financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUFFETT BANK BOOST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But news that Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) was investing in Wall Street's most powerful firm sent U.S. index futures surging in extended trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett's move also boosted Australia's financial sector, with National Australia Bank (NAB.AX) up 4.6 percent and ANZ Banking Group (ANZ.AX) gaining 2.3 percent, as the benchmark SP/ASX 200 index .AXJO rose 0.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Hong Kong the financial sector led gains, with HSBC (0005.HK) up 1.1 percent and ICBC (1398.HK) up 2.6 percent, as the Hang Seng .HSI put on 1.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korean stocks rose 1.2 percent, reversing early losses as an anticipated announcement of government measures against short-selling sent foreign investors who had been betting on price falls scrambling to cover their positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yen eased a little against a number of currencies as the Buffett news stemmed some inflows into the Japanese currency when Wall Street fell the previous day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expected the yen to gain against its peers, drawing support from the slip in Wall Street the previous day," said a trader at a European bank. "However, various cross yen pairs are being bought back in light of the Goldman news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dollar traded around 105.70 yen after hitting a high of 105.90 yen. The euro advanced to 155.25 yen. The Australian dollar rose to around 88.20 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold fell after the dollar bounced on Tuesday, continuing a strong negative correlation between the greenback and dollar-denominated commodities that has been in place for several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Base metals also fell, with Shanghai aluminum futures slipping 1.8 percent to a four year low on concerns over swelling stockpiles and worries China's smelters will continue to churn out metal despite weak demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude for November delivery was up 47 cents at $107.08 a barrel. Losses on Tuesday had followed a record surge of nearly 16 percent in the now expired October contract on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Reuters poll of analysts predicted U.S. inventory data due later would show a fall of 2 million barrels in crude stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten-year U.S. Treasury notes fell in price in Asian trade, pushing yields up to 3.824 percent from 3.803 percent late in New York on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Parvathy Ullatil in HONG KONG; Editing by Lincoln Feast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Architects of a $700 billion bailout plan urged U.S. lawmakers to act swiftly or face dire economic consequences as global stock markets fell for a second day on growing concern the rescue may be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But financial markets got a shot in the arm late Tuesday when one of America's most-respected investors, Warren Buffett, bought a stake in Wall Street's most powerful firm, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Berkshire Hathaway'ssurprise $5 billion deal for about 9 percent of Goldman helped U.S. stock futures pare losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told lawmakers during five hours of grueling hearings on Tuesday that the bailout was "sad" and "embarrassing," but needed to stave off a deep recession and restore confidence in markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he spoke, the U.S. Federal Reserve was forced to inject another $2 billion into the troubled financial system to help mutual funds scrambling to raise cash to meet heavy withdrawals by rattled customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lawmakers scoffed at the proposed bailout's enormous size and the lack of details, U.S. stocks closed down about 1.5 percent on uncertainty over when and how Washington would act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank warned the plan might not pass until Monday, adding that the Democrat-controlled Congress needed limits on compensation for executives of firms offloading bad assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just don't think the American public is sold," said David Dietze, chief investment officer at Point View Financial Services in Summit, New Jersey. "They are skeptical of the need, and they are fearful of the cost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The skepticism is that this is going to help the Wall Street financiers and do nothing for the little guy other than saddle them with a big tax bill," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis has become the No. 1 issue leading up to the November 4 presidential election, and many lawmakers seeking re-election to Congress want to appear vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bailout, potentially the United States' biggest ever, could cost every American man, woman and child $2,300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for the world's richest country, $700 billion would be a huge budget drain. Since 2003, the Iraq war has cost about $550 billion, or a little more than $100 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting two days of hearings, Paulson and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the plan might cost less once the government is able to resell toxic mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson said the government would buy the securities in a reverse auction in which the roles of buyer and seller are reversed to ensure the lowest price is paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transformation of global finance accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once thought untouchable, Goldman was shaken last week by a sudden slide in its shares. It secured approval this week to become a commercial bank and Tuesday's transaction could help it forge an alliance with one of the banks partially owned by Buffett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Japan's largest brokerage agreed to buy bankrupt Lehman Brothers' European arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox urged Congress to plug a regulatory hole in the $58 trillion market for credit default swaps, insurance-like products that many say pose a systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President George W. Bush promised in his last speech to the United Nations that markets would stabilize but faced criticism over the excesses of what some have described as a culture of greed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SHARE THE OUTRAGE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson, a former Goldman Sachs boss reportedly worth about $700 million, told Congress, "I share the outrage that people have. It's embarrassing for the United States of America."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat associated with Wall Street's interests, pressed Paulson on if he could take the money in installments, starting with $150 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson replied bluntly, "We need the full authority."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What this is about is market confidence," he said. "It's a sad story, but the American taxpayer is already on the hook."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress and the Bush administration are under growing pressure to act following a rising tide of U.S. home foreclosures and loan defaults, and the failure of U.S. investment banks as well as the world's largest insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts doubt Paulson and Bernanke can end America's worst crisis of confidence since the 1930s' Great Depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(They) have been wrong about nearly everything since this crisis began years ago," said Barry Ritholtz, director of research at New York investment firm Fusion IQ. "Why should we trust (their) judgment on the largest bailout in American history?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the elections looming, executive compensation is a hot-button issue, and appears to be the main bone of contention as Washington crafts the bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein about $54 million last year. Wall Street's last two independent banks, Goldman and Morgan Stanley, got approval days ago to convert to banks to shelter them from the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch  Co Inc boss John Thain was paid $15 million to join the company last year. He could get another $10 million when Merrill's sale to Bank of America Corp goes through -- a sale prompted by Merrill's troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest insurer American International Group Inc paid boss Martin Sullivan $14 million last year. AIG was rescued a week ago by an $85 billion federal loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found 57 percent of Americans support the bailout, even though only 19 percent believe the government is doing a good job of handling the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the New York Federal Reserve bank, 40 people protested with banners reading "Bail out Main Street, not just Wall Street" and "$700 billion for banks, $0 for homeowners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An angry venture capitalist took a full-page ad in the New York Times, dubbing Bush, Paulson and Bernanke the "new Communists" in a cartoon where the trio planted a flag with a Communist hammer and sickle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SNAPPING UP ASSETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the turmoil swirled, Japanese firms are snapping up U.S. assets.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Architects of a $700 billion bailout plan urged U.S. lawmakers to act swiftly or face dire economic consequences as global stock markets fell for a second day on growing concern the rescue may be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But financial markets got a shot in the arm late Tuesday when one of America's most-respected investors, Warren Buffett, bought a stake in Wall Street's most powerful firm, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Berkshire Hathaway'ssurprise $5 billion deal for about 9 percent of Goldman helped U.S. stock futures pare losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told lawmakers during five hours of grueling hearings on Tuesday that the bailout was "sad" and "embarrassing," but needed to stave off a deep recession and restore confidence in markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he spoke, the U.S. Federal Reserve was forced to inject another $2 billion into the troubled financial system to help mutual funds scrambling to raise cash to meet heavy withdrawals by rattled customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lawmakers scoffed at the proposed bailout's enormous size and the lack of details, U.S. stocks closed down about 1.5 percent on uncertainty over when and how Washington would act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank warned the plan might not pass until Monday, adding that the Democrat-controlled Congress needed limits on compensation for executives of firms offloading bad assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just don't think the American public is sold," said David Dietze, chief investment officer at Point View Financial Services in Summit, New Jersey. "They are skeptical of the need, and they are fearful of the cost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The skepticism is that this is going to help the Wall Street financiers and do nothing for the little guy other than saddle them with a big tax bill," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis has become the No. 1 issue leading up to the November 4 presidential election, and many lawmakers seeking re-election to Congress want to appear vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bailout, potentially the United States' biggest ever, could cost every American man, woman and child $2,300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for the world's richest country, $700 billion would be a huge budget drain. Since 2003, the Iraq war has cost about $550 billion, or a little more than $100 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting two days of hearings, Paulson and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the plan might cost less once the government is able to resell toxic mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson said the government would buy the securities in a reverse auction in which the roles of buyer and seller are reversed to ensure the lowest price is paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transformation of global finance accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once thought untouchable, Goldman was shaken last week by a sudden slide in its shares. It secured approval this week to become a commercial bank and Tuesday's transaction could help it forge an alliance with one of the banks partially owned by Buffett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Japan's largest brokerage agreed to buy bankrupt Lehman Brothers' European arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox urged Congress to plug a regulatory hole in the $58 trillion market for credit default swaps, insurance-like products that many say pose a systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President George W. Bush promised in his last speech to the United Nations that markets would stabilize but faced criticism over the excesses of what some have described as a culture of greed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SHARE THE OUTRAGE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson, a former Goldman Sachs boss reportedly worth about $700 million, told Congress, "I share the outrage that people have. It's embarrassing for the United States of America."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat associated with Wall Street's interests, pressed Paulson on if he could take the money in installments, starting with $150 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson replied bluntly, "We need the full authority."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What this is about is market confidence," he said. "It's a sad story, but the American taxpayer is already on the hook."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress and the Bush administration are under growing pressure to act following a rising tide of U.S. home foreclosures and loan defaults, and the failure of U.S. investment banks as well as the world's largest insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts doubt Paulson and Bernanke can end America's worst crisis of confidence since the 1930s' Great Depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(They) have been wrong about nearly everything since this crisis began years ago," said Barry Ritholtz, director of research at New York investment firm Fusion IQ. "Why should we trust (their) judgment on the largest bailout in American history?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the elections looming, executive compensation is a hot-button issue, and appears to be the main bone of contention as Washington crafts the bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein about $54 million last year. Wall Street's last two independent banks, Goldman and Morgan Stanley, got approval days ago to convert to banks to shelter them from the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch  Co Inc boss John Thain was paid $15 million to join the company last year. He could get another $10 million when Merrill's sale to Bank of America Corp goes through -- a sale prompted by Merrill's troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest insurer American International Group Inc paid boss Martin Sullivan $14 million last year. AIG was rescued a week ago by an $85 billion federal loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found 57 percent of Americans support the bailout, even though only 19 percent believe the government is doing a good job of handling the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the New York Federal Reserve bank, 40 people protested with banners reading "Bail out Main Street, not just Wall Street" and "$700 billion for banks, $0 for homeowners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An angry venture capitalist took a full-page ad in the New York Times, dubbing Bush, Paulson and Bernanke the "new Communists" in a cartoon where the trio planted a flag with a Communist hammer and sickle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SNAPPING UP ASSETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the turmoil swirled, Japanese firms are snapping up U.S. assets. Nomura Holdings Inc agreed to buy bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's Europe and Middle East operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That came on the heels of Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, agreeing to buy up to 20 percent of Morgan Stanley and Nomura planning to buy Lehman's franchise in Japan and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singapore sovereign fund GIC said it still has plenty of cash after investing nearly $18 billion in UBS AG and Citigroup Inc, and would consider investing in U.S. distressed assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Egan; Reporting by Jason Neely, Glenn Somerville, John Poirier, Donna Smith, Patrick Worsnip and Matt Spetalnick; editing by John Wallace, Jeffrey Benkoe, Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc will invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc, in a major boost for the Wall Street bank from perhaps the world's best-known investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's a vote of confidence which is gold plated," said Michael Holland, a money manager at Holland  Co in New York. "You don't get better than this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman rose 8.1 percent after the announcement, while Standard  Poor's 500 futures gained 15 points. Goldman also announced plans to sell $2.5 billion of common stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett is adding Goldman to a portfolio of investments at Berkshire that includes large stakes in a handful of major U.S. commercial banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Goldman won Federal Reserve approval to become a bank holding company, giving it easier access to financing and adding to speculation it might buy another bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This came after many investors questioned its business model amid this month's market turmoil, causing shares to fall 50 percent from their record set last Oct 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman Sachs is an exceptional institution," Buffett said in a statement. "It has an unrivaled global franchise, a proven and deep management team and the intellectual and financial capital to continue its track record of outperformance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett is the second-richest American according to Forbes magazine, and built Berkshire into a $199 billion conglomerate by investing in undervalued companies with strong management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was not available for immediate comment, according to Debbie Bosanek, who works in his Omaha, Nebraska office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, in a statement noted Buffett's "longstanding relationship" with the company, and called the investment "a strong validation of our client franchise and future prospects. This investment will further bolster our strong capitalization and liquidity position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SECOND BIG INVESTMENT IN WEEK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire will buy $5 billion of Goldman perpetual preferred stock that carries a 10 percent dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also will receive warrants to buy $5 billion of common stock, or 43.5 million shares, at $115 per share, within five years, which could give it a roughly 9 percent stake in Goldman. Last week, Goldman said it averaged 448.3 million common shares in the quarter ended Aug 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Goldman and rival Morgan Stanley said they would become bank holding companies, enabling them to accept deposits and killing the investment bank model that dominated Wall Street for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following day, Morgan Stanley said it would sell up to a 20 percent equity stake, worth as much as $8.5 billion, to Japan's largest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Morgan Stanley announced the investments barely a week after upheavals at the two other major Wall Street investment banks. Merrill Lynch  Co Inc agreed to sell itself to Bank of America Corp, while Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly they are saying that Goldman is not only going to be a survivor, but that it is going to prosper in this new world," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire as of June 30 disclosed stakes in six major U.S. financial services companies: American Express Co, Bank of America, MT Bank Corp, SunTrust Banks Inc, U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person familiar with Goldman's thinking said the company is not likely to announce deals with these banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bancorp spokesman Steve Dale and Wells Fargo spokeswoman Julia Tunis Bernard declined to comment. The other companies did not immediately return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said on Sunday it intends to expand its deposit base by buying deposits from other banks, including those in distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's bank unit had about $25 billion in assets and $23 billion in deposits, tiny in comparison to its total assets of $1.1 trillion at the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment is Buffett's second major purchase in a week. On Thursday, Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co affiliate agreed to buy power supplier Constellation Energy Group Inc for $4.7 billion. Constellation took that bid over a higher offer led by France's Electricite de France SA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN TIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his disdain for investment banking excess, Buffett has publicly praised Goldman investment banker Byron Trott, who helped arrange Berkshire's $4.5 billion purchase in March of a majority stake in industrial conglomerate Marmon Holdings Inc from Chicago's Pritzker family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also provided financing for Mars Inc's planned $23 billion acquisition of chewing gum maker Wm Wrigley Jr Co. Berkshire committed $6.5 billion to that transaction. Wrigley shareholders will vote on the merger on Sept 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Buffett was 10 years old his father brought him to visit former Goldman Sachs head Sidney Weinberg. And as a young broker Buffett worked with Gus Levy, who later ran Goldman in the 1970s as senior partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALOMON INC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett's most famous foray into Wall Street came in 1991, when he became interim chairman at Salomon Inc to help it clean house following a Treasury market scandal. Salomon was a major Berkshire investment, but not one of Buffett's best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know if it's a statement on all the financials or the market," said Marshall Sonenshine, chairman of Sonenshine Partners in New York, referring to the Goldman investment. "He sees Goldman Sachs as a good value where it's currently priced. Remember, he invested in Salomon Brothers in the past, and that wasn't a sign that Salomon was going to start doing well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett may have reason to believe a Goldman investment will fare better, said Anton Schutz, a portfolio manager at Mendon Capital Advisors in Rochester, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The valuation is great, and with what the government's doing to unfreeze debt markets, it's a great time to be buying," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman rose $10.10 to $135.15 in after-hours trading following the announcement, after closing up $4.27, or 3.5 percent, to $125.05 in regular trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Megan Davies, Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects spelling of Buffett)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Asian stocks mixed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Concern that U.S. Congress may stall bailout plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Buffett to invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Oil steady at close to $107 a barrel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alex Richardson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SINGAPORE, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Asian stocks were mostly
easier on Wednesday as fears that U.S. lawmakers will stall a
proposed $700 billion bailout of the battered financial sector
haunted investors and a firmer yen hurt Japanese exporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Australian bank shares gained and U.S. Treasury yields
rose after Warren Buffett surprised the market with a $5
billion investment in Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japan's third-biggest bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
(SMFG) (8316.T) also planned to invest several billion dollars
in Goldman, according to the Kyodo news agency, though SMFG
said it had no plans to do so for now. SMFG shares added 2.7
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crude oil futures were a little higher, paring Tuesday's
losses of nearly $3 a barrel, ahead of U.S. government
inventory data expected to show declines in crude and gasoline
stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japan's Nikkei .N225 fell 1.4 percent, with car maker
Honda (7267.T) down 3.4 percent and cameras and copiers firm
Canon (7751.T) losing 4.1 percent. Japanese markets had been
closed for a holiday on Tuesday, when Asian markets mostly
fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We now have a delicate situation about whether the U.S.
Congress will approve the bailout plan and this is weighing on
the market," said Takahiko Murai, general manager of equities
at Nozomi Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan
.MIAPJ0000PUS, which slumped to a 2-year low last week, was
down 0.4 percent at 0130 GMT. Korean shares .KS11 were flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial
average .DJI and SP 500 .SPX both losing around 1.5
percent, amid congressional wrangling over Treasury Secretary
Henry Paulson's plan to buy up toxic mortgage debt on financial
institutions' balance sheets in an effort to resolve the root
cause of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But news that Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N)
(BRKb.N) was investing in Wall Street's most powerful firm sent
U.S. index futures SPc1 surging in extended trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's clearly a positive when Warren Buffett sees value in
a company," said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer of
Philadelphia Trust Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Buffett is so highly regarded as an intelligent value
investor, if he's putting a lot of money into a company that's
been beaten down, it sends a message to the market that maybe
not every financial company should be ignored at this point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AUSSIE BANKS GAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett's move also boosted Australia's financial sector,
with National Australia Bank (NAB.AX) and ANZ Banking Group
(ANZ.AX) gaining between 1.5 and 2.5 percent, as the benchmark
SP/ASX 200 index .AXJO rose 0.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The yen eased a little against a number of currencies as
the Goldman news stemmed some inflows the Japanese currency had
enjoyed when Wall Street fell the previous day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expected the yen to gain against its peers, drawing
support from the slip in Wall Street the previous day," said a
trader at a European bank. "However, various cross yen pairs
are being bought back in light of the Goldman news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dollar was little changed at 105.44 yen JPY= after
hitting a high of 105.90 yen. The euro advanced 0.1 percent to
154.85 yen EURJPY=R. The Australian dollar rose 0.2 percent
to 87.98 yen AUDJPY=.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gold XAU= fell after the dollar bounced on Tuesday,
continuing a strong negative correlation between the greenback
and dollar-denominated commodities that has been in place for
several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude for November delivery was up 17 cents at $106.78
a barrel. A Reuters poll of analysts predicted U.S. inventory
data due later would show a fall of 2 million barrels in crude
stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ten-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR fell 11/32 in
price in early Asian trade, driving yields up to 3.845 percent,
from 3.803 percent late in New York on Tuesday.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) will invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), in a major boost for the Wall Street bank from perhaps the world's best-known investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) (8316.T), Japan's third-largest bank, plans to invest in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Kyodo news agency reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMFG's investment will total several hundred billion yen, Kyodo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag, when reached by telephone, said he couldn't confirm the report while SMFG said it had no plans at this time to invest in Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report comes after Goldman said Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) would invest $5 billion in it, in a major boost for the Wall Street bank from perhaps the world's best-known investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also follows a string of Japanese financial firms snapping up U.S. assets. Nomura Holdings Inc (8604.T) agreed to buy bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's Asia, Europe and Middle East operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That came on the heels of Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T), agreeing to buy up to 20 percent of Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Nomura rose 4.8 percent to 1,499 yen, compared with a 1.3 percent decline in Tokyo's TOPIX average .TOPX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Share of Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan's top bank rose 3.5 percent after it said it would pay as much as $8.5 billion for up to 20 percent in Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nomura was able to buy Lehman after it filed for bankruptcy so I think investors think that Nomura got Lehman on the cheap," said Nana Otsuki, banking analyst at UBS in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It kind of seems that MUFG might have been able to get Morgan Stanley cheaper if they waited a little," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese financial markets were closed on Tuesday for a national holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once considered too naive and cautious for the high-risk, high-return world of investment banking, cash-rich Japanese firms are once again aggressively pushing abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese financial firms have largely avoided the massive credit losses that tore through Wall Street. Unlike their Western rivals, Mitsubishi UFJ and others have largely shied away from riskier investments since their near-death several years ago, when they needed massive injections of public funds to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jean Yoon and Rodney Joyce)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Architects of a $700 billion bailout plan urged U.S. lawmakers to act swiftly or face dire economic consequences as global stock markets fell for a second day on growing concern the rescue may be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But financial markets got a shot in the arm late Tuesday when one of America's most-respected investors, Warren Buffett, bought a stake in Wall Street's most powerful firm, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Berkshire Hathaway'ssurprise $5 billion deal for about 9 percent of Goldman helped U.S. stock futures pare losses. ID:nN23412774&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told lawmakers during five hours of grueling hearings on Tuesday that the bailout was "sad" and "embarrassing," but needed to stave off a deep recession and restore confidence in markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he spoke, the U.S. Federal Reserve was forced to inject another $2 billion into the troubled financial system to help mutual funds scrambling to raise cash to meet heavy withdrawals by rattled customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lawmakers scoffed at the proposed bailout's enormous size and the lack of details, U.S. stocks closed down about 1.5 percent on uncertainty over when and how Washington would act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank warned the plan might not pass until Monday, adding that the Democrat-controlled Congress needed limits on compensation for executives of firms offloading bad assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just don't think the American public is sold," said David Dietze, chief investment officer at Point View Financial Services in Summit, New Jersey. "They are skeptical of the need, and they are fearful of the cost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The skepticism is that this is going to help the Wall Street financiers and do nothing for the little guy other than saddle them with a big tax bill," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis has become the No. 1 issue leading up to the November 4 presidential election, and many lawmakers seeking re-election to Congress want to appear vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bailout, potentially the United States' biggest ever, could cost every American man, woman and child $2,300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for the world's richest country, $700 billion would be a huge budget drain. Since 2003, the Iraq war has cost about $550 billion, or a little more than $100 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting two days of hearings, Paulson and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the plan might cost less once the government is able to resell toxic mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson said the government would buy the securities in a reverse auction in which the roles of buyer and seller are reversed to ensure the lowest price is paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transformation of global finance accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once thought untouchable, Goldman was shaken last week by a sudden slide in its shares. It secured approval this week to become a commercial bank and Tuesday's transaction could help it forge an alliance with one of the banks partially owned by Buffett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Japan's largest brokerage agreed to buy bankrupt Lehman Brothers' European arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox urged Congress to plug a regulatory hole in the $58 trillion market for credit default swaps, insurance-like products that many say pose a systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President George W. Bush promised in his last speech to the United Nations that markets would stabilize but faced criticism over the excesses of what some have described as a culture of greed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SHARE THE OUTRAGE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson, a former Goldman Sachs boss reportedly worth about $700 million, told Congress, "I share the outrage that people have. It's embarrassing for the United States of America."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat associated with Wall Street's interests, pressed Paulson on if he could take the money in installments, starting with $150 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson replied bluntly, "We need the full authority."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What this is about is market confidence," he said. "It's a sad story, but the American taxpayer is already on the hook."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress and the Bush administration are under growing pressure to act following a rising tide of U.S. home foreclosures and loan defaults, and the failure of U.S. investment banks as well as the world's largest insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts doubt Paulson and Bernanke can end America's worst crisis of confidence since the 1930s' Great Depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(They) have been wrong about nearly everything since this crisis began years ago," said Barry Ritholtz, director of research at New York investment firm Fusion IQ. "Why should we trust (their) judgment on the largest bailout in American history?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the elections looming, executive compensation is a hot-button issue, and appears to be the main bone of contention as Washington crafts the bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein about $54 million last year. Wall Street's last two independent banks, Goldman and Morgan Stanley, got approval days ago to convert to banks to shelter them from the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch  Co Inc boss John Thain was paid $15 million to join the company last year. He could get another $10 million when Merrill's sale to Bank of America Corp goes through -- a sale prompted by Merrill's troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest insurer American International Group Inc paid boss Martin Sullivan $14 million last year. AIG was rescued a week ago by an $85 billion federal loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found 57 percent of Americans support the bailout, even though only 19 percent believe the government is doing a good job of handling the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the New York Federal Reserve bank, 40 people protested with banners reading "Bail out Main Street, not just Wall Street" and "$700 billion for banks, $0 for homeowners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An angry venture capitalist took a full-page ad in the New York Times, dubbing Bush, Paulson and Bernanke the "new Communists" in a cartoon where the trio planted a flag with a Communist hammer and sickle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SNAPPING UP ASSETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the turmoil swirled, Japanese firms are snapping up U.S. assets.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc will invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc, in a major boost for the Wall Street bank from perhaps the world's best-known investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's a vote of confidence which is gold plated," said Michael Holland, a money manager at Holland  Co in New York. "You don't get better than this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman rose 6.5 percent following the announcement, while Standard  Poor's 500 futures gained 16 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire will buy $5 billion of perpetual preferred stock that carries a 10 percent dividend. It also will receive warrants to buy $5 billion of common stock, or 43.5 million shares, at $115 per share, within five years, which could give it a roughly 9 percent stake in Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also plans to sell at least $2.5 billion of common stock in a public offering. The company averaged 448.3 million common shares outstanding in the quarter ended Aug 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman had fallen 50 percent from their record set last Oct 31, as credit markets tightened and investors worried about the viability of U.S. investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Goldman said it would become a bank holding company, enabling it to accept deposits and killing the investment bank model that dominated Wall Street for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett, for his part, has built his reputation on investing in companies he considers undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman Sachs is an exceptional institution," Buffett said in a statement. "It has an unrivaled global franchise, a proven and deep management team and the intellectual and financial capital to continue its track record of outperformance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett was not available for immediate comment, according to Debbie Bosanek, who works in his Omaha, Nebraska office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly they are saying that Goldman is not only going to be a survivor, but that it is going to prosper in this new world of financial companies," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, in a statement called Buffett's investment "a strong validation of our client franchise and future prospects. This investment will further bolster our strong capitalization and liquidity position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment is Buffett's second major purchase in less than a week. On Thursday, Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co affiliate agreed to buy power supplier Constellation Energy Group Inc for $4.7 billion. Constellation took that bid over a higher offer led by French energy giant Electricite de France SA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTHER BANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's abandoning of the investment banking model has raised speculation it might merge with a commercial lender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire as of June 30 disclosed stakes in six major U.S. banking and financial services companies: American Express Co, Bank of America Corp, MT Bank Corp, SunTrust Banks Inc, U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo  Co. The latter was Berkshire's largest equity investment other than Coca-Cola Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bancorp spokesman Steve Dale and Wells Fargo spokeswoman Julia Tunis Bernard declined to comment. Bank of America last week announced plans to buy another Wall Street investment bank, Merrill Lynch  Co Inc. The other companies did not immediately return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Buffett's most famous foray into Wall Street came in 1991, when he became interim chairman at Salomon Inc, a major Berkshire investment, to help it clean house following a Treasury market scandal. It was not one of Buffett's better investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know if it's a statement on all the financials or the market," said Marshall Sonenshine, chairman of Sonenshine Partners in New York, referring to the Goldman investment. "He sees Goldman Sachs as a good value where it's currently priced. Remember, he invested in Salomon Brothers in the past, and that wasn't a sign that Salomon was going to start doing well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett may have reason to believe otherwise, said Anton Schutz, a portfolio manager at Mendon Capital Advisors in Rochester, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The valuation is great, and with what the government's doing to unfreeze debt markets, it's a great time to be buying," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman rose $8.07 to $133.12 in after-hours trading following the announcement, after closing up $4.27, or 3.5 percent, to $125.05 in regular trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Megan Davies, Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Architects of a $700 billion bailout plan urged U.S. lawmakers to act swiftly or face dire economic consequences as global stock markets fell for a second day on growing concern the rescue may be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But financial markets got a shot in the arm late Tuesday when one of America's most-respected investors, Warren Buffett, bought a stake in Wall Street's most powerful firm, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N). Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N)surprise $5 billion deal for about 9 percent of Goldman helped U.S. stock futures pare losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told lawmakers during five hours of grueling hearings on Tuesday that the bailout was "sad" and "embarrassing," but needed to stave off a deep recession and restore confidence in markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he spoke, the U.S. Federal Reserve was forced to inject another $2 billion into the troubled financial system to help mutual funds scrambling to raise cash to meet heavy withdrawals by rattled customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lawmakers scoffed at the proposed bailout's enormous size and the lack of details, U.S. stocks closed down about 1.5 percent on uncertainty over when and how Washington would act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank warned the plan might not pass until Monday, adding that the Democrat-controlled Congress needed limits on compensation for executives of firms offloading bad assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just don't think the American public is sold," said David Dietze, chief investment officer at Point View Financial Services in Summit, New Jersey. "They are skeptical of the need, and they are fearful of the cost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The skepticism is that this is going to help the Wall Street financiers and do nothing for the little guy other than saddle them with a big tax bill," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis has become the No. 1 issue leading up to the November 4 presidential election, and many lawmakers seeking re-election to Congress want to appear vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bailout, potentially the United States' biggest ever, could cost every American man, woman and child $2,300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for the world's richest country, $700 billion would be a huge budget drain. Since 2003, the Iraq war has cost about $550 billion, or a little more than $100 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting two days of hearings, Paulson and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the plan might cost less once the government is able to resell toxic mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson said the government would buy the securities in a reverse auction in which the roles of buyer and seller are reversed to ensure the lowest price is paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transformation of global finance accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once thought untouchable, Goldman was shaken last week by a sudden slide in its shares. It secured approval this week to become a commercial bank and Tuesday's transaction could help it forge an alliance with one of the banks partially owned by Buffett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Japan's largest brokerage agreed to buy bankrupt Lehman Brothers' LEHMQ.PK European arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox urged Congress to plug a regulatory hole in the $58 trillion market for credit default swaps, insurance-like products that many say pose a systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President George W. Bush promised in his last speech to the United Nations that markets would stabilize but faced criticism over the excesses of what some have described as a culture of greed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'SHARE THE OUTRAGE'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson, a former Goldman Sachs boss reportedly worth about $700 million, told Congress, "I share the outrage that people have. It's embarrassing for the United States of America."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat associated with Wall Street's interests, pressed Paulson on if he could take the money in installments, starting with $150 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson replied bluntly, "We need the full authority."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What this is about is market confidence," he said. "It's a sad story, but the American taxpayer is already on the hook."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress and the Bush administration are under growing pressure to act following a rising tide of U.S. home foreclosures and loan defaults, and the failure of U.S. investment banks as well as the world's largest insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts doubt Paulson and Bernanke can end America's worst crisis of confidence since the 1930s' Great Depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(They) have been wrong about nearly everything since this crisis began years ago," said Barry Ritholtz, director of research at New York investment firm Fusion IQ. "Why should we trust (their) judgment on the largest bailout in American history?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the elections looming, executive compensation is a hot-button issue, and appears to be the main bone of contention as Washington crafts the bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein about $54 million last year. Wall Street's last two independent banks, Goldman and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), got approval days ago to convert to banks to shelter them from the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N boss John Thain was paid $15 million to join the company last year. He could get another $10 million when Merrill's sale to Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) goes through -- a sale prompted by Merrill's troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) paid boss Martin Sullivan $14 million last year. AIG was rescued a week ago by an $85 billion federal loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found 57 percent of Americans support the bailout, even though only 19 percent believe the government is doing a good job of handling the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the New York Federal Reserve bank, 40 people protested with banners reading "Bail out Main Street, not just Wall Street" and "$700 billion for banks, $0 for homeowners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An angry venture capitalist took a full-page ad in the New York Times, dubbing Bush, Paulson and Bernanke the "new Communists" in a cartoon where the trio planted a flag with a Communist hammer and sickle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SNAPPING UP ASSETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the turmoil swirled, Japanese firms are snapping up U.S. assets.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Architects of a $700 billion bailout plan urged U.S. lawmakers to act swiftly or face dire economic consequences as global stock markets fell for a second day on growing concern the rescue may be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But financial markets got a shot in the arm late Tuesday when one of America's most-respected investors, Warren Buffett, bought a stake in Wall Street's most powerful firm, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Berkshire Hathaway'ssurprise $5 billion deal for about 9 percent of Goldman helped U.S. stock futures pare losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told lawmakers during five hours of grueling hearings on Tuesday that the bailout was "sad" and "embarrassing," but needed to stave off a deep recession and restore confidence in markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he spoke, the U.S. Federal Reserve was forced to inject another $2 billion into the troubled financial system to help mutual funds scrambling to raise cash to meet heavy withdrawals by rattled customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lawmakers scoffed at the proposed bailout's enormous size and the lack of details, U.S. stocks closed down about 1.5 percent on uncertainty over when and how Washington would act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank warned the plan might not pass until Monday, adding that the Democrat-controlled Congress needed limits on compensation for executives of firms offloading bad assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just don't think the American public is sold," said David Dietze, chief investment officer at Point View Financial Services in Summit, New Jersey.

"It's a sad story, but the American taxpayer is already on the hook."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress and the Bush administration are under growing pressure to act following a rising tide of U.S. home foreclosures and loan defaults, and the failure of U.S. investment banks as well as the world's largest insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts doubt Paulson and Bernanke can end America's worst crisis of confidence since the 1930s' Great Depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(They) have been wrong about nearly everything since this crisis began years ago," said Barry Ritholtz, director of research at New York investment firm Fusion IQ. "Why should we trust (their) judgment on the largest bailout in American history?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the elections looming, executive compensation is a hot-button issue, and appears to be the main bone of contention as Washington crafts the bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein about $54 million last year. Wall Street's last two independent banks, Goldman and Morgan Stanley, got approval days ago to convert to banks to shelter them from the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch  Co Inc boss John Thain was paid $15 million to join the company last year. He could get another $10 million when Merrill's sale to Bank of America Corp goes through -- a sale prompted by Merrill's troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest insurer American International Group Inc paid boss Martin Sullivan $14 million last year. AIG was rescued a week ago by an $85 billion federal loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found 57 percent of Americans support the bailout, even though only 19 percent believe the government is doing a good job of handling the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the New York Federal Reserve bank, 40 people protested with banners reading "Bail out Main Street, not just Wall Street" and "$700 billion for banks, $0 for homeowners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An angry venture capitalist took a full-page ad in the New York Times, dubbing Bush, Paulson and Bernanke the "new Communists" in a cartoon where the trio planted a flag with a Communist hammer and sickle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SNAPPING UP ASSETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the turmoil swirled, Japanese firms are snapping up U.S. assets. Nomura Holdings Inc agreed to buy bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's Europe and Middle East operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That came on the heels of Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, agreeing to buy up to 20 percent of Morgan Stanley and Nomura planning to buy Lehman's franchise in Japan and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singapore sovereign fund GIC said it still has plenty of cash after investing nearly $18 billion in UBS AG and Citigroup Inc, and would consider investing in U.S. distressed assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Egan; Reporting by Jason Neely, Glenn Somerville, John Poirier, Donna Smith, Patrick Worsnip and Matt Spetalnick; editing by John Wallace, Jeffrey Benkoe, Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) will invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), in a major boost for the Wall Street bank from perhaps the world's best-known investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's a vote of confidence which is gold plated," said Michael Holland, a money manager at Holland  Co in New York. "You don't get better than this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman rose 6.5 percent following the announcement, while Standard  Poor's 500 futures gained 16 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire will buy $5 billion of perpetual preferred stock that carries a 10 percent dividend. It also will receive warrants to buy $5 billion of common stock, or 43.5 million shares, at $115 per share, within five years, which could give it a roughly 9 percent stake in Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also plans to sell at least $2.5 billion of common stock in a public offering. The company averaged 448.3 million common shares outstanding in the quarter ended Aug 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman had fallen 50 percent from their record set last Oct 31, as credit markets tightened and investors worried about the viability of U.S. investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Goldman said it would become a bank holding company, enabling it to accept deposits and killing the investment bank model that dominated Wall Street for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett, for his part, has built his reputation on investing in companies he considers undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman Sachs is an exceptional institution," Buffett said in a statement. "It has an unrivaled global franchise, a proven and deep management team and the intellectual and financial capital to continue its track record of outperformance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett was not available for immediate comment, according to Debbie Bosanek, who works in his Omaha, Nebraska office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly they are saying that Goldman is not only going to be a survivor, but that it is going to prosper in this new world of financial companies," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, in a statement called Buffett's investment "a strong validation of our client franchise and future prospects. This investment will further bolster our strong capitalization and liquidity position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment is Buffett's second major purchase in less than a week. On Thursday, Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co affiliate agreed to buy power supplier Constellation Energy Group Inc CEG.N for $4.7 billion. Constellation took that bid over a higher offer led by French energy giant Electricite de France SA (EDF.PA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTHER BANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's abandoning of the investment banking model has raised speculation it might merge with a commercial lender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire as of June 30 disclosed stakes in six major U.S. banking and financial services companies: American Express Co (AXP.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), MT Bank Corp (MTB.N), SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N), U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N). The latter was Berkshire's largest equity investment other than Coca-Cola Co (KO.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bancorp spokesman Steve Dale and Wells Fargo spokeswoman Julia Tunis Bernard declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Architects of a $700 billion bailout plan urged U.S. lawmakers to act swiftly or face dire economic consequences as global stock markets fell for a second day on growing concern the rescue may be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But financial markets got a shot in the arm late Tuesday when one of America's most-respected investors, Warren Buffett, bought a stake in Wall Street's most powerful firm, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N). Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N)surprise $5 billion deal for about 9 percent of Goldman helped U.S. stock futures pare losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told lawmakers during five hours of grueling hearings on Tuesday that the bailout was "sad" and "embarrassing," but needed to stave off a deep recession and restore confidence in markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he spoke, the U.S. Federal Reserve was forced to inject another $2 billion into the troubled financial system to help mutual funds scrambling to raise cash to meet heavy withdrawals by rattled customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lawmakers scoffed at the proposed bailout's enormous size and the lack of details, U.S. stocks closed down about 1.5 percent on uncertainty over when and how Washington would act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank warned the plan might not pass until Monday, adding that the Democrat-controlled Congress needed limits on compensation for executives of firms offloading bad assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just don't think the American public is sold," said David Dietze, chief investment officer at Point View Financial Services in Summit, New Jersey. "They are skeptical of the need, and they are fearful of the cost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The skepticism is that this is going to help the Wall Street financiers and do nothing for the little guy other than saddle them with a big tax bill," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis has become the No. 1 issue leading up to the November 4 presidential election, and many lawmakers seeking re-election to Congress want to appear vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bailout, potentially the United States' biggest ever, could cost every American man, woman and child $2,300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for the world's richest country, $700 billion would be a huge budget drain. Since 2003, the Iraq war has cost about $550 billion, or a little more than $100 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting two days of hearings, Paulson and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the plan might cost less once the government is able to resell toxic mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson said the government would buy the securities in a reverse auction in which the roles of buyer and seller are reversed to ensure the lowest price is paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transformation of global finance accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once thought untouchable, Goldman was shaken last week by a sudden slide in its shares.

&lt;p&gt; (New throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) will invest $5 billion in
Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), in a major boost for the Wall
Street bank from perhaps the world's best-known investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a vote of confidence which is gold plated," said
Michael Holland, a money manager at Holland  Co in New York.
"You don't get better than this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman rose 6.5 percent following the
announcement, while Standard  Poor's 500 futures SPc1 gained
16 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berkshire will buy $5 billion of perpetual preferred stock
that carries a 10 percent dividend. It also will receive
warrants to buy $5 billion of common stock, or 43.5 million
shares, at $115 per share, within five years, which could give
it a roughly 9 percent stake in Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also plans to sell at least $2.5 billion of common
stock in a public offering. The company averaged 448.3 million
common shares outstanding in the quarter ended Aug 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman had fallen 50 percent from their record
set last Oct 31, as credit markets tightened and investors
worried about the viability of U.S. investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Sunday, Goldman said it would become a bank holding
company, enabling it to accept deposits and killing the
investment bank model that dominated Wall Street for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett, for his part, has built his reputation on
investing in companies he considers undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman Sachs is an exceptional institution," Buffett said
in a statement. "It has an unrivaled global franchise, a proven
and deep management team and the intellectual and financial
capital to continue its track record of outperformance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett was not available for immediate comment, according
to Debbie Bosanek, who works in his Omaha, Nebraska office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Clearly they are saying that Goldman is not only going to
be a survivor, but that it is going to prosper in this new
world of financial companies," said Tim Ghriskey, chief
investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford
Hills, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, in a statement
called Buffett's investment "a strong validation of our client
franchise and future prospects. This investment will further
bolster our strong capitalization and liquidity position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment is Buffett's second major purchase in less
than a week. On Thursday, Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy
Holdings Co affiliate agreed to buy power supplier
Constellation Energy Group Inc CEG.N for $4.7 billion.
Constellation took that bid over a higher offer led by French
energy giant Electricite de France SA (EDF.PA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OTHER BANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's abandoning of the investment banking model has
raised speculation it might merge with a commercial lender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berkshire as of June 30 disclosed stakes in six major U.S.
banking and financial services companies: American Express Co
(AXP.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), MT Bank Corp (MTB.N),
SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N), U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and Wells
Fargo  Co (WFC.N). The latter was Berkshire's largest equity
investment other than Coca-Cola Co (KO.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Bancorp spokesman Steve Dale and Wells Fargo
spokeswoman Julia Tunis Bernard declined to comment. Bank of
America last week announced plans to buy another Wall Street
investment bank, Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N. The other
companies did not immediately return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps Buffett's most famous foray into Wall Street came
in 1991, when he became interim chairman at Salomon Inc, a
major Berkshire investment, to help it clean house following a
Treasury market scandal. It was not one of Buffett's better
investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't know if it's a statement on all the financials or
the market," said Marshall Sonenshine, chairman of Sonenshine
Partners in New York, referring to the Goldman investment. "He
sees Goldman Sachs as a good value where it's currently priced.
Remember, he invested in Salomon Brothers in the past, and that
wasn't a sign that Salomon was going to start doing well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett may have reason to believe otherwise, said Anton
Schutz, a portfolio manager at Mendon Capital Advisors in
Rochester, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The valuation is great, and with what the government's
doing to unfreeze debt markets, it's a great time to be
buying," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman rose $8.07 to $133.12 in after-hours
trading following the announcement, after closing up $4.27, or
3.5 percent, to $125.05 in regular trading.

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's biggest drugmaker, is especially intrigued by new discoveries using induced pluripotent stem cells or iPS cells, in which researchers coax ordinary cells into behaving like embryonic stem cells, said John McNeish, an executive director in global research and development at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These cells will be tremendous in drug discovery. They will help us understand personalized medicine, genetic variation, ethnic populations, what biomarkers to follow," McNeish said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McNeish heads the company's new regenerative medicine unit set up last spring in Cambridge, Massachusetts and devoted to stem cell therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of the unit is to combine Pfizer's strengths in making pills with therapies that take advantage of the unique properties of stem cells, the body's master cells that can give rise to any tissue in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPS cells can be collected from people with genetic diseases or from specific populations and grown in batches that will live for months and years in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the first applications will be in drug testing, McNeish said in an interview at the World Stem Cell Summit in Madison, Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stem cells can help us make good decisions around which compounds will be more likely to be safe," McNeish said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down the road, he said Pfizer hoped to use compounds to stimulate stem cells in the body to repair injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in chronic heart failure, the hope is to use a drug to stimulate the production of new heart cells to repair damaged tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't even have to be that much. A three or four percent improvement could be a tremendous improvement in their quality of life," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McNeish will run Pfizer's U.S. unit, which will focus on heart disease and diabetes. In November, the company plans to open a standalone regenerative medicine unit in Cambridge, United Kingdom, to focus on research in ophthalmology and diseases of the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McNeish said the overall operation will eventually have 50 to 60 scientists working on stem cell therapies, and they are working with academic researchers and smaller biotech companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have several small collaborations already announced and we have several in the works that we hope to be announcing in the next months or so," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McNeish feels the move is a bold one. "It's tough times in the pharma industry -- it is in all industries. For Pfizer to take a risk is very telling," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he thinks Pfizer is the first to have its own research institute, many other drug companies making investments as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L), the world's second biggest drugmaker, signed a deal worth more than $25 million with the Harvard Stem Cell Institute to use stem cell technology for drug development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And last year, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) and Roche Holding (ROG.VX) launched Stem Cells for Safer Medicines, a collaboration to use stem cells for safety testing of new drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think other pharma companies are watching us very carefully," McNeish said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Maggie Fox, Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures
surged in extended trading on Tuesday after Warren Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway surprised investors with a $5 billion

a company. Buffett is so highly regarded as an intelligent
value investor, if he's putting a lot of money into a company

maybe not every financial company should be ignored at this

Suryo Suwignjo, President, Director, IBM Indonesia.

    "This is a very unique offering now being made available to businesses in
Indonesia who recognize the need to mitigate continuity risks that their
companies may be exposed to. IBM's Data Recovery Center helps clients
focus on the human side of business continuity to ensure that employees
can remain productive even when they cannot access their workplace in
unexpected events of floods, terrorist threats, large-scale power outages,
fire or other instances of IT infrastructure outages," stated Soeparwan
Soelaeman, Country Manager, Global Technology Services IBM Indonesia.

    A 2006 study on workforce continuity by Forrester Consulting found that
business interruptions such as site closures due to fire, natural
disasters, transit strikes, and severe weather potentially leave the data
center unaffected, but can displace employees from their workplace --
significantly impacting the productivity of the employee and in turn,
financially impacting the company.*(1)

    The new IBM Data Recovery Center offering from IBM will provide end-to-end
solutions that helps clients to operationalize a business continuity plan
-- in that it spans people, processes and technology, while also help to
ensure uninterrupted operations across all layers of the business, as well
as helping businesses avoid, prepare and recover from a disruption.

&lt;p&gt;Mayor's Fund Receives Support
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Production Company announced today a donation of
$250,000 for disaster relief in Grand Isle, Louisiana.

   "The physical damage from Hurricane Ike's storm surge has been
devastating, particularly in Grand Isle," said Randy Cleveland,
ExxonMobil's U.S. Production manager.

   ExxonMobil's donation is being directed to the Grand Isle
Hurricane Relief Fund.

   "Our sincere thoughts go out to the residents who are in need of
assistance so they can return to their homes on the island," Cleveland
said. "Mayor David Camardelle and the city's immediate response have
been outstanding. We strongly believe that it is important to support
the city's continued efforts to provide the assistance and disaster
relief needed. With employees and contractors living in the affected
area, this disaster is extremely personal to us."

   "The city sincerely appreciates this gift because it directly
benefits residents who are in need and it encourages other donors.
ExxonMobil is always there for the people of Grand Isle," said Mayor
Camardelle.

   Since immediately after both Hurricanes Gustav and Ike,
ExxonMobil's Grand Isle base has provided support for local emergency
services workers and utilities personnel working to ensure residents
can safely return to the Island.

   Grand Isle serves as ExxonMobil's primary marine and helicopter
base for its eastern Gulf of Mexico oil and gas operations. ExxonMobil
Pipeline Company, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, also has operations on
Grand Isle.

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DC, Sep 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Unlike most museums that begin as a physical building, the National
Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) is using
innovative technology on the Web to become as real as concrete now for
online visitors. A new IBM audio cast explores the progress of the
Smithsonian's newest museum since its virtual opening one year ago, and
how technology is playing a key role in shaping the museum's content.

    "The museum on the Web allows us to test ideas, research, exhibits and the
kind of artifacts we want to collect so that when the bricks and mortar
are up, it is the innovative 21st century museum that we want," said
Lonnie G. Bunch III, founding director of NMAAHC.

    In this audio cast, Mr. Bunch and Stanley Litow, IBM Vice President for
Corporate Citizenship and Corporate Affairs discuss why anyone with
relevant history should participate in a unique feature called the Memory
Book.

    "Using the latest in social networking technology, IBM created the Memory
Book to allow virtual museum visitors to upload his or her memory or story
so that it can be shared with those that are developing the museum's
content, as well as other visitors, family and friends," said Mr. Litow.

    In addition to capturing stories that might otherwise be lost, it also
pictorially displays the relationships between people, places and
historical events. For example, former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown
shares an audio memoir of growing up in a "separate but equal" school.
Jackson B remembers rolling Easter eggs at the National Zoo in Washington
in the 1930s. Kelvin B. Fowler writes a story telling how his great-great
grandfather escaped slavery by hitching a boat ride with a group of
fisherman and sailing to freedom in Virginia.

    The museum will staff a memory-posting table during the Congressional
Black Caucus Foundation's 38th Annual Legislative Conference to gather
stories from members of congress, their staff and conference
participants. The memory posting service will be available during three
days of the conference at the Washington Convention Center: Thursday,
Sept. 25 from noon until 7 p.m.; Friday, Sept. 26 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.;
and Saturday, Sept. 27 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.

    About the National Museum of African American History and Culture:

    The National Museum of African American History and Culture was created by
an Act of Congress in 2003, making it the 19th museum of the Smithsonian
Institution. Its collections and educational programming will cover topics
as varied as slavery, post-Civil War reconstruction, the Harlem
Renaissance, and the civil rights movement. In addition to staging a
national tour of its inaugural exhibition, "Let Your Motto Be Resistance:
African American Portraits," the museum is producing scholarly books and
compact disc recordings, conducting a national collecting initiative
called Save Our African American Treasures, and offering programming
across the country and in five target cities: Atlanta, Chicago, Los
Angeles, New York and Washington. The museum will be built on a five-acre
site adjacent to the Washington Monument on the National Mall. It is
scheduled to open in 2015.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, share movement) Sept 23 (Reuters) -
J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded Primedia Inc PRM.N to
"neutral" from "underweight," citing the recent weakness in the
consumer-magazine publisher's share price and continued growth
at its Apartment Guide unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Apartment Guides momentum should persist near-term. The
flagship... has grown revenue the past 4 quarters, and further
gains are expected in the second half of 2008," analyst Michael
Meltz wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meltz, however, expects revenue from the company's New Home
division to drop 20 percent in the second half, given the
ongoing woes of homebuilders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said while he sees few positive near-term
catalysts for the company, which owns the ApartmentGuide.com
and Rentals.com websites, he does not believe there is much
additional downside from current levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Primedia shares, which have shed more than 60 percent of
their value since the start of the year, were up about 4
percent at $3.04 in morning trade on the New York Stock
Exchange. They touched a high of $3.29 earlier in the session.

&lt;p&gt;New Research from Mediaedge:cia Shows Coca-Cola and Adidas as the Beijing 2008 Sponsorship Winners

      Latest research from Mediaedge:cia, a leading media agency,
reveals the value of the Beijing 2008 Olympics for its official Global
                               Partners
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Beijing 2008 Olympic Games have been heralded as a resounding
success for China, the organisers and athletes alike. But for the 12
brands that were the official Global Partners of the Beijing 2008,
spending a total of $866m on their sponsorship, did it really deliver
on their aims?

   Overall, the 12 official Global Partners collectively increased
awareness of their brands amongst Chinese consumers by 84%, an average
7% increase per brand. But amongst these Global Partner brands there
were considerable differences in the success they had in raising
consumer awareness.

   Of all the Global Partners, Coca-Cola was by far the most
successful brand in leveraging its sponsorship. Chinese consumers
reported a 19% increase in their awareness of the brand after the
Olympics in comparison to before, with nearly 60% of all Chinese
consumers in September being aware that it was an Olympic sponsor.
This is in part attributed to Coca-Cola's long-standing sponsorship of
the Olympic Games having been continually affiliated with the Olympic
Games since 1986. The crucial difference for Coca-Cola was its
investment in activation of its sponsorship.

   Coca-Cola trebled its monthly spend in the six weeks leading up to
the opening ceremony and continued its investment throughout the
period, with the brand spending 1.4m RMB on above-the-line
advertising, nearly 20% more than any of the other of the 12 Global
Partners. Crucially this investment paid off for Coca-Cola with 50% of
Chinese consumers confirming they thought more positively about the
brand and 37% claiming they would be more likely to buy Coca-Cola.

   Yet where Coca-Cola succeeded, other Global Partners failed to
achieve similar levels of uplift in consumer awareness. The two brands
which truly captured the attention of Chinese consumers were a Tier
Two Partner and a brand that was not an official sponsor of the
Olympic Games at all; Adidas and Li Ning.

   Adidas was the brand that by-far achieved the greatest uplift in
comparison to its original awareness, with a significant 24% increase
in consumer awareness. This was achieved not only by successfully
capitalising on its sponsorship with above-the-line advertising (see
diagram 1) but also through its kit deal which saw all Chinese
medalists wearing Adidas sportwear during the medal collection. This
was reflected in the amount of consumers that were likely to think
more positively and more likely to purchase the brand following the
Olympics, with both figures showing an increase of more than 30%.

   However, the unexpected brand success story of Beijing 2008 was
local sportswear retailer Li Ning. MEC research revealed that
consumers' brand awareness soared from 8% in April 2008 to 21% after
the Games. While Li Ning had no official Games sponsor status, the
company sponsored the Chinese gymnastics team, while the founder was
chosen to light the torch at the opening ceremony. This jump in brand
awareness saw Li Ning's share price rise 6% overnight.

   Commenting on the research, Jon Wright, director of MEC MediaLab
APAC, said: "Beijing 2008 was the biggest and most significant
opportunity to date for brands to capture the interest of Chinese
consumers. Our research clearly shows that it's not just about how
much money you have. If brands want to maximize the return of their
sponsorship they need consistent, integrated advertising strategies.
But it's not just what you do with an event that is as vast as the
Olympics, it is also how you do it. There are six months from the
torch relay to the end of the Games, and our research has shown that
the brands that succeed are the ones that continually keep their
advertising and sponsorship fresh and engaging for consumers."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 


--  IBM Systems Director can help reduce system administration and energy
costs by nearly 30 percent(1) in a typical datacenter; 
--  Easy-to-use "intelligent dashboard" includes simple user interface,
virtualization management and active energy management tools; 
--  IBM Systems Director integrates with IBM Tivoli software to provide a
total service management solution
-- with emphasis on virtualization, energy efficiency, automation and
availability. 

    
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced an "intelligent dashboard" that will
allow clients to view, maintain and adjust the energy consumption,
performance, and hardware utilization of their multi-system, virtualized
environment -- all in a single view.

    The new IBM(R) Systems Director 6.1 software, part of IBM's New Enterprise
Data Center strategy to streamline complex infrastructures, is a suite of
software tools to help clients manage energy, virtualization and overall
computer operations. While industry spending on service administration and
energy for running servers exceeds the spending on the server hardware
themselves(2), IBM Systems Director helps clients reduce system
administration and energy costs by nearly 30 percent in a typical data
center, according to a recent International Technology Group study.

    With the new IBM Systems Director as a foundation, IBM delivers an
end-to-end systems management solution that helps clients deploy, monitor,
analyze, optimize and update the server consolidation and virtualization
environments that businesses are deploying today in an effort reduce the
complexity and control the costs of their IT infrastructures. For CIO's,
server virtualization, server consolidation and cost cutting are the three
top priorities today, according to recent studies(3). Specifically, IBM
Systems Director allows clients to:


--  Control costs and reduce complexity of systems management by
integrating platform management provided by IBM Systems Director with IBM
Tivoli(R) enterprise service management for a total IT service management
strategy; 
--  Optimize the use of virtual resources to drive up server utilization
and to reduce energy usage and cooling; 
--  Reduce downtime by monitoring the "health status" of physical and
virtual resources on one server or across the datacenter. 

    
"With IBM Systems Director, we're providing clients a means to better
understand the complexity and costs associated with managing their
datacenter," Rich Lechner, Vice President, Enterprise Systems. "As a
result, clients can coordinate and manage the virtual and physical
resources that make up their entire infrastructure. The combination of IBM
Systems Director and Tivoli software consolidates an IT manager's
infrastructure in one view -- an 'intelligent dashboard' -- allowing them
to see and manage in real time the energy, space and people costs they
need to allocate for and optimize."

    The next-generation IBM Systems Director software now has integrated
cross-platform virtualization management as well as a redesigned user
interface to improve productivity. Serving as a central point of the
computing environment, IBM Systems Director works to oversee the
operations of IBM System z(R), IBM Power Systems, IBM BladeCenter(R) and
IBM System x servers, as well as IBM System Storage platforms, along with
select non-IBM hardware and storage systems.

    Designed for ease-of-use, IBM Systems Director has a simple, intuitive
browser-based interface, which provides a consistent look and feel with
common and familiar management tasks. Additionally, it gives users a
complete, single view of the data center's physical and virtual devices
and energy consumption through the IBM Systems Director Active Energy
Manager plug in -- including details from facility assets such as power
distribution and cooling equipment.

    Specific IBM server and storage offerings that the new IBM Systems
Director applies to:


--  IBM Power Systems: IBM Systems Director for Power Systems supports the
entire server line from the high-end to blades and helps clients deploy,
monitor, analyze, optimize and update Power server and storage physical and
virtual resources running any combination of AIX, i or Linux(TM) workloads.
A new edition of IBM's UNIX operating system, AIX "Enterprise Edition"
includes the IBM Systems Director agent and integrates the AIX Workload
Partition (WPAR) Manager as well as Tivoli components that discover
applications and server relationships, monitor system utilization and
configuration changes and provide a visual representation of systems usage.
More information can be found here:
www.ibm.com/systems/power/software/management 
--  IBM System z: Available for customers running Linux on System z, IBM
Systems Director exploits the mainframe's inherent virtualization
capabilities to scale resources to support millions of transactions per day
or scale out to manage tens to hundreds of virtual servers. It supports
z/VM(R) 5.4 and is designed to run hundreds to thousands of Linux servers
on a single mainframe running with other System z operating systems, such
as z/OS(R), or as a large-scale Linux-only enterprise server solution. z/VM
can also help to improve productivity by hosting non-Linux workloads such
as z/OS, z/VSE, and z/TPF. More information can be found here:
www.ibm.com/systems/z/advantages/virtualization/
--  IBM System x: IBM System x(TM) servers are based on X-Architecture(R),
IBM's design blueprint for Intel processor-based servers, providing
exceptional power-efficiency, performance and virtualization capabilities
for today's most demanding datacenters. IBM Systems Director is supported
across the IBM System x portfolio, supplying clients a single, consistent
interface to better manage IT. More information can be found here:
www.ibm.com/systems/x/advantages/ 
--  IBM BladeCenter: IBM BladeCenter combines servers, storage and
networking in a single system. IBM Systems Director supports the entire IBM
BladeCenter portfolio of five chassis and multiple servers designed to meet
a wide range of specific client needs. More information can be found here:

&lt;p&gt;- Celebrating corporate America's family-friendly leaders -
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Working Mother magazine today named the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
(NYSE: GS) one of the 2008 Working Mother 100 Best Companies. Goldman
Sachs' expansive family-friendly policies and programs are tremendous
assets in helping the firm's employees balance work demands with
family needs. The response to these programs underscores their
importance and year after year, they continue to be among the most
appreciated, utilized and highly praised benefits the firm offers.

   "The economy is not going to alter the commitment of Goldman Sachs
to working mothers, because they've made family-friendly policies a
part of their corporate DNA," said Carol Evans, CEO, Working Mother
Media. "Supporting families is a vital part of their culture and not
just an added benefit."

   Added Suzanne Riss, Editor in Chief, Working Mother magazine, "In
a world where we are all trying to balance work/life demands, Goldman
Sachs has created a highly motivated workplace by making benefits like
flextime, backup childcare and parental leave available to their
employees. The firm understands these benefits are necessary for
productivity and commitment to the business."

   Goldman Sachs' family-friendly benefit extends beyond working
mothers, but to adoptive parents as well as fathers. The firm has a
very comprehensive programming in place to address a diversity of
needs to their employees. These benefits include: time off for
infertility treatments, on-site adoption consultants, adoption
subsidies, expectant parent seminars, maternity mentoring, 16-weeks
paid maternity leave, lactation support, manager maternity training
and extensive back-up child care options.

   "Investing in people and finding innovative ways to support them
is critical to Goldman Sachs' success," said Edith Cooper, Managing
Director and global head of Human Capital Management for Goldman
Sachs. "The dedication with which our people approach their work is
unparalleled. Our employees give a lot of themselves to the firm, and
it is important we stay in tuned with their needs professionally and
personally by continuing to provide meaningful benefits and support at
all phases of their professional and personal lives."

   Methodology:

   Goldman Sachs was selected for the 2008 Working Mother 100 Best
Companies based on an extensive application with more than 500
questions. The application included detailed questions about
workforce, compensation, child care, flexibility programs, leave
policies and more. It also checked the usage, availability and
tracking of programs, as well as the accountability of managers who
oversee them. Seven areas were measured and scored: workforce profile,
compensation, child care, flexibility, time off and leaves,
family-friendly programs, and company culture. For this year's 100
Best, particular weight was given to family-friendly policies,
flexibility, leave policies and benefits for part-timers.

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Sep 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
With the back to school season well underway, results from Visa Canada's
new Practical Money Skills survey shows that parents can play a pivotal
role in helping their teenage children become more financially
responsible. Surveying more than one thousand Canadian students in their
final year of high school, the survey shows that respondents frequently
turn to their parents (77 percent) for information on financial planning.
Respondents were also more likely to develop and maintain a budget
compared to those who had never discussed financial planning with a
parent or guardian (24 percent versus 15 percent).

    "The practicalmoneyskills.ca website helps students take charge of their
money with its no-nonsense approach," said Amy Cole, Acting Head of
Corporate Communications, Visa Canada. "It includes handy online
resources for managing expenses and drafting budgets that are appropriate
for parents and students. Visiting the site is also a great way for
parents to initiate discussions with their children about making
responsible financial decisions."

    More than 80 percent of graduating high school students surveyed will
attend post-secondary institutions next year, with half indicating they
will rely on student loans. While almost 80 percent of students surveyed
are realistic about the amount of debt they will accumulate, almost
two-thirds indicated unrealistic expectations about their future starting
salaries and their ability to repay student loans. Only 15 percent of
students surveyed expressed concern about long-term financial goals,
indicating they may lack awareness about the need for long-term financial
planning. Interestingly, more than three-quarters of students surveyed
agree that money management and budgeting should be mandatory school
curriculum.

    For students surveyed who have found it tough to follow a budget, the
challenge seems to be integrating money management skills into their
daily lives. When asked the primary reasons why they don't stick to a
financial plan, 30 percent of respondents said that it was "totally
unrealistic" and 27 percent believed it was "way too strict and hard to
follow." The Practical Money Skills website and booklet can help as both
encourage students to identify S.M.A.R.T. (specific, measurable,
attainable, relevant and time-related) goals and breaks the budgeting
process into manageable steps; making the financial planning process less
intimidating by encouraging students to "track, trim and target" their
finances.

    "While nearly half of the students surveyed felt prepared or very
prepared for managing money after high school, one-third of respondents
had never created a budget before," said Cole. "The tools available
through practicalmoneyskills.ca help high school, university and college
students to manage their day-to-day finances and create a realistic plan
to achieve financial independence."

    In an effort to make the information more accessible to students and
parents, visitors to practicalmoneyskills.ca can download the Practical
Money Skills brochure in English, French, Spanish, and Chinese. Punjabi
and Arabic versions are scheduled to be available in October 2008.

while JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N)
were downgraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In afternoon trading, Wachovia shares were down $3.90, or
21 percent, at $14.85; JPMorgan fell $6.08, or 13 percent, to
$40.96, while Wells Fargo fell $5.26, or 13.2 percent, to
$34.54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 24-member KBW Bank Index .BKX was down 10 percent in
afternoon trading. It had risen 28.2 percent on Thursday and
Friday combined, as the government announced a series of
measures to calm financial markets and stabilize lenders, now
including plans to buy as much as $700 billion of troubled
assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The sector got the adrenaline shot last week, and that's
wearing off," said Michael Nix, who helps invest $750 million
at Greenwood Capital Associates LLC in Greenwood, South
Carolina. "The near-term outlook for financials still remains
pretty difficult."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, Wachovia and Wells Fargo are respectively the
third-, fourth- and fifth-largest U.S. banks by assets. Shares
of larger banks Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp
(BAC.N) also fell as the broader market tanked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wachovia shares declined after Morgan Stanley won U.S.
Federal Reserve approval to become a bank holding company,
boosting its ability to attract deposits. Morgan Stanley also
agreed to sell a possible $8.5 billion stake to Japan's
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both moves increased the Wall Street bank's perceived
ability to survive independently, without merging with a lender
with a more stable funding base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wachovia Chief Executive Robert Steel is trying to shed
non-core assets, cut 11,350 jobs and reduce annual costs by
$1.5 billion as the bank manages a "distressed"  $122 billion
portfolio of option adjustable-rate mortgages. Even so,
Wachovia shares more than doubled on Thursday and Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nix said not merging with Morgan Stanley could even be
positive for Wachovia. "It will allow Robert Steel to focus on
Wachovia and fix the franchise, without having to integrate a
significant merger at the same time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wachovia was also downgraded to "hold" from "buy" by Stifel
Nicolaus  Co analyst Christopher Mutascio, who called the
bank's recent share run-up "too much too soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo were downgraded by
Sandler O'Neill  Partners LP analysts, who said their stock
valuations already reflected the banks' positions as among the
best-run and best-performing large banks in a tough credit
environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Jeff Harte downgraded JPMorgan to "hold" from
"buy," while Scott Siefers cut Wells Fargo to "sell" from
"hold." Wells Fargo shares had hit a record high on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wachovia is based in Charlotte, North Carolina; JPMorgan in
New York, and Wells Fargo in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Sep 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
With the back to school season well underway, results from Visa Canada's
new Practical Money Skills survey shows that parents can play a pivotal
role in helping their teenage children become more financially
responsible. Surveying more than one thousand Canadian students in their
final year of high school, the survey shows that respondents frequently
turn to their parents (77 percent) for information on financial planning.
Respondents were also more likely to develop and maintain a budget
compared to those who had never discussed financial planning with a
parent or guardian (24 percent versus 15 percent).

    "The practicalmoneyskills.ca website helps students take charge of their
money with its no-nonsense approach," said Amy Cole, Acting Head of
Corporate Communications, Visa Canada. "It includes handy online
resources for managing expenses and drafting budgets that are appropriate
for parents and students. Visiting the site is also a great way for
parents to initiate discussions with their children about making
responsible financial decisions."

    More than 80 percent of graduating high school students surveyed will
attend post-secondary institutions next year, with half indicating they
will rely on student loans. While almost 80 percent of students surveyed
are realistic about the amount of debt they will accumulate, almost
two-thirds indicated unrealistic expectations about their future starting
salaries and their ability to repay student loans. Only 15 percent of
students surveyed expressed concern about long-term financial goals,
indicating they may lack awareness about the need for long-term financial
planning. Interestingly, more than three-quarters of students surveyed
agree that money management and budgeting should be mandatory school
curriculum.

    For students surveyed who have found it tough to follow a budget, the
challenge seems to be integrating money management skills into their
daily lives. When asked the primary reasons why they don't stick to a
financial plan, 30 percent of respondents said that it was "totally
unrealistic" and 27 percent believed it was "way too strict and hard to
follow." The Practical Money Skills website and booklet can help as both
encourage students to identify S.M.A.R.T. (specific, measurable,
attainable, relevant and time-related) goals and breaks the budgeting
process into manageable steps; making the financial planning process less
intimidating by encouraging students to "track, trim and target" their
finances.

    "While nearly half of the students surveyed felt prepared or very
prepared for managing money after high school, one-third of respondents
had never created a budget before," said Cole. "The tools available
through practicalmoneyskills.ca help high school, university and college
students to manage their day-to-day finances and create a realistic plan
to achieve financial independence."

    In an effort to make the information more accessible to students and
parents, visitors to practicalmoneyskills.ca can download the Practical
Money Skills brochure in English, French, Spanish, and Chinese. Punjabi
and Arabic versions are scheduled to be available in October 2008.

&lt;p&gt;  BEIJING, Sep 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and IDUG(R), the International DB2 User Group, today
announced the first global competition to identify the next generation of
software developers. Known as "The Search for the XML Superstar," the
contest will be open to all university students, faculty and professional
developers across China, India and Southeast Asia testing knowledge of
and skills in XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and database technologies.

    "When universities and businesses collaborate, they build the next
generation of skilled information technology leaders to create new
opportunities, fuel economic growth and solve challenges that improve the
human condition," said Inhi Cho Suh, vice president of IBM Data Management
Marketing. "This competition and our collaboration with IDUG is yet
another example of our goal to cultivate individuals and communities with
experience in innovative XML database technologies in hyper-growth markets
such as Southeast Asia, China and India."

    Twenty-five years ago, relational database technology was invented by IBM
Research, delivering the first commercially available database software
program in the early 1980s. IBM has continued to invest and lead in the
delivery of significant innovations in data server technology such as DB2
software with pureXML support to provide a seamless flow of information
of both XML and relational data, regardless of format, platform or
location.

    "This competition is an effective way to bring real world industry
experience to students to keep them in touch with IT trends and emerging
technologies," said Min Wang, Assistant Director, School of Software
Engineering, Tongji University. "We believe the XML competition will
promote this exciting technology among students faster than any textbooks.
Participants who benefit from it are finding themselves already one step
ahead."

    "XML is the modern catalyst of information exchange and integration,"
Associate Professor Stephane Bressan of National University of Singapore
(NUS) School of Computing said. "Regardless of whether they are small to
medium or multinationals, companies need to have the capability to manage
XML data in a seamless environment for efficiency and productivity."

    "NUS School of Computing upholds a cutting edge competence and creativity
as integral elements in its teaching and research," added Dr. Bressan. "We
are glad to note this perspective resonates within the IT industry, and we
are pleased to team with IDUG and IBM in their efforts to organise the XML
contest as a platform to enable computing students and professionals to
showcase their abilities to innovate."

    The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes
Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, is
the third region to introduce this contest, following its earlier launch
in North America and Europe. The contest has generated enthusiastic
participation of students, faculty and professional developers throughout
all the participating countries.

    Access to this contest will be open to those with or without prior
knowledge of or experience with XML and database management. The
competition will give participants an opportunity to learn about these
technologies, which are necessary in a global economy in which the ability
to leverage information will help increase their marketability in the IT
industry.

    "IDUG is pleased to support this worldwide effort to extol the virtues of
XML among developers and database professionals and to members of the
academic community," said Julian Stuhler, president of IDUG. "This contest
aligns perfectly with IDUG's mission of education, creating connections
and sharing best practices among those who rely on DB2 and related
technologies. We hope that this initiative will not only showcase the
power of XML, but illustrate the importance of a peer-based community as a
means to a successful professional career."

    "The Search for the XML Superstar" was initiated by IBM in collaboration
with the IDUG, an independent, user-run organization of data management
professionals. IDUG's mission, and, to an extent, the goal of the
partnership, is to support the information services community by providing
education and services to utilize IBM's DB2 family of products. Categories
in the competition will include Video Mania, Query Challenge and
Programming.

&lt;p&gt;New Format Allows Financial Institutions to Instantly Issue
Customized Visa Credit and Debit Cards in the Branch - Increasing
Customer Convenience and Reducing Issuer Costs
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced that it will begin supporting
the issuance of "unembossed" cards in the U.S. for Visa consumer
debit, business debit and consumer credit cards. Unembossed payment
cards feature printed personalized information, such as the account
number and cardholder name, rather than embossed with raised lettering
currently found on most U.S credit and debit products. By changing the
Visa U.S.A Inc. Operating Regulations to allow the issuance of
unembossed cards, Visa is providing more choice, flexibility and value
for issuers and their cardholders. The move follows a series of
successful pilot tests with a dozen U.S. financial institutions,
including Commerce Bancshares, Inc., TD Banknorth and United Heritage
Credit Union.

   "Being able to instantly provide members with Visa cards has
helped us drive activation, usage and loyalty while reducing costs,"
said Michael Ver Schuur, executive vice president at United Heritage
Credit Union, which participated in a pilot program testing the
unembossed Visa cards. "Not only that, our cardholders felt secure
receiving their cards directly at the branch and enjoyed the ability
to access their accounts conveniently right away."

   Traditional embossed cards typically require lengthier production
times and more complex supply chain management. Because the cards have
to be created offsite, they are generally shipped to the cardholders
days after enrollment, leaving the new cardholder unable to make
purchases or conveniently access cash at ATMs in the interim or
relying on a temporary generic card. The ability to provide
personalized printed cards instantly at the bank branch enables
cardholders to take advantage of their cards immediately.

   Visa has permitted unembossed prepaid cards in the U.S. since
2005. The new regulations give issuers the ability to also issue a
consumer debit or credit card as well as a business debit card
immediately to customers, giving them greater flexibility to manage
their Visa card distribution methods to best fit their business needs.

   "Visa is always looking for ways to bring more value to our
clients and their cardholders," said Stacey Pinkerd, Head of Global
Consumer Debit Products, Visa Inc. "By allowing the issuance of
unembossed cards, we enable issuers to choose the distribution method
that best meets their business needs, while offering customers greater
flexibility and customization. Looking ahead, we will continue to
innovate to provide products that meet financial institutions' demand
for flexibility and cardholders' demand for convenience and security."

   Visa unembossed cards are accepted by most Visa merchants, with
the exception of those who require a manual imprint at the point of
sale such as with an old-style "zip-zap" machine, and can be used for
purchases made online, by mail or by phone.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 23 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded Melco
Crown Entertainment (MPEL.O)to "neutral" from "overweight" and
said the casino and resorts operator had an "impaired" VIP

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 23 (Reuters) - Online movie rental company Netflix Inc
(NFLX.O) said it signed agreements with the CBS Corp (CBS.N)
and Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) Disney Channel that will allow
current season episodes of a number of TV shows to be streamed
at Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Netflix subscribers will be able to watch television shows
including CBS's "CSI" and "NCIS" and the Disney Channel's
"Hannah Montana" and "Wizards of Waverly Place," over the
Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreements with CBS and Disney Channel also add older
TV shows such as "Star Trek," "MacGyver," and "Family Ties, to
the library of choices that can be streamed on Netflix, the
company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The online DVD rental pioneer said members can watch the
shows on their PCs and TVs as part of their existing
subscription plans and without impacting the number of DVDs
they receive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Netflix in recent years has become a staple of home
entertainment for many Americans who like the user friendly
Internet ordering system for DVDs and rapid delivery by mail.
It also has increased its online video offerings.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - An unusual surge in Goldman Sachs' share price in the last 10 minutes of trading on Tuesday raised eyebrows on Wall Street, as it came two hours before news of Warren Buffett's big investment in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS.N) shares rose more than $5 heading into the close of trading even as the rest of the market tumbled, leaving traders suspicious that inside information was used to make a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously someone knew the Buffett news that was coming out. I noticed it yesterday and I was telling my colleagues something is going on with Goldman," said Dave Rovelli, managing director of US Equity Trading at Canaccord Adams in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission spokesman John Nester declined to comment on whether the incident is being investigated. Goldman Sachs could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before 6 p.m. EDT, Goldman Sachs said it would get a $5 billion investment from Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N), which investors welcomed as a much needed vote of confidence in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's shares have since risen about 6 percent. If someone with inside knowledge of the deal was snapping up the bank's shares they would have made a significant, and illegal, profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Someone is going to get caught, because that is easy to track, they can find out who did that," said Rovelli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' stock rose from $119.53 at 3:50 p.m. to $125.05 at the close. The SP financials sub-index meanwhile fell from 273.79 to 273.61 in the same time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That share move at Goldman was a clear outlier. It got everybody's attention. It was clear that there was something specific going on in that stock that wasn't going on in any other stock in that space," said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a stock moves so sharply against the rest of the market, it is usually either due to company-specific news or a big seller of the stock taking a break also known as "a seller's strike," said Kenny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that volume increased in Goldman's stock in the last 10 minutes, the "seller's strike" explanation seems unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Claussen, chief investment strategist at OptionsHouse, a subsidiary of PEAK6 Investments, an options trading firm in Chicago noted that while options in Goldman were not particularly active, "it does raise eyebrows that the stock would attract so many buyers given that the Standard  Poor's 500 index closed near its lows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(additional reporting by Doris Frankel in Chicago and Rachelle Younglai in Washington; Editing by Tom Hals)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's two largest investment banks are girding themselves for a long battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past three days, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) became bank holding companies after investors last week lost confidence in their freewheeling, high-risk broker model. They're also busy stockpiling capital, sacrificing near-term results as they focus on getting through the downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman announced deals that will raise $15 billion from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) and public investors. Morgan Stanley plans to sell as much as a 20 percent stake for roughly $8.5 billion to Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.T), one of the world's largest banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves staved off the pressure that brought down Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK and will let Goldman and Morgan Stanley acquire deposits. But the stability comes at the cost of stricter regulation and slimmer returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're both saying it will be easier, and they'll see more opportunities, with more capital," said Gary Townsend, a veteran analyst who now runs hedge fund Hill-Townsend Capital. "But commercial banking is not easy and the level of leverage allowed is quite a bit different from what they're used to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two companies who said they had plenty of capital and the right business model are now raising piles of cash and changing the way they do business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts cautioned that the two newly minted banks will be forced to rein in risk and use less leverage -- the very tools that made Wall Street so enormously profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll see high- to mid-teens returns on equities. The days of 30 percent ROEs are behind us," said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's equity sales reduced leverage on the balance sheet to where each dollar of capital supports less than $20 of assets -- down from more than $30 last year -- and boosted shareholders' equity by a third to $61 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sales dilute per-share earnings by about 16 percent, and have Goldman paying Buffett a princely 10 percent coupon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Goldman Sachs, the blue chip of financials, the terms of this deal seem exorbitantly expensive and provide insight into how truly challenging current market conditions are," Oppenheimer  Co analyst Meredith Whitney wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basking in the glow of its Buffett endorsement, Goldman shares rose more than 6 percent on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH TIMES AHEAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the tough times for banks are far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury Department's proposal to soak up hard-to-sell debts from ailing banks is still subject to debate in Congress. And the conditions that hurt Wall Street firms in the first place -- a slowing economy, too few deals and illiquid debt markets -- have not improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all the positive developments this week, the cost of insuring against a default in Morgan Stanley debt rose Wednesday. Its shares fell 11.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The willingness to raise a lot of capital at a modest premium to book value could suggest that (Goldman's) management has a bleak outlook on the environment," Sandler O'Neill analyst Jeff Harte said in a note. "We remain cautious on the outlook for the near-term operating environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two firms also face Fed demands for greater disclosure about their trades and investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're certainly at the end of an era. The higher risk, high reward strategies that the investment banks utilized are certainly going to be tamed," said John Challenger, head of Challenger Gray  Christmas, who tracks job and salary trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embracing the bank model also opens the door to some new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth-largest U.S. bank with $1.1 trillion in assets, Goldman intends to snap up assets and deposits from distressed banks seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp or federal bailout plan. Goldman does not intend to acquire large banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Morgan Stanley already has a significant retail financial business through its 8,500 brokers and 3 million wealth management clients. The No. 5 U.S. bank with $989 billion of total assets has said it will expand its retail banking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It expects an alliance with Mitsubishi, the world's second largest bank by deposits, will give it a real boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MUFG talks, and its new bank status, means Morgan can pursue a whole new set of options. Talks that commenced last week with Wachovia Corp WB.N are now dead, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, even the newly empowered and capital-rich Wall Street firms are holding back from buying banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the difficulties in valuing potential targets due to rising credit problems and significant mark-to-market accounting issues," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote, "we believe strategic buyers such as Goldman and Morgan will probably remain on the sidelines for now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I certainly would like to do more," Martin Mackay, Pfizer's global head of research and development, said on Wednesday at a pharmaceutical conference in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is already involved in a co-development collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on the experimental blood clot preventer apixaban from a highly anticipated new class of medicines that has been targeted by several drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors dislike such risk-sharing deals as any profit that comes from a successful new drug must be shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mackay has been so pleased with the Bristol arrangement that it has whetted his appetite for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The apixaban deal has been terrific. It's an excellent collaboration," said Mackay, who was taking part in a panel discussion along with the research heads of Eli Lilly  Co, Wyeth and Johnson  Johnson at the Windhover Pharmaceutical Strategic Alliances conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it has exceeded both teams' expectations," he said. "When we put them together we found more synergies than I certainly had anticipated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such collaborations could help medicines and molecules that might otherwise languish in limbo eventually see the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like most of us, we have this burgeoning phase 2 pipeline which is beginning to move into phase 3, probably too many for the budget than we have, healthy as that is," Mackay said, referring to the world's largest drugmaker's more than $7 billion annual RD budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase 3 is typically the final stage of human testing before a new drug is submitted to regulators for an approval decision and involves large, extremely expensive clinical trials. So decisions on which drugs to move forward into phase 3 are as critically important as any a drug company makes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Paul, head of Lilly's research labs, said he would love to have back some of the drug candidates they decided to pass on, which have turned out to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mackay said Pfizer would be looking at collaboration opportunities even on drugs that are not yet nearing the critical phase 3 decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would like to be more creative about our assets, not just in the late stages but in earlier stages too," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see us outlicensing more of our assets and being creative about the deal making terms," Mackay said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the disturbingly high failure rate of experimental medicines -- 70 to 75 percent of all phase 2 drugs by Paul's account -- all the panelists agreed that creative risk-mitigating strategies are necessary going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth RD chief Mikael Dolsten saw one more advantage of collaborative arrangements with other drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's also a way of getting access to new talent without hiring them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  FRANKFURT, GERMANY and STUTTGART, GERMANY, Sep 24
(MARKET WIRE) -- 
Postbank AG, one of Germany's biggest financial services institutions,
will be installing three new IBM (NYSE: IBM) System z10 mainframes, IBM

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 24 (Reuters) - Recent activities in the brokerage
sector and other large financial firms may have a long-term
negative impact on trading activity, said Goldman Sachs
analysts, who downgraded the world's largest exchange operator
NYSE Euronext NYX.N to "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following a period of increased activity as the market
reacts to the recent changes in the financial markets, volumes
across many asset classes may decline 5 percent to 10 percent,
the brokerage said in a note dated Sept. 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the brokerage upgraded Nasdaq OMX Group (NDAQ.O)
and Knight Capital NITE.O, and said in the near term, it sees
exchanges benefiting from solid volume trends, which can drive
higher-than-expected third-quarter earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Nasdaq OMX Group, which was raised to "buy" from
"neutral," Goldman said, "The momentum the firm has built with
its acquisitions of OMX and the Philadelphia/Boston exchanges
is impressive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given the company's lower exposure to European equities
compared with some peers, and a solid track record of
delivering on synergies, the brokerage expects outperformance
to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman raised its price target for Nasdaq OMX Group by 14
percent to $40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage upgraded market maker Knight Capital to "buy"
from "neutral" and raised its target by $1 to $18, saying it
sees increasing geographic footprint and lack of exposure to
risky products as attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On NYSE Euronext, the brokerage expects near-term headwinds
in U.S. market share, European pricing, and global volume
trends to generally keep investors sidelined and cut its price
target by 12 percent to $46. It previously rated the stock
"buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, several financial stocks fell to their
multi-year lows and the central banks around the world poured
hundreds of billions of dollars into global credit markets to
calm nervous investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain and the United States also banned short selling on
some stocks. A further ramp up of market regulation by the U.S.
goverment is expected in order to stave off further crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which reiterated its "cautious" view on the market
structure sector, reinstated coverage of the world's largest
derivatives exchange CME Group (CME.O) with a "neutral" rating
and price target of $420.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of CME closed at $366.77, while those of Knight
Capital and Nasdaq OMX closed at $14.55 and $31.36,
respectively, on Nasdaq. Shares of NYSE Euronext closed at
$37.95 on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced eDiscovery Analyzer, new conceptual
search and content analysis software to help legal professionals
accelerate eDiscovery as they collect and assess evidence, agree upon
search terms, and cull information for use in legal cases.

    IBM also announced today that Toyota Financial Services, a leading
provider of automotive financial services, is using the IBM eDiscovery
Solution to address its growing e-mail management and legal discovery
requirements.

    "We were looking for a way to meet our Sarbanes-Oxley and Financial
Services Authority regulatory compliance needs while implementing a system
that would help us archive the hundreds of thousands of e-mails and
attachments that we manage on a daily basis," said Hemant Sohoni, Toyota
Financial Services (UK) PLC. "IBM and Neocol UK provided us with the
solution that we were looking for to meet our eDiscovery needs."

    IBM eDiscovery Analyzer

    IBM eDiscovery Analyzer, together with the recently announced IBM
eDiscovery Manager, provide the foundation for an in-house eDiscovery
platform, enabling organizations to become more proactive in controlling
electronic information and more agile in responding to litigation, while
reducing cost by decreasing the volume of information reviewed outside the
organization.

    Using the scalable IBM Enterprise Content Management (ECM) platform, IBM
eDiscovery collects, organizes, manages and retrieves relevant enterprise
information in a security-rich, access-and-change audited manner. It
enables a disciplined approach that helps reduce cost and risk while
delivering ongoing operational benefits.

    IBM eDiscovery Analyzer is designed to help legal professionals and
litigation support specialists:


--  Quickly identify and eliminate irrelevant and non-responsive e-mails to
reduce case matter to a much smaller and relevant data set, helping reduce
eDiscovery review costs



--  Gain early insight into a case, understand key facts, locate key pieces
of evidence, identify key witnesses and communication threads, and form
early case strategies



--  Flag, organize and prioritize documents for review, define the
appropriate review strategy and optimize resources for review



--  Gain a clear view of available case matter to effectively negotiate
queries and term lists during the Meet and Confer stage



--  Preserve chain of custody information to ensure security, auditability
and defensibility

    
A single and secure repository for Toyota's e-mail

    Toyota Financial Services needed a strategic solution that could be used
as a content repository for human resource documentation and
correspondence, and support the human resource department for litigation
needs. With the combined IBM-Neocol offering, Toyota Financial Services
will collect and archive more than 1.3 million e-mails and attachments --
about 100,000 e-mails per day -- in a single and secure repository. Here
they will be dynamically accessible and help the company become more
agile in responding to litigation requests.

    Toyota Financial Services is also using IBM CommonStore for Lotus Domino
and IBM Content Manager to help increase the operational efficiency of
their messaging system and reduce their escalating storage costs, while
IBM eDiscovery Manager is used to help accelerate their eDiscovery
processes. The company is extending the reach of enterprise content
management (ECM) standardization to their corporate legal departments
that currently help archive, manage, share and deliver critical business
information.

    "Our clients are looking for a more effective way to collect, store,
manage and retrieve their information," said Ken Bisconti, vice
president, product and strategy, IBM Enterprise Content Management. "This
solution is built upon our complete ECM platform to provide a new
approach to the process of eDiscovery. With the added capabilities of the
new IBM eDiscovery Analyzer, organizations can now obtain detailed
insight into discovered content early on in the process to help improve
their legal strategy and reduce cost."

    IBM eDiscovery Analyzer will be available later this month from IBM and
IBM Business Partners. For more information on IBM's eDiscovery software,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - An unusual surge in Goldman Sachs' share price in the last 10 minutes of trading on Tuesday raised eyebrows on Wall Street, as it came two hours before news of Warren Buffett's big investment in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares rose more than $5 heading into the close of trading even as the rest of the market tumbled, leaving traders suspicious that inside information was used to make a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously someone knew the Buffett news that was coming out. I noticed it yesterday and I was telling my colleagues something is going on with Goldman," said Dave Rovelli, managing director of US Equity Trading at Canaccord Adams in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission spokesman John Nester declined to comment on whether the incident is being investigated. Goldman Sachs could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before 6 p.m. EDT, Goldman Sachs said it would get a $5 billion investment from Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which investors welcomed as a much needed vote of confidence in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's shares have since risen about 6 percent. If someone with inside knowledge of the deal was snapping up the bank's shares they would have made a significant, and illegal, profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Someone is going to get caught, because that is easy to track, they can find out who did that," said Rovelli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' stock rose from $119.53 at 3:50 p.m. to $125.05 at the close. The SP financials sub-index meanwhile fell from 273.79 to 273.61 in the same time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That share move at Goldman was a clear outlier. It got everybody's attention. It was clear that there was something specific going on in that stock that wasn't going on in any other stock in that space," said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a stock moves so sharply against the rest of the market, it is usually either due to company-specific news or a big seller of the stock taking a break also known as "a seller's strike," said Kenny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that volume increased in Goldman's stock in the last 10 minutes, the "seller's strike" explanation seems unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Claussen, chief investment strategist at OptionsHouse, a subsidiary of PEAK6 Investments, an options trading firm in Chicago noted that while options in Goldman were not particularly active, "it does raise eyebrows that the stock would attract so many buyers given that the Standard  Poor's 500 index closed near its lows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(additional reporting by Doris Frankel in Chicago and Rachelle Younglai in Washington; Editing by Tom Hals)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has placed the following class of J.P. Morgan Chase
Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2006-FL2, on Rating Watch
Negative:

   --$29.3 million class L at 'BBB-'.

   In addition, Fitch affirms the following classes:

   --$306.2 million class A-1 at 'AAA';

   --$298.2 million class A-2 at 'AAA';

   --Interest-only class X-2 at 'AAA';

   --$33 million class B at 'AA+';

   --$28.1 million class C at 'AA';

   --$19.5 million class D at 'AA-';

   --$22 million class E at 'A+';

   --$22 million class F at 'A';

   --$19.5 million class G at 'A-';

   --$24.4 million class H at 'BBB+';

   --$24.4 million class J at 'BBB';

   --$22 million class K at 'BBB-';

   --$7.4 million class LV-1 at 'BB+';

   --$2.6 million class LV-2 at 'BB'.

   Interest-only class X-1 has paid in full.

   The Rating Watch Negative placement is due to upcoming maturity
risk associated with one loan: the SOMA Portfolio (1.9%). The
affirmations reflect generally stable performance demonstrated by the
remainder of the pool since Fitch's last rating action.

   The SOMA Portfolio loan (1.9%) is secured by four hotels located
in San Francisco, CA, with a total of 308 rooms. At issuance, the
borrower planned to reposition the portfolio by performing over $7.4
million in renovations, to be completed by 2008. An initial cash
equity contribution of approximately 33% was made. The loan is
scheduled to mature Oct. 11, 2008. Three extension options are
available; however, their exercise is subject to a minimum debt
service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.20 times (x), 1.30x, and 1.40x for
the first, second, and third options, respectively. The loan does not
currently meet the performance hurdle required for extension. If the
borrower cannot extend or refinance the loan, it would be in default
and could be transferred to the special servicer, which could result
in interest shortfalls to class L. Fitch will revisit the ratings as
additional information becomes available upon loan maturity.

   Of the 10 loans remaining in the pool, three (24.6%) are
considered Fitch loans of concern, including the SOMA Portfolio. The
largest Fitch loan of concern is Marina Village (13.4%), which
consists of 34 low- to mid-rise office properties located within a
master-planned development in Alameda, CA. Year-end 2007 reported
occupancy stood at 76%, compared to the 79.6% leased at issuance. The
borrower has thus far been unable to re-lease large blocks of space
vacated prior to issuance, and the Alameda submarket remains
challenging, with an average vacancy rate of approximately 30%. The
sponsor had invested approximately 30% cash equity in the property at
issuance, and a portion of the $23.5 million B-2 note future funding
facility remains available for leasing costs and capital expenditures.
The loan is in its first of three extension options, with an extended
maturity date of Feb. 9, 2009.

   The 1111 Marcus Avenue loan (9.3%), collateralized by a mixed-use
property in New Hyde Park, NY, is also a Fitch loan of concern.
Occupancy at the property has increased slightly, to 84.1% as of Dec.
31, 2007 from 80% at issuance. However, actual servicer-reported
expenses for 2007 were higher than anticipated at issuance, resulting
in a current Fitch stressed DSCR of 1.06x on the trust balance,
compared to 1.40x at issuance.

   All other loans within the pool are performing at or above
expectations at issuance. The RREEF Silicon Valley Office Portfolio
(16.8%) is the largest loan in the transaction. It is secured by a
portfolio of 119 office and industrial properties located throughout
four submarkets of Silicon Valley, CA. Occupancy across the portfolio
has increased slightly since issuance, to 77% as of Dec. 31, 2007 from
71.4%. The loan had a Fitch stressed DSCR of 1.46x on the trust
balance A-3 note, compared to 1.30x at issuance. The loan matures on
Nov. 9, 2008, and has three one-year extension options.

   The second largest loan is secured by 697,151 square feet (sf) of
in-line and leased fee space corresponding to the Lehigh Valley Mall
(16.3%), a regional mall located in Whitehall, PA, which at issuance
comprised 1,049,504 sf of total space. In October 2007, a lifestyle
center opened at the property, which consists of approximately 120,000
sf of additional space. The loan has experienced stable performance
since issuance. The loan is within the second of three one-year
extension options, and has an extended maturity date of Aug. 9, 2009.

   The Doubletree Metropolitan collateralizes the third largest loan.
Located in Midtown Manhattan, the property is a 755-room full-service
hotel built in 1961 and renovated in 2005. Performance has improved
since issuance, with year-end 2007 occupancy rising to 95.3% from
94.4% at issuance, and the Fitch stressed DSCR on the whole loan
increasing to 2.56x from 2.17x at issuance. The loan is within its
first of three one-year extension options, with an extended maturity
date of May 9, 2009.

   All but one (9.3%) of the loans mature by 2008. However, every
loan within the pool has one or more one-year extension options
remaining. All pooled whole loans, A notes, or senior participations
of whole loans in the trust maintain investment-grade shadow ratings.

   As of the September 2008 remittance, the pool's collateral balance
has paid down 42.8% to $858.7 million, from $1.501 billion at
issuance. Five loans have paid in full since issuance and 10 loans
remain outstanding.

   The transaction has a modified pro rata pay structure whereby 80%
of principal is paid to classes A-1 and A-2, and the remaining 20% is
paid to the other classes pro rata. The transaction switches to
sequential pay in the event of default or when the transaction has
been reduced by 80% from issuance.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - An unusual surge in Goldman Sachs' share price in the last 10 minutes of trading on Tuesday raised eyebrows on Wall Street, as it came two hours before news of Warren Buffett's big investment in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS.N) shares rose more than $5 heading into the close of trading even as the rest of the market tumbled, leaving traders suspicious that inside information was used to make a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously someone knew the Buffett news that was coming out. I noticed it yesterday and I was telling my colleagues something is going on with Goldman," said Dave Rovelli, managing director of US Equity Trading at Canaccord Adams in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission spokesman John Nester declined to comment on whether the incident is being investigated. Goldman Sachs could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before 6 p.m. EDT, Goldman Sachs said it would get a $5 billion investment from Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N), which investors welcomed as a much needed vote of confidence in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's shares have since risen about 6 percent. If someone with inside knowledge of the deal was snapping up the bank's shares they would have made a significant, and illegal, profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Someone is going to get caught, because that is easy to track, they can find out who did that," said Rovelli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' stock rose from $119.53 at 3:50 p.m. to $125.05 at the close. The SP financials sub-index meanwhile fell from 273.79 to 273.61 in the same time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That share move at Goldman was a clear outlier. It got everybody's attention.

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DC, Sep 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Consistent with its efforts to drive collaborative innovation and foster
business model transformation within the energy and utilities industry,
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today at GridWeek 2008 announced it has joined the
Electric Power Research Institute's IntelliGrid(R) program to help create
the enabling technology and methodologies for the smart power grid.

    The smart grid overlays the electricity network with communications and
computer control. When this enabling infrastructure is matched with smart
grid applications in transmission, distribution, or within a customer
portal, it is expected that the resulting smart grid will be able to
deliver significant gains in reliability, capacity, demand response, and
value-added customer services, according to EPRI.

    Research conducted through EPRI's IntelliGrid program provides member
utilities with the methodologies, tools, recommendations for standards,
and unbiased assessments of technologies when implementing new system-wide
technology solutions for advanced metering, distribution automation,
demand response, and wide-area monitoring and control.

    "The concept of a smart grid -- including how it can be built and the
benefits it would offer -- is at the heart of IBM's view on the future of
energy and we are currently helping energy and utility companies address
smart grid requirements for over 100 million consumers globally," said
Guido Bartels, general manager, IBM Energy &amp; Utilities Industry. "We look
forward to collaborating with EPRI to drive the ongoing development of the
IntelliGrid program which will enable interoperability across an energy
and utility company's products and systems."

    "The IntelliGrid research program includes over 50 members that include
utilities, manufacturers, vendors and integrators," stated Arshad Mansoor,
Vice President of Power Delivery and Utilization for EPRI. "These members
are looking to better understand how to define their applications as well
as their requirements for a smart grid infrastructure. With IBM, we have
added another valuable perspective to this program that will help us
continue to accelerate the development of standards for an interoperable
smart grid infrastructure"

    IBM's involvement with the IntelliGrid program complements the company's
ongoing activities with industry groups such as GridWise Alliance and the
Global Intelligent Network Coalition, among others.

    IBM was a founding member of GridWise, a consortium of 70 public and
private stakeholders who are aligned around a shared vision of an electric
system that integrates infrastructure, processes, devices, information and
market structure, so that energy can be generated, distributed and
consumed more reliably and cost effectively. The alliance's messages are
also taken to elected officials, public policy agencies, and the private
sector, stressing the need to build a 21st century utility infrastructure
that can serve as an enabling platform for demand management, improved
energy efficiency, and allow for the integration of electricity generated
from clean, renewable energy sources.

    The Global Intelligent Utility Network Coalition is comprised of leading
edge companies around the world that are not only implementing intelligent
networks in their own markets, but are actively promoting their use across
the world. An example of this group's commitment to the industry and
intelligent utility networks is the development of the Smart Grid Maturity
Model, a framework to guide utilities in planning their smart grid
transformations.

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DC, Sep 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Today at GridWeek 2008 IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced five new members have
joined the Global Intelligent Utility Network Coalition, a group of
utility companies working with IBM to accelerate the adoption of smart
grid technologies and business solutions throughout the world.

    New members include DONG Energy of Denmark, North Delhi Power Limited of
India, Progress Energy of the Carolinas and Florida, San Diego Gas &amp;
Electric and Southern California Gas Co. They join existing members
CenterPoint Energy of Houston, Pepco Holdings, Inc. of Washington, D.C.
and Australia's Country Energy, bringing the total number of consumers
served by coalition members to more than 50 million worldwide.

    An Intelligent Utility Network fundamentally transforms the way power is
generated, distributed and used, adding intelligence throughout the grid
to dramatically reduce outages and faults, improve responsiveness, handle
current and future demand, increase efficiency and manage costs. Consumers
can interact with the utility network in multiple, convenient ways; select
customized services and pricing options; and gain near real-time
visibility into their usage and costs. The Intelligent Utility Network
also helps consumers actively participate in solving critical energy
problems by making "smart" homes and energy-conscious choices possible.

    "With the addition of these five new members, the coalition has expanded
beyond the United States and Australia to include utilities from Europe
and India," said Guido Bartels, general manager, IBM Energy &amp; Utilities
Industry. "This not only strengthens the coalition's global scope, but
also brings new perspectives, competencies, technology and management
strategies that may work in the varied situations and market models across
the world."

    The expansion of the Global Intelligent Utility Network Coalition into an
emerging market like India is significant. By 2010, nearly 60
"mega-cities" worldwide -- most of these in emerging markets -- will have
populations of five million or more, up nearly 50 percent since 2001.
Governments, regulators and utility companies need to ensure that these
mega-cities will survive under the crush of demand for access to the power
grid.

    Building analog utility grids is not the answer in most cases. Countries
cannot afford the waste and unpredictability that characterizes energy in
so many countries. By contrast, smart grids improve energy system
performance, reduce energy loss and enhance customer service. The infusion
of digital intelligence will also enable horizontal integration of
traditional and new sources of power -- wind, plug-in hybrid electric
cars, solar, etc. -- providing end-to-end insight across all forms of
energy. In the process, it will make possible greater levels of
repeatability, reliability and security.

    "India's energy demand is growing rapidly and it is imperative to ensure a
robust distribution network by adopting the latest technologies to sustain
this," said Sunil Wadhwa, CEO and Executive Director, NDPL. "By being a
part of this global coalition, NDPL will be engaging in a strategic effort
to develop smart grid solutions to enhance the efficiency and reliability
of utility operations. We are also confident that the coalition will
contribute actively in energy conservation through technological
intervention and strategy thereby powering India's growth efforts."

    The coalition is devoted to finding ways to develop markets, identify cost
savings and operating efficiencies, and spread knowledge through lessons
learned and best practices. Accomplishments to date include the
development of the Smart Grid Maturity Model, a framework for industry use
to guide utilities in planning their smart grid transformation. IBM has
just named industry veteran Karen Caldwell as executive coordinator to
foster better collaboration among coalition members.

    "We are the first European utility to join the IUN Coalition, but all
member companies face similar challenges," said Jens Jakobsson, Vice
President, Distribution, DONG Energy. "In a world with increased focus on
CO2 emissions and with 20 percent wind energy in Denmark -- increasing in
the coming years, DONG Energy have to modernize and transform the utility
infrastructure in the best way. We want to improve energy efficiency and
reliability of supply; and make smart grid investments while ensuring low
cost. Membership in the IUN Coalition gives us the opportunity to share
experiences and collaborate with the best worldwide."

    "Progress Energy is pleased to join this broad based group of utilities
and IBM in a coordinated world-wide effort to move forward the emergence,
capabilities and full utilization of the Smart Grid," said Jeff Corbett,
Senior Vice President of Energy Delivery at Progress Energy. "Advancing
innovation and technology like this is an essential part of pursuing a
balanced solution to our energy future that includes conservation,
renewables, and state of the art plants. New business alliances such as
this that drive shared learning and collaboration are good for the
industry and will be critical to meeting the increasing complexity and
challenges facing today's energy providers."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
A new IBM (NYSE: IBM) consulting offering can help clients make their
products more eco-friendly from development and manufacturing through
delivery and use to end-of-life reclamation and recycling.

    Ranging across products as diverse as cars, tractors, televisions,
electric shavers, even food and clothing, the IBM Environmental Product
Lifecycle Management offering assists clients in analyzing every phase of
a product's existence and designing it to be environmentally friendly
from the beginning. This includes considering the materials used to make
and package it, the energy needed to produce it, transport and use it,
and designing it to be refurbished or recycled when it's no longer
useable.

    "The days of using inordinate amounts of energy, toxic chemicals and
wasteful packaging to create throwaway products that just get tossed in
the landfill are coming to an end," said Mark Wilterding, IBM's global
leader for product lifecycle management consulting. "Governments,
environmental advocacy groups, and most of all consumers are demanding
that companies do better, and designing a product from the start to be
eco-friendly throughout its lifetime is the most effective way to do
that."

    Increasing government regulations require that companies think about the
overall ecological impact of their products or face rising penalties,
while more and more customers are expressing a preference for "greener"
products. Both expect companies to plan for energy efficiency and proper
disposal of products at end of life. In addition, the rising costs of
energy and materials associated with making, packaging and selling any
product can have a significant impact on a company's bottom line.

    Companies that take a comprehensive approach to designing environmentally
friendly products can not only avoid penalties and increase efficiency
while lowering costs, but also have the opportunity to increase market
share and revenue. Oftentimes, such "green" products are extensions of a
brand or even support new product innovation.

    IBM has extensive experience with many of these design-to-disposal
capabilities within its own operations. The company created its product
stewardship program in 1991, covering design for recycling, use of
recycled plastics, product energy efficiency, and use of environmentally
friendly materials and processes. The company has offered take-back
programs for some products since 1989, and IBM processes more than 49,000
metric tons of products and product waste annually, with less than 1
percent of it going to landfills.

    IBM's Environmental PLM offering is relevant to product and service
offerings across all industries, but in particular to clients in sectors
such as automotive, heavy equipment, electronics, and consumer products
ranging from food to apparel.

    The offering provides an overall analysis of a product's lifecycle, taking
into account current environmental concerns, regulations and business
issues, and industry best practices. Based on that analysis, IBM can help
the client understand any gaps in its current practices, develop realistic
targets for reducing the environmental impact of its products and
establish a strategic plan of initiatives to meet those targets.

    From that plan, IBM can help the client build new design-for-environment
capabilities, integrating them into existing processes to improve the
environmental competitiveness of its operations and products.

    Through this offering, IBM can help clients develop the following
processes:

    -- Design for compliance -- ensuring products meet new regulatory
requirements for energy usage, material safety, etc.;

    -- Design for end-of-life management -- designing a product so that it is
easy to refurbish and reuse or disassemble and recycle;

    -- Lifecycle assessment and carbon footprint reduction -- reducing the
environmental impact of producing the product, shipping it, use by the
consumer, and reclamation and recycling, by evaluating carbon trade-offs
through the manufacturing, distribution and transportation processes;

    -- Material selection -- choosing materials that are renewable, recyclable
and non-toxic;

    -- Packaging design -- designing packaging to minimize waste and make it
lighter and easier to recycle;

    -- Project delivery acceleration -- reducing the time it takes to get
eco-friendly products from the drawing board to market.

    An IBM global survey on corporate social responsibility with more than 250
c-suite executives showed that most see CSR activities as an opportunity
to gain competitive advantage and grow revenue. Additionally IBM's
biennial global survey of more than 1,100 CEOs showed that the majority
of them plan to increase their investments in CSR by 25 percent over the
next three years.

    Environmental PLM joins a growing list of consulting offerings from IBM
designed to help clients address CSR issues throughout their operations,
including the Carbon Trade-off Modeler, the CSR Assessment and
Benchmarking offerings, and Green Sigma(TM).

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T), Japan's No. 3 bank, plans to invest in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Japanese media said, in what would be the third big Japanese investment this week on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMFG said the bank had no deal in place at the moment but media said it wanted to join the list of Japanese financial firms using the upheaval in the United States to aggressively expand abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchases, including a big stake in Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and the Asian and European assets of failed Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK, are a major turnaround for Japanese banks that were nearly crushed by bad loans just a few years ago and needed massive injections of public cash to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late on Tuesday, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) agreed to invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs, a big boost for the Wall Street bank from the world's best-known investor, but a Goldman spokesman said he could not confirm the report SMFG would follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG's investment in Goldman Sachs would total several hundred billion yen, Kyodo news agency said, while the Nikkei business daily said the bank would consider investing up to 100 billion yen ($946 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG played down the reports, which both cited unnamed sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At this point, it is not true that we've decided to invest in Goldman Sachs," said SMFG spokeswoman Chika Togawa, who declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a broader rally of financial stocks, shares of SMFG finished up 1.2 percent at 684,000 yen, compared with a 0.1 percent decline in Tokyo's broad TOPIX share average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they take a big position in Goldman, you can definitely say it would be a positive over the medium- to long-term," said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they take a big enough position so that they can benefit from Goldman's know-how and human resources, it will be positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once considered too naive and cautious for the high-risk, high-return world of investment banking, cash-rich Japanese firms have largely avoided the huge credit losses of the subprime mortgage crisis, leaving them well-placed to pick up the best assets from the carnage on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOIN THE CLUB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc 8604.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T), has agreed to buy up to 20 percent of Morgan Stanley for as much as $8.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back from a one day market holiday on Tuesday, shares of Nomura rose 5.2 percent to 1,505 yen, and Mitsubishi UFJ gained 4.2 percent to 936 yen. Tokyo's index of bank stocks .IBNKS.T rose 1.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nomura was able to buy Lehman after it filed for bankruptcy so I think investors think that Nomura got Lehman on the cheap," said Nana Otsuki, banking analyst at UBS in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It kind of seems that MUFG might have been able to get Morgan Stanley cheaper if they had waited a little," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley secured approval from the Federal Reserve to become commercial, deposit-taking banks this week, signaling the end of an era for Wall Street's free-wheeling, investment banking model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts had previously speculated that Goldman could turn to SMFG for funding, because the two companies have a history of investing in each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Goldman bought 150 billion yen in convertible preferred shares of SMFG, giving it a much-needed capital injection while in the 1980s, SMFG's predecessor bank helped bail out Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Mitsui said in June it would pay 500 million pounds ($927 million) to take a 2 percent stake in British bank Barclays Plc (BARC.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG's President, Teisuke Kitayama, later told Reuters the two banks would work together on private and commercial banking outside of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=105.73 Yen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.5393 Pound)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Nathan Layne and Taiga Uranaka; Editing by Lincoln Feast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pending legislation would expedite wait for foreign nurses
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
In recent years, the U.S. healthcare system has faced the growing
challenge of staffing hospitals and medical centers in the midst of a
nursing shortage that, at its current rate, could restrict many
facilities from providing the expected levels of care. VISANOW, the
industry leading immigration solution provider, has highlighted the
impact of pending legislation that would revamp the hiring landscape
for hospitals and other medical facilities.

   "A large pool of foreign nursing candidates and physical
therapists is available to address hospital staffing concerns," stated
Bob Meltzer, CEO of VISANOW. "However, current immigration regulations
have significantly limited hospitals' ability to hire these qualified
workers and, as a result, repercussions are being felt throughout the
healthcare system."

   Although many foreign nursing students study in the U.S. and
graduate from U.S. nursing programs, they are often unable to work
following the expiration of their Optional Practical Training (OPT)
due to limited immigration options. The majority of nursing candidates
file for permanent residency to secure a green card and the ability to
gain legal employment in the U.S. Due to a significant backlog in such
applications, however, many have to wait two to three years for
approval of their cases.

   Although H-1B visas - originally designed for applicants qualified
to fill a specialty occupation on a temporary basis - would be a
stop-gap for some, the mandated number of H-1Bs available annually has
significantly reduced this as a feasible option. A limited number of
alternative non-immigrant visas are available, but each caters to a
very specific niche demographic. For example, the TN visa is available
only for Canadian and Mexican applicants, the E-3 for Australian
applicants, and the H-1C is available only for hospitals located in
disadvantaged areas and is rarely a fit.

   With the introduction of recent legislation, however, changes to
the limiting immigration process for foreign employees of hospitals
and other medical facilities may soon be on the way. The Emergency
Nursing Supply Relief Act would remove registered nurses and physical
therapists from the current green card caps - allowing for an
additional 20,000 available applicants per year. In addition, the
legislation would require the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
Services (USCIS) to review the I-140 of the nurse petitions within 30
days of submission. Currently, that review process is averaging 8 to
12 months.

   "Obviously, this bill is a significant step in the right direction
for hospitals that struggle with staffing concerns," commented
Meltzer. "The requirement of an expedited review process by the USCIS
and the removal of these applications from the current green card caps
indicate that the severity of this challenge is understood by some in
Washington. Hopefully, this will lead to a workable solution as a
piece-by-piece approach to comprehensive immigration reform begins to
move forward."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is not just a bet on the U.S. financial system, but is also a typical play for perhaps the world's best-known investor: a big bet on a battered blue-chip name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We had a lot of cash, and we are now seeing things that give us a chance to use that cash sensibly," Buffett told CNBC television, referring to holdings at his Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) insurance and investment company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Five years from now, 10 years from now, we'll look back at this period and we'll say you could have made some extraordinary buys," he continued. "The American economy over a period of time will do very well, and people that own a piece of it will do very well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett dove into Wall Street amid a month of turmoil marked by the U.S. government's takeover of mortgage companies Fannie Mae FNM.P and Freddie Mac FRE.P and bailout of insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N), the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK, and a proposed $700 billion bailout for banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said the investment by the 78-year-old Buffett, the second-richest American according to Forbes magazine, might be the shot in the arm the financial sector needs, following hundreds of billions of dollars of write-downs and loan losses in the global credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When Buffett jumps in the pool, others may follow," said Andre Bakhos, president of Princeton Financial Group in Princeton, New Jersey. "That says to investors that all is not lost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire bought $5 billion of perpetual preferred stock with a 10 percent dividend, generating $500 million a year even if Goldman shares fall. It will also get warrants to buy $5 billion of common stock at $115 per share over the next five years. Because Goldman shares closed Tuesday at $125.05, that gave Berkshire an instant $437 million paper profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman separately sold $5 billion of common stock, twice as much as it planned. Its shares rose $2.49, or 2 percent, to $127.54 in early trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW FORAY INTO WALL STREET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it hasn't been spared, Goldman has fared better than many rivals in avoiding the toxic mortgages-related securities and other debt that have curdled balance sheets industrywide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet this week it changed its structure to become a bank holding company, after many investors questioned the Wall Street investment banking model that had endured for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move should reduce Goldman's business risk and profitability, but allow it to amass deposits and give it easier access to financing, and perhaps steer it into mergers with one or more commercial banks. Goldman shares had fallen 50 percent since last October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's chief rival, Morgan Stanley (MS.N), also converted to a bank holding company and said it would sell up to an $8.5 billion stake to Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch  Co MER.N took a different route, agreeing to sell itself to Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire already owns stakes in several large financial services companies, including big stakes in American Express Co (AXP.N) and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N). Buffett has said he added more this quarter in one of these, without saying which.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett has been whittling down Berkshire's year-end $44.33 billion cash pile. This year, he paid $4.5 billion for a majority stake in industrial firm Marmon Holdings Inc, agreed to invest $6.5 billion in Mars Inc's buyout of Wm Wrigley Jr Co WWY.N, and agreed to spend $4.7 billion on power supplier Constellation Energy Group Inc CEG.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett's most famous foray into Wall Street came in 1991, when as interim chairman at Salomon Inc -- a major Berkshire investment -- he cleaned house after a Treasury bidding scandal that cost Chairman John Gutfreund his job.

Salomon is now part of Citigroup Inc (C.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think this experience will be similar," Buffett said on Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt; * Buffett investment in Goldman helps futures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Bernanke, Paulson return to Capitol Hill on bailout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Data on existing-home sales, energy inventories on tap
 (Recasts first paragraph, updates prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks headed for a
higher open on Wednesday after Warren Buffett made a $5 billion
investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) late on Tuesday,
buoying sentiment in the beleaguered financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, Japan's No. 3 bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group (8316.T), plans to invest in Goldman Sachs, Japanese
media said, in what would be the third big Japanese investment
this week on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before the bell, shares of Goldman Sachs jumped nearly 5
percent to $130.85, while rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N) rose 4.6
percent to $29.30. JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), the No. 3 U.S. bank,
were up 2.3 percent at $41.48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A rise on Wall Street would help reverse the worst two-day
slide in six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even as the Goldman Sachs news suggested confidence,
investors worried congressional wrangling could delay or weaken
the proposed $700 billion plan to rescue the financial sector,
increasing unease about the struggling U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In another worrying sign for investors, the interbank cost
of borrowing three-month money in London jumped on Wednesday,
indicating banks are still reluctant to lend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When one of the highly respected value investors puts up
that amount of money it suggests, on the surface, that when
Buffett jumps in the pool others may follow," said Andre
Bakhos, president of Princeton Financial Group in Princeton,
New Jersey. "That says to investors that all is not lost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 rose 10 points and were above fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 climbed
74 points and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures gained 20.75 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury
Secretary Henry Paulson on Tuesday urged Congress to approve
the financial sector bailout quickly, warning that a delay
would put the economy at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But lawmakers raised objections, saying the legislation
could hand taxpayers a huge bill and still lacked detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bernanke is due to testify on the economic outlook before a
joint congressional committee at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT), and again
with Paulson before a House panel on the bailout legislation at
2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A report on August existing home sales is due at 10 a.m.
(1430 GMT), while weekly energy inventories data is scheduled
for release at 10:35 a.m. (1435 GMT).

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T), Japan's No. 3 bank, plans to invest in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Japanese media said, in what would be the third big Japanese investment this week on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMFG said the bank had no deal in place at the moment but media said it wanted to join the list of Japanese financial firms using the upheaval in the United States to aggressively expand abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchases, including a big stake in Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and the Asian and European assets of failed Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK, are a major turnaround for Japanese banks that were nearly crushed by bad loans just a few years ago and needed massive injections of public cash to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late on Tuesday, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) agreed to invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs, a big boost for the Wall Street bank from the world's best-known investor, but a Goldman spokesman said he could not confirm the report SMFG would follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG's investment in Goldman Sachs would total several hundred billion yen, Kyodo news agency said, while the Nikkei business daily said the bank would consider investing up to 100 billion yen ($946 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG played down the reports, which both cited unnamed sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At this point, it is not true that we've decided to invest in Goldman Sachs," said SMFG spokeswoman Chika Togawa, who declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a broader rally of financial stocks, shares of SMFG finished up 1.2 percent at 684,000 yen, compared with a 0.1 percent decline in Tokyo's broad TOPIX share average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they take a big position in Goldman, you can definitely say it would be a positive over the medium- to long-term," said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they take a big enough position so that they can benefit from Goldman's know-how and human resources, it will be positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once considered too naive and cautious for the high-risk, high-return world of investment banking, cash-rich Japanese firms have largely avoided the huge credit losses of the subprime mortgage crisis, leaving them well-placed to pick up the best assets from the carnage on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOIN THE CLUB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc 8604.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T), has agreed to buy up to 20 percent of Morgan Stanley for as much as $8.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back from a one day market holiday on Tuesday, shares of Nomura rose 5.2 percent to 1,505 yen, and Mitsubishi UFJ gained 4.2 percent to 936 yen. Tokyo's index of bank stocks .IBNKS.T rose 1.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nomura was able to buy Lehman after it filed for bankruptcy so I think investors think that Nomura got Lehman on the cheap," said Nana Otsuki, banking analyst at UBS in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It kind of seems that MUFG might have been able to get Morgan Stanley cheaper if they had waited a little," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley secured approval from the Federal Reserve to become commercial, deposit-taking banks this week, signaling the end of an era for Wall Street's free-wheeling, investment banking model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts had previously speculated that Goldman could turn to SMFG for funding, because the two companies have a history of investing in each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Goldman bought 150 billion yen in convertible preferred shares of SMFG, giving it a much-needed capital injection while in the 1980s, SMFG's predecessor bank helped bail out Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Mitsui said in June it would pay 500 million pounds ($927 million) to take a 2 percent stake in British bank Barclays Plc (BARC.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG's President, Teisuke Kitayama, later told Reuters the two banks would work together on private and commercial banking outside of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=105.73 Yen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.5393 Pound)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Nathan Layne and Taiga Uranaka; Editing by Lincoln Feast)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Recasts, changes byline, adds quotes, updates prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Veronica Brown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - The yen fell broadly on
Wednesday as investors eased back from risk aversion, taking
some comfort from news that Goldman Sachs would get fresh
funding and the establishment of new Fed currency swap lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But while the dollar found respite against the yen, nagging
worry about U.S. financial sector health hampered its broader
progress with uncertainty spreading over the U.S. government's
proposed $700 billion package to mop up toxic mortgage debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After getting caught in the eye of a financial storm that
worsened last week when investment bank Lehman Brothers
collapsed, investors took some reassurance from news that Warren
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N)(BRKb.N) said it would
invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is also working out a deal to get several billion
dollars from Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T), Kyodo
news agency reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Federal Reserve also set up currency swap lines
with more central banks, aiming to boost short-term U.S. dollar
liquidity and help drive down interbank lending rates.
[ID:nLO656400]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Both the developments in the investment banking sector and
the temporary arrangement the Fed has made with some more
international central banks is reflected in the yen's pricing,"
SG currency strategist Phyllis Papadavid said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But it's still a very uncertain environment and the risk
backdrop is very difficult, despite policymakers efforts.
There's a lot of uncertainty around what everyone is focused on,
which is the U.S. policy package," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Euro's gains against the dollar were stemmed by data showing
a bigger-than-expected drop in German corporate sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Munich-based Ifo economic research institute said its
business climate index fell to 92.9 in September from 94.8 in
August. It was the lowest reading since May 2005 and below
market expectations of 94.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 1120 GMT, the dollar was down 0.1 percent against a
basket of major currencies .DXY, while the euro rose 0.2
percent on the day to $1.4682 EUR=.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dollar was up 0.5 percent at 106.05 yen JPY= after
hitting a session high of 106.34 yen. The euro gained 0.7
percent to 155.64 yen EURJPY=.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a bid to help dollar-starved banks raise funds, the Fed
said it would establish temporary currency swap lines with
central banks of Australia, Denmark, Sweden and Norway worth a
total of $30 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But bank-to-bank lending markets are still under stress. The
interbank cost of borrowing overnight and three-month sterling
jumped on Wednesday, the three-month cost of borrowing dollars
and euro also rose, according to the British Bankers
Association's latest daily fixing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CERTAINLY MORE UNCERTAINTY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dollar, which had seen a stunning run higher before the
latest bout of turbulence, has been on the back foot since last
week's demise of Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK and the $85 billion
rescue of American International Group Inc (AIG.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, if suffered its biggest one day fall versus the
euro since the single currency's inception in January 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dollar sentiment looked set to stay uncertain as doubts grew
about the effectiveness of the U.S. government's proposed $700
billion bailout plan to tackle the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Treasury plan will remain the focus of the market, and
an early approval will likely remain critical to stabilisation
in market sentiment," UBS strategists said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders will keep a close eye on comments by Fed chairman
Ben Bernanke who is due to continue congressional testimony on
Wednesday on the U.S. government's plan to buy up toxic assets
from banks' balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also slated for release on Wednesday are figures on the U.S.
housing sector, which triggered the global credit crisis and is
seen as key to any economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; August U.S. sales of existing homes are forecast to have
declined to a 4.93 million annualised rate in August, down from
5 million, according to a Reuters poll ECON.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Tamawa Kodoya&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket
of currencies on Wednesday, nagged by uncertainty surrounding
the U.S. government's proposals to mop up toxic mortgage debt
and soothe global market jitters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However the U.S. currency was well-bid against the yen as
investors took some reassurance from news that Goldman Sachs
would get fresh funding and as the U.S. Federal Reserve set up
currency swap lines with more central banks. [ID:nSP163976]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The low-yielding Japanese unit was sold across the board as
traders tentatively moved away from the extremes of risk
aversion stirred up by the storm that hit the U.S. banking
sector last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are seeing people reduce the risk aversion play in the
short term so it is relatively negative for the yen," said Lee
Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubish-UFJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The euro was also briefly hit by knee-jerk selling after
data showed a bigger-than-expected drop in German corporate
sentiment, although the common currency recovered, helped by 
some in the market who had expected an even weaker reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People will likely stick in relatively tight ranges on
uncertainty over the (U.S.) bailout plan," said Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi-UFJ's Hardman. "The only thing that is certain
right now is uncertainty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Munich-based Ifo economic research institute said its

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SENTIMENT STILL BEARISH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dollar sentiment remained bearish on uncertainty about the
effectiveness of the U.S. government's proposed $700 billion
bailout plan to tackle the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Treasury plan will remain the focus of the market, and

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)

 Sept 24 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded Chubb
Corp (CB.N) to "underweight" from "neutral," saying the company
is over-earning in several product areas and two of its
franchises were likely to see increased competition, which
could mitigate growth.

 The brokerage also lowered its third-quarter earnings
estimate for 15 underwriters, including Chubb, saying
hurricanes Fay, Gustav and Ike were likely to pressure
earnings.

 JP Morgan estimated that third-quarter catastrophe losses
could exceed $17.2 billion, with personal, commercial and
reinsurance responsible for 41 percent, 29 percent and 27
percent, respectively, of total losses.

 Given that these losses are an earnings event, not a
capital event, we are skeptical that losses will drive any rate
improvements in property lines, the brokerage said.

&lt;p&gt;Grameen Health and Pfizer Announce Novel Partnership to Explore Sustainable Healthcare Delivery Models for the Developing World

 Partnership Supports Business Models To Help Address Health Needs Of 4 Billion
     People Around the World Who Live on Annual Incomes of Less Than $3,000
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc and Grameen Health, an affiliate of Grameen Bank, the pioneering
micro-financing organization in Bangladesh that shared the Nobel Peace Prize in
2006 for its work to alleviate poverty, today announced that they will work
together to identify sustainable models for healthcare delivery in the
developing world.

The partners will jointly evaluate ways to improve Grameen Health's existing
healthcare delivery systems and primary care clinics in rural Bangladesh. At the
end of one year, they will identify appropriate business models that ultimately
can be replicated in other countries, addressing the needs of the 4 billion
people around the world whose annual income is less than $3,000. As part of its
commitment to the collaboration, Pfizer is dedicating key employees to provide
technical and advisory support.

"As we address the challenges of global health access, we are pleased to partner
with Pfizer who shares our belief that solutions to improving access to
medicines and healthcare can be socially responsible and sustainable, yet
commercially viable," said Professor Muhammad Yunus, who shared the 2006 Nobel
Peace Prize with Grameen Bank, which he founded and now directs.

"We believe Grameen's demonstrated success in providing innovative financial
solutions for the poor, coupled with Pfizer's healthcare experience, human
capital, and extensive portfolio of medicines, have the potential to improve the
lives of millions of patients," said Jean-Michel Halfon, area president of
Canada, Latin America, Africa, and Middle East Pharmaceutical Operations, Pfizer
Inc. "This partnership is the first of many initiatives in support of Pfizer's
broader Global Access strategy, which aims to develop non-conventional,
efficient, and sustainable health financing and delivery models."

During the next year, the partnership will focus on the following areas:

    --  Analyzing ways to expand and improve the current low-cost micro-health
        delivery and insurance programs at Grameen Health's 38 existing Kalyan
        clinics.

    --  Reviewing operating efficiencies and scope of services (e.g.,
        telemedicine, mobile healthcare) at Grameen Health's Kalyan clinics.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), among the biggest obstacles to
improved health outcomes are inadequate health delivery and financing mechanisms
that place the heaviest burden on the poor and sick, who are the least able to
pay.

In addition to its partnership with Pfizer, Grameen is partnering with GE
Healthcare to test the delivery of ultrasound capability in rural clinics for
early detection of abnormalities. Grameen also is partnering with the Mayo
Clinic to improve the training, efficiency, and retention of staff at existing
Grameen Health Kalyan clinics.

"We recognize that improving worldwide access to healthcare is a significant
long-term project, and look forward to working with various organizations and
thought leaders in support of this global effort," added Jean-Michel Halfon.

Grameen Health (GH) aims to extend the success of the micro-finance model to
healthcare by designing and developing a bottom-up health care infrastructure
built from sustainable best practices in a broad range of healthcare services
around the world, and improving upon them to deliver the highest quality
healthcare in an efficient and sustainable manner for a broad market, including
the poorest of the poor. GH will enable the poor to be self sufficient in
addressing their healthcare needs such that they can accept, but not require,
outside assistance.

&lt;p&gt;Grameen Health to Establish Independent Collaborations with Pfizer, GE Healthcare, and Mayo Clinic to Create Sustainable Healthcare Delivery Models for the Developing World

  Partnerships Will Support Development of Business Models That Meet
   the Health Needs of 4 Billion People Around the World Who Live on
                  Annual Incomes of Less Than $3,000
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Grameen Health, an affiliate of Grameen Bank, the pioneering
micro-financing organization in Bangladesh that shared the Nobel Peace
Prize in 2006 for its work to alleviate poverty, announced today that
it will establish independent partnerships with Pfizer Inc., GE
Healthcare, and Mayo Clinic to create sustainable models for
healthcare delivery in the developing world.

   Grameen Health has chosen to work independently with these
partners because of their respective expertise: Pfizer Inc is the
world's largest research-based pharmaceutical company, GE Healthcare
is the world's largest manufacturer of medical devices such as
ultrasound and CT/MRI, and Mayo Clinic is the world's first and
largest integrated, not-for-profit group practice.

   These multiple, independent collaborations will focus on social
business models in which the businesses are self-supporting and any
profits are re-invested into the system in order to reach more of the
poor. This approach is cost-effective and maximizes the benefits that
patients receive. The models will be transferable to other healthcare
delivery systems.

   According to the World Health Organization (WHO), among the
biggest obstacles to improved health outcomes are inadequate health
delivery and financing mechanisms that place the heaviest burden on
the poor and sick, who are the least able to pay.

   The independent collaborations will initially explore and evaluate
ways to improve the existing Grameen Health delivery and financing
systems in Bangladesh, with the aim of creating models that can be
adapted for the needs of the 4 billion people around the world whose
annual income is less than $3,000.

   "As we address the challenges of global health access, we are
pleased to partner with these and other organizations that share our
belief that solutions to improving access to medicines and healthcare
can be socially responsible and sustainable, yet commercially viable,"
said Professor Muhammad Yunus, who shared the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize
with Grameen Bank, which he founded and now directs. "In Bangladesh,
we have found that only an economically viable solution can create the
infrastructure needed to enable people to sustain themselves,
alleviating the poverty cycle. We believe our knowledge and expertise
in micro-financing can be applied toward the development of a
sustainable health care system."

   During the next year, the collaborations will focus on the
following areas:

   --  Implementing primary health promotion and disease prevention
        programs. These are the most cost-effective steps in
        affordable health care, and include maternal and child health
        promotion and nutrition programs.

   --  Analyzing ways to expand and improve the current low-cost
        micro-health delivery and insurance programs at Grameen
        Health's 38 existing Kalyan clinics.

   --  Developing continuous training programs for nurses,
        technicians and physicians.

   --  Reviewing operating efficiencies and scope of services (e.g.,
        telemedicine, mobile health care) at Grameen Health's Kalyan
        clinics.

   --  Introducing genomic, epidemiological, and outcomes research
        capability for the prevention and treatment of diseases
        relevant to the population in Bangladesh, with an emphasis on
        the best use of existing tested and approved procedures and
        drugs.

   Grameen Health and its partners hope to develop appropriate and
sustainable models for healthcare delivery and rural primary care
clinics, with the goal of replicating these models in other countries.
Pfizer is dedicating key employees to provide technical and advisory
support to evaluate Grameen's existing healthcare delivery systems in
Bangladesh. GE Healthcare will test delivery of ultrasound capability
in rural clinics for early detection of abnormalities, and Mayo Clinic
will work to improve the training, efficiency, and retention of staff
at existing Grameen Health Kalyan clinics.

   "Pfizer is honored to work with Grameen to explore the development
of nonconventional, efficient and sustainable health financing and
delivery models. We believe Grameen's world-renowned success in
providing innovative financial solutions for the poor, coupled with
Pfizer's health care experience, human capital and extensive arsenal
of medicines, has the potential to improve the lives of millions of
patients," said Jean-Michel Halfon, Area President of Canada, Latin
America, Africa, and Middle East pharmaceutical operations, Pfizer
Inc.

   "GE Healthcare is committed to early health initiatives," said
Omar Ishrak, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clinical Systems,
GE Healthcare. "We have affordable technology with advanced imaging
and care capabilities that can make a difference to save lives. With
the ubiquitous usage of ultrasound, GE believes it's provided a
crucial tool in the early care of expectant mothers. We intend to work
with Grameen Health to further understand and expand ultrasound usage
in rural areas. Through this pilot program we plan to train providers
in the usage of ultrasound, evaluate the product, the training and the
workflow that would be needed to enable the full deployment of this
technology. This is one positive step towards accessible and
sustainable healthcare for the developing world."

   "Mayo Clinic and Grameen are exploring opportunities where our
organizations can work collaboratively based on the junction of our
missions and strategic priorities," said Denis Cortese, M.D.,
president &amp; CEO, Mayo Clinic. "These opportunities range from new
methods of delivering care and dissemination of knowledge and best
practices to education, clinical research and the use of new
technology in non-traditional settings. Our two organizations are
working diligently to find the opportunities that will have the best
likelihood of improving health care delivery in developing countries."

   Professor Yunus adds: "Improving health care access and quality
worldwide is a huge and long-term project. We would like to invite
other partners and thought leaders to join in on the collaboration
with Grameen Health, or to create their own social health care
business models and share the results with us."

   Grameen Health (GH) aims to extend the success of the microfinance
model to health care by designing and developing a bottom-up health
care infrastructure built from sustainable best practices in a broad
range of health care services around the world, and improving upon

   GH will be a nation-wide healthcare service for all people, but
particularly focused on the poor women and children. Just as Grameen
Bank brought financial services at an affordable price to poor women,
GH will aim to bring state-of-the-art health services to all people --

with Massachusetts General Hospital, John Hopkins Hospital of the USA,
Narayana Hrudayalaya of India, Johnson and Johnson, Bayer, BASF, Aga
Khan University, and others.

   This initiative will lead to the creation of a world class medical
college and hospital, specialized hospitals, research centers in a 200
acre Health City, a series of nursing colleges, training programs for
technicians, second tier hospitals, and rural health management
centers throughout the country. Each rural health management center
will be dedicated to improving and maintaining the health status of
the people in its region, particularly focused on the poor women and
children. These centers will be IT-linked with the Health City in
Dhaka for continuous attention by specialist doctors and nurses.
Through the nursing colleges, GH will train Bangladeshis --
particularly the newly educated class of Grameen borrowers' daughters
-- to choose nursing as a profession and to serve in Bangladesh and
abroad.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T),
Japan's No. 3 bank, plans to invest in Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N), Japanese media said, in what would be the third big
Japanese investment this week on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; SMFG said the bank had no deal in place at the moment but
media said it wanted to join the list of Japanese financial
firms using the upheaval in the United States to aggressively
expand abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The purchases, including a big stake in Morgan Stanley
(MS.N) and the Asian and European assets of failed Lehman
Brothers LEHMQ.PK, are a major turnaround for Japanese banks
that were nearly crushed by bad loans just a few years ago and
needed massive injections of public cash to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late on Tuesday, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc
(BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) agreed to invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs,
a big boost for the Wall Street bank from the world's
best-known investor, but a Goldman spokesman said he could not
confirm the report SMFG would follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SMFG's investment in Goldman Sachs would total several
hundred billion yen, Kyodo news agency said, while the Nikkei
business daily said the bank would consider investing up to 100
billion yen ($946 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SMFG played down the reports, which both cited unnamed
sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At this point, it is not true that we've decided to invest
in Goldman Sachs," said SMFG spokeswoman Chika Togawa, who
declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a broader rally of financial stocks, shares of SMFG
finished up 1.2 percent at 684,000 yen, compared with a 0.1
percent decline in Tokyo's broad TOPIX share average .TOPX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If they take a big position in Goldman, you can definitely
say it would be a positive over the medium- to long-term," said
Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If they take a big enough position so that they can
benefit from Goldman's know-how and human resources, it will be
positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once considered too naive and cautious for the high-risk,
high-return world of investment banking, cash-rich Japanese
firms have largely avoided the huge credit losses of the
subprime mortgage crisis, leaving them well-placed to pick up
the best assets from the carnage on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JOIN THE CLUB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nomura Holdings Inc (8604.T), Japan's top brokerage, has
agreed to buy the Asian, European and Middle East operations of
failed U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers [nLN452124].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc
(8306.T), has agreed to buy up to 20 percent of Morgan Stanley
for as much as $8.5 billion. [nT130486].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Back from a one day market holiday on Tuesday, shares of
Nomura rose 5.2 percent to 1,505 yen, and Mitsubishi UFJ gained
4.2 percent to 936 yen. Tokyo's index of bank stocks .IBNKS.T
rose 1.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Nomura was able to buy Lehman after it filed for
bankruptcy so I think investors think that Nomura got Lehman on
the cheap," said Nana Otsuki, banking analyst at UBS in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It kind of seems that MUFG might have been able to get
Morgan Stanley cheaper if they had waited a little," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley secured approval from the
Federal Reserve to become commercial, deposit-taking banks this
week, signalling the end of an era for Wall Street's
free-wheeling, investment banking model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts had previously speculated that Goldman could
turn to SMFG for funding, because the two companies have a
history of investing in each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2003, Goldman bought 150 billion yen in convertible
preferred shares of SMFG, giving it a much-needed capital
injection while in the 1980s, SMFG's predecessor bank helped
bail out Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sumitomo Mitsui said in June it would pay 500 million
pounds ($927 million) to take a 2 percent stake in British bank
Barclays Plc (BARC.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SMFG's President, Teisuke Kitayama, later told Reuters the
two banks would work together on private and commercial banking
outside of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=105.73 Yen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=.5393 Pound)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Nathan Layne and Taiga Uranaka;

on a Wall Street revival by buying a $5 billion stake in
Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and a Japanese bank looked ready to follow
but markets were on edge as U.S. lawmakers clashed over a
financial sector rescue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Architects of the proposed $700 billion bailout for
financial firms faced a second day of grilling by U.S.
lawmakers on Wednesday as the debate threatening to postpone a
decision until next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the buyout package that has been proposed by
the Treasury and the Federal Reserve will be passed," said
Andrew Barrett, managing director and strategist with Citi
Private Client Investment in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Markets will need to see this happen or we will have
another leg down in the major global indices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asian and European stock markets rose fractionally on
Wednesday amid uncertainty about the bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The MSCI index of Asian shares outside Japan
.MIAPJ0000PUS edged up 0.16 percent, and Tokyo .N225 rose
0.2 percent and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of top companies
was up 0.36 percent at 1007 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. stock futures SPc1 were up just over 1 percent,
pointing to a stronger start on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Buffett's legendary status as a value investor gives the
bulls reason for optimism," said Chris Hossain, senior sales
manager at ODL Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FBI REPORT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. lawmakers set to discuss the size and content of the
bailout on Wednesday will consider a CNN report that the FBI
was investigating potential mortgage fraud involving firms and
senior executives at the heart of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CNN said the FBI was trying to determine whether anyone in
those financial institutions had any responsibility for
providing "misinformation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said these included mortgage giants Fannie Mae FNM.N
and Freddie Mac FRE.N, investment bank Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK and insurer American International
Group Inc (AIG.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) will buy up
to 9 percent of Goldman, which also announced plans to sell
$2.5 billion in common stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berkshire will buy $5 billion of Goldman perpetual
preferred stock which carries a 10 percent dividend. It also
will receive warrants to buy $5 billion of common stock, or
43.5 million shares, at $115 per share, within five years,
which could give the United States' second richest man and his
investment vehicle roughly 9 percent of Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japan's third-largest bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
(8316.T), also plans to invest in Goldman, Japanese media
reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japanese financial firms this week have already bought
Lehman Brothers assets and a stake in Morgan Stanley as they
take advantage of global upheaval to expand abroad. [nLN452124]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sumitomo has had a long relationship with Goldman but
spokeswoman Chika Togawa said: "At this point it is not true
that we've decided to invest in Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokesman said he could not confirm the Japanese
media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While billions of dollars have poured in to buy up
operations and stakes on Wall Street this week, political
debate rages over the extent to which the U.S. government
should help financial firms stranded with toxic assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the Senate Banking Committee's
top Republican, said the plan was aimed at rescuing the same
institutions that created the crisis with "sloppy underwriting
and reckless disregard for the risks they were creating,
taking, or passing on to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What troubles me most is that we have been given no
credible assurances that this plan will work. We could very
well spend $700 billion and not resolve the crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke face a second day of questioning from
lawmakers a day after Paulson told them during five hours of
hearings that the bailout, while "sad" and "embarrassing," was
needed to stave off a deep recession and restore confidence in
markets. [nN23313135]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The financial crisis has become the No. 1 issue leading up
to the Nov. 4 U.S. presidential election, and many lawmakers
seeking re-election to Congress want to appear vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Washington Post-ABC News poll showed that Democrat Barack
Obama has opened a 9-point lead over Republican John McCain in
the U.S. presidential race amid turmoil in the financial system
and growing pessimism about the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; $2,300 EACH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bailout, potentially the United States' biggest ever,
could cost every American man, woman and child $2,300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At $700 billion it would eclipse the roughly $550 billion
which the United States has spent on the Iraq war since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paulson and Bernanke said the plan might cost less once the
government is able to resell mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've still got plenty of uncertainty ahead of U.S.
Congress approving the rescue package," said Sarah-Jane Wagg,
president director of UBS Securities Indonesia in Jakarta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street's woes are having far-reaching impact, with
investor nerves frayed by two weeks of unprecedented markets
turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Federal Reserve was forced to inject another $2
billion to help mutual funds which were scrambling to raise
cash to meet heavy withdrawals by rattled customers
[nNYG001311] and there was a run on a Hong Kong bank.

&lt;p&gt;Grameen Health and Pfizer Announce Novel Partnership to Explore Sustainable Healthcare Delivery Models for the Developing World

   Partnership Supports Business Models To Help Address Health Needs
  Of 4 Billion People Around the World Who Live on Annual Incomes of
                           Less Than $3,000
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc and Grameen Health, an affiliate of Grameen Bank, the
pioneering micro-financing organization in Bangladesh that shared the
Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for its work to alleviate poverty, today
announced that they will work together to identify sustainable models
for healthcare delivery in the developing world.

   The partners will jointly evaluate ways to improve Grameen
Health's existing healthcare delivery systems and primary care clinics
in rural Bangladesh. At the end of one year, they will identify
appropriate business models that ultimately can be replicated in other
countries, addressing the needs of the 4 billion people around the
world whose annual income is less than $3,000. As part of its
commitment to the collaboration, Pfizer is dedicating key employees to
provide technical and advisory support.

   "As we address the challenges of global health access, we are
pleased to partner with Pfizer who shares our belief that solutions to
improving access to medicines and healthcare can be socially
responsible and sustainable, yet commercially viable," said Professor
Muhammad Yunus, who shared the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize with Grameen
Bank, which he founded and now directs.

   "We believe Grameen's demonstrated success in providing innovative
financial solutions for the poor, coupled with Pfizer's healthcare
experience, human capital, and extensive portfolio of medicines, have
the potential to improve the lives of millions of patients," said
Jean-Michel Halfon, area president of Canada, Latin America, Africa,
and Middle East Pharmaceutical Operations, Pfizer Inc. "This
partnership is the first of many initiatives in support of Pfizer's
broader Global Access strategy, which aims to develop
non-conventional, efficient, and sustainable health financing and
delivery models."

   During the next year, the partnership will focus on the following
areas:

   --  Analyzing ways to expand and improve the current low-cost
        micro-health delivery and insurance programs at Grameen
        Health's 38 existing Kalyan clinics.

   --  Reviewing operating efficiencies and scope of services (e.g.,
        telemedicine, mobile healthcare) at Grameen Health's Kalyan
        clinics.

   According to the World Health Organization (WHO), among the
biggest obstacles to improved health outcomes are inadequate health
delivery and financing mechanisms that place the heaviest burden on
the poor and sick, who are the least able to pay.

   In addition to its partnership with Pfizer, Grameen is partnering
with GE Healthcare to test the delivery of ultrasound capability in
rural clinics for early detection of abnormalities. Grameen also is
partnering with the Mayo Clinic to improve the training, efficiency,
and retention of staff at existing Grameen Health Kalyan clinics.

   "We recognize that improving worldwide access to healthcare is a
significant long-term project, and look forward to working with
various organizations and thought leaders in support of this global
effort," added Jean-Michel Halfon.

   About Grameen Health

   Grameen Health (GH) aims to extend the success of the
micro-finance model to healthcare by designing and developing a
bottom-up health care infrastructure built from sustainable best
practices in a broad range of healthcare services around the world,
and improving upon them to deliver the highest quality healthcare in
an efficient and sustainable manner for a broad market, including the
poorest of the poor. GH will enable the poor to be self sufficient in
addressing their healthcare needs such that they can accept, but not
require, outside assistance.

   About Pfizer Inc

   Pfizer is the world's largest research-based biomedical and
pharmaceutical company, with 85,000 colleagues operating in more than
150 countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
nearly one-third of the molecules on its "Essential Medicines List"
are Pfizer medicines.

&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter Helps AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Secure $135 Million Through Historic Bond Allocation for $400 Million East Bay Transit-Oriented Development

   San Francisco Goodwin Procter Attorney, Tuan A. Pham Leads Effort
  to Secure Necessary Funding For Complex Public/Private Development
               Adjacent to BART's Pleasant Hill Station
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Goodwin Procter LLP, one of the nation's leading law firms, today
announced the successful culmination of its efforts in helping
AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB: NYSE) acquire funding through a
State of California bond allocation considered to be one of the
largest of its kind in California history. As developer's counsel,
Goodwin Procter represented AVB in connection with the issuance of $10
million in tax-exempt multifamily housing revenue bonds and the
remarketing of $116 million in tax-exempt and $9 million in taxable
multifamily housing revenue bonds. The law firm helped AVB secure a
letter of credit from Bank of America, N.A. in the amount of $135
million to provide credit enhancement and liquidity support for the
bonds in addition to aiding in the structuring of the joint venture
development partnership between AVB and Millennium Partners.

   This transaction represents AVB's largest bond financing ever
closed. Proceeds from the sale of the Bonds will be loaned to AVB to
finance construction of a multifamily residential project known as
Avalon Walnut Creek at Contra Costa Centre in Contra Costa,
California. The Project is a residential component of a larger $400
million mixed-use development known as the Contra Costa Centre Transit
Village. It is located adjacent to the Pleasant Hill Bay Area Rapid
Transit station.

   The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the County of Contra Costa, and
its Redevelopment Agency felt strongly about developing the Avalon
Walnut Creek transit village. Contra Costa County first filed an
application with the State to issue bonds. The bonds were then sold on
the open market with the proceeds being loaned to AVB to begin
construction of the development.

   The Avalon Walnut Creek at Contra Costa Centre Project includes
422 residential apartments, of which 20 percent will be offered to
"very low income tenants" - tenants making no greater than 50 percent
of the area median income. The development is also expected to consist
of a 3,367-space multi-story parking garage for BART users,
approximately 35,000 square feet of retail space, 270,000 square feet
of commercial office space, 100 condominium units, 19,400 square feet
dedicated to conference facilities, and an additional 648-space
parking garage. AVB anticipates completion of the project in 2010.

   "The transit village will show the rest of California that
providing adequate public infrastructure and services that keep pace
with growth is the best way to increase density within transit rich
locations. By creating a public/private partnership and engaging the
local community, Contra Costa Centre and the BART Transit Village are
providing over 2,800 residential units and employment for 6,500
people; and the Pleasant Hill BART station is serving 6,500 BART
customers daily," said Contra Costa County Supervisor, Susan Bonilla.

   Led by partner Tuan A. Pham, the Goodwin Procter legal team
representing AVB was comprised of partners and associates from the
firm's national Real Estate Practice Group, including Phillip H.
Ebling, Christopher R. Maratas, and Lilly E. Shilton. "We thoroughly
enjoyed counseling AVB as it secured Bank of America as the credit
enhancer and went to the bond market at advantageous tax-exempt
interest rates," said Pham. "Our efforts were particularly gratifying
since this was one of the largest multifamily housing bond allocations
ever received by a private sector developer from the State of
California, and the largest bond deal that AVB has ever completed."
Typically, CDLAC, the State's bond allocation committee, will cap its
allocations at $30 million per development.

   "Our Public/Private Development Team is extremely proud to have
represented AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Our national real estate
resources contributed greatly to this project and our network of
highly skilled real estate attorneys played an important role in
making this project a reality," said Lewis G. Feldman, the Team's
leader.

   In recent years, Goodwin Procter has structured and executed
public/private development financing in excess of $20 billion, has
counseled clients on REIT and REIT M deals totaling more than $70
billion, has counseled clients on real estate investment transactions
valued at more than $20 billion and has provided advice on the
formation of real estate and related funds with private equity capital
in excess of $20 billion.

&lt;p&gt; * Buffett investment in Goldman helps futures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Bernanke, Paulson return to Capitol Hill on bailout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Data on existing-home sales, energy inventories on tap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose
on Wednesday after Warren Buffett made a $5 billion investment
in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) late on Tuesday, buoying
sentiment in the beleaguered financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, Japan's No. 3 bank plans to invest in Goldman
Sachs, Japanese media said, in what would be the third big
Japanese investment this week on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman Sachs jumped more than 7 percent to $134
before the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even as the Goldman Sachs news suggested confidence,
investors worried congressional wrangling could delay or weaken
the proposed $700 billion plan to rescue the financial sector,
increasing unease about the struggling U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In another worrying sign for investors, the interbank cost
of borrowing three-month money in London jumped on Wednesday,
indicating that lending between banks remains strained because
of a lack of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When one of the highly respected value investors puts up
that amount of money it suggests, on the surface, that when
Buffett jumps in the pool others may follow," said Andre
Bakhos, president of Princeton Financial Group in Princeton,
New Jersey. "That says to investors that all is not lost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 rose 6.50 and were above fair value,
a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 climbed
42 points and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures climbed 5 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary
Henry Paulson on Tuesday urged Congress to approve the
financial sector bailout quickly, warning that a delay would
put the economy at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But lawmakers raised objections, saying the legislation
would hand taxpayers a huge bill and still lacked detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bernanke is due to testify on the economic outlook before
the congressional Joint Economic Committee starting at 10 a.m.
(1400 GMT), and Bernanke and Paulson will appear before the
House Financial Services Committee on the bailout legislation
at 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the economic front, a report on August existing home
sales is due at 10 a.m. (1430 GMT), while weekly energy
inventories data is scheduled for release at 10:35 a.m. (1435
GMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday on fear that congressional
wrangling could delay the proposed $700 billion plan to mop up
bad mortgage debts from banks' balance sheets.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Sep 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Titus Labs, a leading provider of email and document classification
software, today announced the release of Titus Labs Message
Classification (TMC) Web Access 2.0. The industry's most advanced
classification solution for Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) now
enables organizations to enforce email labelling policies, protect
against data leakage, and make users accountable for proper information
handling when using OWA.

    An increasing number of organizations enable employees to access email
from remote locations through standard Web browsers. Providing mobile
access to email makes organizations more vulnerable to data leakage as
security and classification policies are rarely enforced outside the
perimeter of the organization. For any organization, including
government, military and large enterprises, Message Classification Web
Access 2.0 provides advanced capabilities for IT administrators to
control exactly what emails and documents may be viewed over Web mail.

    "As a defence organization, a great number of our emails are sensitive in
nature, and many of our users are in the field, which makes Web mail an
important tool," said Chief of Command, Danish Defence. "The ability to
control what is viewed outside the firewall and ensuring our
classification scheme is applied regardless of a user's physical location
enables us to mitigate the risk of inappropriate behaviour. Titus Labs'
solution was easy to deploy across our network and no user training was
required."

    Product Enhancements in TMC OWA 2.0:

    - Calendar and Task Support: Users can now classify meeting requests and
tasks. IT administrators can force users to select a classification or
they can provide a default classification value.

    - Warning Dialog: The software can display a warning when a particular
classification is selected. For example, an organization may wish to
display a warning when a user selects a classification of RELEASABLE TO
INTERNET. The warning dialog text is completely customizable.

    - OWA Prevent: The OWA Prevent feature is an optional setting that
prevents users from viewing confidential messages or emails with
attachments when using OWA.

    - Customizable Help: This "Help" button can link to an HTML page
describing the organization's classification policies.

    - Advanced Message Body Labelling: Organizations can now build custom
body labels that include variables such as the classification and the
date; for example, the body label could read: "This message has been
classified as INTERNAL USE ONLY by XYZ Corp. on 20 Jun 09".

    "Ensuring messages are handled appropriately outside of the
organization's firewall continues to be a major challenge because
organizations rarely have control over how users access or handle
information via a standard Web browser," said Charlie Pulfer, VP Product
Development, Titus Labs. "The compliance and security issues associated
with inappropriate use of information or data leakage mean that
organizations must take appropriate steps to ensure the security of email
accessed via Web browsers. With Titus Labs Message Classification Web
Access, organizations can have confidence that they are extending
existing email security policies to all communications regardless of the
user's physical location."

    Pricing and Availability

    Titus Message Classification is currently available, with pricing
including server fee $5995 USD + Client License $11 USD/user with volume
discounts. The offering is available through Titus Labs and its
authorized reseller partners.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T), Japan's No. 3 bank, plans to invest in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Japanese media said, in what would be the third big Japanese investment this week on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMFG said the bank had no deal in place at the moment but media said it wanted to join the list of Japanese financial firms using the upheaval in the United States to aggressively expand abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchases, including a big stake in Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and the Asian and European assets of failed Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK, are a major turnaround for Japanese banks that were nearly crushed by bad loans just a few years ago and needed massive injections of public cash to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late on Tuesday, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) agreed to invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs, a big boost for the Wall Street bank from the world's best-known investor, but a Goldman spokesman said he could not confirm the report SMFG would follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG's investment in Goldman Sachs would total several hundred billion yen, Kyodo news agency said, while the Nikkei business daily said the bank would consider investing up to 100 billion yen ($946 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG played down the reports, which both cited unnamed sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At this point, it is not true that we've decided to invest in Goldman Sachs," said SMFG spokeswoman Chika Togawa, who declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a broader rally of financial stocks, shares of SMFG finished up 1.2 percent at 684,000 yen, compared with a 0.1 percent decline in Tokyo's broad TOPIX share average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they take a big position in Goldman, you can definitely say it would be a positive over the medium- to long-term," said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they take a big enough position so that they can benefit from Goldman's know-how and human resources, it will be positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once considered too naive and cautious for the high-risk, high-return world of investment banking, cash-rich Japanese firms have largely avoided the huge credit losses of the subprime mortgage crisis, leaving them well-placed to pick up the best assets from the carnage on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOIN THE CLUB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc 8604.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T), has agreed to buy up to 20 percent of Morgan Stanley for as much as $8.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back from a one day market holiday on Tuesday, shares of Nomura rose 5.2 percent to 1,505 yen, and Mitsubishi UFJ gained 4.2 percent to 936 yen. Tokyo's index of bank stocks .IBNKS.T rose 1.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nomura was able to buy Lehman after it filed for bankruptcy so I think investors think that Nomura got Lehman on the cheap," said Nana Otsuki, banking analyst at UBS in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It kind of seems that MUFG might have been able to get Morgan Stanley cheaper if they had waited a little," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley secured approval from the Federal Reserve to become commercial, deposit-taking banks this week, signaling the end of an era for Wall Street's free-wheeling, investment banking model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts had previously speculated that Goldman could turn to SMFG for funding, because the two companies have a history of investing in each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Goldman bought 150 billion yen in convertible preferred shares of SMFG, giving it a much-needed capital injection while in the 1980s, SMFG's predecessor bank helped bail out Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Mitsui said in June it would pay 500 million pounds ($927 million) to take a 2 percent stake in British bank Barclays Plc (BARC.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG's President, Teisuke Kitayama, later told Reuters the two banks would work together on private and commercial banking outside of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=105.73 Yen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.5393 Pound)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Nathan Layne and Taiga Uranaka; Editing by Lincoln Feast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ATLANTA, GA, Sep 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today introduced new functionality across its security
product portfolio to help clients simplify their security infrastructure
and slash security costs. These new features are designed to help
organizations reap more benefits from their security investments, which
is increasingly vital for IT organizations to meet new demands.

    Information Technology (IT) organizations have neither the time nor money
to manage multitudes of disparate security point solutions, each intended
to protect against a specific threat. This problem is compounded as
organizations transition from physical to virtual IT environments, which
introduces a multitude of new security and compliance risks. IBM Internet
Security Systems radically reduces the cost and complexity of security and
compliance by delivering products that are inherently designed to work
together as an extensible platform, all managed through a single
heterogeneous management console. The new product enhancements from IBM
ISS are designed to continue this strategy of "strategic security
simplification." Highlights of these major upgrades include:

    IBM Proventia Network Virtual Intrusion Prevention System (VIPS)
Appliance -- a first-of-a-kind virtual appliance, the VIPS enables clients
to maximize their existing hardware investments by deploying virtual
appliances on underutilized hardware resources. This product marks the
first product roll-out from PHANTOM, a breakthrough research initiative
from IBM X-Force and IBM Research, to offer businesses a holistic approach
to secure virtualized server environments. The Phantom initiative also
includes virtual appliances for Proventia Enterprise Scanner and Proventia
Multi-Function Security in addition to our virtual Proventia Server
solution with true defense in-depth introspection security protection. The
software based VIPS appliance runs under VMWare, which allows flexible
deployments and on-demand security services at the click of a button. It
also allows customers to accelerate their adoption of virtual data centers
by addressing securing and compliance requirements. Finally, Proventia
Network Virtual IPS provides a total-cost-of-ownership savings over time,
because clients do not need to buy new hardware when they want to upgrade
or expand their intrusion-prevention capabilities.  IBM
Proventia Network Security Controller (NSC) -- a security management
appliance that enables protection for high speed networks and helps
clients preserve their investment in the Proventia product family
portfolio as they upgrade their network fabric from 1 gigabit per second
to 10 gigabits per second. The NSC allows clients with existing Proventia
appliances to connect those appliances to 10G networks and "team"
appliances together to fully inspect traffic at line speed. The NSC also
includes full active bypass functionality to eliminate the need for a
dedicated bypass on the network and another device on the network that
must be managed.  IBM Proventia Network Enterprise Scanner --
Enterprise Scanner safeguards enterprises from malicious attacks by
identifying and prioritizing risks associated with network
vulnerabilities while enabling protection activities and comprehensive
reporting. Enterprise Scanner now supports multiple ports, enabling it to
scale without the need for additional appliances. This feature drives
efficiencies and helps reduce costs because clients can scan multiple
networks from a single appliance. Also, because the appliance now can
scan an organization's IT infrastructure faster, clients can begin
remediation tasks immediately further mitigating risk by leveraging
advanced ticketing and profile functionality. This helps drive
efficiencies and helps reduce costs because clients can scan multiple
networks from a single appliance.  New features also include
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)-based rating, which allows
users to prioritize discovered vulnerabilities based on an
industry-standard rating system. Users can continually assess the status
of their network by using this benchmark and leveraging the continuous
scanning window feature.  IBM Proventia SiteProtector 7.0 --
The newest version of IBM Proventia SiteProtector enables clients to
easily manage and measure their enterprise security infrastructure
through an easy-to-use, centralized console. Information technology staff
can identify risks and manage products through a single console, while
also running compliance reports with the solution's new policy management
tool. With updated policy management features, IBM helps reduce security
management time and costs, streamline compliance reporting and reduce
risk. This product is also offered as a managed security service in which
IBM monitors and manages the SiteProtector tool 24x7 or just on nights
and weekends when an organization's staff is not at work. As a managed
service, clients benefit from knowing IBM is carefully monitoring their
IT infrastructure so that the business can focus on its core function and
focus on serving its customers rather than maintaining its IT
operations.  Client Security Readiness Tool -- IBM ISS is
launching its first Client Security Readiness Tool, a free professional
services workshop which identifies and measures a client's security
posture. Through this standardized, repeatable tool, security experts can
assess a client's security and attribute a baseline security posture
number. This measurement tool allows clients to benchmark how their
security increases and helps them realize where they spend their IT
security dollars, areas of potential risk, and then determine which
security solutions can be implemented. Currently, the tool incorporates
IBM's entire services portfolio of offerings and will include software
and systems solutions in the near future.

    "We are eager to get our hands on the Proventia Network Virtual Intrusion
Prevention System (VIPS) Appliance from IBM Internet Security Systems,"
said Pat O'Day, Chief Technology Officer at BlueLock, LLC, a managed
technology services provider that delivers infrastructure-as-a-service to
global corporations. "The VIPS fits right into our virtual cloud computing
strategy and will be a great opportunity for our clients that wish to
significantly improve the security of their environments."

    IBM is the world's leading provider of risk and security solutions.
Clients around the world partner with IBM to help reduce the complexities
of security and strategically manage risk. IBM's experience and range of
risk and security solutions are unsurpassed -- from dedicated research,
software, hardware, services and global business partner value -- helping
clients secure business operations and implement company-wide, integrated
risk management programs.

&lt;p&gt;  ATLANTA, GA, Sep 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today introduced new products that expand its initiative
for small to mid-sized businesses to implement the same highly
sophisticated and intricate security networks deployed by major
corporations.

    The new products and services will be offered by IBM's renowned Internet
Security Systems unit, and are designed to meet a pressing need. Research
from IBM's X-Force security team indicates acceleration in security
threats on the Web, at the same time that information technology (IT)
departments are stretched thin trying to keep pace with security issues
and compliance requirements. IBM's approach streamlines security
management, delivering "ahead of the threat" protection against attacks,
simplifying security infrastructure through consolidation, and reducing
the labor and costs associated with compliance.

    Today's announcement includes:

    The newest release of IBM's Proventia Network Multi-Function Security, a
Unified Threat Management (UTM) solution geared to help small and medium
sized businesses by providing complete security at a lower overall cost.
It provides six security modules, and now includes a Secure Sockets Layer
Virtual Private Network (SSL VPN) to provide remote users with easy remote
access and tighter security controls. IBM offers the only UTM in the
industry that is certified to help clients meet PCI compliance by
independent testing from NSS Labs.

    This release also makes it easier for IT departments to manage with
several firewall enhancements and many usability upgrades. Complete with
firewall, intrusion protection, anti-virus, anti-spam, URL filtering,
IPSec VPN, and now an SSL VPN, this UTM is a one-stop product that
eliminates the need to manage multiple vendors and products.

    "Complexity is the real issue for security -- both in terms of creating
opportunity for breaches, and causing escalating costs," said Fred Vignes,
director of information technology at the Zoo Atlanta. "The new SSL VPN
capability in the IBM UTM appliance has provided immeasurable benefits for

   What do you see as the two sides of the coin here (regarding
Treasury bailout proposals)?

   If we get it right, it will be just a pretty bad recession. We
have lived through many of those in the past. If we get it wrong, we
face some extremely rough economic times ahead. Those warning about
the potential of a second Great Depression are not kidding, but such
an awful outcome is far from the only possibility.

   How would you advise investors to proceed at this time?

   Invest under the assumption that we will have a significant
economic slowdown. That means buy companies where there is demand for
the products through good times and bad, and which have very strong
balance sheets. Some of the Consumer Staples names seem to fit the
bill, like Kraft (NYSE: KFT), Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG) and PepsiCo
(NYSE: PEP). The Integrated Oil companies like Exxon (NYSE: XOM) and
Conoco (NYSE: COP) also look like safe harbors in this storm.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Bets on n.runs AG as Part of Their New Partner Program "SDL Pro Network" in EMEA

   Software Giant Appoints IT Security Company as a Member of the
"Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle Pro Network"
OBERURSEL, Germany--(Business Wire)--
n.runs AG, specialist for IT consulting and solution development
is the only central European company to be selected for the new
Microsoft partner program "Security Development Lifecycle Pro Network"
by the world's largest software company Microsoft. The pilot phase
will be launched on 10th November 2008 during the Microsoft Tech-Ed
EMEA in Barcelona.

   As a consequence of Bill Gates declaring "Trustworthy Computing"
the company maxim in 2002, and in view of the consistently increasing
customer requirements regarding security, the Security Development
Lifecycle (SDL) was designed by Microsoft as an internal standard for
software development, in order to eliminate security relevant defects
and to reduce any subsequent damages due to design and programming
errors. Since then, more than 20,000 Microsoft developers and
programmers have undergone the SDL training.

   With the new program, Microsoft has set a goal of making this
successful development cycle available to external companies who deal
with the development and programming of Microsoft as well as other
applications.

   For this purpose, Microsoft created the partner program "Security
Development Lifecycle Pro Network". Microsoft has put its faith in
consultants and trainers from the nine worldwide market leading
consulting and training companies in the network security sector.
Their task is to support organisations using their substantial
experience and expertise concerning SDL methodology and technology, to
implement SDL with the help of proven guidelines and establish it as
an integral part of the software development process.

   After long-standing co-operation with Microsoft in the consulting
sector, n.runs AG was chosen for the program due to their high level
of expertise in the IT security sector, and it offers both the
training and the corresponding consulting for the implementation of
SDL required by Microsoft.

   "We are very proud to be selected as a member of the SDL Pro
Network by Microsoft, as the only company from mainland Europe. The
program is a crucial step in software development, for increased
security of IT applications. As an exclusive member we will make a
significant contribution to fulfilling the ever higher security
requirements of the IT market", explains Andreas Bruns, CEO of n.runs
AG. "Already today, we are one of the first companies to be able to
cover the total spectrum related to SDL, and our customers will
benefit from this", added Bruns.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs brought good news to global markets worried that architects of a $700 billion bailout plan would not be able to convince U.S. lawmakers to move swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group also plans to invest in Goldman, Japanese media reported on Wednesday, in what would be the country's third big investment on Wall Street this week as its well-capitalized banks take advantage of global upheaval to expand aggressively abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG, which is Japan's third-largest bank and has a long relationship with Goldman, said the bank had no deal in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks in Asia gained slightly and U.S. Treasury yields rose after news of the Goldman stake purchase by one of the world's most respected investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNN reported that the FBI was investigating Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and insurer American International Group Inc and their senior executives for potential mortgage fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bureau was trying to determine whether anyone in those financial institutions had any responsibility for providing "misinformation," CNN reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new Washington Post-ABC News poll, meanwhile, showed that Democrat Barack Obama has opened a 9-point lead over Republican John McCain in the U.S. presidential race amid turmoil in the financial system and growing pessimism about the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSCI index of Asian shares outside Japan edged up 0.16 percent, and Tokyo, which was closed on Tuesday for a public holiday, rose 0.2 percent. Stocks in Europe were set to open slightly higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've still got plenty of uncertainty ahead of U.S. Congress approving the rescue package," said Sarah-Jane Wagg, president director of UBS Securities Indonesia in Jakarta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, investor nerves are frayed by two weeks of unprecedented financial markets turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Hong Kong, Bank of East Asia was forced to deny rumors questioning its stability, which had sent its shares down as much as 11 percent and drew hundreds of customers to at least one of its branches. The bank said its capital adequacy ratio of 14.6 percent was well-above international requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway secured approval this week to become commercial banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Japanese banks investing in western peers, speculation has swirled that SMFG might invest in Goldman, but SMFG spokeswoman Chika Togawa said: "At this point it is not true that we've decided to invest in Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman said he could not confirm a Kyodo news agency report of an investment by SMFG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire will buy $5 billion of Goldman perpetual preferred stock that carries a 10 percent dividend. It also will receive warrants to buy $5 billion of common stock, or 43.5 million shares, at $115 per share, within five years, which could give it a roughly 9 percent stake in Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late on Tuesday, top Japanese brokerage Nomura Holdings Inc agreed to buy bankrupt Lehman's Europe and Middle East operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That came on the heels of Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, agreeing to buy up to 20 percent of Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLITICS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis has become the No. 1 issue leading up to the November 4 U.S. presidential election, and many lawmakers seeking re-election to Congress want to appear vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bailout, potentially the United States' biggest ever, could cost every American man, woman and child $2,300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for the world's richest country, $700 billion would be a huge budget drain. Since 2003, the Iraq war has cost about $550 billion, or a little more than $100 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting two days of hearings, Paulson and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the plan might cost less once the government is able to resell toxic mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson said the government would buy the securities in a reverse auction in which the roles of buyer and seller are reversed to ensure the lowest price is paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox urged Congress to plug a regulatory hole in the $58 trillion market for credit default swaps, insurance-like products that many say pose a systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President George W. Bush promised in his last speech to the United Nations that markets would stabilize, but faced criticism over the excesses of what some have described as a culture of greed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Dolan and Taiga Uranaka in TOKYO; Harry Suhartono in JAKARTA, and James Pomfret in HONG KONG; Editing by Jean Yoon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T), Japan's No. 3 bank, plans to invest in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Japanese media said, in what would be the third big Japanese investment this week on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMFG said the bank had no deal in place at the moment but media said it wanted to join the list of Japanese financial firms using the upheaval in the United States to aggressively expand abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchases, including a big stake in Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and the Asian and European assets of failed Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK, are a major turnaround for Japanese banks that were nearly crushed by bad loans just a few years ago and needed massive injections of public cash to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late on Tuesday, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) agreed to invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs, a big boost for the Wall Street bank from the world's best-known investor, but a Goldman spokesman said he could not confirm the report SMFG would follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG's investment in Goldman Sachs would total several hundred billion yen, Kyodo news agency said, while the Nikkei business daily said the bank would consider investing up to 100 billion yen ($946 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG played down the reports, which both cited unnamed sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At this point, it is not true that we've decided to invest in Goldman Sachs," said SMFG spokeswoman Chika Togawa, who declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a broader rally of financial stocks, shares of SMFG finished up 1.2 percent at 684,000 yen, compared with a 0.1 percent decline in Tokyo's broad TOPIX share average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they take a big position in Goldman, you can definitely say it would be a positive over the medium- to long-term," said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they take a big enough position so that they can benefit from Goldman's know-how and human resources, it will be positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once considered too naive and cautious for the high-risk, high-return world of investment banking, cash-rich Japanese firms have largely avoided the huge credit losses of the subprime mortgage crisis, leaving them well-placed to pick up the best assets from the carnage on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOIN THE CLUB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc 8604.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T), has agreed to buy up to 20 percent of Morgan Stanley for as much as $8.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back from a one day market holiday on Tuesday, shares of Nomura rose 5.2 percent to 1,505 yen, and Mitsubishi UFJ gained 4.2 percent to 936 yen. Tokyo's index of bank stocks .IBNKS.T rose 1.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nomura was able to buy Lehman after it filed for bankruptcy so I think investors think that Nomura got Lehman on the cheap," said Nana Otsuki, banking analyst at UBS in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It kind of seems that MUFG might have been able to get Morgan Stanley cheaper if they had waited a little," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley secured approval from the Federal Reserve to become commercial, deposit-taking banks this week, signaling the end of an era for Wall Street's free-wheeling, investment banking model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts had previously speculated that Goldman could turn to SMFG for funding, because the two companies have a history of investing in each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Goldman bought 150 billion yen in convertible preferred shares of SMFG, giving it a much-needed capital injection while in the 1980s, SMFG's predecessor bank helped bail out Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Mitsui said in June it would pay 500 million pounds ($927 million) to take a 2 percent stake in British bank Barclays Plc (BARC.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG's President, Teisuke Kitayama, later told Reuters the two banks would work together on private and commercial banking outside of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=105.73 Yen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.5393 Pound)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Nathan Layne and Taiga Uranaka; Editing by Lincoln Feast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Architects of a $700 billion bailout plan urged U.S. lawmakers to act swiftly or face dire economic consequences amid growing concern the rescue may be delayed, but markets were heartened by news that Warren Buffett was investing $5 billion in Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tokyo, Kyodo news agency reported that Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T), Japan's third-largest bank, plans to invest several billion dollars in Goldman, with which it has a long relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG said it had no plans at this time to invest in Goldman, whose spokesman Lucas van Praag said he could not confirm the Kyodo report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks in Asia gained and U.S. Treasury yields rose after news of the Goldman stake purchase by one of the world's most respected investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSCI index of Asian shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS edged up 0.4 percent, but Tokyo .N225, which was closed on Tuesday for a public holiday, fell 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) BRKb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told lawmakers during five hours of hearings on Tuesday that the bailout was "sad" and "embarrassing," but needed to stave off a deep recession and restore confidence in markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Barrett, managing director and strategist with Citi Private Client Investment in Hong Kong, said there is sufficient political will in Congress to approve the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the buyout package that has been proposed by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve will be passed, and we hope it will be passed by the end of this week. Markets will need to see this happen or we will have another leg down in the major global indices," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Paulson spoke, the U.S. Federal Reserve was forced to inject another $2 billion into the troubled financial system to help mutual funds that were scrambling to raise cash to meet heavy withdrawals by rattled customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lawmakers scoffed at the proposed bailout's enormous size and the lack of detail, U.S. stocks closed down about 1.5 percent on uncertainty over when and how Washington would act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank warned the plan might not pass until Monday, adding that the Democrat-controlled Congress needed limits on compensation for executives of firms offloading bad assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just don't think the American public is sold," said David Dietze, chief investment officer at Point View Financial Services in Summit, New Jersey. "They are skeptical of the need, and they are fearful of the cost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The skepticism is that this is going to help the Wall Street financiers and do nothing for the little guy other than saddle them with a big tax bill," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN IN SPOTLIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once thought untouchable, Goldman was shaken last week by a sudden slide in its shares. Goldman and rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N) secured approval this week to become commercial banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With big and well-capitalized Japanese banks investing in western peers, speculation has swirled that SMFG might invest in Goldman. SMFG shares rose 2.2 percent after the Kyodo report, outperforming a broader market that was in negative territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG spokeswoman Chika Togawa said: "At this point it is not true that we've decided to invest in Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire will buy $5 billion of Goldman perpetual preferred stock that carries a 10 percent dividend. It also will receive warrants to buy $5 billion of common stock, or 43.5 million shares, at $115 per share, within five years, which could give it a roughly 9 percent stake in Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late on Tuesday, top Japanese brokerage Nomura Holdings Inc (8604.T) agreed to buy bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's LEHMQ.PK European and Middle East operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That came on the heels of Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T), agreeing to buy up to 20 percent of Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLITICS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis has become the No. 1 issue leading up to the November 4 U.S. presidential election, and many lawmakers seeking re-election to Congress want to appear vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bailout, potentially the United States' biggest ever, could cost every American man, woman and child $2,300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for the world's richest country, $700 billion would be a huge budget drain.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Architects of a $700 billion bailout plan urged U.S. lawmakers to act swiftly or face dire economic consequences amid growing concern the rescue may be delayed, but markets were heartened by news that Warren Buffett was investing $5 billion in Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tokyo, Kyodo news agency reported that Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Japan's third-largest bank, plans to invest several billion dollars in Goldman, with which it has a long relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG said it had no plans at this time to invest in Goldman, whose spokesman Lucas van Praag said he could not confirm the Kyodo report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks in Asia gained and U.S. Treasury yields rose after news of the Goldman stake purchase by one of the world's most respected investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSCI index of Asian shares outside Japan edged up 0.4 percent, but Tokyo, which was closed on Tuesday for a public holiday, fell 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway secured approval this week to become commercial banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With big and well-capitalized Japanese banks investing in western peers, speculation has swirled that SMFG might invest in Goldman. SMFG shares rose 2.2 percent after the Kyodo report, outperforming a broader market that was in negative territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG spokeswoman Chika Togawa said: "At this point it is not true that we've decided to invest in Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire will buy $5 billion of Goldman perpetual preferred stock that carries a 10 percent dividend. It also will receive warrants to buy $5 billion of common stock, or 43.5 million shares, at $115 per share, within five years, which could give it a roughly 9 percent stake in Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late on Tuesday, top Japanese brokerage Nomura Holdings Inc agreed to buy bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's European and Middle East operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That came on the heels of Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, agreeing to buy up to 20 percent of Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLITICS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis has become the No. 1 issue leading up to the November 4 U.S. presidential election, and many lawmakers seeking re-election to Congress want to appear vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bailout, potentially the United States' biggest ever, could cost every American man, woman and child $2,300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for the world's richest country, $700 billion would be a huge budget drain. Since 2003, the Iraq war has cost about $550 billion, or a little more than $100 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting two days of hearings, Paulson and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the plan might cost less once the government is able to resell toxic mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson said the government would buy the securities in a reverse auction in which the roles of buyer and seller are reversed to ensure the lowest price is paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox urged Congress to plug a regulatory hole in the $58 trillion market for credit default swaps, insurance-like products that many say pose a systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President George W.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway
Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) will invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs
Group Inc (GS.N), in a major boost for the Wall Street bank
from perhaps the world's best-known investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "It's a vote of confidence which is gold plated," said
Michael Holland, a money manager at Holland  Co in New York.
"You don't get better than this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman rose 8.1 percent after the announcement,
while Standard  Poor's 500 futures SPc1 gained 15 points.
Goldman also announced plans to sell $2.5 billion of common
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett is adding Goldman to a portfolio of investments at
Berkshire that includes large stakes in a handful of major U.S.
commercial banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Sunday, Goldman won Federal Reserve approval to become a
bank holding company, giving it easier access to financing and
adding to speculation it might buy another bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This came after many investors questioned its business
model amid this month's market turmoil, causing shares to fall
50 percent from their record set last Oct 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman Sachs is an exceptional institution," Buffett said
in a statement. "It has an unrivaled global franchise, a proven
and deep management team and the intellectual and financial
capital to continue its track record of outperformance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett is the second-richest American according to Forbes
magazine, and built Berkshire into a $199 billion conglomerate
by investing in undervalued companies with strong management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was not available for immediate comment, according to
Debbie Bosanek, who works in his Omaha, Nebraska office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, in a statement
noted Buffett's "longstanding relationship" with the company,
and called the investment "a strong validation of our client
franchise and future prospects. This investment will further
bolster our strong capitalization and liquidity position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SECOND BIG INVESTMENT IN WEEK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berkshire will buy $5 billion of Goldman perpetual
preferred stock that carries a 10 percent dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also will receive warrants to buy $5 billion of common
stock, or 43.5 million shares, at $115 per share, within five
years, which could give it a roughly 9 percent stake in
Goldman. Last week, Goldman said it averaged 448.3 million
common shares in the quarter ended Aug 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Sunday, Goldman and rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N) said
they would become bank holding companies, enabling them to
accept deposits and killing the investment bank model that
dominated Wall Street for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The following day, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) said it would sell
up to a 20 percent equity stake, worth as much as $8.5 billion,
to Japan's largest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc
(8306.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and Morgan Stanley announced the investments barely
a week after upheavals at the two other major Wall Street
investment banks. Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N agreed to sell
itself to Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), while Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK filed for bankruptcy protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Clearly they are saying that Goldman is not only going to
be a survivor, but that it is going to prosper in this new
world," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris
Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berkshire as of June 30 disclosed stakes in six major U.S.
financial services companies: American Express Co (AXP.N), Bank
of America, MT Bank Corp (MTB.N), SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N),
U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A person familiar with Goldman's thinking said the company
is not likely to announce deals with these banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Bancorp spokesman Steve Dale and Wells Fargo
spokeswoman Julia Tunis Bernard declined to comment. The other
companies did not immediately return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said on Sunday it intends to expand its deposit
base by buying deposits from other banks, including those in
distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's bank unit had about $25 billion in assets and $23
billion in deposits, tiny in comparison to its total assets of
$1.1 trillion at the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment is Buffett's second major purchase in a
week. On Thursday, Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co
affiliate agreed to buy power supplier Constellation Energy
Group Inc CEG.N for $4.7 billion. Constellation took that bid
over a higher offer led by France's Electricite de France SA
(EDF.PA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOLDMAN TIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite his disdain for investment banking excess, Buffett
has publicly praised Goldman investment banker Byron Trott, who
helped arrange Berkshire's $4.5 billion purchase in March of a
majority stake in industrial conglomerate Marmon Holdings Inc
from Chicago's Pritzker family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also provided financing for Mars Inc's planned $23
billion acquisition of chewing gum maker Wm Wrigley Jr Co
WWY.N. Berkshire committed $6.5 billion to that transaction.
Wrigley shareholders will vote on the merger on Sept 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Buffett was 10 years old his father brought him to 
visit former Goldman Sachs head Sidney Weinberg. And as a young
broker Buffett worked with Gus Levy, who later ran Goldman in
the 1970s as senior partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SALOMON INC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett's most famous foray into Wall Street came in 1991,
when he became interim chairman at Salomon Inc to help it clean
house following a Treasury market scandal. Salomon was a major
Berkshire investment, but not one of Buffett's best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't know if it's a statement on all the financials or
the market," said Marshall Sonenshine, chairman of Sonenshine
Partners in New York, referring to the Goldman investment. "He
sees Goldman Sachs as a good value where it's currently priced.
Remember, he invested in Salomon Brothers in the past, and that
wasn't a sign that Salomon was going to start doing well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett may have reason to believe a Goldman investment
will fare better, said Anton Schutz, a portfolio manager at
Mendon Capital Advisors in Rochester, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The valuation is great, and with what the government's
doing to unfreeze debt markets, it's a great time to be
buying," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman rose $10.10 to $135.15 in after-hours
trading following the announcement, after closing up $4.27, or
3.5 percent, to $125.05 in regular trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Megan Davies, Joseph A. Giannone

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian financial shares and U.S. stock futures rose on Wednesday after Warren Buffett surprised the market with a $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firmer stocks knocked some of the safe-haven premium off U.S. Treasuries and the dollar inched down against the euro as fears continued to grip investors that U.S. lawmakers will stall a proposed $700 billion bailout of the battered financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market is still nervous about the outcome of the proposed U.S. plan as politics seems to be making the deal more complicated," said Ryuji Shimai, a market analyst at Shinko Securities in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European markets were seen opening mixed, as Buffett's vote of confidence in Wall Street banks competed for attention with uncertainty over the U.S. bailout plan and business sentiment surveys due in France, Italy and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spreadbetters saw London's FTSE 100 .FTSE opening 8 to 19 points higher and Frankfurt's DAX .GDAXI 15 to 25 points higher, while the French CAC 40 .FCHI was seen down 5 to 9 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude oil futures edged up toward $107 a barrel, paring Tuesday's losses of nearly $3, ahead of U.S. government inventory data expected to show declines in crude and gasoline stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's Nikkei .N225 gained 0.2 percent, while MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan, which slumped to a two-year low last week, was up 0.3 percent at 0605 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI and SP 500 .SPX both losing around 1.5 percent, amid congressional wrangling over Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's plan to buy up toxic mortgage debt on financial institutions' balance sheets in an effort to resolve the root cause of the current financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"FOLLOWING GOD"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But news that Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) was investing in Wall Street's most powerful firm sent U.S. index futures surging as much as 23 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett's move also boosted Australia's financial sector, with National Australia Bank (NAB.AX) up 6.2 percent and ANZ Banking Group (ANZ.AX) gaining 3.1 percent, as the benchmark SP/ASX 200 index rose 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Hong Kong the financial sector also led gains, with China Life (2628.HK) up 2.8 percent and ICBC (1398.HK) up 2.4 percent, as the Hang Seng Index .HSI put on 0.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody is just following god, Warren Buffett has shown the way," said Francis Lun, general manager with Fulbright Securities, as the move by the world's most famous investor was taken as a sign there may now be value in the beaten-down sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's third-biggest bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) (8316.T) also planned to invest several billion dollars in Goldman, according to the Kyodo news agency, though SMFG said it had no plans to do so for now.

&lt;p&gt;PERTH, Sept 24 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) has proposed expanding the production capacity of its
planned Wheatstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Western
Australia by about 67 percent, government documents showed on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The proposal to expand output to a 25 million tonnes per
annum (mtpa) comes amid a forecast surge in global LNG demand
to 400 mtpa by 2020 from 170 mtpa last year, as the world seeks
cleaner source of fuel amid environmental concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The planned Wheatstone plant was first announced in March
as a 5 mtpa facility. In July Chevron said it was planning to
raise capacity to 15 mtpa after it found more gas at its Iago
gas field adjacent to the Wheatstone gas field which will
provide gas for the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said in the report that it would take a number of
years to develop the Wheatstone plant to the 25 mtpa capacity,
but did not give a specific timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimated
cost of the plant and whether the firm has lined up any other
parties to supply gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Australia's environment department did not make any comment
on the expansion plan on its Website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If expanded to 25 mtpa, the Wheatstone plant would be
larger than the North West Shelf LNG project, operated by
Australia's Woodside Petroleum Ltd Woodside (WPL.AX), and the
Chevron's own, proposed 15 mtpa Gorgon LNG project, which is
currently Australia's biggest planned resources project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has selected three potential sites for the

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Architects of a $700 billion bailout plan urged U.S. lawmakers to act swiftly or face dire economic consequences amid growing concern the rescue may be delayed, but markets were heartened by news that Warren Buffett was investing $5 billion in Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tokyo, Kyodo news agency reported that Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T), Japan's third-largest bank, plans to invest several billion dollars in Goldman, with which it has a long relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG said it had no plans at this time to invest in Goldman, whose spokesman Lucas van Praag said he could not confirm the Kyodo report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks in Asia gained and U.S. Treasury yields rose after news of the Goldman stake purchase by one of the world's most respected investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSCI index of Asian shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS edged up 0.4 percent, but Tokyo .N225, which was closed on Tuesday for a public holiday, fell 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) BRKb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told lawmakers during five hours of hearings on Tuesday that the bailout was "sad" and "embarrassing," but needed to stave off a deep recession and restore confidence in markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Barrett, managing director and strategist with Citi Private Client Investment in Hong Kong, said there is sufficient political will in Congress to approve the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the buyout package that has been proposed by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve will be passed, and we hope it will be passed by the end of this week. Markets will need to see this happen or we will have another leg down in the major global indices," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Paulson spoke, the U.S. Federal Reserve was forced to inject another $2 billion into the troubled financial system to help mutual funds that were scrambling to raise cash to meet heavy withdrawals by rattled customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lawmakers scoffed at the proposed bailout's enormous size and the lack of detail, U.S. stocks closed down about 1.5 percent on uncertainty over when and how Washington would act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank warned the plan might not pass until Monday, adding that the Democrat-controlled Congress needed limits on compensation for executives of firms offloading bad assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just don't think the American public is sold," said David Dietze, chief investment officer at Point View Financial Services in Summit, New Jersey. "They are skeptical of the need, and they are fearful of the cost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The skepticism is that this is going to help the Wall Street financiers and do nothing for the little guy other than saddle them with a big tax bill," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN IN SPOTLIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once thought untouchable, Goldman was shaken last week by a sudden slide in its shares. Goldman and rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N) secured approval this week to become commercial banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With big and well-capitalized Japanese banks investing in western peers, speculation has swirled that SMFG might invest in Goldman. SMFG shares rose 2.2 percent after the Kyodo report, outperforming a broader market that was in negative territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMFG spokeswoman Chika Togawa said: "At this point it is not true that we've decided to invest in Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire will buy $5 billion of Goldman perpetual preferred stock that carries a 10 percent dividend. It also will receive warrants to buy $5 billion of common stock, or 43.5 million shares, at $115 per share, within five years, which could give it a roughly 9 percent stake in Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late on Tuesday, top Japanese brokerage Nomura Holdings Inc (8604.T) agreed to buy bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's LEHMQ.PK European and Middle East operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That came on the heels of Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T), agreeing to buy up to 20 percent of Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLITICS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis has become the No. 1 issue leading up to the November 4 U.S. presidential election, and many lawmakers seeking re-election to Congress want to appear vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bailout, potentially the United States' biggest ever, could cost every American man, woman and child $2,300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for the world's richest country, $700 billion would be a huge budget drain. Since 2003, the Iraq war has cost about $550 billion, or a little more than $100 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting two days of hearings, Paulson and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the plan might cost less once the government is able to resell toxic mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson said the government would buy the securities in a reverse auction in which the roles of buyer and seller are reversed to ensure the lowest price is paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox urged Congress to plug a regulatory hole in the $58 trillion market for credit default swaps, insurance-like products that many say pose a systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President George W. Bush promised in his last speech to the United Nations that markets would stabilize, but faced criticism over the excesses of what some have described as a culture of greed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'SHARE THE OUTRAGE'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson, a former Goldman Sachs boss reportedly worth about $700 million, told Congress, "I share the outrage that people have. It's embarrassing for the United States of America."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat associated with Wall Street's interests, pressed Paulson on if he could take the money in installments, starting with $150 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson replied bluntly, "We need the full authority."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What this is about is market confidence," he said. "It's a sad story, but the American taxpayer is already on the hook."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress and the Bush administration are under growing pressure to act following a rising tide of U.S. home foreclosures and loan defaults, and the failure of U.S. investment banks as well as the world's largest insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Dolan and Taiga Uranaka in TOKYO; Editing by Jean Yoon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Yields rise after U.S. stock futures jump&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Uncertainty over U.S. bailout plan pulls yields off peaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Satomi Noguchi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOKYO, Sept 24 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields rose on
Wednesday after news of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
investing $5 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) boosted
U.S. stock futures in Asian trade, reducing the safe-haven appeal
of debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But yields remained off earlier peaks, capped by uncertainty
over whether a U.S. proposed $700 bailout plan can be quickly
enacted in an effort to resolve the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market is still nervous about the outcome of the
proposed U.S. plan as politics seems to be making the deal more
complicated," said Ryuji Shimai, a market analyst at Shinko
Securities in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR fell 3/32 in price,
pushing yields up to 3.816 percent from 3.803 percent late in New
York on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 10-year yield jumped as much as 5 basis points to 3.856
percent earlier in the session as SP 500 futures SPc1 soared
as much as 23 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two-year note fell 1/32 in price to yield 2.101 percent
US2YT=RR, up 2.8 basis points, after rising as high as 2.138
percent earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the market was also concerned that the U.S.
bailout plan could involve the federal government printing money
to take on bad assets and ending up with a lot more debt to fund,
when it is already likely to need to borrow around $1 trillion in
the current financial year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The yields on shorter maturities slipped from the day's highs
as credit markets remained under severe strain, with banks
reluctant to make loans to each other. The prospect of scarce
credit for companies and consumers further dimmed the outlook for
the overall economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three-month U.S. Treasury bill rates US3MT=RR were down to
0.72 percent, dropping further from 0.80 percent late New York on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As markets keep track of developments on the bailout plan, a
variety of economic data and other events will punctuate the
trading session later on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Existing home sales data for August is due to be released at
1400 GMT while Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is set to
testify on the economic outlook before Congress also at 1400 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following Tuesday's testimony at the Senate Banking
Committee, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Fed Chairman
Bernanke are scheduled to testify before the House Financial
Services Committee on Wednesday afternoon on the government's
proposal to intervene in capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Sophie Hardach)

&lt;p&gt;SANTA CLARA, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Thursday he still sees a
"certain buoyancy" among technology and telecommunications
customers worldwide, despite recent U.S. economic woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Our industry is not immune to what goes on in the global
economy. And yet as I travel...given the current circumstances,
people still see a certain buoyancy in the market," Ballmer
told a meeting of Silicon Valley civic leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At least, for now, people are feeling, I won't say
optimistic, but better than you would be feeling if you are
watching CNBC all day," he said of the financial TV channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer, the leader of the world's largest software maker,
said he was speaking generally of industry demand rather than
his own business. "We are one week from the end of the quarter,
so I have nothing all that interesting to say," he joked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street analysts, on average, expect the Redmond,
Washington-based company to generate an 8 percent rise in
revenue to just under $15 billion during its fiscal first
quarter ending in September.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 25 (Reuters) - With the acquisition of
Washington Mutual Inc, (WM.N) JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief
Executive Jamie Dimon is starting to look a little more like
this century's incarnation of John Pierpont Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Morgan, who established the original J.P. Morgan  Co in
1871, organized a rescue of the banking system in the Panic of
1907. More than 100 years later, Dimon is buying failed banks
in the midst of financial chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The parallel is far from perfect. Dimon's rescues are first
and foremost meant to be good deals for shareholders, and not
necessarily noble efforts to stabilize the financial world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in an era of faltering financial institutions, Dimon's
JPMorgan, now the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, seems
about as strong as Morgan's did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He acquired investment bank Bear Stearns Cos in May through
a government-financed fire sale, and agreed to acquire
Washington Mutual's (WM.N) assets after the government took
control of the largest U.S. savings and loan on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon, 52, has been something of a golden child on Wall
Street ever since he was a protege of Sanford "Sandy" Weill at
the company that would become Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan's
chief New York commercial banking rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan edged out Citi, among others, in acquiring
Washington Mutual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several books profiling Dimon are in the works, as his
comments on Wall Street, its foibles and the U.S. economy
become more influential. This is partly because JPMorgan has
avoided much of the credit mess that has embroiled competitors
and left Bear Stearns hobbled, Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK
bankrupt and Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N sold to Bank of
America Corp (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think Jamie has earned the right by his performance to
be a spokesman that people should pay attention to," Weill, the
former Citigroup chief executive and chairman, said in an
interview with Reuters in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for investors, JPMorgan shares have through Thursday
dropped 0.4 percent or 19 cents this year, finishing on
Thursday at $43.46, compared with an 18.7 percent slide in the
KBW Banks Index BKX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With his latest acquisition of the assets of the country's
largest savings and loan, Dimon again took the statesman's role
while snaring the deal for JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He has been a good risk manager. He has been able to reap
the benefits," said Rick Meckler, chief investment officer of
LibertyView Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NO SHRINKING PERSONALITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Bruner, author of "The Panic of 1907" and dean of
the Darden Business School at the University of Virginia, told
Reuters in July that he sees some similarities between John
Pierpont Morgan's handling of the 1907 financial markets'
crisis and Dimon's acquisition of investment bank Bear
Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan took over Bear Stearns after the latter suffered
the equivalent of a bank run. Part of the reason JPMorgan
became involved was that it was considered by the government to
be the financial institution best equipped to absorb the
85-year-old company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He sets an example at an institution that is itself
exemplar," Bruner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After leaving Citigroup, Dimon became chief executive at
Chicago's underperforming Bank One Corp, where he slashed costs
and improved operations. He engineered that bank's $58 billion
takeover by JPMorgan in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon is known for being boisterous, opinionated and
unafraid to speak his mind, even if it means talking over
colleagues on calls with analysts and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People who know him say Dimon cuts his peers no slack. On a
conference call for Wall Street chieftains while JPMorgan was
rescuing Bear Stearns, Dimon shot down a somewhat technical
question from Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit, who has
a doctorate in finance. According to published reports, Dimon
told Pandit: "Stop being such a jerk."

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) tonight announced it has acquired
all deposits, assets and certain liabilities of Washington Mutual's
banking operations from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC), effective immediately. Excluded from the transaction are the
senior unsecured debt, subordinated debt, and preferred stock of
Washington Mutual's banks. JPMorgan Chase will not be acquiring any
assets or liabilities of the banks' parent holding company (WM) or the
holding company's non-bank subsidiaries. As part of this transaction,
JPMorgan Chase will make a payment of approximately $1.9 billion to
the FDIC.

   The acquisition expands Chase's consumer branch network into the
attractive states of California, Florida and Washington State and
creates the nation's second-largest branch network - with locations
reaching 42% of the U.S. population. The combined 5,400 branches in 23
states will also serve as an excellent base to extend the reach of the
business banking, commercial banking, credit card, consumer lending
and wealth management businesses. The acquisition also extends Chase's
retail branch network to additional states, including Georgia, Idaho,
Nevada and Oregon.

   The acquisition of Washington Mutual's banking operations is
expected to be immediately accretive to earnings and to add more than
50 cents per share in 2009. JPMorgan Chase expects to incur pretax
merger costs of approximately $1.5 billion while achieving annual
pretax cost savings of approximately $1.5 billion by 2010, net of
significant investments in the business. The bank plans to complete
most systems integrations and rebranding by year-end 2010, closing
less than 10% of branches in the combined network in overlapping
markets.

   In conjunction with this acquisition, JPMorgan Chase will be
marking down the acquired loan portfolio by approximately $31 billion,
which primarily represents our estimate of remaining credit losses
related to the impaired loans. JPMorgan Chase intends to raise
additional capital in connection with this transaction to maintain the
company's strong capital position.

   "This deal makes excellent strategic sense for our company and our
shareholders. Our people have worked hard to build a strong franchise
and balance sheet - making this compelling transaction possible," said
Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO. "As we have said in the past,
increasing our regional banking presence not only strengthens our
Retail business, but also benefits other business lines across our
firm, including our commercial banking, business banking, credit card,
and asset management groups."

   "JPMorgan Chase is strongly committed to both a strong banking
system and our responsibility as a good corporate citizen. We are
active in the states and local communities where we do business,"
Dimon said. In July, the bank earned an outstanding rating from the
Officer of the Comptroller of the Currency for the company's work
helping families buy homes, financing small businesses and making its
communities better.

   "We look forward to welcoming Washington Mutual's employees to
JPMorgan Chase and working with them as we build a great company
together," Dimon added.

   "This acquisition makes us more convenient and valuable to our
customers and meets our strategic goal of broadening our footprint to
serve our current and future customers better," said Charlie Scharf,
head of Chase's Retail business. He added, "Following a transition,
Washington Mutual customers will be able to take advantage of Chase's
broader network and a wider product range - all backed by the strength
and security of JPMorgan Chase." Over time, Chase will provide more
personal bankers, business bankers, loan officers and investment
advisers to serve the needs of Washington Mutual customers and to
expand their relationship with Chase.

   Customers of both companies may continue banking as usual, and
feel confident that their deposits are secure, now backed by the
strength and security of JPMorgan Chase. Employees and vendors should
continue to operate business as usual.

   Chase expects to convert Washington Mutual's consumer banking,
home lending and credit card businesses to the Chase brand and
technology platforms over the next two years. Chase and Washington
Mutual customers should be able to access the combined network of
14,000 ATMs without fees in the coming months.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) is expected to acquire the deposits of Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N), the largest U.S. savings and loan, in a government-brokered bailout, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purchase could be a major step in cleaning up a U.S. financial system littered with toxic mortgage debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquiring the deposits could fulfill JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon's long-held goal of becoming a retail banking force in the western United States. It comes six months after JPMorgan, the No. 3 U.S. bank, agreed to acquire the failing investment bank Bear Stearns Cos at a fire-sale price. Branches would also be included in the transaction, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it would hold an investor conference call at 9:15 p.m. EDT on Thursday, but it did not say why. Neither company returned calls for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deposit acquisition is not likely to affect the roughly $45.2 billion insurance fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), which analysts expect will be tapped dozens of times in the next few years to cover bank failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also comes as Washington wrangles over the fate of a $700 billion bailout of the financial services industry, which has been battered by mortgage defaults and tight credit conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jamie Dimon is clearly feeling that he has an opportunity to grab market share, and get it at fire-sale prices," said Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager at Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. "He's becoming an acquisition machine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan ended June with $1.78 trillion of assets, $722.9 billion of deposits and 3,157 branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual ended June with $309.7 billion of assets, $181.9 billion of deposits, 2,239 branches and 43,198 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Washington Mutual plunged 80 cents to 89 cents in after-hours trading after falling 57 cents to $1.69 in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEGOTIATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A transaction would follow more than a week of negotiations over the fate of Seattle-based Washington Mutual, which attracted interest from several large North American and European banks, as well as private equity firms, despite soaring mortgage losses and evaporating investor confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also appears to be a costly defeat for David Bonderman and his private equity firm TPG Inc TPG.UL, which in April invested $2 billion in Washington Mutual as part of a $7 billion capital-raising by the thrift. TPG was not available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual's $227 billion book of real estate loans, more than half of which comes from home equity loans, and adjustable-rate and subprime mortgages now considered risky, ensconced the thrift on the critical list of financial institutions needing help, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its fate appeared to grow more precarious after problems with mortgage-related debt led to last week's bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK and the near demise of insurance company American International Group Inc (AIG.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The addition of Washington Mutual would make JPMorgan close in size to Citigroup Inc (C.N), now the largest U.S. bank by assets. It would trail Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) assuming that bank, which now ranks second in assets, completes its planned purchase of Merrill Lynch  Co MER.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once something of a golden child at Citigroup Inc (C.N) before Sanford "Sandy" Weill engineered his ouster in 1998, Dimon has been carving for himself something of a role as a Wall Street savior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some historians see parallels with the legendary financier John Pierpont Morgan, who ran J.P. Morgan  Co and was credited with intervening to end a banking panic in 1907.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis has also been credited with helping steady Wall Street, or at least reduce damage, with his acquisitions this year of Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial Corp, the troubled mortgage lender that was once the nation's largest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HARD-HIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear how much of Washington Mutual's loans might have been eligible for the bailout. The thrift has a significant presence in California and Florida, two of the states hardest hit by the nation's housing crisis. It also has a significant presence in the New York City area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thrift had long been expected to sell itself after amassing $6.3 billion of losses in the previous three quarters. It had also projected $19 billion of mortgage losses through 2011, but many analysts said that was too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual earlier this month ousted Chief Executive Kerry Killinger, who spearheaded the thrift's growth as well as its expansion in subprime and other risky mortgages, and replaced him with Alan Fishman, the former chief executive of Brooklyn, New York's Independence Community Bank Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paritosh Bansal, Megan Davies, Jessica Hall, Christian Plumb, Jonathan Stempel and Dan Wilchins, and Jonn Poirier in Washington)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co has agreed to acquire the deposits of struggling savings and loan Washington Mutual Inc in a government-brokered deal, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.
    Earlier, JPMorgan, the third-largest U.S. bank, said it would hold an investor conference call later on Thursday night but did not say why it was doing so.
    JPMorgan officials were not immediately available for comment.
    Wamu shares, which plunged 25 percent in the main session, were up 5.9 percent in after-hours trading. JPMorgan shares were up 1.8 percent.

    The following is reaction from investors, industry analysts:

    NANCY BUSH, ANALYST, NAB RESEARCH, ANNANDALE, NEW JERSEY
    "It's very unsurprising. It had been speculated for a long time that JPMorgan was going to buy Washington Mutual or Wachovia, and Washington Mutual presented itself first. JPMorgan got branches from Bank of New York, and revamped them. So they've have plenty of experience in revamping retail franchises, which is what they'll be doing with these branches."
    "Washington Mutual had been teetering on the brink for quite awhile. It is surprising that it has hung on for as long as it has."

    RICK MECKLER, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK, NY
    "JPMorgan is a strong hand, they're a good operator. It probably is a good deal for them."
    "I think it's really just showing you that the problems have become not only so large but in some ways they fed on themselves -- the more distressed sales you have, the more it creates problems for other security holders."
    "I think what (Dimon) did right is he appeared to have built up the fire power to step into these situations, in terms of having the capital, in terms of having avoided some of the problems that other people had.
    "He has been a good risk manager, he has been able to reap the benefits."

    MATT MCCORMICK, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT BAHL  GAYNOR  INVESTMENT COUNSEL, INC. IN CINCINNATI, OHIO
    "Jamie Dimon is clearly feeling that he has an opportunity to grab market share, and get it at firesale prices. There will clearly be two types of banks: those that survive, and those that don't. Dimon will survive and dominate. He's becoming an acquisition machine."

    JPMorgan ended June with $1.78 trillion of assets, $722.9 billion of deposits and 3,157 branches.
    Washington Mutual ended June with $309.7 billion of assets, $181.9 billion of deposits, 2,239 branches and 43,198 employees.
    Shares of Washington Mutual plunged 80 cents to 89 cents in after-hours trading after falling 57 cents to $1.69 in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

    A transaction would follow more than a week of negotiations over the fate of Seattle-based Washington Mutual, which attracted interest from several large North American and European banks, as well as private equity firms, despite soaring mortgage losses and evaporating investor confidence.

    Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis has also been credited with helping steady Wall Street, or at least reduce damage, with his acquisitions this year of Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial Corp, the troubled mortgage lender that was once the nation's largest.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co is expected to acquire the deposits of Washington Mutual Inc, the largest U.S. savings and loan, in a government-brokered bailout, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.
    The purchase could be a major step in cleaning up a U.S. financial system littered with toxic mortgage debt.
    Acquiring the deposits could fulfill JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon's long-held goal of becoming a retail banking force in the western United States. It comes six months after JPMorgan, the No. 3 U.S. bank, agreed to acquire the failing investment bank Bear Stearns Cos at a fire-sale price. Branches would also be included in the transaction, the newspaper said.
    JPMorgan said it would hold an investor conference call at 9:15 p.m. EDT on Thursday, but it did not say why. Neither company returned calls for comment.
    The deposit acquisition is not likely to affect the roughly $45.2 billion insurance fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), which analysts expect will be tapped dozens of times in the next few years to cover bank failures.
    It also comes as Washington wrangles over the fate of a $700 billion bailout of the financial services industry, which has been battered by mortgage defaults and tight credit conditions.
    "Jamie Dimon is clearly feeling that he has an opportunity to grab market share, and get it at fire-sale prices," said Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager at Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. "He's becoming an acquisition machine."
    JPMorgan ended June with $1.78 trillion of assets, $722.9 billion of deposits and 3,157 branches.
    Washington Mutual ended June with $309.7 billion of assets, $181.9 billion of deposits, 2,239 branches and 43,198 employees.
    Shares of Washington Mutual plunged 80 cents to 89 cents in after-hours trading after falling 57 cents to $1.69 in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

    NEGOTIATIONS
    A transaction would follow more than a week of negotiations over the fate of Seattle-based Washington Mutual, which attracted interest from several large North American and European banks, as well as private equity firms, despite soaring mortgage losses and evaporating investor confidence.
    It also appears to be a costly defeat for David Bonderman and his private equity firm TPG Inc, which in April invested $2 billion in Washington Mutual as part of a $7 billion capital-raising by the thrift. TPG was not available for comment.
    Washington Mutual's $227 billion book of real estate loans, more than half of which comes from home equity loans, and adjustable-rate and subprime mortgages now considered risky, ensconced the thrift on the critical list of financial institutions needing help, analysts said.
    Its fate appeared to grow more precarious after problems with mortgage-related debt led to last week's bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and the near demise of insurance company American International Group Inc.
    The addition of Washington Mutual would make JPMorgan close in size to Citigroup Inc, now the largest U.S. bank by assets. It would trail Bank of America Corp assuming that bank, which now ranks second in assets, completes its planned purchase of Merrill Lynch  Co.
    Once something of a golden child at Citigroup Inc before Sanford "Sandy" Weill engineered his ouster in 1998, Dimon has been carving for himself something of a role as a Wall Street savior.
    Some historians see parallels with the legendary financier John Pierpont Morgan, who ran J.P. Morgan  Co and was credited with intervening to end a banking panic in 1907.
    Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis has also been credited with helping steady Wall Street, or at least reduce damage, with his acquisitions this year of Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial Corp, the troubled mortgage lender that was once the nation's largest.

    HARD-HIT
    It was not immediately clear how much of Washington Mutual's loans might have been eligible for the bailout. The thrift has a significant presence in California and Florida, two of the states hardest hit by the nation's housing crisis. It also has a significant presence in the New York City area.
    The thrift had long been expected to sell itself after amassing $6.3 billion of losses in the previous three quarters. It had also projected $19 billion of mortgage losses through 2011, but many analysts said that was too low.
    Washington Mutual earlier this month ousted Chief Executive Kerry Killinger, who spearheaded the thrift's growth as well as its expansion in subprime and other risky mortgages, and replaced him with Alan Fishman, the former chief executive of Brooklyn, New York's Independence Community Bank Corp.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co has agreed to acquire the deposits of struggling savings and loan Washington Mutual Inc in a government-brokered deal, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.
    Earlier, JPMorgan, the third-largest U.S. bank, said it would hold an investor conference call later on Thursday night but did not say why it was doing so.
    JPMorgan officials were not immediately available for comment.
    Wamu shares, which plunged 25 percent in the main session, were up 5.9 percent in after-hours trading. JPMorgan shares were up 1.8 percent.

    The following is reaction from investors, industry analysts:

    NANCY BUSH, ANALYST, NAB RESEARCH, ANNANDALE, NEW JERSEY
    "It's very unsurprising. It had been speculated for a long time that JPMorgan was going to buy Washington Mutual or Wachovia, and Washington Mutual presented itself first. JPMorgan got branches from Bank of New York, and revamped them. So they've have plenty of experience in revamping retail franchises, which is what they'll be doing with these branches."
    "Washington Mutual had been teetering on the brink for quite awhile. It is surprising that it has hung on for as long as it has."

    RICK MECKLER, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK, NY
    "JPMorgan is a strong hand, they're a good operator. It probably is a good deal for them."
    "I think it's really just showing you that the problems have become not only so large but in some ways they fed on themselves -- the more distressed sales you have, the more it creates problems for other security holders."
    "I think what (Dimon) did right is he appeared to have built up the fire power to step into these situations, in terms of having the capital, in terms of having avoided some of the problems that other people had.
    "He has been a good risk manager, he has been able to reap the benefits."

    MATT MCCORMICK, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT BAHL  GAYNOR INVESTMENT COUNSEL, INC. IN CINCINNATI, OHIO
    "Jamie Dimon is clearly feeling that he has an opportunity to grab market share, and get it at firesale prices. There will clearly be two types of banks: those that survive, and those that don't. Dimon will survive and dominate. He's becoming an acquisition machine."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) plans to offer services
to phones powered by Google Inc's (GOOG.O) Android including
alerts when your credit card has been used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The credit card network also said in October, No. 1 mobile
phone maker Nokia (NOK1V.HE) would start selling the 6212
phone, which users could wave at an electronic reader to make
payments and use for remote payments and money transfers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said it was still developing its application to allow
in-store "contactless" payments by cell phone for Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it said these services --- already common in countries
such as Japan -- may not take off for years here as U.S. stores
would need to install new card readers and cell phones with the
corresponding technology would need to be in wider use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the meantime, Visa said on Thursday that it would  offer
transaction alerts and discount offers from merchants to
Android users. The application will also work with Google maps
and location technology to help users find nearby cash machines
and stores where special offers are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said that for the first few months, the application
will be available just to Android phone users who also have
Visa cards issued by JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) banks. It plans to
open the application to other banks in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, Google unveiled the first
Android-powered phone, which HTC Corp (2498.TW) is making and
Deutsche Telekom's (DTEGn.DE) T-Mobile [TMOG.UL] unit is
selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the initial Android device does not include hardware to
support contactless credit card payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim Attinger, Visa's global head of product development,
said that while mobile payment services have been slow to take
off, the company sees mobile phones as key to adding new
customers. Only 1.6 billion Visa cards are in use today,
compared with more than 3 billion people with cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're absolutely going to start porting financial services
into those," Attinger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Sinead Carew and Juan Lagorio; Editing by

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
This is an update to a message issued earlier today. It replaces
that message.

   Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to Microsoft
Corporation (Microsoft):

   --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA+';

   --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'AA+';

   --Senior unsecured debt at 'AA+';

   --Short-term IDR of 'F1+';

   --$2 billion commercial paper (CP) program at 'F1+'

   The Rating Outlook is Stable.

   The ratings and Outlook are supported by Microsoft's: i) leading
market share in all of its core software segments, ii) superior
balance sheet with exceptional financial flexibility, particularly for
acquisitions; iii) industry-leading liquidity supported by a
considerable cash position and consistent free cash flow; and iv)
unparalleled financial performance and operating profile, complemented
by a sizable recurring revenue base. Over the intermediate term, Fitch
believes there are no significant competitive threats that could
materially affect the company's leading market share position in its
core operating systems businesses.

   As of June 30, 2008, Microsoft's total liquidity was strong at
$23.7 billion of cash and investments, consisting of approximately
$10.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and $13.3 billion of
short-term investments, which are invested in highly liquid,
fixed-income securities. Fitch believes a significant portion of
Microsoft's cash flow is generated outside the U.S. and will represent
an increasing percentage of the total cash position due to stronger
growth in international markets and continued funding of share
repurchases and dividends with U.S.-based cash. The company also has
$6.5 billion of long-term investments, consisting of primarily public
and highly liquid equity securities. Liquidity is further supported by
Microsoft's industry-leading annual free cash flow of approximately
$12 billion-$14 billion and a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility
maturing March 22, 2009 that serves as a back-up to the CP program.
Fitch anticipates that free cash flow will continue to be utilized
primarily for share repurchases and acquisitions. Microsoft has
authority to repurchase $40 billion of shares prior to its expiration
on Sept. 30, 2013. Fitch gains further confidence in Microsoft's
liquidity profile from the company's historical practice to maintain a
significant net cash position.

   As of June 30, 2008, Microsoft had negligible outstanding debt as
the company has historically relied on its free cash flow to fund
share repurchases, cash dividends and modest acquisition activity.
However, similar to other large technology companies with significant
operations and cash balances overseas, Fitch expects Microsoft may
issue long-term debt in the near term to replenish its U.S.-based cash
balances in order to continue funding stock repurchases, cash
dividends, or acquisitions without repatriating offshore cash subject
to incremental taxes. The company's board of directors has authorized
debt financings of up to $6 billion. Fitch believes the company has
financial flexibility to issue significantly more debt over the
intermediate term, particularly to deal with cash location issues, as
the company maintains its net cash position commitment.

   Over the past several years, Microsoft has continually exhibited
strong top-line growth and superior profitability. Since fiscal year
2002, annual revenue growth has increased in the mid-teens percent
range, resulting in a six-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of
13.4%. Additionally, profitability remains robust, with EBITDA margins
in the mid 40% range (excluding legal charges), and the company
converts over 20% of its revenue into free cash flow. Microsoft's
best-in-class operating and financial performance is driven largely by
its leading position in the consumer, small business and enterprise
computing markets, led by its Windows and Vista operating systems for
personal computers (PCs - approximately 90% market share) and servers
(approximately 70% market share).

   Although Fitch believes the company has no near term competitive
or financial risks, longer-term rating concerns consist of: i) new
software models that could challenge Microsoft's highly profitable
license model, including open-source software, software as a service
(SaaS) or advertising-supported software; ii) gross margin pressures
attributable to investments in and stronger growth of emerging markets
subject to lower average selling prices (ASP); iii) substantially
lower operating margins for the two non-software business segments,
which represent approximately 20% of total revenues; and iv) further
legal and/or regulatory actions that could impede the company's course
of business. Fitch expects higher international growth and the ongoing
expansion into adjacent businesses will continue to pressure the
company's margins, but are unlikely to materially affect the company's
free cash flow.

   Despite the superior financial and operating profile, the
company's strong margins have compressed moderately in recent years
due to pricing pressures from higher-growth overseas markets and the
growth of lower-margin online and entertainment segments, which in
aggregate account for 20% of total revenue and are significantly less
profitable than the core software licensing divisions. Emerging
markets are approximately 14% of total revenues and growing 35%
annually (compared to 10%-15% for mature markets), driven mostly by
solid demand for PCs. These markets are characterized by lower price
points and thus the growth may negatively affect operating margins.
This is exacerbated by piracy, which, while adversely affecting U.S.
revenue, has a more significant impact on revenue from outside the
U.S., particularly in countries where laws are less protective of
intellectual property rights.

   Over the past decade Microsoft has been subject to various
lawsuits alleging monopolistic practices and unfair competition,
largely due to the ubiquity of its operating systems and the company's
decision to include additional software, primarily Internet Explorer,
with the core operating system. While the settlements and fees that
Microsoft paid in relation to these legal issues were large, Fitch
views them as manageable considering the company's significant free
cash flow. The company was able to achieve solid revenue and profit
growth during this time and Fitch believes future legal and regulatory
interference will not have meaningful financial impact.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to Microsoft
Corporation (Microsoft):

   --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA+';

   --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'AA+';

   --Senior unsecured debt at 'AA+';

   --Short-term IDR of 'F1+';

   --$2 billion commercial paper (CP) program at 'F1+'

   The Rating Outlook is Stable.

   The ratings and Outlook are supported by Microsoft's: i) leading
market share in all of its core software segments, ii) superior
balance sheet with exceptional financial flexibility, particularly for
acquisitions; iii) industry-leading liquidity supported by a
considerable cash position and consistent free cash flow; and iv)
unparalleled financial performance and operating profile, complemented
by a sizable recurring revenue base. Over the intermediate term, Fitch
believes there are no significant competitive threats that could
materially affect the company's dominant market share position in its
core operating systems businesses.

   As of June 30, 2008, Microsoft's total liquidity was strong at
$23.7 billion of cash and investments, consisting of approximately
$10.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and $13.3 billion of
short-term investments, which are invested in highly liquid,
fixed-income securities. Fitch believes a significant portion of
Microsoft's cash flow is generated outside the U.S. and will represent
an increasing percentage of the total cash position due to stronger
growth in international markets and continued funding of share
repurchases and dividends with U.S.-based cash. The company also has
$6.5 billion of long-term investments, consisting of primarily public
and highly liquid equity securities. Liquidity is further supported by
Microsoft's industry-leading annual free cash flow of approximately
$12 billion-$14 billion and a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility
maturing March 22, 2009 that serves as a back-up to the CP program.
Fitch anticipates that free cash flow will continue to be utilized
primarily for share repurchases and acquisitions. Microsoft has
authority to repurchase $40 billion of shares prior to its expiration
on Sept. 30, 2013. Fitch gains further confidence in Microsoft's
liquidity profile from the company's historical practice to maintain a
significant net cash position.

   As of June 30, 2008, Microsoft had negligible outstanding debt as
the company has historically relied on its free cash flow to fund
share repurchases, cash dividends and modest acquisition activity.
However, similar to other large technology companies with significant
operations and cash balances overseas, Fitch expects Microsoft may
issue long-term debt in the near term to replenish its U.S.-based cash
balances in order to continue funding stock repurchases, cash
dividends, or acquisitions without repatriating offshore cash subject
to incremental taxes. The company's board of directors has authorized
debt financings of up to $6 billion. Fitch believes the company has
financial flexibility to issue significantly more debt over the
intermediate term, particularly to deal with cash location issues, as
the company maintains its net cash position commitment.

   Over the past several years, Microsoft has continually exhibited
strong top-line growth and superior profitability. Since fiscal year
2002, annual revenue growth has increased in the mid-teens percent
range, resulting in a six-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of
13.4%. Additionally, profitability remains robust, with EBITDA margins
in the mid 40% range (excluding legal charges), and the company
converts over 20% of its revenue into free cash flow. Microsoft's
best-in-class operating and financial performance is driven largely by
its leading position in the consumer, small business and enterprise
computing markets, led by its Windows and Vista operating systems for
personal computers (PCs - approximately 90% market share) and servers
(approximately 70% market share).

   Although Fitch believes the company has no near term competitive
or financial risks, longer-term rating concerns consist of: i) new
software models that could challenge Microsoft's highly profitable
license model, including open-source software, software as a service
(SaaS) or advertising-supported software; ii) gross margin pressures
attributable to investments in and stronger growth of emerging markets
subject to lower average selling prices (ASP); iii) substantially
lower operating margins for the two non-software business segments,
which represent approximately 20% of total revenues; and iv) further
legal and/or regulatory actions that could impede the company's course
of business. Fitch expects higher international growth and the ongoing
expansion into adjacent businesses will continue to pressure the
company's margins, but are unlikely to materially affect the company's
free cash flow.

   Despite the superior financial and operating profile, the
company's strong margins have compressed moderately in recent years

growth of lower-margin online and entertainment segments, which in
aggregate account for 20% of total revenue and are significantly less

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Buying $1 trillion of
delinquent home loans at steep discounts would be a more direct
way to break home price declines and rising foreclosures than
the U.S. Treasury's proposal to soak up troubled securities,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Government purchases of bad loans could buoy home prices
and unfreeze capital markets at the lowest possible cost to
taxpayers, the analysts, led by Dale Westhoff, wrote in a
research note published on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Illiquid mortgage securities are currently priced to the
worst-case scenarios of home price declines and defaults
because "nothing has occurred to suggest an end to the
self-perpetuating cycle," the analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The key for a self-reinforcing program "is to implement it
at the loan level with a single objective: to establish a floor
on collateral pricing," they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An entity similar to the Resolution Trust Corp. could buy
loans at 60 percent of their unpaid principal balance, giving
itself the ability to modify mortgages to affordable terms.
Capital markets could restructure existing mortgage bonds to
create securities, backed by the 60 percent balance, that are
government-guaranteed for a period, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "super senior" securities would sell at yields only
slightly higher than "agency" mortgage-backed securities issued
by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Addressing home prices is critical amid expectations for an
additional 5.5 million foreclosures over the next five years,
on top of about 2 million already in or through the process,
they said. Outside of loans in U.S. mortgage programs, the
government would buy some $1.05 trillion in loans for a price
of $630 billion over five years, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total losses on liquidated mortgages average less than 40
percent, so the program should be self-funding, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan should be pursued independently of decisions to
participate in the purchase or sale of securities backed by the
loans, they said. Lawmakers on Thursday were close to agreement
on a massive $700 billion plan to buy illiquid mortgage assets
in a bid to stabilize financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The new program will put the government at the throttle of
foreclosure supply, ending the destructive distressed selling
that has been wreaking havoc" on home prices," they said.

&lt;p&gt;Grant Supports a National System of Community Trails
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Foundation today announced a $300,000 grant to the
Rails-to-Trails Conservancy (RTC) to create a nationwide network of
walking and biking trails using former rail lines that will support
more than 1.9 million people in the Washington DC, Chicago, New York
City, Los Angeles and New Orleans communities.

   This grant builds upon previous funding support from the Company,
which expanded trails in numerous other communities, including the
Silver Comet Trail in Georgia and the Chief Ladiga Trail in Alabama.
The Georgia-Alabama trails will be commemorated Saturday, September
27, 2008, when they are joined to become the longest paved trail in
the United States.

   "Coca-Cola is committed to helping ensure the vitality of our
communities," said Ingrid Saunders Jones, chair of The Coca-Cola
Foundation. "This grant is an expression of our commitment to the
Rails-to-Trails Conservancy's goal of creating trails that place 90
percent of Americans within three miles of a safe and healthy
community trail system."

   Through the awarding of the $300,000 grant, the RTC will provide
expertise and pass-through grants to several trail organizations,
specifically:

   --  Five grants totaling $50,000 for community grants supporting
        the operations of trail organizations in Washington, DC;
        Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, and New Orleans;

   --  Three grants totaling $150,000 for specific rail-to-trail
        development, expansion and enhancement projects in Washington,
        DC (including the Metropolitan Branch Trail), Chicago and New
        York City.

   --  Additionally, $100,000 will support RTC's technical
        initiative, which includes the Mapping Initiative and
        Guidebook Series, which provides the public with information
        on the nation's trail systems.

   "Creating healthier places for healthier people requires the
support of concerned corporate citizens, like Coca-Cola," said Keith
Laughlin, Rails-to-Trails Conservancy president. "We have already seen
great successes with trail connections across the nation and cannot
wait to see what wonderful things this next grant will do for
America's rail-trail network."

   In 2005, Coca-Cola donated $500,000 to the RTC to develop and
expand trails across the country, like the Silver Comet and Chief
Ladiga trails. Funding from Coca-Cola helped build the Gateway Park
where the two trails connect at the Georgia-Alabama state line.
Coca-Cola also supported Dasani brand's "Blue Bikes" program that
provided bicycle fleets to local trail organizations so that Americans
could enjoy the benefits of an active lifestyle.

   Globally, The Coca-Cola Company is a leader in sustainability
efforts in the areas of water stewardship, packaging, energy and
climate protection. As part of its community sustainability and
healthy, active lifestyle initiatives, the Company announced in
January 2008 a $2 million donation to Atlanta's BeltLine Partnership,
which -- once completed -- will connect Atlanta communities by
creating greenspace, trails, transit, and new development along 22
miles of historic rail segments that encircle the City of Atlanta's
urban core. In addition, the Company has provided $3.5 million in
support to the National Parks Foundation for use in enhancing and
maintaining trails in national parks across the United States.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
came under sharp criticism from a U.S. judge on Thursday for
being slow to produce technical documents it is required to
give software makers as part of a 2002 antitrust settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; At a hearing to discuss Microsoft's progress in complying
with the settlement, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly
scolded Microsoft for writing in a report that what it had
already produced "fully complies with the final judgments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She disagreed, and insisted that the company work more
quickly to produce the systems documents that software makers
need to write applications for the Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The systems documents, as far as I'm concerned, are
required," Kollar-Kotelly told the Microsoft team, adding that
she wanted to see court oversight of Microsoft ended on
schedule on Nov. 12, 2009. "That's not going to happen unless
these things get done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The issue was part of discussions at a hearing held to
review Microsoft's compliance with the pact that settled
findings the company had abused its dominance in personal
computer operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft was required to issue licenses for companies who
want to write programs for the Windows computer operating
system, and provide technical information about Windows to help
make the programs work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The next hearing is set for Jan. 28.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) plans to offer services to phones powered by Google Inc's (GOOG.O) Android including alerts when your credit card has been used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The credit card network also said in October, No. 1 mobile phone maker Nokia (NOK1V.HE) would start selling the 6212 phone, which users could wave at an electronic reader to make payments and use for remote payments and money transfers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said it was still developing its application to allow in-store "contactless" payments by cell phone for Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it said these services --- already common in countries such as Japan -- may not take off for years here as U.S. stores would need to install new card readers and cell phones with the corresponding technology would need to be in wider use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Visa said on Thursday that it would offer transaction alerts and discount offers from merchants to Android users.

&lt;p&gt;SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(Business Wire)--
American Traffic Solutions ("ATS") announced today that Goldman
Sachs has become its first institutional investor. Goldman Sachs was
invited to invest in ATS as a minority shareholder to support the
explosive growth in the company's photo traffic safety enforcement and
electronic toll payment businesses, according to Jim Tuton, president
and CEO of ATS. ATS is the largest independent, privately held company
providing photo traffic enforcement services in North America. The
company's 2007-08 quarterly compound revenue growth rate exceeded 80
percent.

   Terms of the sale were not disclosed, but Tuton reported that
Goldman Sachs will be represented on ATS' board of directors.

   Jim Tuton founded the American photo traffic enforcement industry
in 1987 when he introduced "photo radar" to the small community of
Paradise Valley, Arizona, in the Phoenix area. Photo traffic
enforcement is now used in approximately 300 communities in 25
American states and the District of Columbia. ATS currently serves
more than 125 municipalities in 18 states, the District of Columbia
and the Province of Alberta, Canada. New York City, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C., Houston, Fort Worth, Phoenix, St. Louis, Seattle and
San Diego are all ATS customers.

   Budget-constrained communities across the country are turning to
photo safety enforcement because it improves public safety at no cost
to the local police departments, explained Tuton. According to a 2007
study by the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety (www.iihs.org),
red-light cameras reduced violations by as much as 96 percent in
Philadelphia. St. Louis experienced a 49 percent decrease in
violations. And from 1994-2005, red-light-running violations decreased
73 percent in New York City.

   "Cash-strapped cities are finding it more and more difficult to
deploy adequate police resources to fight serious crime," said Tuton.
"Our cameras handle the routine traffic enforcement duties so officers
can spend more time in their communities. We help cities improve
public safety by providing solutions that also generate needed revenue
by shifting the financial burden from the taxpayers to the violators."

   "Goldman Sachs was attracted to the industry and then identified
ATS as a leader with tremendous growth potential, an exemplary track
record and a high-quality management team," said Raheel Zia, vice
president in the principal investment area at Goldman Sachs. "ATS has
been at the forefront of the photo traffic safety enforcement industry
with the company's speed and red-light camera programs. The company's
worldwide expansion into electronic toll collection and
transportation-related commercial services present attractive growth
opportunities."

   "We have grown ATS from a small, single-client company in 1987 to
a company with more than 125 customers," explained Tuton. "We have
been profitable every year since we started the business. This was
accomplished with a national team of 425 employees and managers and
without any private equity investment." Tuton noted that the company's
client base grew by nearly 100 percent in 2007.

   "Our relationship with Goldman Sachs will provide a strong
platform and access to capital resources that will enable ATS to
continue on our amazing growth trajectory," Tuton continued. "Goldman
Sachs is one of the largest and most prestigious investment companies
in the world. They are a terrific fit for ATS because they share our
culture and mission of serving state and local governments with needed
operational and financial services."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background) WASHINGTON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - The United States has suspended consular services, such as issuing visas, in Pakistan in response to a worsening security situation there, the State Department said on Thursday. I think we are taking the steps in response to the security environment in Pakistan, State Department spokesman Robert Wood said. A State Department official said that there had been a number of threats against American interests in the country but did not elaborate. There's a lot of chatter going on and we're obviously very worried about it, he said. Security has deteriorated alarmingly in Pakistan over recent months, with the military attacking al Qaeda and Taliban strongholds in the northwest, while the militants have responded with a string of bomb attacks. A previously unknown group that claimed responsibility for a suicide truck bomb attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad last Saturday that killed 54 people said the Pakistani government should stop cooperating with the United States. Wood said there was no connection between the suspension of U.S. consular services on Thursday and an incident on Thursday in which the Pentagon said U.S. helicopters in Afghanistan were fired on from a Pakistani military checkpoint along the border. We just had the attack on the Marriott Hotel ... it's of great concern, Wood told reporters. Therefore we have to look at our security posture and take those measures that we think are necessary. I don't want to get into the details as to what kind of security threats we are facing out there, Wood said. He said the suspension of consular services was temporary, and that emergency services for American citizens in Pakistan would continue. In addition to its embassy in Islamabad, the United States has consulates in Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar. (Editing by Philip Barbara)

&lt;p&gt;  EAST FISHKILL, NY, Sep 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced today that a Power Systems server demonstrated
nearly four times the performance per processor core of an HP ProLiant
server.(1)

    According to a recent Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC-C)
benchmark result, the IBM Power(TM) 570 server with POWER6 processor
technology and AIX(R), the IBM version of UNIX(R) operating system,
performed 3.8-times faster than the HP ProLiant MODEL running the new
Intel Dunnington processor and Microsoft Windows(R) Server 2003
Enterprise x64 Edition.

    The new comparisons were disclosed today at an IBM Power Systems Customer
Council meeting in East Fishkill, N.Y., the home of IBM's state-of-the-art
300mm semiconductor manufacturing and development facility.

    IBM claimed additional benchmark leadership with a SPECjbb2005 benchmark
result, which evaluates the performance of servers running typical
Java(TM) business applications. The POWER6 processor-based IBM Power 570
running AIX bested the Dell PowerEdge900, the Sun X4450 and the Fujitsu
Primergy RX600, all running Dunnington, by 2.2 times per processor
core.(2)

    Per-core performance is even more important for customers running database
or other software workloads that use per-core pricing when determining
total solution cost. Less cores for the same performance can translate to
significant and direct savings in licensing and ongoing annual software
maintenance costs.

    "Our Power Systems are an excellent example of how the hardware, software
and microprocessor are all integrated together to produce maximum results
for our clients," said Scott Handy, vice president of worldwide marketing
and strategy, IBM Power Systems. "The performance of POWER6 processors,
combined with PowerVM virtualization and the newly-announced Systems
Director 6.1 management for IBM Power Systems, help businesses increase
efficiency while reducing operating costs and energy consumption in the
data center. HP, Sun and Dell all like to claim leadership, but the fact
remains that even while our competitors are using some of the latest Intel
processors, the comparisons to the IBM POWER6 processor come up short."

    IBM Power Systems claim leadership in more than 70 key computing
performance benchmarks. For more details, please visit

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) plans to offer alerts, special offers, and ATM and merchant location services in a software application for phones powered by Google Inc's (GOOG.O) Android system by year-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The credit card company also said that in October, No. 1 mobile phone maker Nokia (NOK1V.HE) would start selling the 6212 phone, which users could wave at an electronic reader to make payments and use for remote payments and money transfers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said it was still developing its application to allow in-store "contactless" payments by cell phone for Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it said these services --- already common in countries such as Japan -- may not take off for years here as U.S. stores would need to install new card readers and cell phones with the corresponding technology would need to be in wider use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Visa said on Thursday that it would start by offering transaction alerts and special offers from merchants to Android users. The application will work with Google maps and location technology to help users find nearby cash machines and stores where special offers are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said that for the first few months, the application will be available just to Android phone users who also have Visa cards issued by JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) banks. It plans to open the application to other banks in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Google unveiled the first Android-powered phone, which HTC Corp (2498.TW) is making and Deutsche Telekom's (DTEGn.DE) T-Mobile TMOG.UL unit is selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the initial Android device does not include hardware to support contactless credit card payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Attinger, Visa's global head of product development, said that while mobile payment services have been slow to take off, the company sees mobile phones as key to adding new customers. Only 1.6 billion Visa cards are in use today, compared with more than 3 billion people with cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're absolutely going to start porting financial services into those," Attinger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sinead Carew and Juan Lagorio; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Restoring Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) 348,500 barrel per day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery to full production from Hurricane Ike will take weeks if not months, according to sources familiar with an assessment of extensive water damage still under way at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;

The Murphy refinery was back in production 10-1/2 months after the storm roared ashore on August 25, 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon spokesman Kevin Allexon said the refinery's cogeneration unit was producing electric power for the refinery and to the local utility for use by residents in Beaumont.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on initial engineering assessments, damage to the Beaumont Refinery, although extensive, does not appear to be severe," Allexon said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As steam and power become available, the refinery's utility system is being gradually and systematically re-established," he said.

&lt;p&gt;Payment Leader Unveils Applications for Android Powered Mobile
Handsets, Readies First U.S. Trial of Mobile Money Transfer
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) today hosted an innovation briefing in New
York, during which the company showcased advances in electronic
payments that are creating a future of "better money" that is more
convenient, more reliable and more secure than cash or checks.

   The payments industry leader was joined by a number of prominent
innovators including Google, Intel, Nokia and Singapore Post Ltd., who
are each expanding the benefits of electronic financial services to
consumers in new and emerging marketplaces.

   The Visa-powered innovations discussed and demonstrated at the
briefing recognize several overall trends in the payments industry,
including the convergence of electronic payments and mobile phones;
the expansion of electronic payments into new acceptance locations
including transit and vending machines; and the importance of
extending electronic payments to the millions of "unbanked" and
"underbanked" consumers around the world.

   "For decades Visa has been changing the way people think about and
use money with great success, but there is still tremendous
opportunity to extend the benefits of electronic payments to consumers
and business around the world," said Bill Sheedy, President, North
America, Visa Inc. and host of the briefing. "Capturing that
opportunity requires innovative products and ideas that deliver
measureable benefits to meet the needs of consumers, merchants and
financial institutions. Along with our partners, that's what Visa has
shown today, and continues to develop every day."

   The event was highlighted by four major announcements of
innovative advances in electronic payments and services:

   --  Visa Applications for Android: Visa announced it is developing
        a suite of mobile applications for the Android(TM) platform,
        which will be available for download on Android-powered
        handsets and initially available to Chase Visa cardholders.
        The services will allow Visa cardholders to receive
        notifications to their mobile devices about transaction
        activity on their accounts; obtain offers from a wide array of
        merchants; and use the built-in location-based technology
        developed by Google to quickly map nearby merchants where they
        can redeem Visa offers and locate ATMs that accept Visa. In
        addition, Visa is also developing a payment application that
        will enable consumers with Visa accounts to make mobile
        payments in retail locations nationwide, or while on the go,
        over wireless networks.

   --  Visa - Nokia Collaborating on Next Generation Handset: Visa
        and Nokia (NYSE:NOK), the world's largest mobile handset
        manufacturer, announced plans today to deliver Visa payment
        and related services for Nokia's next generation Near-Field
        Communications (NFC) handsets beginning with the 6212 Classic,
        which is expected to be available in October 2009. The Visa
        applications will first be made available for trial use by
        interested financial institutions. Trials will allow consumers
        with the 6212 and a relationship with a participating Visa
        issuing bank to use their handsets for a variety of payment
        and related services, including remote payments, money
        transfer, and alerts and notifications.

   --  Launch of U.S. Mobile Money Transfer Pilot: Visa and U.S.
        Bancorp (NYSE: USB) today announced the launch of a mobile
        money transfer pilot program to allow participating Visa
        cardholders to use their mobile phones and PDAs to securely
        send funds directly to another Visa cardholder. The first
        phase of the program, which is expected to launch by the end
        of this year, will enable domestic money transfers within the
        U.S. and will involve key Visa issuers, led by U.S. Bank and
        as many as 6,000 Visa account holders.

   --  Expansion of Visa's Prepaid Services: Visa also announced the
        expansion of Visa ReadyLink, its prepaid reload service, to
        enable the reload of eligible Visa prepaid products at ATMs
        across the U.S. Visa ReadyLink gives consumers a secure and
        convenient way to purchase and add funds to Visa reloadable
        prepaid cards, a significant advantage to financially
        "underserved" consumers - those without a traditional banking
        relationship or access to a payment card. Visa estimates there
        are more than 80 million financially underserved consumers in
        the U.S.

   Visa also reported that it has completed stress-testing and
optimization of VisaNet, its proprietary, centralized processing
system, to ensure adequate capacity for the upcoming holiday shopping
season. VisaNet stands ready to process 11,000 transaction messages
per second, a rate 45 percent above the 7,387 transaction messages per
second sustained during Visa's peak processing hour last year on
December 22.

   In addition, Visa is preparing for its second annual fall upgrade
to its processing systems, a massive undertaking that involves the
modification of nearly 5 million lines of code that effect 50,000
systems changes in multiple Visa data centers around the globe.

   Visa and its partners displayed a number of payment innovations
that are creating the future of money. Demonstrations included a
variety of transactions using Visa payWave, Visa's next generation
contactless chip technology: paying a fare at a transit turnstile,
buying products in vending machines, and completing a purchase quickly
at point-of-sale terminals. Using the new Nokia 6212 NFC-enabled
handset, Visa demonstrated mobile payment services such as mobile
offers, alerts and money transfer.

   "Because thousands of financial institutions, millions of
merchants and hundreds of millions of cardholders in 170 countries
rely on Visa every day for secure, reliable and convenient payments,
we simply can not afford complacency. We must continually drive
ourselves to remain one step ahead of changing and increasing customer
demands - that's our innovation imperative," Sheedy said.

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Nigeria's senior oil workers'
union said on Thursday that U.S. oil giant Chevron (CVX.N)must
resolve outstanding labour issues before it sells its fuels
marketing business in the West African country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron said on Monday it had agreed to sell several of its
West African fuels marketers, including its downstream business
in Nigeria, to Corlay Global SA as part of its effort to shrink
its marketing operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Babatunde Ogun, president of the PENGASSAN union, said his
members were in negotiations with Chevron over payments to
Nigerian workers ahead of the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They cannot sell Chevron downstream without completing
labour issues," Ogun told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They cannot make that sort of money without paying some
money to those who have worked and laboured to build that
company's image, because they are not sure they are going to
keep their jobs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ogun said negotiations were ongoing and that there was no
immediate threat of any industrial action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For full Reuters Africa coverage and to have your say on the

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, share price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said its
consortium in Kazakhstan reached full production at the Tengiz
field, which will increase its oil output capacity to 540,000
barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest increase at Tengizchevroil LLP's site comes after
the consortium boosted capacity at the Tengiz field earlier this
year to 400,000 barrels per day from about 310,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has a 50 percent stake in Tengizchevroil, while
state-run KazMunaiGas owns 20 percent, ExxonMobil Kazahkstan
Ventures Inc (XOM.N) 25 percent and LUKArco 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the expansion project, the companies reinject a portion
of the sour gas produced at the site back into the reservoir at
very high pressure to help preserve the pressure in the
reservoir, stabilizing production and prolonging its output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has previously said expansions of the sour gas
injection and a second generation plant at Tengiz would cost the
consortium about $7.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Chevron were up 1.8 percent to $86.79 per share on
the New York Stock Exchange, in line with the gain in the broader
Standard  Poor's Energy index .GSPE.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 25 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its price target on
Boeing Co (BA.N) shares to $56 from $60, saying the aircraft
maker's customers could have difficulty financing purchases,
given a challenging credit environment following the recent
financial market fallout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that the amount of funding from traditional
aircraft financing sources is shrinking and that Boeing's
customers may face near-term challenges financing aircraft
purchases," Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boeing will have to either provide the financing to its
airline customers or face delays in planned 2009 deliveries,
Goldman said, adding that the current credit crisis is likely
to translate into higher funding costs for the aircraft maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Boeing would not have to meaningfully reduce its
2009 delivery target as it is overbooked by about 10 percent
for the year, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman maintained its "sell" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Boeing were up 65 cents at $58.01 in morning
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Unique Program Offers Multiple Options for Accumulation and
                         Redemption of Points
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Global Aviation today launched a rewards program unlike
any other in the business and general aviation markets. The new
FlyBuys(TM) reward program (www.FlyBuysRewardsProgram.com) targets
business and general aviation pilots as well as business aviation
flight departments. FlyBuys participants - individuals or
organizations - will be able to earn points based on purchases of jet
fuel and aviation gasoline at participating Chevron and Texaco FBOs
around the country. Extra points can be earned if the FlyBuys card is
used in conjunction with a Chevron Alliance Program card. Once
accumulated, FlyBuys points can be redeemed for Chevron or Texaco gift
cards or universal gift certificates at www.giftcertificates.com.

   "Unlike traditional reward programs in the business and general
aviation markets, FlyBuys will offer participants a much greater level
of flexibility--both in who can participate and what reward-types are
available," said Bob Taylor, manager, Branded Programs, Chevron Global
Aviation. "Business jet operators can now use the points as they see
fit. This program is unique in that participating members can be
either individuals such as pilots or flight crew members, or flight
departments, where points can be pooled and managed across the
organization. That's quite a departure from traditional programs. And,
rather than having a limited number of redemption options, FlyBuys
points can be converted to gift certificates that can be used at major
retailers across the country. Points can also be converted into
Chevron or Texaco gift cards which can be used to purchase fuel,
snacks or services at over 10,000 Chevron or Texaco branded stations
in the United States. Whether you are a pilot or a business aviation
organization FlyBuys is a very attractive offer and just another way
for us to say thank you to our loyal customers."

   Chevron will begin signing up of pilots and flight departments at
this year's National Business Aviation Association's (NBAA) conference
which will be held in Orlando, Florida from October 6 to 8. The
program is free to participants. Those that sign up during NBAA will
receive 2,000 points - enough for a $25 Chevron or Texaco gift card -
after the first use of their FlyBuys card. Individuals and
organizations interested in participating in the FlyBuys Reward
program are encouraged to stop by Chevron's booth (# 1200) during the
show.

   For more information on the FlyBuys program, or to register, go to
www.FlyBuysRewardsProgram.com. Once registered, participants will be
able to view and manage their account online. Participants will be
able to start accumulating points beginning January 1, 2009 at
participating FBOs.

   The Chevron Alliance Program offers a one-card purchasing solution
for corporate flight departments and aircraft operators throughout the
United States. The Alliance program streamlines all related aviation
purchases and services at more than 750 Chevron and Texaco FBOs, and
offers dedicated support from our Alliance representatives.

   Chevron Global Aviation supplies jet fuel and aviation gasoline to
more than 1,000 commercial and general airports in 70 countries.
Chevron markets and sells aviation fuels to 350 commercial airports
worldwide and more than 750 general aviation airports in the United

&lt;p&gt;System Enhancement to Bring Visa Ready Link to Participating ATMs
Nationwide
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced an enhancement to its prepaid
reload network, Visa ReadyLink, which will enable consumers to add
funds to eligible Visa prepaid cards at participating automated teller
machines (ATMs) that accept envelope-free deposits across the United
States. The new service is expected to rollout later this fall.

   More than 7,000 merchant locations across the U.S. have
implemented Visa ReadyLink since it first launched in 2006. The
innovative service supports the adoption of prepaid products by
helping meet the needs of financially underserved consumers - the more
than 80 million consumers in the U.S. who lack access to a payment
card or a traditional banking relationship, and who rely heavily on
cash for everyday transactions.

   With Visa ReadyLink, consumers have an easy way to reload funds to
Visa reloadable prepaid cards - including payroll, general purpose
reloadable and government disbursement cards - at everyday merchant
locations like supermarkets and convenience stores, providing
immediate access to funds with a safer, more convenient payment
alternative to cash and checks.

   Using Visa ReadyLink at the ATM

   Today, thousands of envelope-free ATMs enable customers to
conveniently make deposits by simply inserting cash or paper checks
directly into a financial institution's ATMs. Likewise, consumers with
eligible Visa reloadable prepaid cards will be able to add cash funds
to their cards conveniently and securely in the same manner at
participating ATMs.

   "Standing in long check-cashing lines and carrying around a week's
wages in cash is often the norm for people without access to a
payments card or bank account," said Brian Triplett, Global Head of
Prepaid Products at Visa Inc. "By bringing Visa ReadyLink first to
retailers and now offering advancements to make reload capabilities
available at ATMs, we can provide a much safer and easier alternative
for cardholders. We intend to continue to use the value of Visa's
network to grow the prepaid category in ways that help our partners
capture a greater share of cash and check spend."

   Partner Benefits

   In addition to consumer benefits, the expansion of Visa ReadyLink
delivers greater value to ATM owners and financial institutions. For
ATM owners, Visa ReadyLink creates an opportunity to provide
innovative services to customers that can help drive incremental
revenue--all through an existing VisaNet connection. For financial
institutions, VisaReadyLink transactions are processed like any Visa
transaction; and as with any authorized and approved transaction,
funds are guaranteed by the ATM acquirer to the card issuer.

   Visa and its partners are investing in the growth of the prepaid
category to penetrate paper-heavy payment segments in the U.S., while
creating opportunities for Visa to grow electronic payments in
countries that still rely heavily on cash - Visa's largest global
competitor. Increasingly, consumers are turning to prepaid products
for the convenience and security they provide, while businesses and
governments are realizing cost savings and efficiencies by
distributing payroll and benefits - like unemployment and child
support funds with a Visa prepaid card instead of checks.

   Those interested in learning more about implementing Visa
ReadyLink should contact their Visa account executive. More
information about the service is also available at
www.visa.com/reloadable.

&lt;p&gt;Visa and Nokia Working Together to Deliver Payment Applications for Next Generation Mobile Devices

   Partnership Extension Capitalizes on Latest Advances in Mobile and
Payment Technologies
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), the world's largest retail electronic payments
network, and Nokia (NYSE:NOK), the world's largest mobile device
manufacturer, announced plans today to deliver Visa payment and
payment-related services - including contactless payments, remote
payments, money transfer, alerts and notifications - for Nokia's next
generation handsets beginning with the Nokia 6212 Classic, expected to
be available starting October 2008.

   The Visa applications will first be made available for trial use
by interested financial institutions and will allow consumers with the
Nokia 6212 classic and a relationship with a participating Visa
issuing bank to use their Visa account to pay for goods and services;
initiate mobile money transfers to other individuals with Visa
accounts; receive near real-time notifications of activity on their
Visa account; and "opt in" to receive offers and discounts from
merchants.

   "Mobile payments and services are one of the most vibrant areas of
innovation at Visa, as we seek to accelerate the migration from paper
forms of payment to digital money," said Tim Attinger, Head of Global
Product Innovation at Visa Inc. "Visa is already better money - more
convenient, reliable and secure than cash. Putting Visa payments and
exciting new services into the NFC-equipped Nokia 6212 classic adds
another layer of convenience and security for Visa account holders and
Nokia customers around the world."

   The Nokia 6212 classic includes integrated Near-Field
Communications chipsets (NFC) which lets the mobile device behave like
a contactless payment card, where consumers simply wave it within a
few inches of a special point of sale reader to complete a Visa
transaction. Nokia and Visa first demonstrated NFC technology in
December 2005 with the launch of the first large scale NFC trial in
the United States at the Phillips Arena in Atlanta.

   The plans announced today represent the next phase in an ongoing
effort between Visa and Nokia to make mobile payments a reality for
consumers around the globe. The long-term collaboration between Nokia
and Visa has already resulted in multiple trials of Visa mobile
payments enabled through NFC technology on four continents, including
in the United States with Wells Fargo Bank; in Malaysia with Maybank
and Maxis; in Taiwan with Chinatrust Commercial Bank and Chunghwa
Telecom; and London with Barclays Bank.

   "NFC-capable devices such as the Nokia 6212 Classic are set to
change the way mobile phone users interact with devices and services
in their surroundings," says Jeremy Belostock, the Head of Near Field
Communications, Nokia. "With our partnership with Visa, we're bringing
the value of electronic payments and services directly into the mobile
phone, making our customers' everyday lives more convenient."

&lt;p&gt;First U.S. Test of Direct Funds Transfer between Visa Accounts
Using a Mobile Device
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and U.S. Bank, lead bank of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:
USB), today announced plans to launch a mobile money transfer pilot
program to allow registered Visa cardholders in the United States to
use their mobile phones to securely send funds directly to another
registered Visa cardholder's account. The pilot, which is intended to
begin by the end of 2008, is the first U.S.-based trial testing mobile
money transfers between Visa accounts.

   Money transfer service is a key component of Visa's mobile
strategy that seeks to harness the proliferation of mobile devices by
making them multi-function payment tools. The services provided in
this U.S. trial complement what Visa already offers by way of money
transfer service to consumers in 13 countries in Europe, the Middle
East and Asia. In addition to supporting money transfers through
mobile devices, Visa enables the service through other existing
channels, including bank branches, ATMs, the Internet, and kiosks.

   "With more consumers relying on their mobile devices to simplify
their everyday lives, Visa has a significant opportunity to streamline
and secure the way people send and receive money," said Elizabeth
Buse, Global Head of Product at Visa Inc. "Through our business
network of more than 16,000 banks and 1.6 billion cards in market,
Visa can enable secure and convenient mobile money transfers, both
domestically and cross-border."

   Visa cardholders participating in this pilot will be able to
initiate money transfer transactions using a mobile web browser to
access a secure interface. The transferred funds will be credited
directly to the recipient's Visa account. The recipient can then
access the funds via a cash withdrawal at an ATM or by making a
purchase at any merchant that accepts Visa products, subject to the
recipient's bank's funds availability policies.

   The first phase of the mobile money transfer pilot program will
enable domestic money transfers within the U.S. and will involve
several Visa issuers, including U.S. Bank, and as many as 6,000 Visa
account holders. The initial pilot is intended to provide Visa and its
partners with valuable insight into consumer behavior. Based on these
learnings, a second pilot phase is expected to extend the program to
include cross-border transactions during the first half of 2009.

   "We are excited to partner with Visa to better understand how
mobile money transfer services can provide even greater convenience
and access to U.S. Bank services," says Pam Joseph, vice chairman of
payment services at U.S. Bancorp. "We see the growth of mobile
technology and increased sophistication of devices as an opportunity
to serve our customers with secure and reliable mobile financial
services."

   Powered by Visa Mobile Platform

   At the heart of the mobile money transfer service is Visa's mobile
platform, a suite of technologies that enables Visa, its clients, and
mobile operators to engage in trial activities and develop
commercially scalable mobile services. Built on years of experience in
mobile payments, Visa's platform complements the infrastructure of
mobile carriers and financial institutions, and is supported by
handset manufacturers, chip suppliers, mobile applications developers,
over-the-air (OTA) service providers and mobile messaging providers.

   "Visa innovations create better money and enable more people in
more places to enjoy the advantages of electronic payments," said
Buse. "The Visa mobile platform helps us deliver on that promise, and
enables our clients to expand their products to new channels."

&lt;p&gt;New State-of-the-Art Facilities Significantly Increase Production
                       from the Supergiant Field
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that its affiliate
Tengizchevroil LLP has completed a major expansion at the Tengiz Field
in Kazakhstan that will nearly double production capacity at one of
the world's largest oil fields.

   The completion of the expansion brings Tengizchevroil's daily
crude production capacity to 540,000 barrels. The first phase of
expansion, accomplished earlier this year, increased daily capacity
from approximately 310,000 barrels to 400,000 barrels.

   "This accomplishment demonstrates how Chevron is leading the
industry in the selection and execution of major capital projects
while providing increased value for our host countries and partners,"
said George Kirkland, executive vice president, Chevron Global
Upstream and Gas. "As world energy demand continues to grow, the
multi-billion dollar expansion of the Tengiz field brings much-needed
new oil to market."

   The Sour Gas Injection (SGI) operations and the crude processing
portion of the Second Generation Plant (SGP) have been successfully in
service for several months while the natural gas and sulfur processing
portions of SGP were being completed and commissioned. SGP's full
facilities now stabilize and sweeten crude oil, as well as separate
and process natural gas into gas products and elemental sulfur. SGI
reinjects one-third of produced sour gas into the reservoir at very
high pressures to help preserve reservoir pressure.

   "The success of this expansion is a testament to Chevron's
long-term, successful partnership with the Republic of Kazakhstan.
Chevron is committed to continuing our investment in the people,
economy and energy infrastructure of Kazakhstan," said Guy
Hollingsworth, president of Chevron Europe, Eurasia and Middle East
Exploration and Production. "The scale of this project is incredible.
SGP is the largest single-train sour gas and crude processing unit in
the world, and SGI is now returning sour gas to the reservoir at the
highest concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and highest pressures ever
accomplished."

   Chevron has a 50 percent interest in Tengizchevroil. Other
partners are KazMunaiGas, 20 percent; ExxonMobil Kazakhstan Ventures
Inc., 25 percent; and LUKArco, 5 percent.

   Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated
energy companies, with subsidiaries that conduct business across the
globe. The company's success is driven by the ingenuity and commitment
of approximately 59,000 employees who operate across the energy
spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and transports crude oil and
natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels and
other energy products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products;
generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy
efficiency solutions; and develops and commercializes the energy
resources of the future, including biofuels and other renewables.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) today announced plans to make mobile
payment-related services broadly available to United States consumers
by the end of the year. Central to this effort is Visa's delivery of
mobile applications for the Android(TM) platform, which will be
available for download on Android-powered handsets and initially
available to Chase Visa cardholders.

   The first set of services that Visa is planning to develop for
Android will allow Chase Visa cardholders to receive notifications to
their mobile devices about transaction activity on their accounts;
obtain offers from a wide array of merchants; and use the built-in
location-based technology developed by Google to quickly map nearby
merchants where they can redeem Visa offers and locate ATMs that
accept Visa.

   During an introductory period, Visa mobile services that will be
developed for the Android platform will first be offered to Chase Visa
account holders. Following this initial launch phase, Visa plans to
work with additional card-issuing financial institutions to extend
availability of its mobile services for Android to their Visa account
holders. Visa is also developing a payment application that will
enable consumers with Visa accounts to make mobile payments in retail
locations nationwide, or while on the go, over wireless networks.

   "By developing these mobile services for the Android platform,
Visa has taken a major step toward achieving our goal of combining two
of the world's most powerful and ubiquitous consumer innovations,
electronic payments and mobile technology," said Elizabeth Buse,
Global Head of Product at Visa Inc. "Through this effort, U.S.
consumers will, for the first time, be able to download Visa mobile
service applications directly to their handsets. Visa cardholders have
come to expect more from their Visa account than just convenience and
security of payment, and wireless customers expect their mobile
devices to carry a multitude of applications. Extending Visa payments
and services to the mobile device is a natural extension, and makes
the consumer payment experience more convenient, more secure and more
rewarding."

   As industry leaders, J.P. Morgan Chase and Visa share a commitment
to working to meet consumers' demand for information-rich services
that will make their handsets more useful in helping them accomplish
what is most important to them.

   Three Powerful Services

   The Visa mobile applications developed for the Android platform
will initially deliver three powerful services that will make
consumers lives easier, improve their ability to manage and protect
their Visa accounts, and get valuable offers from merchants. Consumers
would enroll for Visa mobile services via their mobile device, and
would "opt-in" to the services, so they would only activate those they
choose, and would be able to "opt-out" at any time, helping to
preserve their privacy.

   Visa mobile services developed for the Android platform include:

   --  Alerts: Consumers will receive near real-time notification of
        purchase activity based on customized cardholder preferences.
        The consumer will be able to personalize the types of alerts
        delivered to their mobile device according to pre-selected
        parameters, such as the size of the transaction, or whether
        the transaction is in foreign currency. Because these alerts
        are triggered by the transaction as it passes through the Visa
        network, consumers will receive notifications almost
        immediately, typically before they even leave the store. This
        adds a new layer of peace of mind when using Visa, and a new
        way to combat fraud.

   --  Offers: Consumers will receive targeted offers from merchants
        directly to their phone. These offers - ranging from discounts
        to loyalty offers - could be based on a consumer's previous
        purchase activity. For consumers and merchants alike, this
        service will ensure the most relevant offers are sent in a
        timely manner, helping increase merchant traffic, loyalty and
        customer satisfaction.

   --  Locator: The Locator service is expected to integrate with
        technology developed by Google, such as Google Maps and Google
        location-based services, to show consumers nearby locations of
        merchants sending them offers, or of an ATM that accepts Visa.
        The location would be called out on a map displayed on the
        mobile device screen.

   "We're pleased to extend the value of Visa to the mobile channel,"
said Buse. "With more than 3 billion mobile devices already in market
today, we have an opportunity deliver the convenience and security of
Visa to consumers around the globe."

   Visa Mobile Initiative

   Visa's strategy in creating mobile payment services has been to
apply the scale and flexibility of its global payment network to
deliver payments and value-added services on mobile devices that have
immediate value to consumers, merchants, and issuers. Over the last
two years, Visa has actively engaged with financial institutions,
wireless operators, handset manufacturers, and technology providers to
develop and test innovative mobile services. Visa is currently testing
mobile payments, money transfer and value-added services with
consumers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Korea,
Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, the U.K., and the U.S.

   Visa's investment in its mobile technology comes as more consumers
in both developed and emerging economies adopt mobile devices and play
a central role in commerce. The development of mobile applications for
the Android platform is the latest example of how Visa is making
mobile commerce a global reality.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)

 Sept 25 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded eight
companies in the U.S. lodging sector, including Marriott
International, as it lowered its 2009 estimates for all the
lodging companies it covers, saying it expects revenue per
available room (RevPAR) to decline.

 "Our proprietary checks reveal meaningfully lower corporate
volumes, higher group attrition/cancellation rates, recent
tough corporate rate negotiations, and softening international
RevPAR," analyst Joseph Greff wrote in a note to clients.

 Therefore, the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2009
will be very weak from an operational standpoint, Greff said.
Given limited visibility, the lodging companies will be
cautious on their preliminary outlook for 2009 when they report
third-quarter results, he added.

 Greff expects RevPAR to fall 5 percent to 6 percent in the
fourth quarter and 3 percent to 6.5 percent in 2009. He reduced
his 2009 earnings estimates for the lodging companies he covers
by 21.4 percent on average.

 The analyst believes the lodging real estate investment
trusts (REITs) -- Host Hotels, LaSalle Hotel, FelCor Lodging
and Sunstone Hotel -- and Orient-Express have the greatest
negative operating leverage, given the RevPAR assumptions.

 During earnings season, the price performance of lodging
stocks will be weak given downward revisions in 2009 estimates
following 2009 RevPAR outlook and investors will largely remain
on the sidelines with lodging stocks as "they will likely be
dead money," the analyst said.

 However, Greff said he still favors Marriott, Starwood
Hotels, Wyndham, Choice Hotels, Orient-Express and Gaylord,
compared to the lodging REITS,  because of the former's already
locked-in unit growth, limited capital investment and greater
financial flexibility, which should help them better weather a
decelerating RevPAR environment.

 The analyst cut his price target on Wyndham Worldwide Corp
(WYN.N) to $23 from $27, but maintained his "overweight" rating
on the stock citing low valuation. Greff kept his "underweight"
rating on LaSalle Hotel Properties (LHO.N).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's two largest investment banks are girding themselves for a long battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past three days, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) became bank holding companies after investors last week lost confidence in their freewheeling, high-risk broker model. They're also busy stockpiling capital, sacrificing near-term results as they focus on getting through the downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman announced deals that will raise $15 billion from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) and public investors. Morgan Stanley plans to sell as much as a 20 percent stake for roughly $8.5 billion to Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.T), one of the world's largest banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves staved off the pressure that brought down Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK and will let Goldman and Morgan Stanley acquire deposits. But the stability comes at the cost of stricter regulation and slimmer returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're both saying it will be easier, and they'll see more opportunities, with more capital," said Gary Townsend, a veteran analyst who now runs hedge fund Hill-Townsend Capital. "But commercial banking is not easy and the level of leverage allowed is quite a bit different from what they're used to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two companies who said they had plenty of capital and the right business model are now raising piles of cash and changing the way they do business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts cautioned that the two newly minted banks will be forced to rein in risk and use less leverage -- the very tools that made Wall Street so enormously profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll see high- to mid-teens returns on equities. The days of 30 percent ROEs are behind us," said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's equity sales reduced leverage on the balance sheet to where each dollar of capital supports less than $20 of assets -- down from more than $30 last year -- and boosted shareholders' equity by a third to $61 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sales dilute per-share earnings by about 16 percent, and have Goldman paying Buffett a princely 10 percent coupon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Goldman Sachs, the blue chip of financials, the terms of this deal seem exorbitantly expensive and provide insight into how truly challenging current market conditions are," Oppenheimer  Co analyst Meredith Whitney wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basking in the glow of its Buffett endorsement, Goldman shares rose more than 6 percent on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH TIMES AHEAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the tough times for banks are far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury Department's proposal to soak up hard-to-sell debts from ailing banks is still subject to debate in Congress. And the conditions that hurt Wall Street firms in the first place -- a slowing economy, too few deals and illiquid debt markets -- have not improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all the positive developments this week, the cost of insuring against a default in Morgan Stanley debt rose Wednesday. Its shares fell 11.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The willingness to raise a lot of capital at a modest premium to book value could suggest that (Goldman's) management has a bleak outlook on the environment," Sandler O'Neill analyst Jeff Harte said in a note. "We remain cautious on the outlook for the near-term operating environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two firms also face Fed demands for greater disclosure about their trades and investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're certainly at the end of an era. The higher risk, high reward strategies that the investment banks utilized are certainly going to be tamed," said John Challenger, head of Challenger Gray  Christmas, who tracks job and salary trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embracing the bank model also opens the door to some new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth-largest U.S. bank with $1.1 trillion in assets, Goldman intends to snap up assets and deposits from distressed banks seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp or federal bailout plan. Goldman does not intend to acquire large banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Morgan Stanley already has a significant retail financial business through its 8,500 brokers and 3 million wealth management clients. The No. 5 U.S. bank with $989 billion of total assets has said it will expand its retail banking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It expects an alliance with Mitsubishi, the world's second largest bank by deposits, will give it a real boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MUFG talks, and its new bank status, means Morgan can pursue a whole new set of options. Talks that commenced last week with Wachovia Corp WB.N are now dead, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, even the newly empowered and capital-rich Wall Street firms are holding back from buying banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the difficulties in valuing potential targets due to rising credit problems and significant mark-to-market accounting issues," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote, "we believe strategic buyers such as Goldman and Morgan will probably remain on the sidelines for now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Highlights: Diamond Offshore, Molson Coors, Pfizer, Cytori Therapeutics and AIG

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Diamond Offshore (NYSE: DO) as
the Bull of the Day and Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE: TAP) as
the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides
analysis on Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE: PFE), Cytori Therapeutics (Nasdaq:
CYTX) and American International Group (NYSE: AIG).

   Full analysis of all these stocks is available at
http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676.

   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

   Bull of the Day: Diamond Offshore (NYSE: DO)

   Our continued favorable view of Diamond Offshore shares reflects
the company's strong leverage to the favorable deepwater drilling
outlook. With a backlog of more than $11 billion, Diamond offers a
solid level of earnings and cash flow visibility going forward.

   The company remains committed to returning excess cash
shareholders, primarily through dividends. In addition to its regular
dividend, the company has paid a special dividend of $1.25 per share
in each of the last four quarters and $4 per share earlier in 2007.
Given its cash flow outlook, we expect this payout pattern to remain
in place in the near to medium term.

   In terms of its deepwater drilling leverage, its closest peer is
Transocean, relative to which it continues to trade at a discount. Our
unchanged $145 price objective reflects 2009 P/E and EV/EBITDA
multiples of 10.8x and 7.0x, respectively, both well within historical
trading ranges and still at a discount to Transocean.

   Bear of the Day: Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE: TAP)

   Molson Coors, formed through the 2005 merger between Molson and
Adolph Coors, has improved the company's scale and financial strength.
However, higher input costs are compressing the company's overall
gross margin and smoking bans are negatively impacting the U.K.
operations.

   Of particular concern is the cost rationalization moves of the
major brewers that are expected to result in the loss of the positive
pricing trends enjoyed by the industry for the last two years. The
Sell rating is maintained.

   With respect to premium lager-style beer, the three major brewers
-- Anheuser-Busch, Molson Coors, and SABMiller -- control
approximately 77% of the market. Growing or even maintaining market
share requires increased investments in marketing. The Canadian
brewing industry is a mature market and is characterized by intense
competition for volume and market share.

   Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog:

   Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE: PFE)

   We believe Pfizer continues to face an uphill battle in growing
its top-line given the company's sheer size and lack of a significant
pipeline. While near-term earnings growth will come in the form of
cost-cutting and share repurchases, the company lacks a catalyst to
increase revenues once Lipitor loses patent exclusivity.

   We expect the company to look to do a number of significant deals
in the pharma and biotech industry in order to build the franchise and
invest for the future. We believe there is currently little downside
price risk given the valuation and rate the shares a Hold with a $20
price target.

   Cytori Therapeutics (Nasdaq: CYTX)

   Cytori Therapeutics is development-stage biotechnology company
that seeks to commercialize stem cell and regenerative cell therapies
for cardiovascular disease, reconstructive surgery, and other serious,
chronic, and life threatening conditions and disorders. The company
has developed the Celution System, an automated process that harvests
stem and regenerative cells residing in a patient's adipose (fat)
tissue.

   We believe that 2008 should be an exciting year for Cytori as the
company has begun to record product sales revenues from early-adopter
Celution System placements in Europe and Asia.

   American International Group (NYSE: AIG)

   At this point, it makes sense to explain just what a credit
default swap, or CDS, is. They were the key reason for the demise of
AIG, and for the fear that if they were not bailed out that the whole
ball of wax would come unglued. Essentially it is an insurance policy,
but an unregulated one (the State of N.Y. just recently said that it
would start to regulate part of the market -- can you say closing the
barn door?).

&lt;p&gt;ANKARA, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Turkish state oil company TPAO
and U.S. company Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) are close to a deal on
exploring for oil in the Black Sea, state energy sources said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Major oil importer Turkey has stepped up efforts in recent
years to exploit hydrocarbon reserves in the Black Sea as it
looks to diversify energy resources and reduce its fuel bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ankara is also holding talks with Germany's RWE AG (RWEG.DE)
and U.S. Chevron (CVX.N) on conducting oil exploration in the
region and a source from TPAO, who declined to named, said those
talks were progressing positively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The talks with Exxon Mobil on oil exploration are on the
verge of being completed with an agreement," a source at TPAO
told Reuters, although the source declined to say when an accord
might be signed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At the end of 2009 or start of 2010 drilling will start as
planned. We have high expectations for this drilling," said
another source at the Turkish Energy Ministry. Both sources
declined to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TPAO aims to launch production in 2015-2016 if drilling is
carried out by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mehmet Uysal, general director of TPAO, has said that $500
million has so far been invested in oil exploration in the Black
Sea, where officials estimate the volume of reserves at 10
billion barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is also working on plans for oil exploration in
the Black Sea with Brazil's Petrobras (PETR4.SA).

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 25 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities cut its 2008
estimates on at least six U.S. asset managers to reflect poor
equity market returns quarter to date, particularly in the
month of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Kenneth Worthington said the significant
deterioration of assets under management could threaten
earnings growth in 2009, which leads him to believe that
valuation contraction was likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Invesco (IVZ.N) was his top investment idea, and
added that he saw the company getting close to positive results
in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He maintained Janus Capital Group Inc (JNS.N) and Franklin
Resources Inc (BEN.N) at "underweight".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see both companies as vulnerable to a strengthening US
dollar. Janus is also vulnerable to a disproportionate exposure

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) capped off its purchase of Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N) on Friday by selling $10 billion of stock, more than it expected, while analysts warned the company faces a third-quarter loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $1.9 billion acquisition of WaMu makes JPMorgan the second-largest U.S. bank by deposits and marks the largest bank failure in U.S. history.

Stein added that, if JPMorgan's assumptions about WaMu's holdings are right, "It's a great deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's hard-charging chief executive, sees the deal as a boost to the empire he has been building since he arrived from Banc One four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're building this franchise for the long term -- not for next year or the next five years, but for the next 100 years," he said on a call with investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon had considered buying WaMu at various points this year. By holding out for a deal in which JPMorgan snared WaMu's banking assets, while leaving behind about $20 billion in debt, his reputation as a savvy deal maker looks set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon sometimes prefers to present his actions as a form of corporate philanthropy.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds staff, customers' comments, write-downs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Elinor Comlay and Laura Myers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE  Sept 26 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) capped off its purchase of Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N)
on Friday by selling $10 billion of stock, more than it
expected, while analysts warned the company faces a
third-quarter loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $1.9 billion acquisition of WaMu makes JPMorgan the
second-largest U.S. bank by deposits and marks the largest bank
failure in U.S. history. It also saddles JPMorgan with the
troublesome mortgages that caused painful write-downs and
credit losses for the thrift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's too early to know if JPMorgan is a big winner or
loser from this deal," said James Ellman, portfolio manager at
hedge fund Seacliff Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors gave the deal an early vote of confidence,
though, sending JPMorgan shares up more than 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They basically bought the company for nothing," said John
Stein, co-founder of investment firm FSI Group. Stein added
that, if JPMorgan's assumptions about WaMu's holdings are
right, "It's a great deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's hard-charging chief executive, sees
the deal as a boost to the empire he has been building since he
arrived from Banc One four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're building this franchise for the long term -- not for

statesman in a little over six months -- with the WaMu deal
following JPMorgan's acquisition of Bear Stearns Cos in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts warned that worsening markets may mean WaMu's
purchase could weigh on JPMorgan's profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Susan Roth Katzke, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said in a
research note that she was "less confident in the cost of the
current credit and capital markets cycle to the bank's existing
operations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz wrote in a note to clients
that the near- to intermediate-term outlook remained challenged
in light of higher costs in credit cards and at the retail
bank, as well as the increasing likelihood of sustained lower
revenues from capital markets business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WRITE-DOWNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The immediate outlook is certainly not all rosy. JPMorgan
is taking on $296 billion of tangible assets from Washington
Mutual, at least some portion of which are the mortgages that
caused the thrift to unravel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank will write down more than $30 billion from the
WaMu acquisition and incur $1.5 billion of pre-tax costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the same time, JPMorgan has raised its expectations for
write-downs on its own leveraged lending and mortgage-related
positions to between $3 billion and $3.5 billion, up from $1.1
billion in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While analysts sought to assess how the deal affects
JPMorgan's financials, WaMu staff and customers were trying to
assess what the deal means for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Madelain Verter, a customer at a WaMu branch in New York,
arrived to make a deposit and heard other depositors discussing
whether to withdraw their funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I guess with the state of the economy, it shouldn't have
come as a surprise," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Customers were mostly unfazed by the takeover -- the only
concern was voiced by New York customers with existing accounts
at Chase, nervous the merger might leave their combined
deposits above the $100,000 ceiling insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But at WaMu's headquarters in Seattle employees were
struggling to come to grips with the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are now Chase employees," said Bryan Johnson, 50, a
senior consultant. "We don't think we'll have our jobs in a
couple of months. We went out and got drunk last night, and

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - At 9:40 a.m.  on Friday, five buttoned-down bankers rolled their suitcases into the lobby of Washington Mutual's Seattle headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said they were from JPMorgan Chase  Co, but they didn't need to: nearly everyone else at the WaMu Center was in jeans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The night before, JPMorgan agreed to buy WaMu's branches and deposits for less than $2 billion as the federal government closed down an institution that survived the Great Depression of the 1930s only to be felled by the mortgage crisis of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't think we'll have our jobs in a couple of months," said Bryan Johnson, 50, a senior consultant who works at WaMu headquarters. "We went out and got drunk last night, and probably will do so again tonight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business was slow at Treasures, Gifts  Goodies, a store in the lobby. Outside, a man used his cell phone to take a picture of the WaMu sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today nobody knows anything," said Jonathan Shuval, 57, a senior software developer on a cigarette break and waiting for bad news. "In a few days I expect them to come out with platitudes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WaMu, which was the largest U.S. savings and loan, is a fixture in the city where it was founded in 1889. Many residents lamented that it was only a matter of time before the WaMu signs that dot the town are replaced by JPMorgan Chase signs or simply taken down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At WaMu headquarters, contract worker Lori Charlebois, 39, said the mood was tense. "All management is in meetings," she said. "Everyone's scurrying about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlebois said she was more worried for her brother than for herself. He survived three rounds of job cuts in the home loan division, but may not survive what's coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A living room set, complete with a fire burning in a fireplace, stands in the lobby, testament to WaMu's home mortgage business. A plaque reads "The first 118 years were just the beginning."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Peter Henderson; Editing by Eddie Evans)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  CHARLOTTE, NC, Sep 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
KnowTia Corporation announced that the Oasis CRM product line will now be
enhanced with a new interface to Microsoft's Great Plains(R). The
interface to Great Plains(R) will include integrated customer, vendor,
inventory &amp; order management integration. These features will be
interfaced with Oasis CRM's real-time integration engine, InfoLink. This
new interface will assist with further securing Oasis CRM as a standalone
"Total Business Solution."

    Oasis CRM for Microsoft Great Plains(R) will leverage the existing
accounting investment for small- to mid-sized businesses. By incorporating
Sales Force and Customer Service Automation with comprehensive inventory
control features, Oasis CRM automates the entire customer life cycle and
eliminates duplicate data entry for their clients.

    KnowTia recognized early on that many companies rely on disconnected
software systems to handle SFA (Sales Force Automation), Customer Service,
Fulfillment and Accounting. These disconnected solutions in turn caused
process bottlenecks and further prohibited growth. Additionally, the
increased chance for errors and overall increases in operation costs limit
the business' future success. As such, Oasis CRM was designed to eliminate
these bottlenecks and provide a structured, easy to use system where
information is entered once and flows automatically through the various
stages of the company, including accounting.

    Put simply, the most efficient companies in the world know that the key to
growth and customer satisfaction requires internal business processes
which are connected and automated for efficiency. Oasis CRM software was
specifically designed for Microsoft Great Plains(R) customers that are
looking to improve efficiency and eliminate the bottlenecks of growth.

&lt;p&gt;BankAtlantic Issues Statement in Response to the JPMorgan Chase Acquisition of Washington Mutual

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
BankAtlantic, Florida's Most Convenient Bank, today issued the
following statement in response to the transaction facilitated by the
Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) relating to Washington Mutual and its acquisition
by JPMorgan Chase:

   BankAtlantic is available to assist Washington Mutual's customers
and answer questions about BankAtlantic's FDIC coverage which includes
the availability of CDARS, a program recently launched by
BankAtlantic. The CDARS program can offer customers FDIC insurance
coverage from $100,000 up to $50 million when they enter into the
CDARS Deposit Placement Agreement, while earning attractive returns on
their deposits. In fact, since its recent launch, BankAtlantic has
attracted millions of dollars of fully FDIC insured customer deposits
via the CDARS program.

   We want you to know that BankAtlantic is here to meet your banking
needs. BankAtlantic is financially strong and well capitalized. At
June 30, 2008, Core, Tier I and Total Capital ratios of 11.77%, 9.99%
and 6.82%, respectively, were well in excess of all regulatory "well
capitalized" thresholds of 10.0%, 6.0% and 5.0%, respectively.

   Like all financial institutions doing business in Florida,
BankAtlantic has experienced credit losses. However, contrary to
recent headlines reporting on America's credit crisis, BankAtlantic's
conservative residential lending practices have never included
subprime, option-arm, negative amortization or similar products. In
addition, as we have previously reported, BankAtlantic's investment
portfolio does not include commercial paper, collateralized debt
obligations, structured investment vehicles, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac
equity or debt securities, or credit default swaps. In total, while
other financial institutions have suffered the downward spiraling
negative effects of these products and practices, BankAtlantic has
none.

   We clearly live in extraordinary times. Aggressive and unsound
practices pursued by financial institutions have severely impacted
America's financial system. While the names may change from Wall
Street to Main Street, BankAtlantic is still here, as it has been for
over 56 years, with over 100 locations to meet your banking needs.
BankAtlantic is financially sound, with strong capital, a loyal
deposit base, a deep commitment to providing seven-day convenience,
unparalleled service, and a powerful mix of banking products and
services to all Floridians.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. bailout plan for the financial industry is unlikely to help credit markets or the economy soon, and U.S. growth will likely contract over the next two quarters, JPMorgan Chase  Co said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal plan, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, "may be passed by Congress, but should not, in our opinion, lead to materially improved credit conditions or stronger growth in the near term," JPMorgan said in a research note on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers on Friday continued to negotiate over a $700 billion financial rescue plan after talks at the White House broke down in acrimony on Thursday and the biggest bank closure in U.S. history roiled global markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President George W. Bush said that while there were disagreements on parts of the bailout plan, legislation would be passed by Congress. "We are going to get a package passed," he said in a brief appearance at the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it expects negative growth over the next two quarters and expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 50 basis points by December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bailout plan would allow holders of distressed assets, mostly mortgage securities, to sell them to the Treasury. JPMorgan said it is still unclear how the plan will help investors, banks and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchase of the bad debt is meant to "jump-start the securitization markets," JPMorgan said, yet questions remain over how to value the securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan suggested an auction process or hiring outside experts to use models to value the securities, suggestions that already have been tried on Wall Street without success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also said new sales of corporate debt should increase, but investors will demand high yields to compensate for the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Finally, the modest amount of new bond supply is coming at significant concessions to secondary market levels. We expect high-grade bond spreads to widen further," JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Walden Siew; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Includes More Than 180 Mainframe Management Solutions in 18
                         Functional Categories
ISLANDIA, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--


   News Facts

   --  CA (NYSE: CA) today announced "Day One" support for z/OS V1.10
        across its extensive line of mainframe software solutions,
        continuing its long history of timely coordination with new
        releases of IBM System z operating systems.

   --  CA's management solutions for z/OS V1.10 empower customers to
        take advantage of new z/OS functionality including its
        specialty processors, HiperDispatch, Extended Address Volumes
        (EAVs), hardware-assisted encryption and support for the
        latest security standards.

   --  CA is supporting IBM z/OS V1.10 across more than 180 solutions
        in 18 functional categories. CA worked closely with IBM to
        ensure tight integration of its management solutions portfolio
        with z/OS V1.10. CA actively participated in IBM's Early
        Support Program for z/OS V1.10 by supporting select mutual
        customers through the installation of this new version of the
        operating system on CA's z10 in its data center.

   Support for Specialty Processors

   --  z/OS V1.10 extracts significant additional value from
        installed specialty processors by expanding the scope of
        zIIP-eligible functions to include large message transport
        across HiperSocket connections, global data mirroring (XRC),
        and XML parsing services. Similarly, CA continues to expand
        its portfolio of zIIP-eligible features with the delivery of
        the latest CA Vtape Virtual Tape System and CA Tape Encryption
        products.

   --  CA plans further exploitation of the specialty engines in
        order to deliver innovative products that realize the business
        value they represent.

   Support for EAV-Capable Storage Subsystems

   --  z/OS V1.10 supports the newest EAV-capable storage subsystems
        such as the IBM(R) DS8000. These subsystems enable storage
        administrators to define volumes as large as 223 GB, relieving
        current constraints and simplifying storage management by
        reducing the total number of managed volumes. CA solutions
        help customers take advantage of this capability by making it
        easier to manage, monitor, and automate use of these large
        DASD volumes.

   Enhancements in virtualization, encryption, security, and
reliability

   --  CA also eases exploitation of the many other functions
        included in z/OS V1.10, including the most recent enhancements
        to its virtualization, encryption, security, and reliability
        features--such as the built-in Health Checker for z/OS
        function. CA workload automation solutions capitalize on this
        capability by delivering solution-specific Health Check
        functions that plug into the IBM-supplied "Health Checker"
        framework. CA SYSVIEW(R) Performance Management enables
        customers to view and configure both IBM and non-IBM supplied
        Health Check plug-ins from a single management facility.
        Solutions such as OPS/MVS(R) Event Management and Notification
        further complement the Health Checker facility by enabling
        exception conditions surfaced by one or more Check functions
        to be resolved without human intervention.

   Digital Certificates, IPV6 Addresses

   --  In support of z/OS V1.10, CA ACF2(TM) and CA Top Secret(R) now
        fully support 9-100 character password phrases, and
        automatically re-encrypt users' Kerberos keys when either
        passwords or password phrases are changed. The generation of
        digital certificates by these CA solutions has been enhanced
        to support all new Distinguished Name attribute types and IPv6
        addressing.

   --  In addition, CA Auditor for z/OS now detects new operating
        system functionality including new SAF resource classes,
        new/changed PPT and Parmlib members, new standard and dynamic
        exit points, and new FMIDs (SMP/E Function Modification IDs).

   Advanced Development and QA Methodologies

   --  A significant factor in CA's ability to consistently provide
        Day One support for new operating system releases such as z/OS
        V1.10 is its employment of advanced development and QA
        methodologies. These methodologies facilitate central
        management of integration across product lines and global
        operations, enabling rapid delivery of high quality management
        solutions designed to interoperate seamlessly with IBM's
        flagship mainframe operating system.

   Decades of Support for IBM Mainframes

   --  Customers have been relying on CA management solutions for IBM
        mainframes to optimize value and help reduce cost of ownership
        for more than three decades. The benefits of these management
        solutions have become even more important to IT organizations
        as mainframe workloads have skyrocketed in recent years--while
        experienced mainframe administrators are retiring and budget
        pressures continue to limit IT headcount.

   Supporting Quotes

   --  "CA remains the leading independent provider of management
        solutions for the IBM mainframe platform," said Chris
        O'Malley, executive vice president and general manager of CA's
        Mainframe Business Unit. "We are committed to helping IT
        organizations worldwide get maximum business value from their
        extensive investments in z/OS."

   --  "CA's solutions significantly simplify and streamline the
        diverse management tasks required to keep our IBM z/OS
        environment operating at peak efficiency," said Michael
        Dixon, vice president of the CA Event Management and
        Automation Global User Community. "By providing such timely
        support for z/OS V1.10 and helping us exploit its new
        capabilities, CA is enabling us to reap the benefits of the
        operating system upgrade sooner and with greater confidence."

   --  "CA's solutions will help us get optimum value from our IBM
        z/OS environment, reduce the environmental impact of IT, and
        drive down fixed costs," said Ingrid Lohneiss, president of
        the CA Identity &amp; Access Management for Mainframe Global User
        Community. "Their timely support for z/OS V1.10 is just one
        more reason that we have such great confidence in CA as our
        strategic partner for mainframe security management."

   CA World 2008 Sessions

   --  CA World 2008, Nov. 16-20 in Las Vegas, will feature a number
        of sessions and demonstrations of CA's support and
        exploitation of z/OS V1.10 features, including zIIP and EAV
        technologies, across multiple product areas. For more

&lt;p&gt;Fitch: WaMu Acquisition a Strategic Positive for JPMorgan Chase; IDR Affirmed at 'AA-'

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) acquisition of Washington Mutual Inc.'s
(WaMu) banking operations is a strategic positive that bolsters JPM's
retail franchise and expands its reach to additional high growth
markets throughout the United States, according to Fitch Ratings,
which has affirmed JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA at
'AA-'. A complete list of affected ratings follows the end of the
press release.

   JPM's announced purchase includes all deposits, assets and select
liabilities of Washington Mutual's banking operations from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The ratings of the acquired
deposits are aligned with those of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.

   Washington Mutual Bank's obligations under its mortgage bonds have
been assumed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA. These mortgage bonds are
owned by WM Covered Bond Program (WMCBP) and are securing WMCBP's
covered bonds. A separate rating action commentary on WMCBP
outstanding debt will follow later today.

   For JPM, this deal effectively creates the largest US depository
institution ($905 billion in deposits), the second largest branch
network (5,410 branches), and the largest credit card issuer ($181
billion outstanding). Equally noteworthy is the immediate expansion of
its footprint across 23 states to include the West coast and other
attractive high growth markets (e.g., FL, TX, AZ). Access to these
expanded markets provides JPM with strong cross-selling potential for
the firm's vast array of retail and middle-market products.

   The $1.9 billion purchase excludes the senior unsecured debt,
subordinated debt, and preferred stock of Washington Mutual's banks.
Net assets of approximately $31 billion were acquired, before marks of
$31 billion were applied. After reserve and accounting adjustments,
incremental proforma capital totals $1.9 billion. Regulatory capital
ratios are expected to remain within management's targeted ranges; in
addition, JPM is seeking to bolster its capital position through the
launch of a common stock issuance targeted to raise approximately $10
billion in fresh equity.

   The transaction is expected to be accretive immediately and in the
future, despite projected marks on the home loan portfolio. Projected
cost savings of $1.5 billion essentially equal initial merger-related
costs.

   Systems conversion and rebranding of the consumer banking, home
lending and credit card operations will take place over the next two
years. No major integration risk is cited, as JPM Chase management has
proven experience with large bank mergers. With the Bear Stearns
integration well underway, and lack of significant overlap in the two
acquisitions, there should be ample management resources to dedicate
to this purchase. Litigation risk should not be extraordinary.

   Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook:

   JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.:

   --Long-term IDR at 'AA-';

   --Long-term senior debt at 'AA-'

   --Short-term IDR at 'F1+';

   --Short-term debt at 'F1+';

   --Subordinated debt at 'A+';

   --Preferred stock at 'A+';

   --Individual at 'B';

   --Support at '5';

   --Support Floor at 'NF'.

   JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA

   --Long-term IDR at 'AA-';

   --Long-term deposits at 'AA';

   --Long-term senior debt at 'AA-'

   --Short-term IDR at 'F1+';

   --Short-term deposits at 'F1+';

   --Short-term debt at 'F1+';

   --Subordinated debt at 'A+';

   --Individual at 'B';

   --Support at '1'.

   Fitch upgrades the following deposit ratings:

   Washington Mutual Bank

   --Long-term deposits upgraded to 'AA' from 'BBB-';

   --Short-term deposits upgraded to 'F1+' from 'F3'.

   Providian National Bank

   --Long-term deposits upgraded to 'AA' from 'BBB-'.

   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings
are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.
Published ratings, criteria and methodologies are available from this
site, at all times. Fitch's code of conduct, confidentiality,

making clinical improvements. The agreement is another endorsement of
the strength and quality of the award winning SpeechMagic platform.

includes complete patient and bed management as well as an integrated
radiology information system (RIS) and a picture archiving and
communication system (PACS).

requires that input from various departments and sources, such as
medical notes, discharge summaries or ward visits, is captured and
stored in a standardized format. SpeechMagic's advanced technology and
ongoing research in the field of semantic interoperability will allow
us to quickly bring advanced information capture to Amalga HIS and
Amalga RIS/PACS customers around the globe," said Steve Shihadeh, vice
president, Microsoft Health Solutions Group.

Systems will immediately start the process of integrating their
technologies.

&lt;p&gt;CHF and OPIC Partner with Academic Program to Provide Business and
               Management Education to Women in Liberia
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) Chairman and CEO, Lloyd

   Goldman Sachs' 10,000 Women initiative is working with leading
academic institutions and development organizations to implement
innovative business education programs throughout the world. Building
on 30 previously-announced partnerships, Goldman Sachs will work with
CHF and Cuttington University in Liberia to develop and deliver a
short-term certificate program to train underserved women in business
management. Over the next five years, the program will select and
train 300 underserved Liberian women entrepreneurs with the skills
they need to develop quality business plans, access capital, and
ultimately grow their small and medium businesses. The scholars of the
program will develop skills such as accounting, marketing, human
resource management, production, and quality control.

   "We are very pleased to expand the 10,000 Women initiative by
working with esteemed partners, CHF International and OPIC, to provide
women in Liberia with both the critical knowledge and practical tools
needed to help them develop their businesses," said Dina Powell,
Managing Director and Global Head of the Office of Corporate
Engagement at Goldman Sachs. "Access to capital is one of the key
challenges facing small and medium sized enterprises in Liberia. This
unique collaboration will allow us to help address this challenge by
building a qualified pool of applicants positioned to access the funds
that are available and leverage them to achieve their growth
potential."

   The 10,000 Women program was launched March 5, 2008. It is a
global initiative that provides 10,000 underserved women,
predominantly in developing and emerging markets, with business and
management education. Goldman Sachs committed $100 million over the
next five years and has partnered with universities in Africa, Asia,
Europe, Latin America and United States to seek, create and develop
programs to impact the quality and capacity of business education for
women in developing regions around the world. For further information

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that Gartner, Inc. has positioned IBM in
the leader's quadrant in three of its reports: "Magic Quadrant for
Enterprise Asset Management for Manufacturing, September 2008," "Magic
Quadrant for Transmission and Distribution Enterprise Asset Management,
September 2008," and "Magic Quadrant for Power-Generation Enterprise
Asset Management Software, September 2008.(1)"

    Each of the reports includes a market description for Enterprise Asset
Management (EAM) solutions. Gartner said: "An EAM solution includes work
order creation, planned maintenance, maintenance history, MRO inventory
and procurement, as well as equipment, component and asset tracking for
equipment. In its most-evolved form, the functionality is extended by the
addition of basic financial management modules, such as accounts payable,
cost recording in ledgers, and human resource management for rostering and
skill recording."

    In positioning vendors in its Magic Quadrant, Gartner evaluates
completeness of vision and ability to execute.

    According to Gartner, in the Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Asset
Management for Manufacturing: "Leaders in this market have a global
presence, a large installed base in manufacturing, strong viability and a
combination of rich features including: functionality, interfaces to many
different ERP (and supporting EAM) applications, and a capable and global
implementation partner community."

    "I believe these reports highlight our ability to focus on specific
industries and meet a wide variety of EAM requirements," said Bill Sawyer,
vice president, Maximo and Hosting Operations, IBM Tivoli Software. "We've
added significant resources to our development and installation teams.
These resources have increased our understanding of, and commitment to,
solving our customers' asset management challenges. As a result, we are
confident IBM Maximo will continue to be a leading solution for a variety
of EAM markets."

WHO:    Lee Dumas, Director of Architecture, Azaleos Corporation and
         Exchange Ranger/MCA
        Dumas has worked in the Microsoft Exchange and the messaging
         industry for 15 years. He has served on the Microsoft
         Exchange development team at Microsoft, and spent seven years
         with Avanade, a global IT consultancy, where he was
         responsible for architecting Exchange deployments, upgrades

WHAT:   Choosing the right storage system is critical to a successful
         Exchange deployment. Exchange Server supports three primary
         types of storage technologies: storage area networks (SAN),
         network-attached storage (NAS), and direct-attached storage

         and its advantages and disadvantages for Exchange Server
         storage management, including:
        -- Why DAS is the current Microsoft recommended storage system
         for Exchange
        -- Why SAN is the best option if cost and complexity are not
         an issue
        -- Why NAS is the best option for branch offices and/or for
         economical and reliable storage

&lt;p&gt; (adds details)

 Sept 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs revised ratings and price
targets on several European airlines and said revenue would
deteriorate this winter, premium travel was at risk of slowing
and UK consumer demand might also disappoint.

 "The baton of worry has passed from oil (still a major
problem) to revenue," the brokerage said.

 Goldman, however, said mergers and acquisitions was the big
hope for the sector.

 "As the majority of these airlines will in our view be
unable to lower their unit costs or raise their unit revenues
sufficiently to earn their cost of capital, an uplift from
MA-based synergies appears the only potential avenue towards
value creation."

 Goldman upgraded Aer Lingus (AERL.I), and Iberia IBLA.MC
to "neutral" from "sell" and said its positive stance reflects
the companies' high levels of liquidity.

The brokerage also said if Iberia's proposed merger with
British Airways wereto fall through, Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and
Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA) could be interested.

 It also upgraded Finnair (FIA1S.HE) to "buy" from "sell,"
and Norwegian Air Shuttle (NWC.OL) to "neutral" from "sell."

 Goldman retained its "sell" rating on Austrian Airlines
AUAV.VI, British Airways BAY.L, EasyJet (EZJ.L), Ryanair
(RYA.I), and SAS (SAS.ST).

 The following table lists the ratings and price target

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Unilever, Cytori Therapeutics Inc., Pfizer Inc., UST, Inc. and Altria Group.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest
news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks
recently featured in the blog include: Unilever (NYSE: UN), Cytori
Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: CYTX), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), UST, Inc.
(NYSE: UST) and Altria Group (NYSE: MO).

   Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the
free Profit from the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

   Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog:

   Unilever Buy Rating Maintained

   Unilever (NYSE: UN) has benefited from the 'Path to Growth'
strategy in terms of expanding margins, building momentum of key
brands, rationalizing costs, and streamlining the asset base.
Impressively, the underlying operating margin is rising despite rising
input costs in the first half of 2008. In addition, the developing and
emerging markets are expected to continue driving incremental topline
growth.

   Unilever has simplified the management hierarchy whereby the dual
chairman structure has been replaced by a structure comprising a
single chief executive officer and a non-executive Chairman. The
organizational changes will expedite decision-making, improve
execution, and enhance customer focus. The one-to-one equivalence
between PLC and NV shares should also improve financial transparency.

   Cytori Thera Warrants Excitement

   Cytori Therapeutics (Nasdaq: CYTX) is development stage
biotechnology company that seeks to commercialize stem cell and
regenerative cell therapies for cardiovascular disease, reconstructive
surgery, and other serious, chronic, and life threatening conditions
and disorders. The company has developed the Celution System, an
automated process that harvests stem and regenerative cells residing
in a patient's adipose (fat) tissue.

   We have been encouraged by the small clinical data seen so far
using Cytori's technology. We think the company is store to report a
solid third quarter and the Street has yet to take notice of the
upside that exists over the next few years. Today's price represents a
very attractive entry point in our view. We are maintaining our Buy
rating and $16 target.

   Pfizer Lacking a Catalyst

   We believe Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) continues to face an uphill battle
in growing its top-line given the company's sheer size and lack of a
significant pipeline. While near-term earnings growth will come in the
form of cost-cutting and share repurchases, the company lacks a
catalyst to increase revenues once Lipitor loses patent exclusivity.

   We expect the company to look to do a number of significant deals
in the pharma and biotech industry in order to build the franchise and
invest for the future. We believe there is currently little downside
price risk given the valuation and rate the shares a Hold with a $20
price target.

   UST Stays a Sell on Altria Bid

   UST, Inc. (NYSE: UST) is the leading producer of moist smokeless
tobacco products and dominates the premium sector of the domestic
market. However, the company has been steadily losing market share to
discounters in the sub-premium categories over the last 15 years. With
the announced acquisition by Altria Group (NYSE: MO) for $69.50 per
share in cash, the potential price appreciation for UST stockholders
is now limited. Hence, the rating is a Sell.

&lt;p&gt;SANTA CLARA (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Thursday he still sees a "certain buoyancy" among technology and telecommunications customers worldwide, despite recent U.S. economic woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our industry is not immune to what goes on in the global economy. And yet as I travel...given the current circumstances, people still see a certain buoyancy in the market," Ballmer told a meeting of Silicon Valley civic leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At least, for now, people are feeling, I won't say optimistic, but better than you would be feeling if you are watching CNBC all day," he said of the financial TV channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, the leader of the world's largest software maker, said he was speaking generally of industry demand rather than his own business. "We are one week from the end of the quarter, so I have nothing all that interesting to say," he joked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts, on average, expect the Redmond, Washington-based company to generate an 8 percent rise in revenue to just under $15 billion during its fiscal first quarter ending in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Eric Auchard; Editing by Anshuman Daga)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) plans to offer services
to phones powered by Google Inc's (GOOG.O) Android including
alerts when your credit card has been used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The credit card network also said in October, No. 1 mobile
phone maker Nokia (NOK1V.HE) would start selling the 6212
phone, which users could wave at an electronic reader to make
payments and use for remote payments and money transfers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said it was still developing its application to allow
in-store "contactless" payments by cell phone for Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it said these services --- already common in countries
such as Japan -- may not take off for years here as U.S. stores
would need to install new card readers and cell phones with the
corresponding technology would need to be in wider use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the meantime, Visa said on Thursday that it would  offer
transaction alerts and discount offers from merchants to
Android users. The application will also work with Google maps
and location technology to help users find nearby cash machines
and stores where special offers are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said that for the first few months, the application
will be available just to Android phone users who also have
Visa cards issued by JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) banks. It plans to
open the application to other banks in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, Google unveiled the first
Android-powered phone, which HTC Corp (2498.TW) is making and
Deutsche Telekom's (DTEGn.DE) T-Mobile [TMOG.UL] unit is
selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the initial Android device does not include hardware to
support contactless credit card payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim Attinger, Visa's global head of product development,
said that while mobile payment services have been slow to take
off, the company sees mobile phones as key to adding new
customers. Only 1.6 billion Visa cards are in use today,
compared with more than 3 billion people with cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're absolutely going to start porting financial services
into those," Attinger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Sinead Carew and Juan Lagorio; Editing by

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc
(WM.N) was closed by the U.S. government in by far the largest
failure of a U.S. bank, and its banking assets were sold to
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) for $1.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Thursday's seizure and sale is the latest historic step in
U.S. government attempts to clean up a banking industry
littered with toxic mortgage debt. Negotiations over a $700
billion bailout of the entire financial system stalled in
Washington on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual, the largest U.S. savings and loan, has
been one of the lenders hardest hit by the nation's housing
bust and credit crisis, and had already suffered from soaring
mortgage losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual was shut by the federal Office of Thrift
Supervision, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp was named
receiver. This followed $16.7 billion of deposit outflows at
the Seattle-based thrift since Sept 15, the OTS said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With insufficient liquidity to meet its obligations, WaMu
was in an unsafe and unsound condition to transact business,"
the OTS said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Customers should expect business as usual on Friday, and
all depositors are fully protected, the FDIC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said the bailout happened on
Thursday night because of media leaks, and to calm customers.
Usually, the FDIC takes control of failed institutions on
Friday nights, giving it the weekend to go through the books
and enable them to reopen smoothly the following Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual has about $307 billion of assets and $188
billion of deposits, regulators said. The largest previous U.S.
banking failure was Continental Illinois National Bank  Trust,
which had $40 billion of assets when it collapsed in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said the transaction means it will now have 5,410
branches in 23 U.S. states from coast to coast, as well as the
largest U.S. credit card business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It vaults JPMorgan past Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) to
become the nation's second-largest bank, with $2.04 trillion of
assets, just behind Citigroup Inc (C.N). Bank of America will
go to No. 1 once it completes its planned purchase of Merrill
Lynch  Co MER.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bailout also fulfills JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie
Dimon's long-held goal of becoming a retail bank force in the
western United States. It comes four months after JPMorgan
acquired the failing investment bank Bear Stearns Cos at a
fire-sale price through a government-financed transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a conference call, Dimon said the "risk here obviously
is the asset values."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added: "That's what created this opportunity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan expects to incur $1.5 billion of pre-tax costs,
but realize an equal amount of annual savings, mostly by the
end of 2010. It expects the transaction to add to earnings
immediately, and increase earnings 70 cents per share by 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also plans to sell $8 billion of stock, and take a $31
billion write-down for the loans it bought, representing
estimated future credit losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDIC said the acquisition does not cover claims of
Washington Mutual equity, senior debt and subordinated debt
holders. It also said the transaction will not affect its
roughly $45.2 billion deposit insurance fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Jamie Dimon is clearly feeling that he has an opportunity
to grab market share, and get it at fire-sale prices," said
Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager at Bahl  Gaynor Investment
Counsel in Cincinnati. "He's becoming an acquisition machine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BAILOUT UNCERTAINTY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The transaction came as Washington wrangles over the fate
of a $700 billion bailout of the financial services industry,
which has been battered by mortgage defaults and tight credit
conditions, and evaporating investor confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It removes an uncertainty from the market," said Shane
Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital in Sydney.
"The problem is that markets are in a jittery stage. Washington
Mutual provides another reminder how tenuous things are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual's collapse is the latest of a series of
takeovers and outright failures that have transformed the
American financial landscape and wiped out hundreds of billions
of dollars of shareholder wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These include the disappearance of Bear, government
takeovers of mortgage companies Fannie Mae FNM.P and Freddie
Mac FRE.P and the insurer American International Group Inc
(AIG.N), the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc
LEHMQ.PK, and Bank of America's purchase of Merrill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, based in New York, ended June with $1.78 trillion
of assets, $722.9 billion of deposits and 3,157 branches.
Washington Mutual then had 2,239 branches and 43,198 employees.
It is unclear how many people will lose their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Washington Mutual plunged $1.24 to 45 cents in
after-hours trading after news of a JPMorgan transaction
surfaced. JPMorgan shares rose $1.04 to $44.50 after hours, but
before the stock offering was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 119-YEAR HISTORY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The transaction ends exactly 119 years of independence for
Washington Mutual, whose predecessor was incorporated on Sept.
25, 1889, "to offer its stockholders a safe and profitable
vehicle for investing and lending," according to the thrift's
website. This helped Seattle residents rebuild after a fire
torched the city's downtown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also follows more than a week of sale talks in which
Washington Mutual attracted interest from several suitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These included Banco Santander SA (SAN.MC), Citigroup Inc
(C.N), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L), Toronto-Dominion Bank
(TD.TO) and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N), as well as private equity
firms Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) and Carlyle Group [CYL.UL],
people familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Less than three weeks ago, Washington Mutual ousted Chief
Executive Kerry Killinger, who drove the thrift's growth as
well as its expansion in subprime and other risky mortgages. It
replaced him with Alan Fishman, the former chief executive of
Brooklyn, New York's Independence Community Bank Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WaMu's board was surprised at the seizure, and had been
working on alternatives, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than half of Washington Mutual's roughly $227 billion
book of real estate loans was in home equity loans, and in
adjustable-rate mortgages and subprime mortgages that are now
considered risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The transaction wipes out a $1.35 billion investment by
David Bonderman's private equity firm TPG Inc [TPG.UL], the
lead investor in a $7 billion capital raising by the thrift in
April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A TPG spokesman said the firm is "dissatisfied with the
loss," but that the investment "represented a very small
portion of our assets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DIMON POUNCES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal is the latest ambitious move by Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once a golden child at Citigroup before his mentor Sanford
"Sandy" Weill engineered his ouster in 1998, Dimon has carved
for himself something of a role as a Wall Street savior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon joined JPMorgan in 2004 after selling his Bank One
Corp to the bank for $56.9 billion, and became chief executive
at the end of 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some historians see parallels between him and the legendary
financier John Pierpont Morgan, who ran J.P. Morgan  Co and
was credited with intervening to end a banking panic in 1907.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has suffered less than many rivals from the credit
crisis, but has been hurt. It said on Thursday it has already
taken $3 billion to $3.5 billion of write-downs this quarter on
mortgages and leveraged loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual has a major presence in California and
Florida, two of the states hardest hit by the housing crisis.
It also has a big presence in the New York City area. The
thrift lost $6.3 billion in the nine months ended June 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is surprising that it has hung on for as long as it
has," said Nancy Bush, an analyst at NAB Research LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Paritosh Bansal, Christian Plumb

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - With the acquisition of Washington Mutual Inc, (WM.N) JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon is starting to look a little more like this century's incarnation of John Pierpont Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan, who established the original J.P. Morgan  Co in 1871, organized a rescue of the banking system in the Panic of 1907. More than 100 years later, Dimon is buying failed banks in the midst of financial chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parallel is far from perfect. Dimon's rescues are first and foremost meant to be good deals for shareholders, and not necessarily noble efforts to stabilize the financial world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in an era of faltering financial institutions, Dimon's JPMorgan, now the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, seems about as strong as Morgan's did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He acquired investment bank Bear Stearns Cos in May through a government-financed fire sale, and agreed to acquire Washington Mutual's (WM.N) assets after the government took control of the largest U.S. savings and loan on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 52, has been something of a golden child on Wall Street ever since he was a protege of Sanford "Sandy" Weill at the company that would become Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan's chief New York commercial banking rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan edged out Citi, among others, in acquiring Washington Mutual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several books profiling Dimon are in the works, as his comments on Wall Street, its foibles and the U.S. economy become more influential. This is partly because JPMorgan has avoided much of the credit mess that has embroiled competitors and left Bear Stearns hobbled, Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK bankrupt and Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N sold to Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Jamie has earned the right by his performance to be a spokesman that people should pay attention to," Weill, the former Citigroup chief executive and chairman, said in an interview with Reuters in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for investors, JPMorgan shares have through Thursday dropped 0.4 percent or 19 cents this year, finishing on Thursday at $43.46, compared with an 18.7 percent slide in the KBW Banks Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his latest acquisition of the assets of the country's largest savings and loan, Dimon again took the statesman's role while snaring the deal for JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He has been a good risk manager. He has been able to reap the benefits," said Rick Meckler, chief investment officer of LibertyView Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO SHRINKING PERSONALITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Bruner, author of "The Panic of 1907" and dean of the Darden Business School at the University of Virginia, told Reuters in July that he sees some similarities between John Pierpont Morgan's handling of the 1907 financial markets' crisis and Dimon's acquisition of investment bank Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan took over Bear Stearns after the latter suffered the equivalent of a bank run. Part of the reason JPMorgan became involved was that it was considered by the government to be the financial institution best equipped to absorb the 85-year-old company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He sets an example at an institution that is itself exemplar," Bruner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving Citigroup, Dimon became chief executive at Chicago's underperforming Bank One Corp, where he slashed costs and improved operations. He engineered that bank's $58 billion takeover by JPMorgan in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon is known for being boisterous, opinionated and unafraid to speak his mind, even if it means talking over colleagues on calls with analysts and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who know him say Dimon cuts his peers no slack. On a conference call for Wall Street chieftains while JPMorgan was rescuing Bear Stearns, Dimon shot down a somewhat technical question from Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit, who has a doctorate in finance.

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Global banking giant JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) has named Russian economic reformer Anatoly Chubais, one of the least popular figures among the Russian public, to its international advisory board, it said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) had as much as $20 billion at risk had the insurer
American International Group Inc (AIG.N) collapsed, the New

&lt;p&gt; Goldman was AIG's largest trading partner, the newspaper

Goldman, the newspaper said, citing several of the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street bank told the newspaper that it was never
imperiled by AIG's troubles. Spokesman Lucas van Praag also
disputed the $20 billion figure, saying it did not account for
collateral and hedges that Goldman employed to reduce risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The AIG bailout came after the New York-based insurer saw
losses spiral on credit default swaps, which are insurance
contracts whose value is tied to underlying securities such as
mortgages and corporate debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A failure of AIG might have had cascading effects

AIG Chief Executive Edward Liddy tried to reassure customers
that the company would keep operating as normally as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our insurance companies remain strong and well
capitalized," he said. "The financial issues of the AIG parent
company do not affect our insurance companies' ability to pay
claims and underwrite new policies. Regulations ensure that the
assets of our insurance companies are there to back up each
policy. You are protected. Your policies are safe."

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil's Methanol to Gasoline (MTG) Technology Selected for Synthesis Energy Systems' Coal to Liquids Projects

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company (EMRE) today announced
that it has entered into an agreement with Synthesis Energy Systems
(SES) that provides SES the option to execute up to fifteen Methanol
to Gasoline technology licenses in their global operations. SES has
chosen to assign the first license to a project near Benwood, West
Virginia.

   This approximate 7,000 barrel per calendar day unit will be based
on commercially proven MTG technology which incorporates improvements
since the technology was originally commercialized by ExxonMobil 20
years ago in New Zealand.

   MTG converts crude methanol directly to low sulfur, low benzene
gasoline that can be sold directly or blended with conventional
refinery gasoline. Although the original application of the MTG
technology processed methanol from natural gas, the same technology
can be used for methanol from other sources such as coal, petcoke or
biomass. The SES projects will gasify the coal, convert the synthetic
gas to methanol, and then convert the methanol to gasoline via the MTG
process. Conversion of coal to gasoline through gasification and
methanol conversion is one way to significantly reduce the potential
pollutants from coal, including the reduction of SOx emissions and the
capture of CO2.

   EMRE is the research and engineering arm of Exxon Mobil
Corporation (NYSE:XOM), a leading global oil, natural gas, and
petrochemicals company whose subsidiaries have operations in nearly
200 countries and territories. Additional information regarding
ExxonMobil and technologies it licenses can be found at
http://www.exxonmobil.com/refiningtechnologies.

   SES is focused on converting coal to higher priced products by
investment in a project with a short construction schedule at a lower
capital cost, and a closer proximity to a coal sources. More
information can be found at http://www.synthesisenergy.com.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
has sealed a 500 million pound ($901 million) deal to take on a

base by buying deposits from other banks, including those in

regulators to find $50 billion in assets it could by from the
struggling banks. Those assets would be in addition to the $150

&lt;p&gt;  RALEIGH, NC, Sep 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
At IBM's (NYSE: IBM) largest employee site in the United States, Olympic
Gold Medalist Cullen Jones hopes to begin another gold-winning relay team
with employees as the company begins its nationwide annual Employee
Charitable Contribution Campaign (ECCC).

    Cullen Jones will be speaking to Raleigh-based employees on Wednesday,
October 1 as part of The Cullen Jones Diversity Tour/Make a Splash, aimed
to prevent drowning and encourage swimming among minorities. IBM is a
sponsor of the Diversity Tour.

    "It's estimated that 60 percent of minorities do not know how to swim,"
said Cullen Jones. "The Make a Splash non profit is trying to change that
by teaching children and adults a life-saving skill."

    Over the last five years, IBM employees nationwide have contributed nearly
$170 million to their non profits of choice as part of the ECCC. The ECCC
is a voluntary, employee-driven fund-raising event that offers IBM
employees the opportunity to contribute to not profits. Make a Splash, a
program of the USA Swimming Foundation, is now one of more than 4,500 non
profits IBM employees can contribute to.

    "Helping to make a difference in the lives of people where we work and
live is a large part of what it means to be an IBM employee," said Bob
Greenberg, IBM Senior State Executive for North Carolina.

    In the U.S. more than 43,000 employees are registered to the company's
corporate volunteer program called On Demand Community (ODC), and
contributed more than 2 million volunteer hours this year to date. In
North Carolina, IBM employees and retirees contributed almost $3 million
as part of the ECCC last year. In addition, more than 4,900 IBM employees
and retirees in North Carolina participate in the ODC, and have
contributed more than 460,000 volunteer hours to date this year.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW DELHI, INDIA, Sep 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it has retained its leadership in
the India domestic IT services market and registered a market share of
9.6% for calendar year 2007, according to leading IT market research and
advisory firm IDC(1). This was driven by significant, large-scale
business transformation engagements, signings across consulting and
application services portfolios and growth in Integrated Technology
Services, Strategic Outsourcing, and Maintenance &amp; Technical Support.

    Commenting on the company's continued market dominance, Nipun Mehrotra,
Vice President and General Manager, Global Technology Services, IBM
India/South Asia, said, "It is indeed a great honor to be recognized as a
leader by IDC in the domestic IT services market. While organizations in
India put their efforts towards the next phase of growth, they
simultaneously want to mitigate any kind of risk that may impede their
growth. Organizations today understand the significance of optimizing
their investments on IT and viewing both IT and business strategy as a
complementary piece and not isolated. To realize all these, they are
looking up to partners like IBM who can help their business really grow
and not just stop short at fulfilling some need-based IT requirements."

    "The India domestic IT services market has grown to be over US$ 5 billion
in 2007 and this growth can be attributed to the growth in number of
outsourcing contracts being signed up in the country," said Praveen
Sengar, Senior Manager, Software &amp; Services Research, IDC India. "Vendors
that continue to invest in building their capabilities will find numerous
opportunities to tap the rapidly-growing demand for services from local
customers as Indian enterprises' IT deployments increase in maturity and
complexity to meet emerging business challenges."

    According to IBM, in order to effectively address unique customer
requirements, the company has been leveraging its world-wide capabilities,
assets, innovative approaches and experience. The company has a wide range
of global assets -- both from technology and business perspective, and it
is able to replicate these assets for clients in India as well. IBM is
also creating unique solutions and localizing innovation efforts to cater
to specific client needs in an Indian context.

    "The Indian domestic IT market has witnessed huge transformational deals
lately as opposed to stand-alone services in a piece-meal fashion from
multiple vendors and this trend is likely to grow as companies ride the
growth wave to differentiate in the market and become players in the
global economy," said Sandip Patel, Managing Partner and General Manager,
Global Business Services, IBM India/South Asia. "Clients want global
know-how and prefer a partner like IBM so they can leverage the length
and breadth of technological innovation, global industry skills, and
financial strength. What separates us from the rest is our ability to
combine industry insights, software, hardware and consultancy into
business solutions for our clients."

    IBM Global Services works closely with over 2,200 organizations in India,
spanning across varied industries, providing them diverse spectrum of IT
services. 2007 saw the company signing up customers -- small, mid-sized
and large -- across all the key industries and regions. Driven by strong
market demand for IBM's deep insights and expertise in the areas such as
business transformation and reengineering, IT infrastructure design and
management, green data centre as well as business continuity and disaster
management, IBM Global Services continued to sign up major deals and new
wins in the first six months of 2008.

&lt;p&gt;Investors should focus on banks such as Synovus Financial (SNV.N), Colonial BanGroup CNB.N and Zions Bancorp (ZION.O) as these will benefit from the stability in the housing markets proposed in the relief program, analyst Steven Alexopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Friedman Billings Ramsey analyst Paul Miller sees only modest, short-term benefit for community and regional banks in the brokerage's coverage universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem, in our opinion, remains over-levered balance sheets that require a combination of balance sheet contraction and raising of equity capital to permanently address investors' concerns regarding long-term solvency of many institutions, Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers are in talks over a proposed financial system bailout, which included buying of soured assets and a change in treatment of government sponsored enterprises' preferred stock losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley analyst Ken Zerbe expects certain banks in the group to benefit from a potential change in the treatment of government sponsored enterprises' (GSE) preferred stock losses by U.S. authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe Sovereign Bancorp SOV.N would benefit the most if the tax proposal is enacted, as it currently does not have sufficient capital gains to offset the projected impairment loss on its GSE holdings," Zerbe wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colonial and Synovus Financial are the brokerage's highest conviction "underweight"(s) in the mid-sized banks' group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zerbe still favors better-capitalized banks, such as Hudson City Bancorp (HCBK.O) and People's United Financial (PBCT.O), given the economic uncertainty and the possibility that the nation moves into a recession by end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Amitha Rajan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  EATONTOWN, NJ, Sep 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Quintum Technologies, an innovator in VoIP technologies and a subsidiary
of Network Equipment Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: NWK), announced today that
Dairylea Cooperative Inc., the Northeast's largest milk marketer, has
chosen Quintum's Tenor DX Series VoIP switches and gateways to support
its implementation of Microsoft Unified Communications (UC).

    With Quintum's Tenor gateway, Dairylea has been able to successfully
deploy Microsoft UC in its existing network and telecom environment --
which features a seven-year-old Avaya Definity(TM) PBX. Microsoft UC
users' IP phones can connect through the Tenor to the PBX, so they can
call non-UC users inside and outside the company just as they did before.
No modification at all of the PBX was necessary.

    This ability to implement Microsoft UC without modification of the PBX was
of significant benefit to Dairylea, since such modifications can be
extremely costly and time-consuming.

    Dairylea's staff depends heavily on voice communications to effectively
serve the 2,400 member farms in its cooperative. Dairylea is deploying
Microsoft UC to enhance its voice communications in a number of ways. For
example, with Microsoft UC, Dairylea's staff can use their IP phones to
receive calls to their main work numbers at home or at other locations on
the company's virtual private network (VPN). Microsoft UC also provides
Dairylea's staff with presence awareness -- which helps eliminate "phone
tag."

    Dairylea switched to Quintum's Tenor solution after another VoIP vendor
failed to fully support interoperability between Definity and Microsoft
UC. Internal caller ID proved to be a particular problem with the other
vendor's hardware and software.

    According to Jim Snodgrass, president of Siiker Communications, the
consultancy that is managing Dairylea's Microsoft UC initiative, Quintum
provided superior technical support -- in addition to offering a more
effective hardware solution.

    "Quintum was able to deliver in two days what our other vendor was unable
to deliver in two weeks," says Snodgrass. "The Tenor DX gateway is an
excellent choice for integrating IP convergence technology into legacy
analog telephony environments, and Quintum's staff is highly knowledgeable
about the idiosyncrasies of these types of integrations."

    About Dairylea:

    Dairylea has more than 2,500 member farms located throughout the Northeast
with annual sales approaching $1 billion. Dairylea markets 5.5 billion
pounds of raw milk on an annual basis for its member farms. They have
become the largest milk marketing cooperative in the Northeast. Dairylea
can be reached at 315-433-0100 or visit their website at www.dairylea.com.

&lt;p&gt;Fortisphere Extends Industry Leading Heterogeneous Management
                  Support of Virtual Infrastructures
CHANTILLY, Va.--(Business Wire)--
Fortisphere, a leading provider of policy-based virtualization
management software, today announced that its Virtual Essentials(TM)
product suite has achieved "Certified for Windows Server 2008" status
and will support Hyper-V, Microsoft's next-generation hypervisor-based
server virtualization technology. Designed for line-of-business and
mission-critical applications, the Certified for Windows Server 2008
program demonstrates that Fortisphere has met the highest technical
bar for stability, security, reliability, availability and platform
compatibility.

   A Microsoft Certified Partner and member of the Microsoft
Accelerator Program, Fortisphere is committed to providing the
automation, visibility and control required for effective policy-based
management of heterogeneous virtual infrastructures. As organizations
deploy offerings from multiple vendors such as Microsoft, Fortisphere
will continue to pioneer solutions that provide support for
multi-vendor virtual infrastructures.

   A May 15, 2008 Gartner report "Preparing for Heterogeneous
Virtualization: The Third and Most Challenging Phase" by George J.
Weiss and John Enck states that "the future of virtualization will
trend toward pervasiveness across IT data centers. Most large data
centers deploy a variety of vendor-specific architectures, such as
mainframes, Unix systems, x86/x64 platforms and vendor-specific legacy
systems. Various form factors include blades, racks, frames and
towers. Unless logical transparency can be delivered, virtualization
will be destined to be deployed in silos specific to vendor platforms
and management solutions. Maximizing the benefits of virtualization
across heterogeneous systems will help optimize resource use,
availability, agility and granularity."

   "We are committed to helping our customers more efficiently manage
their virtual infrastructures, regardless of the underlying
virtualization technology," said Mike Harper, president and CEO,
Fortisphere. "With early, pent-up demand, Microsoft clearly has
innovative solutions like Hyper-V that will allow them to be a market
leader. Fortisphere is excited to be one of the first vendors to
support new customers deploying both Windows Server 2008 and Hyper-V."

   "By delivering economical and accessible virtualization
technologies for desktop to datacenter environments, Microsoft is
helping customers receive the benefits our Dynamic IT strategy has to
offer by enabling them to achieve a more agile IT infrastructure,"
said David Greschler, director, integrated virtualization at
Microsoft. "Fortisphere's support of Windows Server 2008 with Hyper-V
through their policy-based virtualization management solution
complements Hyper-V by providing the automation, visibility and
control required to help effectively manage heterogeneous virtual
environments."

   About Fortisphere

   Fortisphere is the leading provider of policy-based virtualization
management software that ensures virtualized environments operate
efficiently, effectively and securely. With its patent-pending Inside
Track(TM) Technology, Fortisphere is pioneering solutions that provide
a new level of visibility, control and automation around the
inventory, configuration and policy-based management of virtual
machines.

   Fortisphere is a venture-backed company, headquartered in
Chantilly, VA, with offices in Boston, MA and Glenwood, MD. More

&lt;p&gt;BROOMFIELD, Colo.--(Business Wire)--
Plasmon PLC (LSE:PLM), the trusted source in archiving solutions,
today announced that it is working with IBM to provide a disaster
recovery solution that moves companies beyond a reliance on backup and
gives customers trusted, timely and cost-effective recovery of
critical data. Plasmon's UDO Archive Appliance(TM) is being combined
with IBM's Hot Site Recovery Service to allow IBM FileNet P8 customers
to leverage, simultaneously, the unique strengths of archival disk and
optical media in a single system. This combination allows customers to
address data accessibility, disaster recovery and other archive
requirements in a way that traditional storage products cannot.

   With industry statistics estimating the cost of downtime averaging
between $85,000 and $90,000 an hour, disaster recovery and business
continuity continue to be business imperatives. For IBM FileNet P8
customers that have demanding recovery time objectives, the enhanced
Hot Site Recovery service that includes Plasmon's Archive Appliance
now provides a solution to meet this objective in a faster, more
cost-effective manner.

   Utilizing Plasmon's Archive Appliance, P8 customers write data to
Archival RAID storage allowing for quick information access during
everyday use. As part of this process, archived data is also
automatically copied to removable and highly durable UDO (Ultra
Density Optical) disks for long-term storage by the Archive Appliance.

   As part of IBM's enhanced Hot Site Recovery solution these optical
disks, which can provide over 100 years of longevity, are then shipped
to an offsite location providing further security and recoverability
options. If a disaster or crisis occurs, the optical disks can be
transferred to the customers' IBM Hot Site locations along with backup
copies of the IBM FileNet P8 databases for restoration. Unlike backup
data, which must be laboriously transferred back onto disk to be
accessible online, the archived data on UDO is available for online
access as soon as it has been placed within a standby Archive
Appliance at the IBM Hot Site. This solution allows IBM customers to
move beyond reliance on time-consuming tape-based recovery or
resorting to expensive redundant storage.

   "Working with IBM and communicating the value of the Archive
Appliance to customers looking for faster, more cost-effective
recovery options will help drive a further understanding of the
importance of archiving data on multiple types of media to achieve a
true archive that is protected for the life of the data but still
easily accessible," said Steven Murphy, CEO, Plasmon. "Forging
relationships with market leaders like IBM is key to our strategy of
helping companies address their archiving and backup challenges in a
more simplified manner."

   About the UDO Archive Appliance

   Plasmon has combined the performance and simplicity of network
attached RAID with the longevity and authenticity of Ultra Density
Optical (UDO) in the Archive Appliance to establish a new standard for
archival storage. The UDO Archive Appliance easily integrates with
content management, email and imaging applications, and enables
organizations to deploy an archival storage strategy that meets their
compliance and risk management requirements at a very low total cost
of ownership.

   About Plasmon

   For more than 21 years, Plasmon has partnered with leading
organizations worldwide to implement long-term archiving solutions.
Plasmon provides customers with a proven methodology for establishing
and managing enterprise archives as part of their IT and business
processes. Plasmon solutions are designed specifically for long-term
archiving without a product agenda and offer customers choice and
flexibility to help them manage data growth, reduce archive
complexity, enhance operation efficiencies, reduce cost and mitigate
governance risk.

   Founded in 1987, Plasmon PLC is listed on the London Stock
Exchange (LSE:PLM) and is headquartered in Cambridge, United Kingdom
with offices globally. For more information, visit www.plasmon.com.

&lt;p&gt;Restaurant Handheld Ordering System Meets Pay at the Table
                         Security Requirements
EMERYVILLE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
TriniTEQ, Inc. a leading developer of handheld hospitality point
of sale systems, announced today that its WaiterPAD system has
successfully completed Payment Application Best Practices (PABP)
compliance testing performed by information security assessment and
data protection company, Digital Resources Group (DRG). As a Validated
Payment Application, WaiterPAD now allows restaurant patrons to
securely pay at the table.

   Paying at the table allows servers to swipe credit cards
tableside, in the presence of the consumer, preventing the credit card
from leaving the table. In addition to enabling secure tableside
payment, WaiterPAD is a complete handheld ordering system designed for
hospitality. First deployed in 1999, WaiterPAD is used by thousands of
major restaurants, bars, cafes, theaters and sporting venues around
the world.

   As a Visa-designated Qualified Payment Application Security
Company, DRG conducted extensive security testing to validate
WaiterPAD's PABP compliance. Jim Cowing, CISSP, QPASP and Managing
Director of Digital Resources Group, noted that, "DRG's testing
covered all aspects of the application that stores, processes or
transmits payment information including the handheld and wireless
system. Successful completion of PABP is a noteworthy accomplishment
for TriniTEQ. PABP validation demonstrates the WaiterPAD application
has met all requirements that the Payment Card Industry has
established to ensure merchants are using a secure application that
protects their customer's cardholder data."

   As a low frequency, long-range Radio Frequency (RF) system,
WaiterPAD has advantages over Wi-Fi systems for pay at the table. In
restaurants with commonly found enclosed rooms, microwaves, glass,
steel and liquids, WaiterPAD requires fewer wireless access points and
reduces security risk by avoiding more commonly trafficked Wi-Fi
frequencies.

   "Hospitality security requirements continue to rise in response to
sophisticated and often well publicized security breaches," commented
James Vote, CTO, TriniTEQ. "PABP compliance validation is an important
milestone given WaiterPAD's design as high-profile hospitality
enterprises' handheld of choice for reliable ordering, up-selling and
now secure payment at the table."

&lt;p&gt;JPIX, the Largest Internet Exchange in Japan, Extends Peering Fabric to Equinix Tokyo Data Center

  Partnership Allows Both Companies to Further Enhance Their Traffic
                           Exchange Services
TOKYO--(Business Wire)--
Equinix, Inc. (Nasdaq:EQIX), the leading global provider of
network-neutral data centers and Internet exchange services, and Japan
Internet Exchange Co. Ltd. (JPIX), the largest Internet exchange in
Japan, today announced that JPIX has extended its peering fabric to
the Equinix Tokyo-2 (TY2) Internet Business Exchange (IBX(R)) data
center located in Shinagawa. As a part of the agreement, Equinix
customers will be able to directly exchange traffic, or "peer," with
JPIX's diverse aggregation of Internet service providers, cable TV
service providers and content providers, allowing high-quality traffic
exchange participants to increase reliability, improve performance and
reduce the costs of network traffic exchange.

   JPIX, with over 100 customers, including Japan's Tier-1 ISPs,
cable TV service providers and content providers, is a strategic
exchange point for Internet traffic in Japan. Through this agreement,
JPIX will set up an Internet Exchange (IX) switch at the Equinix TY2
center, and it will use Equinix's IBXLink service to directly connect
to the Equinix TY1 center located in Heiwajima.

   Equinix is the global leader in interconnection and peering,
offering high-performance private and public peering services. The
peering relationships facilitated by Equinix's interconnection

&lt;p&gt;Disney Store Unveils Exclusive Line of Camp Rock and Hannah Montana Costumes; Magical Styles Make Tweens Shine Like Stars on Halloween Night

  Favorite Characters Bring the Magic of Disney to the Younger Crowd
PASADENA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney Store's exclusive line of 2008 Halloween costumes capture
the fun, spirit and music of the most popular Disney Channel hits -
Camp Rock, Hannah Montana and High School Musical. From sparkling
Disney Princess costumes outfitted with faceted jewels to shimmering
Disney Fairies with light up wings and rowdy pirates from Disney's
Pirates of the Caribbean who glow in the dark, Disney Store offers the
most magical costumes available.

   "Disney Store costumes are some of the most fabulous, high-quality
costumes available," said Molly Adams, VP General Manager, Disney
Store. "We're very excited about our Camp Rock and Hannah Montana
costumes -- you won't find these styles at any other specialty
retailer."

   Even the family pet can get in on the Halloween fun -- Disney
Store offers matching Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse style dog
costumes.

   For Tweens

   New for 2008, tweens can live out their rock star dreams in an
exclusively styled "Mitchie" costume based on the outfit she wears in
the Camp Rock Beach Jam scene.

   Tweens will also have a hard time choosing between Disney Store's
two Hannah Montana costumes -- the funky rock star costume or the gold
pop star costume. For some extra Halloween spirit, tweens can also
chose from a High School Musical two-piece cheerleader costume with
matching pompoms sold separately.

   For Girls

   Disney Store's jewel-themed Deluxe Cinderella or Belle costumes
will make girls feel like royalty. The sparkling white Deluxe Giselle
wedding dress features elaborate embellishments similar to the
original that inspired it.

   With extra detailing and beautiful designs, this year's line of
Disney Princess and other girls' costumes are inspired by favorites
including Ariel, Belle, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty (Aurora), Snow
White, Tinker Bell, Alice in Wonderland and Minnie Mouse. Additional
accessories include jewel topped light-up wands and matching glitter
encrusted light-up shoes for added visibility, as well as fancy wedge
heel dress shoes.

   For Boys

   New for 2008, Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean-inspired Glow in

Lightyear costumes are ready for any adventure with exciting details
like light-up goggles, gloves and wings for Buzz. Also, for boys is a
new red racing suit with sound and light-up features based on the
Disney Pixar film Cars.

   Boys can choose to never grow up and fly away to Never Land with
this year's Peter Pan costume. They can also choose to be his
arch-nemesis pirate Captain Hook. The red Power Rangers Jungle Fury
costume allows boys to become part of the ultimate force of good as
they draw upon animal strength to protect the earth from evil.

   For Infants and Toddlers

   New for 2008, Disney Store introduces toddler sizes in styles
based on the Playhouse Disney preschool series My Friends Tigger and
Pooh. These masked super sleuths Tigger and Pooh styles can help boys
and girls unravel the mysteries of the Hundred Acre Woods. Disney
Store also will once again offer "bubble plush" costumes for children
ages infant to toddler. New additions to the line include Daisy Duck,
as well as Goofy and Pluto, each with a new squeak feature built-in

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is looking to buy up to $50 billion in assets from troubled U.S. banks, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing executives at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newspaper said it is looking to buy the assets as part of its transition into commercial banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday, Goldman and rival Morgan Stanley said they would become bank holding companies, enabling them to accept deposits and killing the investment bank model that had dominated Wall Street for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said then that it intends to expand its deposit base by buying deposits from other banks, including those in distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times said Goldman plans to talk to U.S. regulators to find $50 billion in assets it could by from the struggling banks. Those assets would be in addition to the $150 billion of its own assets it is moving to its Utah industrial loan corporation, a bank regulated in that state, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Erman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Chemical's Exxtral Performance Polyolefins Specified for Interiors of New Citroen Berlingo and Peugeot Partner

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical's Exxtral(TM) performance polyolefins have
been specified for four interior components of the new Citroen
Berlingo and Peugeot Partner manufactured by PSA Peugeot Citroen
Group. The components include the instrument panel, door panel, and
upper and lower trim.

   PSA Peugeot Citroen Group is the first automotive original
equipment manufacturer (OEM) to specify ExxonMobil Chemical's Exxtral
BMU141 polyolefin for use in instrument panels. Exxtral polyolefin was
selected because it offers a unique balance of impact strength and
stiffness and is easy to mold.

   "The development of the Berlingo and Partner instrument panels is
an excellent example of collaboration with the automotive OEM and the
Tier One supplier. Our global network of product, application and
technical service engineers works closely with our customers, helping
them improve their processes and components," said Jim R. McKinley,
global manager, ExxonMobil Chemical specialty compounds business.
"This helps facilitate application development delivering parts more
quickly to the marketplace."

   Exxtral performance polyolefins also have been specified for the
door panel and upper and lower trim because they offer a lightweight
alternative to other materials used in these applications. Providing
design flexibility for part consolidation, these polyolefins are
replacing difficult to recycle material combinations of more costly
engineered thermoplastics.

   Exxtral performance polyolefins are becoming increasingly popular
with automotive designers and processors looking for new materials
that offer reductions in weight without sacrificing strength as well
as excellent surface appearance, paintability or the ability to
mold-in color. They are durable in adverse conditions and
competitively priced. They also provide outstanding surface hardness,
good "fit and finish" characteristics and fast cycle times.

   According to PSA Peugeot Citroen Group, the Berlingo is the
benchmark and European leader in the ludospace(a) category. The new
Berlingo is described as an authentic all-rounder that meets the
growing demand for freedom and versatility in use. It retains the
ultra-functional, family-friendly character of the original and
strengthens its personality with dynamic up-market styling. Stylish,
dynamic and robust, it possesses refined interior styling that is both
modern and hard-wearing. Citroen has used premium materials that give
the cabin a prestigious feel.

   (a) A ludospace is a medium size, recreational, light utility
vehicle.

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Records Revisits Tim Burton's Cult Classic The
  Nightmare Before Christmas with the Release of Nightmare Revisited

   Features Brand New Covers of the Danny Elfman Original Soundtrack
          by Korn, Amy Lee, Plain White T's, Flyleaf &amp; More!
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
On September 30, Walt Disney Records unveils Nightmare Revisited
with 20 fresh recordings and beloved covers of the music, mayhem, and
merriment from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Danny
Elfman returns to recapture the musical landscape he masterfully
created for the original The Nightmare Before Christmas soundtrack
with two brand new recordings of the "Opening" and "Closing." Adding a
new tantalizing twist to Nightmare favorites, Nightmare Revisited also
boasts an eclectic array of today's music superstars including Korn,
Amy Lee, Plain White T's, Rise Against, Rodrigo y Gabriela, and
Flyleaf. Of course the soundtrack could not be complete without a
popular ghost of Nightmare's past: Marilyn Manson's eerie cover of
"This Is Halloween."

   Each artist re-imagines the most beloved Nightmare anthems,
incorporating their signature styles and bringing a hauntingly
delightful new sound to life.

   Danny Elfman adds, "The new Nightmare Revisited is much more
diverse compared to the 13th Anniversary Special Edition. The approach
in every song is different. Instead of just covering the songs, they
turned groups loose on the score itself. Hearing all these
interpretations of the songs and score is a huge treat. There are
bands with their psychedelic abstract visions - Sparkle Horse, Vitamin
String Quartet and Polyphonic Spree -- and they're counter-balanced
with solid performances by Korn, Rise Against and All American
Rejects."

masterfully created for the film. Key tracks from the soundtrack and
film include: "This Is Halloween," the song which introduces the
storyline; "Jack's Lament," in which Jack expresses his frustration
with his life; "What's This?," Jack's exuberant testimonial to
Christmastown; "Jack's Obsession" in which Jack realizes his new-found
desire for Christmastown; "Kidnap the Sandy Claws," which unveils
Lock, Shock and Barrel's plan to abduct Santa Claus; "Making
Christmas," Halloweentown's off-kilter impression of Christmas;
"Sally's Song," a tender ballad of unrequited love; "Oogie Boogie's
Song," the evil demon's gloriously ghoulish tribute to himself; "Poor
Jack," a song of self-awakening in which Jack discovers he truly
belongs in Halloweentown; and the finale reprise performed by Jack,
Sally, and the citizens of Halloweentown. Supported by an evocative
and suspenseful underscore, the soundtrack is a dazzling marriage of
music and innovative technique.

&lt;p&gt;TAMPA, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
TeamZoneSports (www.teamzonesports.com), a free, private social
network specializing in online team management, communication,
coordination and information sharing, today announced that Microsoft
has published two case studies highlighting TeamZoneSports' use of
several Microsoft technologies.

   One case study shows how integrating Microsoft technologies helps
ensure efficient and highly reliable communications for TeamZoneSports
members. Using a software-plus-services approach based on Microsoft
technologies such as Microsoft Silverlight and Microsoft Office
Communications Server 2007 allowed TeamZoneSports to provide its
members with a highly reliable platform for media sharing and
communications. Silverlight, a cross-browser, cross-platform plug-in
for delivering the next-generation of rich interactive applications
for the Web, enables members an easy way to upload and share pictures
and videos as well as view online sports training videos. A
software-plus-services approach allows TeamZoneSports members to share
information in several ways, providing teams with a single destination
to perform all team related online activities. Readers can view the
case study by going to:
www.microsoft.com/casestudies/casestudy.aspx?casestudyid=4000002457.

   The second case study focuses on TeamZoneSports' use of Microsoft
Virtual Earth. Knowing the importance of punctuality in team sports,
TeamZoneSports looked to Microsoft Virtual Earth mapping technology to
enable members to retrieve accurate and up-to-date directions as well
as other geographical information directly from the TeamZoneSports
site. When initially setting up a team, users input their postal code,
which TeamZoneSports links to Virtual Earth telling the program the
location of the team. The site using Virtual Earth provides detailed
driving directions and a map print-out for convenience. Apart from
other mapping technologies, Virtual Earth provides a bird's-eye view
or a 45-degree angle shot of a designated location allowing visibility
for the user. Readers can view the case study by going to:
www.microsoft.com/casestudies/casestudy.aspx?casestudyid=4000002456.

   "TeamZoneSports' use of Microsoft Virtual Earth mapping platform
provides clear geographical information for an immersive customer
experience on the online social network," said Chris Sampson, director
of Virtual Earth Sales and Operations. "The seamless integration of
Virtual Earth into the Web site allows members to easily navigate to
games and practices with rich maps and driving directions."

   "Use of Microsoft technologies has enabled us to quickly deliver
and continuously innovate a valuable, free service to our members,"
said Craig Blackburn, TeamZoneSports' Chief Operations Officer.
"Joining with Microsoft has given us a distinct competitive and
sustainable advantage as we contemplate a move into this lucrative
market."

&lt;p&gt;OSLO (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Tuesday the global financial crisis will sap consumer and business spending, affecting all companies, including his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Financial issues are going to affect both business spending and consumer spending, and particularly ... spending by the financial services industry," Ballmer told reporters on the sidelines of a news conference in the Norwegian capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a lot of business with the corporate sector as well as with the consumer sector and whatever happens economically will certainly effect itself on Microsoft," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think one has to anticipate that no company is immune to these issues," he said, but declined to be more specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts, on average, expect the Redmond, Washington-based company to generate an 8 percent rise in revenue to just under $15 billion in its first-quarter ending in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are parts of our every business which are probably 'safe' in the sense that it's not like our business would go to zero," he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the other hand, when businesses have less money -- they can borrow less money, they can spend less money -- that can't be good. When consumers feel the economic pinch, house prices come down. That can't be good," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 2.9 percent to $25.73 at 11:17 a.m. EDT in a broader U.S. market rebound following a sharp slide on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ballmer's comments weighed on the shares of German software maker SAP AG (SAPG.DE), which fell 2.0 percent and were among the heaviest fallers in Germany's DAX index .GDAXI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors may take Ballmer's remarks as an indication that Microsoft's revenues could be hurt by the continuing financial crisis, a trader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By extension, these fears have worked their way over to SAP," the trader added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"TRUST" IN U.S. LAWMAKERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said he believed the U.S. Congress would soon help stabilize the situation after rejecting a $700 billion bank bailout plan on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I trust that before the end of the week we have some resolution, at least in the U.S. Congress, that will help to stabilize the situation.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has taken the following rating action on the U.S.
residential mortgage servicer ratings for Walter Mortgage Company
(WMCo):

   --Residential primary servicer rating for subprime product
affirmed at 'RPS3-'.

   This rating action reflects WMCo's seasoned management team,
adequate loan administration procedures, and competent default
management practices. WMCo is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of
Walter Industries, Inc.

   WMCo's servicing portfolio consisted of over 39,000 accounts
totaling $2.06 billion as of Dec. 31, 2007. More than 90% of the
accounts in WMCo's servicing portfolio were sourced through a sister
company, Jim Walter Homes, Inc. (JWH), which provides financing on the
majority of the houses that it constructs, with the balance purchased
from third parties including other home builders, mortgage companies,
and banks. Approximately 90% of the accounts serviced by WMCo are
included in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), with the
balance owned by the company. WMCo's business model for servicing
focuses on a niche market that includes accounts originated by JWH
that often involve first time home buyers, and are generally subprime
fixed rate mortgages with rural collateral.

   WMCo's servicing operation is headquartered in Tampa, FL, with an
additional servicing site in Fort Worth, TX and divisional field
offices in Atlanta, GA, Birmingham, AL, Charlotte, NC, and Houston,
TX. As of Dec. 31, 2007 WMCo had a servicing staff of 166 full time
equivalent positions, which included approximately 100 full time field
servicing employees. WMCo pursues a strategy of high touch, direct
contact servicing, employing field representatives who are involved in
all stages of collections and default management through disposition
of real estate owned. WMCo's collection activity begins predominantly
after an account becomes 30 days delinquent. However, having field
representatives make direct contact with delinquent borrowers allows
the company to pursue loss mitigation resolutions during the
collections process on a face-to-face basis.

   WMCo is in the process of converting its originations platform to
originate FHA product. Management indicated that initially it plans to
sell those assets to FHA approved lenders/servicers, which would
reduce internal originations for its servicing portfolio. Fitch
believes that WMCo is a capable servicer with competent systems,
established processes and adequate controls. However, Fitch will
continue to monitor WMCo's ability to maintain its performance while
pursuing its servicing initiatives in a high delinquency environment.

   Fitch rates residential mortgage primary, master, and special
servicers on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the highest rating.
Within some of these rating levels, Fitch further differentiates
ratings by plus (+) and minus (-) as well as the flat rating. For more
information on Fitch's residential servicer rating program, please see
Fitch's report 'Rating U.S. Residential Mortgage Servicers', dated
Nov. 29, 2006, which is available on the Fitch Ratings web site at
www.fitchratings.com.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes from interview, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tarmo Virki&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSLO, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) Chief Executive
Steve Ballmer said on Tuesday the global financial crisis will
sap consumer and business spending, affecting all companies,
including his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Financial issues are going to affect both business spending
and consumer spending, and particularly ... spending by the
financial services industry," Ballmer told reporters on the
sidelines of a news conference in the Norwegian capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have a lot of business with the corporate sector as well
as with the consumer sector and whatever happens economically
will certainly effect itself on Microsoft," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think one has to anticipate that no company is immune to
these issues," he said, but declined to be more specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street analysts, on average, expect the Redmond,
Washington-based company to generate an 8 percent rise in
revenue to just under $15 billion in its first-quarter ending in
September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are parts of our every business which are probably
'safe' in the sense that it's not like our business would go to
zero," he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On the other hand, when businesses have less money -- they
can borrow less money, they can spend less money -- that can't

come down. That can't be good," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares rose 2.9 percent to $25.73 at 1517 GMT in a
broader U.S. market rebound following a sharp slide on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Ballmer's comments weighed on the shares of German
software maker SAP AG (SAPG.DE), which fell 2.0 percent and were
among the heaviest fallers in Germany's DAX index .GDAXI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors may take Ballmer's remarks as an indication that
Microsoft's revenues could be hurt by the continuing financial
crisis, a trader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "By extension, these fears have worked their way over to
SAP," the trader added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "TRUST" IN U.S. LAWMAKERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said he believed the U.S. Congress would soon help
stabilise the situation after rejecting a $700 billion bank
bailout plan on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I trust that before the end of the week we have some
resolution, at least in the U.S. Congress, that will help to

bank rescue package, although European and U.S. markets later
recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bad mortgage debt has hit U.S. banks and insurers, prompting
government bailouts to avoid a breakdown in the financial
system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NO MICROSOFT PHONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said Microsoft plans to stick with charging handset
makers licensing fees for using its mobile operating system,
despite free offerings from Google (GOOG.O) and Nokia
(NOK1V.HE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are doing well, we believe in the value of what we are
doing," Ballmer told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pressure on Microsoft's high licensing fees has
increased over 2008 with Google rolling out free Android
technology and Nokia offering to buy out others from Symbian and
take also its software royalty-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said there was no reason to expect Microsoft to enter the
mobile phone making business, like some analysts forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I do not anticipate us building a phone," Ballmer said.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Foundation Pledges $500,000 to The Drucker Institute at Claremont Graduate University

   Grant Enriches and Promotes Best Practice in Nonprofit Innovation
CLAREMONT, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Foundation has pledged $500,000 to Claremont
Graduate University over the next four years to support the Drucker
Institute's Peter F. Drucker Award for Nonprofit Innovation. Funding
will be used to stimulate interest in developing innovative programs
that respond to critical community issues, to create awareness about
best-practice programs and to enhance the value of the award.

   Specifically, the grant from The Coca-Cola Foundation will be used
to increase the first-place Drucker Award from $35,000 to $100,000,
beginning in 2009. The second place award of $7,500 and the third
place prize of $5,000 will remain unchanged.

   "This extraordinarily generous gift from The Coca-Cola Foundation
underscores just how important it is for nonprofit organizations to
innovate--something that Peter Drucker wrote and talked about long
before there was such an intense focus on the social sector and social
entrepreneurship," said Rick Wartzman, director of the Drucker
Institute, a campus-wide resource of Claremont Graduate University.
"This gift allows us to better recognize the work being done by
leading nonprofits, while also raising the awareness of Peter
Drucker's seminal contributions to the field. We couldn't be more
pleased to have Coca-Cola as our partner."

   Said Ingrid Saunders Jones, chair of The Coca-Cola Foundation,
"Nonprofits play a vital role in creating sustainable communities, and
we are pleased to assist the Drucker Institute in its efforts to
identify and reward best practice programs in nonprofit innovation."

   The Peter F. Drucker Award for Nonprofit Innovation, administered
annually since 1991, is granted to a social sector organization that
demonstrates Drucker's definition of innovation--change that creates a
new dimension of performance. This year's winner, selected from more
than 500 nonprofits that applied for the award, was recently
announced. It is KickStart International, a San Francisco-based
organization that fights poverty in Africa by creating and selling
simple tools that help poor entrepreneurs increase their income. Among
its innovations is the MoneyMaker irrigation pump, which allows
small-scale growers to produce high-value crops year-round and make
the transition from subsistence farming to commercial agriculture.

   This year's runner-up is Hidden Harvest, based in Coachella,
Calif. The program employs low-income farm workers to "rescue" produce
that is left behind in fields and orchards after harvest. This fresh
and nutritious food is, in turn, delivered free of charge to more than
60 local agencies that serve the poor and hungry. The third-place
winner is the Bethesda, Md.-based Calvert Foundation. Its Community
Investment Notes raise capital from individual and institutional
investors and lend it to nonprofits and social entrepreneurs working
around the world to alleviate poverty and promote sustainable
development.

   The winners from the 2008 competition will be honored at an Oct.
28 dinner in Los Angeles, featuring Wendy Kopp, the founder of Teach
for America, as the keynote speaker. The awards dinner will be
preceded by a daylong conference on nonprofit effectiveness. The
keynote speaker at the daytime event will be Karen Baker, California's
Secretary of Service and Volunteering--the first such cabinet-level
position in the nation.

   Widely considered the father of modern management, Drucker not
only consulted for major corporations, he advised the Girl Scouts, the
Red Cross, the Salvation Army and countless other social-sector
organizations. He called the nonprofit sector "America's most
distinctive institution."

&lt;p&gt;OSLO (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) plans to continue charging licensing fees from handset makers for using its mobile operating system and not follow the free offerings of Google and Nokia, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressure on Microsoft's high licensing fees has increased over 2008 with Google (GOOG.O) rolling out free Android technology and Nokia (NOK1V.HE) offering to buy out others from Symbian and also make its software royalty-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do," Ballmer told Reuters, when asked whether his firm would stick with licensing fees. "We are doing well, we believe in the value of what we are doing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's interesting to ask why would Google or Nokia, Google in particular, why would they invest a lot of money and try to do a really good job if they make no money.

We have to wait and see," Ballmer said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's market share in smart phone operating systems has stayed at about 10 percent for several years, despite the U.S. technology giant's efforts to win more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft charges $8 to $15 per phone, according to Strategy Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Handset makers are skeptical of Nokia, operators are skeptical of Google, I think by actually charging money people know exactly what our motivations are," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there was no reason to expect Microsoft to enter the mobile phone making business, like some analysts foresee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do not anticipate us building a phone.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the findings from a survey of nearly
4,300 U.S. and UK consumers that revealed insights into consumer
behaviors, preferences and expectations around how they shop, and how
they make purchasing decisions across multiple retail channels including
in-store, Web, mobile and catalog.

    The study, titled  "Understanding Consumer Patterns and Preferences in
Multi-Channel Retailing," examines factors retailers need to consider
when evaluating multi-channel initiatives. Multi-channel retailing, the
act of selling products across a variety of channels including in-store,
Web, mobile and catalog, continues to be a leading business strategy
adopted by retailers today. The report ranks the most commonly shopped
products across multiple channels, highlights the features and functions
consumers value while shopping, and explores the reasons why shoppers are
quick to shift their loyalty to specific retailers across multiple
channels. The product categories that were evaluated include Consumer
Electronics, Apparel/Accessories &amp; Footwear, Home Improvement,
Pharmaceuticals, Sporting Goods, Groceries and Home Decor.

    Research estimates that nearly 40% of retail sales will be influenced by
the Web and by cross-channel in 2012. In 2007, cross-channel shopping
accounted for $510 billion or 20% of total retail sales and by 2012, that
number is projected to be over $1.1 trillion, representing growth of an
estimated 17.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for all retail
categories. ("The Web's Impact on Cross-Channel Sales," Forrester
Research, June 2007).

    In light of this growing trend, retailers are seeking deeper insights into
how to maximize the multi-channel experience and build customer advocacy
so they can successfully evolve with customers' needs over time. "Since
multi-channel is still an area of discovery for many, retailers are
looking for guidance around how to navigate the process to inspire
greater loyalty among customers and drive increased profitability across
the business," said Fred Balboni, Global Retail Industry Leader, IBM. "To
realize the desired gains, retailers need to understand the factors that
are really driving consumers to shop."

    Key findings of the report include:

    Top multi-channel product category: Consumer electronics purchases emerged
as the most frequently shopped product category among multi-channel
shoppers. Apparel/Accessories &amp; Footwear, Home Improvement/Do-it-Yourself
and Appliances came in as the next most popular product categories. The
report also revealed that in the U.S., Apparel/Accessories &amp; Footwear and
Grocery have the greatest percentage of impulse purchase decisions per
basket. In the UK, the grocery market had the highest number of impulse
purchase decisions per basket, as well as the largest percentage of
impulse shoppers.

    Preferred shopping experience: Over 75 percent of shoppers cited that they
prefer shopping "Online to Store" followed by "Store to Online" (7+
percent) and "Online to Call Center" (3+ percent) across all product
categories -- these combinations were nearly identical for U.S. and UK
consumers. Based on average basket size, consumers in the U.S. spent the
most on purchases made between the "Online to Call Center" channels. On
the flip side, consumers in the UK spent the most between the "Online to
Mobile" segments.

    Profile of multi-channel shopper: In the U.S., the age group with the
greatest percentage of multi-channel shoppers (those who are defined by
shopping once a month or more) is 18-24 years; in the UK, core
multi-channel shoppers are slightly older between 25-34 years.

    Switching Loyalties between Channels and Retailers: Between 46-50 percent
of all shoppers in the U.S. and the UK admitted to switching loyalties to
retailers as they shopped across different channels. Overall, most
consumers cited price as their primary motivation for change, followed by
convenience and product availability.

    About the Study:

    The findings of this report are based on a survey of nearly 4,300 U.S. and
UK consumers from the U.S. and the UK. The population included a wide
range of demographics (gender, age, family status) comprising equal
numbers of men and women, with an above average national income.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The UK division of insurer
Canada Life CL_pb.TO emerged as the institutional investor
which sealed a deal to hedge 500 million pound ($901 million) of
longevity exposure with JP Morgan Chase  Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A JP Morgan spokeswoman confirmed to Reuters on Monday that
a deal involving "long dated" longevity swaps had taken place,
but did not identify the insurer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While there are no details available from Canada Life, we
can confirm that they are the UK insurer involved in the
longevity deal with JP Morgan," a spokeswoman for Canada Life
said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, JP Morgan signed another deal with insurer
Lucida, which specialises in taking on longevity risk and
corporate pension schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The nascent longevity swap market could see a lucrative
future as pension schemes, whose assets are valued at above $20
trillion, seek to hedge their longevity exposure -- the risk
that people on live longer on average than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A longevity swap helps pension schemes and insurance
companies manage the risk of increasing life duration by
enlisting a counterparty to pay pensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In return, the scheme pays the counterparty an agreed stream
of cash, which is generally an estimate of the future pension
payments by the counterparty, based on an assumed future level
of improvement in longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Cecilia Valente; editing by Elaine Hardcastle)

 OSLO, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) plans to
continue charging licensing fees from handset makers for using
its mobile operating system and not follow the free offerings of
Google and Nokia, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Tuesday.

 The pressure on Microsoft's high licensing fees has
increased over 2008 with Google (GOOG.O) rolling out free
Android technology and Nokia (NOK1V.HE) offering to buy out
others from Symbian and also make its software royalty-free.

 "We do," Ballmer told Reuters, when asked whether his firm
would stick with licensing fees. "We are doing well, we believe
in the value of what we are doing."

 "It's interesting to ask why would Google or Nokia, Google
in particular, why would they invest a lot of money and try to
do a really good job if they make no money. I think most
operators and telecom companies are sceptical about Google," he
said.

 Google tries to promote web surfing on phones and the use of
their services such as e-mail and search so they make
advertising revenue.

 "In the case of Nokia - are they really open sourcing, or
are they really making Symbian their own operating system? We
have to wait and see," Ballmer said in an interview.

 Microsoft's market share in smart phone operating systems
has stayed at about 10 percent for several years, despite the
U.S. technology giant's efforts to win more.

 Microsoft charges $8 to $15 per phone, according to Strategy
Analytics.

 "Handset makers are sceptical of Nokia, operators are
sceptical of Google, I think by actually charging money people
know exactly what our motivations are," Ballmer said.

 He said there was no reason to expect Microsoft to enter the
mobile phone making business, like some analysts foresee.

 "I do not anticipate us building a phone. Sorry, we are not
going build one," Ballmer said.

others from Symbian and also make its software royalty-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We do," Ballmer told Reuters, when asked whether his firm
would stick with licensing fees. "We are doing well, we believe
in the value of what we are doing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's interesting to ask why would Google or Nokia, Google
in particular, why would they invest a lot of money and try to
do a really good job if they make no money. I think most
operators and telecom companies are sceptical about Google," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google tries to promote web surfing on phones and the use of
their services such as e-mail and search so they make
advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the case of Nokia - are they really open sourcing, or
are they really making Symbian their own operating system? We
have to wait and see," Ballmer said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's market share in smart phone operating systems
has stayed at about 10 percent for several years, despite the
U.S. technology giant's efforts to win more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft charges $8 to $15 per phone, according to Strategy
Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Handset makers are sceptical of Nokia, operators are
sceptical of Google, I think by actually charging money people
know exactly what our motivations are," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said there was no reason to expect Microsoft to enter the
mobile phone making business, like some analysts foresee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I do not anticipate us building a phone. Sorry, we are not
going build one," Ballmer said.

&lt;p&gt; (New throughout; Adds NEW YORK to dateline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) unveiled
more advanced research programs on Tuesday than it previously
projected as the drugmaker focuses on products to treat cancer
and Alzheimer's disease to counter looming patent expirations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thirty-one research programs advanced to the next stage of
development over the past six months, the world's largest
drugmaker said in a press release. It also discontinued
development of 13 research projects, including a late-stage
treatment for melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said in a memo last week it was ending efforts to
develop medicines for heart disease, obesity and bone health,
among other conditions, as it focuses on cancer and five other
therapeutic areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York-based Pfizer has struggled to come up with new
medicines to replace blockbuster drugs that have lost or will
lose patent protection, such as its hypertension drug Norvasc.
Lipitor, Pfizer's biggest selling product, will see its sales
plummet after it loses its U.S. patent protection in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has identified six "high-potential" disease areas
for research: oncology, pain, inflammation, diabetes,
Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Most of the research
advancements were in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer boosted the number of projects in late-stage, or
Phase 3, clinical trials to 25 from 16 over the past six
months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In some cases, those include multiple studies for single
products. For example, five of Phase 3 trials involve Sutent, a
drug already approved for certain cancers. The Phase 3 programs
involve eight new drugs that have not yet been approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, Pfizer announced the goal to grow its Phase 3
pipeline to at least 24 projects, and as many as 28, by
December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer's pipeline acceleration is ahead of projections
given to investors in March 2008," the company said in the
release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drugmaker still is targeting submitting 15 to 20
applications to regulators between 2010 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares were up 18 cents, or 1 percent, at $17.83 in
morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;VIENNA, Sept 30 (Reuters) - German airline Lufthansa
(LHAG.DE) has hired JP Morgan as an adviser in its bid to buy
Austrian Airlines AUAV.VI, which is being sold by the Austrian
government, sources familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lufthansa is shortlisted in the auction of the loss-making
Austrian carrier together with Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA) and with
S7, Russia's biggest domestic airline in one of the many airline
takeover battles raging through the European sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bidders are currently reviewing Austrian's books and are

advised by Lazard and Austria's Raiffeisen Investment. S7 has
not picked an advising bank yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lufthansa and JP Morgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Austria elected a new parliament on Sunday in which the
parties backing the outgoing government lost heavily. However, a
reprise of the governing left-right coalition appeared to be
likely after conservatives appointed a new leader on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There was a broad consensus in the outgoing government,
which remains in place in a caretaker capacity until a new one
is formed, to go ahead with the sale of Austrian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Austria's state holding company OeIAG, which is offering its
43-percent stake, is advised by Merrill Lynch.

&lt;p&gt;  OSLO, NORWAY, Sep 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
ProfitBase, a technology leader in easy-to-use configurable data
warehousing, today announced they have received an order and are in the
final stages of deploying an Association for Retail Technology Standards
(ARTS) Business Intelligence (BI) solution for MYDIN Mohamed Holdings
Berhad of Malaysia.

    MYDIN, one of Malaysia's largest homegrown retailers, plans to triple
their stores from the present 43 to 125 by 2010. The aggressive growth
objectives and need for better, near real-time information for their
decision makers and suppliers drove their investment decision. "We have a
situation where our IT infrastructure for reporting is not able to keep up
with the expansion of store formats and the number of stores. We currently
have two ERP and two Point-Of-Sale (POS) systems. We are migrating our
core ERP to Microsoft Dynamics(R) AX over the next two years, but until
that happens we need a way to consolidate the data from these systems and
provide the reports and dashboards that our people and suppliers need to
make better decisions," said Malik Murad Ali, IT Director for MYDIN. "We
evaluated several vendors, both large and small, and decided on Microsoft
Office PerformancePoint(TM) Server 2007 for our reporting and dashboards
and on ProfitBase 2009 for our data warehouse and OLAP Cubes."

    MYDIN decided on ProfitBase 2009 to consolidate data from their two ERP
and two POS systems because of the easy to use development environment
and the ready to use On Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) Cube templates
for retail that support the ARTS data standard. The retail templates are
quickly deployed and provide analytics for item sales, hourly sales,
hourly item sales, efficiency, and much more. Additionally, the
ProfitBase Finance OLAP Cube template will be used to consolidate the ERP
General Ledgers so that a consolidated financial status of the company is
automatic.

    MYDIN is deploying Office PerformancePoint Server 2007 and Microsoft
Office SharePoint Server 2007 to provide all levels of the organization
and their suppliers with information. Dashboards and scorecards, which
will have standard financial and retail Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
will be deployed for everyone from the board of directors and executive
management to central merchandisers, branch operations managers and
suppliers. Additionally, the Office PerformancePoint Server 2007 analysis
capability will be provided for robust data mining and ad hoc analysis.

    "With the ProfitBase-Microsoft BI solution we expect to have better
visibility to our top selling products allowing us to make sure adequate
store inventory levels are maintained. We also will share product
inventory levels with our suppliers so they can better service our stores.
Overall, with better visibility and the resulting optimization and
proactive decision making, we expect a positive impact to the bottom line
of at least 5%," notes Malik Murad Ali.

    "Microsoft and our partners improve retail operations and meet consumer
demand with infrastructure optimization and real-time business
intelligence solutions that enable demand-driven merchandizing," said Jan
de Jong, WW Industry Solutions Manager for Business Insight, Microsoft
Distribution &amp; Services. "The ProfitBase solution, combined with
Microsoft technology, provides MYDIN with standard ARTS-based analytics
that match the various job functions found in the retail organization.
With Office PerformancePoint Server 2007 technology, MYDIN users are able
to use dashboards, reports, scorecards and analysis tools that can
deliver the right information to different users in ways that make the
most sense to each of them."

    According to Borre Tharaldsen, managing director of ProfitBase AS,
ProfitBase and Microsoft are committed to helping retailers, like MYDIN,
increase productivity throughout their organizations. "The MYDIN project
demonstrates our complementary strengths, which provide powerful
capabilities that can help any retailer drive results," Tharaldsen said.
"ProfitBase offers retailers a proven ready-to-use, ARTS-based solution
that is easily and rapidly deployed so they realize the benefits very
quickly."

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Shows Accelerating Pipeline with Significant Growth in Late-Stage Clinical Development

     Phase 3 Cohort Now Includes 25 Programs; Additions in Key Disease Areas
                       Including Cancer and Heart Disease
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc today provided the latest update to its development pipeline, showing
significant progress in achieving the company's growth, productivity and
performance goals.

The pipeline now includes 114 programs, from Phase 1 through Registration. The
number in late-stage (Phase 3) development has grown from 16 to 25 over the past
six months.

In total, 31 programs advanced to the next stage of development; 13 were
discontinued; and one was withdrawn from registration. The majority (19) of the
advances were in Pfizer's identified high-potential disease areas, including
oncology, pain, inflammation, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.

"We are making significant operational improvements and driving our strategies
to accelerate development, refocus investments and further improve execution,
including trial design and cycle times," said Martin Mackay, President of Pfizer
Global Research &amp; Development. "We are investing in the most promising disease
areas, where there is strong unmet medical need, favorable markets and an
opportunity to advance medical science."

Pfizer's pipeline acceleration is ahead of projections given to investors in
March 2008. At that time, the company announced the goal to grow its Phase 3
pipeline to at least 24 - and as many as 28 new molecular entities or new
indications - by December 2009. The company is targeting 15-20 regulatory
submissions in the period 2010-2012.

The company is vigorously driving its biotechnology investments and has 16
biotherapeutics in development, including CP-751871, a fully humanized
monoclonal antibody which works against the Insulin-like Growth Factor 1
(IGF1-R). CP-751871 recently began Phase 3 testing against non-small-cell lung
cancer, the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S.

The company has seven other cancer programs in Phase 3, including two potential
new indications for Sutent in hepatocellular and prostate cancer. Sutent is
taken orally and is a highly selective, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
that starves tumors of blood and nutrients needed for growth and simultaneously
kills cancer cells that make up tumors. It is also being tested in Phase 3
against breast, lung, and colorectal cancers.

Also advancing to Phase 3 is a potential new renal cell carcinoma indication for
axitinib. This is an oral, selective inhibitor of VEGFR (vascular endothelial
growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3), which has been shown to induce tumor
regression.

Pfizer's updated pipeline is posted at www.pfizer.com and shows each compound
name with the relevant disease area. The mechanism of action is also shown for
late-stage programs.

DISCLOSURE NOTICE: The information contained in this release is as of September
30, 2008. Pfizer assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements
contained in this release as the result of new information or future events or
developments.

This release contains forward-looking information about various products in
development and potential additional indications for certain in-line products,
including their potential benefits, and about Pfizer's Phase 3 pipeline and
planned regulatory submissions, that involves substantial risks and
uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the
uncertainties inherent in research and development; decisions by regulatory
authorities regarding whether and when to approve any drug applications and
supplemental drug applications that have been or may be filed for any such
products in development and additional indications, as well as their decisions
regarding labeling and other matters that could affect the availability or
commercial potential of such products and such additional indications; and
competitive developments.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Sep 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced an expansion of its Lotus Notes and
Domino collaboration flagship software to new markets and users with a
new version that delivers higher levels of mobility and security for the
iPhone(TM) and another that protects companies from Internet-borne
threats such as spam and viruses.

    Lotus Notes and Domino software adoption has grown to more than 140
million licensed users worldwide.

    The ability to connect to secure business email on devices such as the
iPhone is an example of Tomorrow at Work, an IBM initiative that examines
a changing work world and anticipates trends in technology, business,
society and culture.

    Debuting as a Top 20 pick on Apple's Web application page, Lotus
iNotes(TM) ultralite is a software download that allows a person to do
Lotus Notes email and view calendar and contacts using the iPhone. iNotes
is available at no extra charge to people who have a Lotus Notes software
license and is also included with IBM's new Lotus Notes software 8.0.2,
which raises performance significantly, and uses 20 percent less memory
than the previous version.

    Notes 8.0.2 also includes an updated version of Lotus Symphony, an
easy-to-use document, spread sheet and presentation software package based
on the Open Document Format. This newest Symphony has improved
compatibility with Microsoft Office and now supports 28 languages. The
four new ones are Catalan, Slovakian, Slovenian, and Thai.

    iPhone users can access Lotus iNotes ultralite through an intuitive
interface via the Safari browser. For added security and protection of
corporate data, iPhone users can choose to use IBM's Lotus Mobile Connect
virtual private network software along with ultralite. The latest version
of Lotus Mobile Connect, which became available at the end of June, makes
the ultralite sign-on process even easier.

    Here are comments from businesses that have started doing Notes email
using their iPhones:

    "We've been using Lotus Notes and Domino software for years. Now that
there's a light version for the iPhone, we're completely rethinking our
mobile strategy. Lotus iNotes ultralite simplifies the way we transfer
email and calendar information to cellular phones, which could save us a
lot of trouble and money," said Jason Michels, who manages the email
network for Aurora Health Care, an integrated health care provider in
Wisconsin. "It's possible we'll see a lot of people with iPhones around
here because of this," he added.

    "It's technology like this that enables us to be the kind of focused,
smart agency that we are. As our clients and their needs continually
evolve, we're challenged to stay a mammoth step ahead. We're in the
business of creating energy around ourselves and all those we encounter,
and without tools like iNotes, that wouldn't be possible," said Curtis
Pogue, Systems Administrator at Vladimir Jones, an integrated marketing
communications agency based in Colorado.

    "I really like the iNotes ultralite mode. It is very fast, works well and
has the same look and feel of the iPhone user interface. Congratulations
to IBM on this introduction of support for the iPhone," according to Andy
Brunner, Principal and Owner, ABData Information Technology Consulting and
Engineering, in Zurich, Switzerland, IBM Business Partner and member of
the Masters of Lotus Notes community.

    IBM's new Lotus Protector for Mail Security, which protects companies from
Internet-borne spam and viruses, is also available now. The first offering
in the new Lotus Protector security family, it shields Notes and Domino
systems and users from harmful and inappropriate content, and secures
company data from unauthorized access. Lotus Protector for Mail Security
features a high-performance engine with comprehensive scanning and
filtering techniques. It also features a sophisticated rules engine to
block incoming and outgoing content based on customer specifications.

    Lotus Notes and Domino has grown across small-medium business, and is used
by more than half of the largest 100 corporations in the world, 80 percent
of the top 10 global companies in banking, telecommunications, aerospace
and defense, consumer products, electronics, insurance and
pharmaceuticals.

&lt;p&gt;  BURLINGTON, MA, Sep 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Acronis(R) Inc. (http://www.acronis.com), a provider of affordable,
scalable storage management and disaster recovery software, today
announced the availability of Acronis Recovery for Microsoft Exchange, a
backup and recovery software program specifically designed to provide
fast, cost-effective and flexible options for protecting Microsoft
Exchange installations.

    Acronis Recovery for Microsoft Exchange extends the company's proven
backup and disaster recovery protection to Microsoft Exchange servers.
Designed primarily with speed and secure backups in mind, Acronis
Recovery for Microsoft Exchange gives IT administrators the ability to
keep the all-important lifeblood of any business -- e-mail -- in perfect
working order.

    "There is one common thread that unites every business in the world --
small or large -- and that is the absolute need for e-mail to work, all
the time. A company that cannot communicate with its partners and
customers won't be in business very long," said Alain Gentilhomme, vice
president of product management at Acronis. "All of our software products
are built for fast recovery, but Acronis Recovery for Microsoft Exchange
acknowledges the absolute importance of e-mail in any company and has
features that are specifically designed to make restoring an Exchange
server fast and painless."

    "Acronis Restore for Exchange is a very intuitive and user-friendly
product that every e-mail admin must own," said Eric Houser, senior
network engineer at Parallel Technologies Inc. of Dublin, OH. "It
includes useful features such as the guided disaster recovery plan
creator that walks anyone with any experience level through restoring the
Exchange system, as well as a wizard that determines the best backup
strategy for your environment. A quick and easy restore process adds to
the host of features that makes this product a requirement for anyone
using Exchange."

    "We see an increasing focus on not only recovery of user data but also
system level recovery of the server configuration, system state and
application," said Laura DuBois, research director of storage software at
IDC. "Acronis enables recovery of both. The Acronis Recovery for Microsoft
Exchange product offers not only granular recovery of individual messages
but also priority-based recovery of the Exchange service itself. For some
environments, near instant recovery of the messaging service is essential
to ongoing business operations while recovery of older message data can
occur over a rolling window."

    Flexibility=Fast Recovery

    Not all failures are created equal. That means that the restoration
procedure for a particular problem in an Exchange database will vary
depending on what caused the problem. With Acronis Recovery for Microsoft
Exchange, IT administrators can:


--  recover specific e-mail messages or mailboxes using a granular (brick-
    level) restore
--  restore to the point of failure, which means not having to completely
    re-install Exchange
--  recover to a specific point in time, to a last known working state
    

    
Restorations are faster and the backup files are smaller due to
Acronis' ability to back up and restore individual e-mails, files,
folders and mailboxes and not the entire Exchange application.

    In the event of a hardware failure, customers can use the software in
conjunction with Acronis True Image Echo backup software with Universal
Restore to do a bare-metal restore to a completely different piece of
hardware and have the Exchange Server back in service very quickly.

    Features include:


--  Active Restore: Full Microsoft Exchange Server functionality for users
    in seconds, while the system is still being restored
--  Near continuous data protection: Continuously back up transactions to
    enable the complete restoration of Microsoft Exchange Server databases with
    minimum data loss
--  Automatic dial-tone recovery: Restore e-mail service more quickly to
    users (providing them with a basic "dial tone") and then restore users'
    previous data as it becomes available
--  Hot Backup: Backup while the Microsoft Exchange service is online and
    serving clients, allowing for 24/7 availability
--  Restore e-mail from database-level backup
--  The Backup Strategy Assistant: Create a Disaster Recovery Plan for any
    environment, delivering step-by-step instructions for recovery. Following
    the wizard's instruction, anyone can schedule backup jobs and restore a
    system rapidly, be they an experienced database administrator or not
--  Centralized management: Provides a single point for the entire
    infrastructure, making it easy to manage and track backup and recovery
    activities
--  Intuitive, wizard-driven GUI and command-line interface: Guides users
    through the scheduling process and reduces the possibility for errors; also
    offers full command-line interface for scripting
--  High performance and speeds: Due to the ability to restore data
    (mailboxes, public folders or individual e-mails) from a database-level
    backup, rather than time-consuming brick-level backups
--  Bare-metal restore: Restore a whole production server (operating
    system and all databases, configuration files, and data) on an unconfigured
    system from a bootable CD or by PXE
--  Windows Server 2008 support
    

    
Availability and pricing

    Acronis Recovery for Microsoft Exchange is now available from Acronis and
resellers worldwide. Manufacturer's suggested list price starts at $999
per server. Acronis Recovery for Microsoft Small Business Server lists for
$399.

&lt;p&gt;GRIDSCALE Database Virtualization Software Dramatically Improves
        Scalability and Availability of SQL Server Applications
WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
xkoto, the database virtualization company, today announced
GRIDSCALE for Microsoft SQL Server, a product that improves
application performance, scalability and reliability in SQL Server
environments.

   GRIDSCALE for Microsoft SQL Server is an active-active solution
that virtualizes the database infrastructure. It enables businesses to
distribute application loads horizontally across multiple instances of
SQL Server, resulting in better reliability and performance than that
of more costly and complex legacy clustering solutions. With GRIDSCALE
for SQL Server, businesses can eliminate planned and unplanned
outages, rapidly scale application load across SQL Servers, and
implement cost-effective disaster recovery solutions.

   With GRIDSCALE, database administrators can perform hardware
upgrades and software updates without having an impact on system
performance or uptime. Plus, GRIDSCALE eliminates the limitations of
clustering configurations, such as shared storage, partitioning and
mirroring.

   "We are confident that GRIDSCALE for SQL Server will deliver the
reliability and performance we require to meet the needs of our new
Home Security customers," said Drew DeNardo, Director of IT, InGrid,
Inc. "We're using an ASP-based Web store, and if our database is down,
that means lost sales. GRIDSCALE for SQL Server is a cost-effective
way to give InGrid's e-commerce engine the same sort of reliability
that GRIDSCALE for DB2 has provided for our core Home Security
services."

   "Traditional database clustering solutions have been proven over
the years to deliver availability for mission-critical applications,"
said Donna Scott, VP, Distinguished Analyst of Gartner, Inc. "However,
database virtualization is emerging as a viable alternative to
traditional clustering, providing near continuous application
availability, seamless failover for unscheduled server downtime, and
non-disruptive capacity expansion, and horizontal scaling on reads."

   Testing at Microsoft's MTC Lab

   xkoto underwent extensive performance and functional testing of
GRIDSCALE for SQL Server in one of Microsoft's technology centers.
Results showed near-linear scalability for read-intensive workloads,
such as those used for online commerce applications. GRIDSCALE also
received high marks on availability tests, which simulated hardware
failures, network outages and site-wide disaster.

   "We're seeing strong demand for customers who want to run critical
business applications on commodity systems," said David Patrick,
President and Chief Executive Officer, xkoto. "GRIDSCALE for Microsoft
SQL Server will enable businesses to take SQL Server to the next level
of performance and reliability."

   How GRIDSCALE Works

   Unlike traditional clustering, which relies on multiple databases
tied to shared storage, GRIDSCALE employs a shared-nothing
architecture with a dynamic number of database servers for continuous
availability. Each database server operates completely independent of
the others, maintaining its own complete and consistent copy of the
database. The GRIDSCALE server appears as a single, fully functional
database to all applications, which are unaware that any one of
several database servers may be used to fulfill their requests.

   "Virtualization is increasingly seen as an important component of
an organization's industry standard systems-based solutions," said Dan
Kusnetzky, Principal Analyst and President of the Kusnetzky Group LLC
and author of Virtually Speaking on ZDnet. "This technology has long
been a component of mainframe and midrange systems-based solutions.
What xkoto has done is to develop an important new virtualization
technology that centers on enhancing the operations of database-based
solutions. Organizations looking to optimize the performance,
scalability and reliability of these solutions would be well advised
to learn more about what xkoto is doing."

   GRIDSCALE for SQL Server initially supports ODBC, JDBC, and .NET
connectivity. In addition to its support for SQL Server, xkoto added
functionality for DB2 in the latest version 4.1 version of GRIDSCALE.

  from SaaS Sales Tax Automation and Management Solution Loaded with
                       Next-Generation Features
LAGUNA HILLS, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
SpeedTax, Inc., a provider of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS),
fully-automated sales tax management solutions, today announced an
integration deal whereby Spider Logic, the technology integration

will give customers access to the SpeedTax Service Engine(TM), a
centralized rules-based service that is always up-to-date with

with Dynamics GP."

   "From both a product integrator and Microsoft Dynamics GP business
partner perspective, we're very pleased to be involved with delivering
SpeedTax to the thousands of Great Plains users in need of a strong
automated sales tax management solution," said Jeff Greeneway,
Managing Partner at Wipfli LLP's Consulting Practice. "Several key
factors - not the least of which includes economic conditions at state
and local levels nationwide leading to heightened audit activity, in
addition to the immediate need in the mid-market for a SaaS sales tax
management solution - make today's integration announcement very good
news for Dynamics GP customers."

   "This is an auspicious and timely integration for SpeedTax," said
L. Gary Boomer, CEO of Boomer Consulting, and 2008 inductee into

"Dynamics GP is the most recognizable business management solution in
the mid-market, with an impressively large customer base currently

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects sourcing in paragraph 11 to the Wall Street
Journal)
 (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) will drop
efforts to develop medicines for heart disease, obesity and
bone health as part of its plan to focus research on cancer and
five other therapeutic areas, a company memo showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-based firm, set to provide a product
development update on Tuesday, will end drug development in an
area known for its flagship $12 billion per year
cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, as well as some of it's
biggest disappointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, inflammation/immunology,
oncology, pain and psychoses (schizophrenia) were "higher
priority areas" for Pfizer going forward, its Therapeutic
Advisory Group wrote in an internal memo dated Sept. 25
provided to Reuters from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These large markets, with rapidly advancing science, are
the areas where Pfizer can take a leading position," the group
wrote in the memo. The company is still considering whether to
pursue ophthalmology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a continuous process to constantly evaluate our
pipeline and make decisions based on high priority, unmet
medical needs with market growth potential," Pfizer spokesman
Ray Kerins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of Lipitor, the world's top selling drug, are slowing
as patients have opted instead for cheap generic forms of Merck
 Co's (MRK.N) Zocor. The sales are set to fall off a cliff in
2011 when generic versions are slated to hit the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has been unable to come up with enough new
blockbuster medicines to replace those that have lost, or will
lose, patent protection, such as hypertension drug Norvasc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In December 2006, the company scrapped cholesterol-lowering
drug Torcetrapib after it was linked to deaths in a large
trial, losing some $800 million in development costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a major setback for the company and investors, who
had high hopes for the product, and the share price has
languished ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The recent shift in RD focus was led by President Martin
Mackay, a long-time Pfizer research executive who took over the
division in October of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan is expected to include job cuts and a reduction in
spending, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. The
moves will not affect products in late stage development or set
to be launched in the next three years, according to Kerins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That includes its co-development collaboration with
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) on the experimental blood clot
preventer Apixaban from a highly anticipated new class of
medicines that has been targeted by several drugmakers.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN RAMON, CA, Sep 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The WiMedia Alliance today announced that it is partnering with the
Wireless Alliance for Testing Experiment and Research (WALTER) to focus
on furthering European development of technology required for
measurement, calibration and testing of UWB radio products. This
collaboration, called the WALTER project, includes several partners
worldwide and aims to create a pan-European interconnected testbed, and to
boost the European innovation potential to develop new applications and
services based on extremely high capacity networks.

    Through this collaboration, researchers with the WALTER project will have
direct access to members of the WiMedia Alliance who are involved in the
development of the specifications providing them with instantaneous access
to test specifications. WiMedia will have access to WALTER regulatory
tests and to three WALTER independent testing labs located in Europe and
China, helping drive international acceptance and adoption of WiMedia
standards.

    "This relationship is another example of our commitment to rapid
deployment of WiMedia UWB standards on an international basis and to have
the support in place that is needed for adoption," said Roberto Aiello,
chairman, WiMedia Certification Review Board. "Our participation with the
Walter project goes hand-in-hand with our partnerships with other global
efforts including our existing partnerships with the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and Ecma International, an
international standards organization."

    About the WiMedia Alliance

    The WiMedia Alliance is a not-for-profit open industry association that
promotes and enables the rapid adoption, regulation, standardization and
multi-vendor interoperability of ultra-wideband (UWB) worldwide. The basis
for the industry's first UWB standards (published by Ecma International),
WiMedia UWB is optimized for wireless personal-area networks delivering
high-speed (480Mbps and beyond), low-power multimedia capabilities for the
PC, CE, mobile and automotive market segments. Emphasizing peaceful
coexistence with other wireless services, the WiMedia UWB Common Radio
Platform is designed to operate with application stacks developed by the
Certified Wireless USB Promoter Group, the Bluetooth-SIG and proprietary
implementations. Further information on the WiMedia Alliance and its
certification program is available at www.wimedia.org

    About WALTER

    WALTER is a project co-financed by the European Commission under the 7th
framework program for RTD. Started in January 2008 it will last 2 years.
Gathering 8 organisations from Europe and China, the project WALTER
addresses the need for broadband testbeds by overcoming the technical
issues of measuring low level, high datarate radio signals. The resulting
worldwide interconnected testbeds will address the short term needs of
industry and regulators but also the longer-term needs of research
communities.

&lt;p&gt;Calendar Interoperability for Microsoft(R) Exchange Server Now
  Available; Zimbra(TM) Debuts Open Framework for IBM(R) Lotus Domino
            Messaging Server, Meeting Maker(TM), and Others

      Meets Needs of Large Organizations to Enable Heterogeneous
                        Computing Environments
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Zimbra, a Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO) company and the leader in open
source, next-generation messaging and collaboration software, today
announced the availability of a new open extension framework for
Zimbra Collaboration Suite(TM) (ZCS) that enables two-way
interoperability with leading collaboration platforms. Large
enterprises and academic institutions can now easily integrate teams
using Zimbra to work seamlessly with other departments that use
different collaboration servers like Microsoft Exchange, exploring the
benefits of Zimbra without having to make the decision to replace
their current systems up front. This extends Zimbra's history of
openness and compatibility to a broader range of platforms, and builds
on Yahoo!'s leadership in e-mail as a key starting point for users.

   The first extension, built by Zimbra for the Microsoft Exchange
2003 platform, and now in beta, allows Zimbra users to access and
share two-way free/busy information, schedules and global address book
with colleagues whose data resides on Microsoft Exchange. The
framework is also openly available for anyone in the Zimbra community
to write an extension to other collaboration platforms such as IBM
Lotus Domino, Novell(R) GroupWise(R), or PeopleCube Meeting Maker.

   "Interoperability with Exchange and other leading collaboration
systems is a top request by many enterprises and academic institutions
where mixed deployments are common," said Satish Dharmaraj, Zimbra
co-founder and Yahoo! vice president. "Zimbra's recent growth with
large organizations has been tremendous, with recent customer wins and
deal expansions including Dai Nippon Publishing, Reliance Industries,
H Block and Texas A University. This interoperability builds upon
a long record of compatibility work by Zimbra and is one of the key
needs for our largest customers."

   ZCS Interoperability for Exchange features:

   --  Free/busy and schedule interoperability: ZCS now has the
        ability to view free/busy calendar information in Exchange,
        allowing a Zimbra user to schedule a meeting with Exchange
        users as well as book resources like meeting rooms. Conversely
        Exchange users can also schedule ZCS users; in this regard, it
        is no different than working with another Exchange user.

   --  Integration with Active Directory: Integration with Active
        Directory provides a unified Global Address List (GAL) of both
        ZCS and Exchange users in the same deployment.

   --  Anytime, anywhere access: The feature works in all Zimbra
        clients, including Zimbra's AJAX Web Client, Outlook via
        Zimbra Connector for Outlook, Zimbra Mobile supported devices
        including any BlackBerry or Windows Mobile based smartphones.
        Exchange users can use whatever client they use currently such
        as Outlook.

   --  Minimal IT support: ZCS Interoperability for Exchange doesn't
        require any changes on the Exchange server; the service is
        completely managed in the Zimbra Administration Console.

   "As a research facility, our researchers, scientists and
administrative teams have varying needs of collaboration tools. We
want to give each department and all of our users the flexibility of
using the collaboration platform that works best for them, while
avoiding the IT headache of a mixed environment," said Brian Finley,
IT Strategist, Argonne National Laboratory. "The Zimbra
interoperability framework offers us a way to seamlessly integrate
teams and users on various platforms while giving each department the
freedom of choice to use any platform they desire."

   Pricing and Availability

   ZCS Interoperability for Exchange is free for all ZCS Open Source
and Network Edition users and the framework is available now for
anyone to develop extensions to other leading platforms. Zimbra
Outlook Connector and Zimbra Mobile are available for ZCS Network
Edition users.

   The ZCS 5.0 Open Source Edition is free. The commercially
supported ZCS 5.0 Network Edition is available for a 60-day free trial
on the Zimbra website. Zimbra's Hosted Demo (www.zimbra.com/demo) is
available for an immediate test drive of ZCS.

   ZCS Network Edition includes product support as well as software
subscriptions to new releases, updates and patches. ZCS is available
on-premise or as a hosted service and is available at a significant
educational or non-profit discount. Please contact sales@zimbra.com

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Analyst Interview. Today's interview
is with Fixed Income Portfolio Manager Manish Jain, who discusses
General Electric (NYSE: GE), General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Citigroup
(NYSE: C).

   Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the
free Profit from the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678.

   Can you clear up what "spreads" are for us?

   When people talk about spreads, they are talking about the
difference between the yield of a corporate or municipal bond and the
yield earned on a U.S. Treasury bond for the same maturity. The lower
the spread, the more people feel comfortable with the company's
likelihood of paying off the debt. If the spread is high, that means
people are concerned.

   The U.S. Treasury rate is your risk-free rate. There is very
little chance of Treasuries defaulting. Investors use that as a
starting point and then add premium to the rates depending on the
chance of a company going bankrupt.

   By way of example, up until now General Electric (NYSE: GE)
usually has been able to issue bonds at a spread + 50 bps (basis
points) to the Treasuries. So if the 5-year U.S. Treasury is yielding
around 3%, then GE is able to sell their bonds at a yield of around
3.5%. On the other hand if you are looking at General Motors (NYSE:
GM), then the spread may be +400 bps to the Treasuries.

   As investors feel uncomfortable about a company, the yield spreads
on their bonds start to rise. So right now financial companies yield
spreads are shooting up.

   I was offered a bond issued by Citigroup (NYSE: C) that will
mature in 5 months and it is yielding around 6.3%. For comparison's
sake, 6-month Treasuries are yielding around 1.5%. So the spread is
around 480 bps. That is junk bond territory.

&lt;p&gt;OSLO, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) Chief Executive
Steve Ballmer said on Tuesday that no company was immune to the
global financial crisis which he expects to sap both consumer
and business spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Financial issues are going to affect both business spending
and consumer spending, particularly... spending by the financial
services industry," Ballmer told reporters on the sidelines of a
seminar in the Norwegian capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think one has to anticipate that no company is immune to
these issues," he said, adding that he believed that the U.S.
Congress would soon help stabilise the situation after rejecting
a $700 billion bank bailout plan on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I trust that before the end of the week we have some
resolution, at least in the U.S. Congress that will help to
stabilise the situation. We need that, I hope we get that," he
said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc will drop efforts to develop medicines for heart disease, obesity and bone health as part of its plan to focus research on cancer and five other therapeutic areas, a company memo showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York-based firm, set to provide a product development update on Tuesday, will end drug development in an area known for its flagship $12 billion per year cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, as well as some of it's biggest disappointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, inflammation/immunology, oncology, pain and psychoses (schizophrenia) were "higher priority areas" for Pfizer going forward, its Therapeutic Advisory Group wrote in an internal memo dated September 25 provided to Reuters from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These large markets, with rapidly advancing science, are the areas where Pfizer can take a leading position," the group wrote in the memo. The company is still considering whether to pursue ophthalmology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a continuous process to constantly evaluate our pipeline and make decisions based on high priority, unmet medical needs with market growth potential," Pfizer spokesman Ray Kerins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Lipitor, the world's top selling drug, are slowing as patients have opted instead for cheap generic forms of Merck  Co's Zocor. The sales are set to fall off a cliff in 2011 when generic versions are slated to hit the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has been unable to come up with enough new blockbuster medicines to replace those that have lost, or will lose, patent protection, such as hypertension drug Norvasc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2006, the company scrapped cholesterol-lowering drug Torcetrapib after it was linked to deaths in a large trial, losing some $800 million in development costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a major setback for the company and investors, who had high hopes for the product, and the share price has languished ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent shift in RD focus was led by President Martin Mackay, a long-time Pfizer research executive who took over the division in October of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan is expected to include job cuts and a reduction in spending, but will not affect products in late stage development or set to be launched in the next three years, according to Kerins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes its co-development collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on the experimental blood clot preventer Apixaban from a highly anticipated new class of medicines that has been targeted by several drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Phil Wahba)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Edward Tobin; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)&lt;/p&gt;
