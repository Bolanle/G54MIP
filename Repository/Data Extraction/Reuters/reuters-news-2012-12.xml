			Dominion Dealer Solutions and Microsoft Establish Strategic 
      Relationship for Next-Generation Dealer Management System
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New DMS based on Microsoft Dynamics AX to drive enhanced customer 
      experience and operational efficiency for automotive dealers and 
      manufacturers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dominion Dealer Solutions and Microsoft have established a strategic 
      relationship to collaborate and create a next-generation Dealer 
      Management System (DMS) based on Microsoft Dynamics AX. The two 
      companies are combining the powerful foundation of Microsoft Dynamics AX 
      with Dominion Dealer Solutions&#8217; extensive automotive retail expertise 
      and assets into an industry leading solution that will enable automotive 
      dealers and manufacturers to enhance customer experience, increase 
      revenue and profit and drive operational efficiencies. The solution will 
      utilize Microsoft Dynamics AX, along with Microsoft server solutions and 
      tools and the Windows Azure platform to take advantage of the 
      efficiencies and flexibility offered by Microsoft&#8217;s public cloud 
      offerings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our strategy with Microsoft Dynamics AX is to provide a robust platform 
      for game-changing solutions like the new Dealer Management System from 
      Dominion,&#8221; said Christian Pedersen, General Manager of Microsoft 
      Dynamics AX. &#8220;The power and flexibility of Microsoft Dynamics AX enables 
      partners like Dominion to rapidly and cost-effectively develop 
      line-of-business solutions that drive accelerated business value for 
      their customers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Combining Dominion's experience crafted through relationships with over 
      11,000 rooftops and Microsoft's technology will result in a tremendous, 
      forward-looking Dealer Management System,&#8221; said Robert Berndt, President 
      of Dominion Dealer Solutions. &#8220;The automotive DMS market has been 
      dominated by large, legacy systems that severely limit the ability of 
      dealers and manufacturers to meet customers' expectations and 
      differentiate themselves from their competition. Our relationship with 
      Microsoft gives us the capability to meet the needs of the market, and 
      more, on day one. Dealers who use our DMS will experience flexibility 
      they never dreamed possible, and they will be positioned for the future 
      of automotive retailing.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The relationship between Microsoft and Dominion is part of Microsoft 
      Business Solutions&#8217; strategic Global Independent Solutions Vendor (ISV) 
      program, resulting in collaboration in RD, marketing and sales. 
      Dominion selected Microsoft Dynamics AX as the platform for the DMS, 
      which offers the combination of industry leading ERP capabilities 
      required for a DMS, along with rich integration and custom development 
      capabilities that are ideal for a meeting the dynamic needs of a rapidly 
      evolving retail market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited to welcome Dominion as a member of the Global ISV 
      program,&#8221; stated Doug Kennedy, Vice President of Partners for Microsoft 
      Dynamics. &#8220;Their long history of delivering value for their customers 
      aligns directly with our goals for the initiative.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new dealer management system will be initially rolled out to new 
      vehicle dealerships in the United States, starting in Q1 2013.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley hired former Goldman Sachs trader Edward Glenn Hadden to run its Treasury bond desk last year, even though his former employer had placed the trader on paid leave for about a year following an internal inquiry, said three people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inquiry by Goldman involved a matter separate from an ongoing investigation by exchange operator CME Group into a December 2008 trade that involved U.S. Treasury futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Hadden nor Goldman has been accused of wrongdoing in the 2008 trading incident. But the decision by Morgan Stanley to hire Hadden even though some of his activities had raised questions within Goldman could put the firm in an uncomfortable position in light of the revelations of the CME Group investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadden was a partner at Goldman Sachs when the 2008 trade drawing scrutiny occurred. The incident that led to the Goldman internal inquiry took place the end of 2009 and involved profits Hadden is said to have made ahead of the launch of a new Treasury futures contract introduced by the CME Group in early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs both recently learned of the CME investigation into the 2008 incident. But sources said Morgan Stanley was aware Goldman had put Hadden on paid leave when it hired him in March 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadden's lawyer said his client did nothing wrong with the 2008 trade and expects the CME to reach a similar conclusion when it completes its investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no legal or factual basis for any suggestion of market manipulation," said James Benjamin, who defended his client in response to a recent regulatory disclosure by the firm that Hadden is being investigated by CME over a 4-year-old trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin had no comment about the incident that led to Goldman putting Hadden on paid leave that effectively barred him from trading at the firm for about a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadden, who goes by his middle name "Glenn," officially left Goldman (GS.N) in late 2010. A few months later, Hadden, who had been a partner at Goldman, joined Morgan Stanley with much fanfare to run the Wall Street firm's Treasury bond and interest rate derivatives trading desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadden is one of the most successful traders in the market for Treasury bonds and interest rate derivatives, whose value stands at $531.6 trillion, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. He had worked for Goldman Sachs for about 11 years before voluntarily leaving the firm at the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading in Treasuries and interest rate derivatives is an important part of Morgan Stanley's bond trading business, as it focuses on high-volume trading that can be easily automated and cleared under new regulations, rather than riskier and more complex over-the-counter trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin, a defense attorney with Akin Gump, said the CME investigation involves a "technical risk management activity" that occurred "in a one-minute period four years ago." While Benjamin declined to discuss the specifics of the allegation against Hadden in his statement, the lawyer said his client had "acted properly and followed established market practice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CME Group declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake said Hadden is still employed by the firm, and in good standing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of the investigation broke on Sunday evening when The New York Times posted a story on its website about Hadden with the headline "Morgan Stanley Trader Faces Inquiry on Possible Manipulation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, citing a regulatory filing and sources familiar with the matter, said the CME was investigating Hadden over whether his Treasury futures trading had manipulated prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadden's file with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority cites a pending CME investigation of his Treasury futures orders placed on the expiration date in December 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trades being probed by the CME pertained to programs set up by the Federal Reserve during the height of the financial crisis to help support Wall Street and the banking system, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported that some at the Fed had suspected that Goldman was trying to improperly profit from one of the government's bond-buying programs, and complained to Goldman about Hadden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2009 incident that led to the Goldman internal inquiry also involved Treasury futures but had nothing to do with the U.S. government's efforts to prop up the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the 2009 matter involved a new Treasury futures trading product the CME was developing and one which Hadden had advised on, said those people, who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadden had found a way to structure a Treasury trade ahead of the CME's official announcement in September 2009 that it was going to launch in early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That incident moved his superiors at Goldman to put him on leave, keeping him on the payroll but preventing him from actively trading for about a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, even as the CME investigates Hadden over the 2008 incident, its product development team has continued to turn to him for help in devising new Treasury futures products.

when it completes its investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no legal or factual basis for any suggestion of
market manipulation," said James Benjamin, who defended his
client in response to a recent regulatory disclosure by the firm
that Hadden is being investigated by CME over a 4-year-old
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin had no comment about the incident that led to

Manipulation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, citing a regulatory filing and sources familiar

whether his Treasury futures trading had manipulated prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadden's file with the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority cites a pending CME investigation of his Treasury
futures orders placed on the expiration date in December 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trades being probed by the CME pertained to programs set
up by the Federal Reserve during the height of the financial
crisis to help support Wall Street and the banking system, a
person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported that some at the Fed had

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			JAMF Software Announces Plug-Ins for Microsoft SCCM 2012 and 
      Altiris Client Management Suite, Allowing Enterprise Organizations to 
      Manage the Apple Platform
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Enterprise organizations will be able to deploy and manage Macs and 
      iOS devices alongside their existing Windows management infrastructure, 
      ensuring that they have best-of-breed capabilities for both platforms 
      without compromising on quality.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			JAMF Software, developers of the Casper Suite, a collection of 
      device management applications for the Apple platform including devices 
      such as iPhone, iPad and Mac computers, has announced plug-ins for 
      Windows management systems including Microsoft System Center 
      Configuration Manager 2012 (SCCM) and Altiris Client Management Suite.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Casper Suite is the best-of-breed management software for the 
      entire Apple platform, enabling organizations to confidently manage and 
      secure devices as they respond to the incredible growth of Apple in the 
      enterprise. With the release of plug-ins that integrate with the latest 
      versions of the leading Windows management systems, enterprise 
      organizations are immediately able to manage the Apple platform by using 
      the Casper Suite alongside existing infrastructure.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Support for Microsoft SCCM 2012 and Altiris Client Management 
      Suite 7.1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In environments where Apple devices are flooding into 
      traditionally PC-based organizations, IT management is often faced with 
      the dilemma of settling on a single cross-platform product that has 
      lesser capabilities for one platform or training administrators to work 
      with parallel systems that have stronger platform-specific capabilities 
      but do not allow for centralized reporting.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			With JAMF Software&#8217;s plug-in architecture, the end result is truly 
      the best of both worlds. IT administrators can use the comprehensive 
      capabilities of the Casper Suite to manage their Apple devices, while 
      hardware and software data is synced in real-time to their existing 
      Windows management solution to ensure that inventory is always 
      up-to-date for compliance and auditing. By bridging the gap between 
      systems, plug-ins allow organizations to use the best tool for the job 
      on both the Windows and Apple platforms while providing a seamless 
      experience for end users without compromising on quality.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;We are increasingly hearing from enterprise organizations that 
      want the best solution to manage growing quantities of Apple devices,&#8221; 
      said Doug Rhoten, Development Manager, Plug-Ins at JAMF Software, 
      developers of the Casper Suite. &#8220;With these plug-ins, they are able to 
      choose the best-of-breed Casper Suite to manage their Apple devices, 
      without having to change their existing management infrastructure. The 
      plug-in architecture and compatibility with leading Windows client 
      management solutions means that organizations can have full management 
      capabilities for both platforms, while maintaining a single console for 
      their inventory and compliance reporting.&#8221;

      Center Alliance, an online resource to help partners create solutions

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Through 2021, Major Constraints in the Hospital-Treated Infections 
      Drug Market Will Include the Loss of Patent Protection for Key Branded 
      Products&#8212;Notably Pfizer&#8217;s Zyvox&#8212;and Continued Generic Erosion of 
      Premium-Priced Agents Such as Meropenem
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Infectious Disease Physicians Want New Therapies that are Active 
      Against Multidrug-Resistant Gram-Negative Bacteria, According to 
      Findings from Decision Resources
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Decision Resources, one of the world&#8217;s leading research and advisory 
      firms for pharmaceutical and healthcare issues, finds that, in the 
      hospital-treated infections (HTI) drug market, the loss of patent 
      protection for key branded products&#8212;notably Pfizer&#8217;s Zyvox, the HTI 
      sales leader in 2011&#8212;and the continued generic erosion of premium-priced 
      agents such as meropenem (Cubist Pharmaceuticals/AstraZeneca&#8217;s 
      Merrem/Meronem; Dainippon Sumitomo&#8217;s Meropen; generics) as well as 
      increasingly stringent regulatory and reimbursement environments will be 
      the major constraints of market growth through 2021.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Pharmacor advisory service entitled Hospital-Treated 
      Infections finds that, over the next decade, the HTI market will 
      grow at a modest 2.7 percent annual rate in the United States, France, 
      Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Japan. This growth will be 
      driven primarily by the uptake of 12 emerging therapies and continued 
      use of premium-priced agents that target multidrug-resistant (MDR) 
      pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The HTI market is currently dominated by parenteral agents, and drug 
      developers recognize the need for more-convenient dosing, either in the 
      form of oral formulations or drugs that require less frequent 
      administration. This convenience would facilitate early patient 
      discharge, thereby reducing hospital and patient costs. Five of the 
      emerging therapies slated to launch by 2021&#8212;Rib-X&#8217;s delafloxacin, 
      Furiex&#8217;s JNJ-Q2, Trius/Bayer&#8217;s tedizolid, Tetraphase&#8217;s eravacycline and 
      Nabriva/Forest&#8217;s BC-3781&#8212;are being developed in both intravenous and 
      oral formulations. Additionally, long-acting therapies such as Durata&#8217;s 
      dalbavancin and The Medicines Company&#8217;s oritavancin have the potential 
      for once-a-week dosing and would enable convenient outpatient parenteral 
      antibiotic therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The findings also reveal that, because of the increasing prevalence and 
      severity of infections due to MDR gram-negative bacteria, infectious 
      disease physicians have called for new therapies that are active against 
      these pathogens. There is a growing need for antibiotics that target 
      pathogens that express beta-lactamases, including extended-spectrum 
      beta-lactamases (ESBLs), Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs), 
      and metallo-beta-lactamases. Two antipseudomonal 
      cephalosporin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations will launch during 
      the forecast period: Cubist&#8217;s CXA-201 and AstraZeneca/Forest&#8217;s CAZ-AVI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;CXA-201 and CAZ-AVI provide broad-spectrum, gram-negative coverage and 
      stability against ESBLs and CAZ-AVI has the added advantage of expanded 
      coverage of some class C beta-lactamases and the class A carbapenemases 
      KPC,&#8221; said Decision Resources Analyst Maria Ascano, Ph.D. &#8220;According to 
      infectious disease experts we interviewed, when approved, both agents 
      are likely to partly replace carbapenems for treatment of 
      MDR-gram-negative pathogens, thereby stemming emergence of carbapenem 
      resistance.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;  PALO ALTO, CA, Dec 03 (Marketwire) -- 
GrexIt, Inc., the first collaboration tool to add shared email labels and
folders for businesses using Google Apps, is now an essential tool for
companies migrating their email from Microsoft Exchange to Google Apps.
The tool gives businesses the ability to continue email collaboration
while going through the transition with no downtime. 

    "For the last six months we have been prevented from transferring our
Exchange system to Gmail for all users simply because there were no
public folders," said Neil Hack, Ronin Corporation, a global market
research firm. "Without them we have no real effective shared email
resource. GrexIt solves this for us in a very elegant implementation and
paves the way for us to fully migrate away from in-house Exchange to full
blown Google Apps email for all. It's a fantastic App and very close to
being absolutely essential."

    According to Google, organizations using Google Apps include 66 of the
top 100 universities in the US, government institutions in 45 of the 50
US states, and a total of 5 million businesses. 

    "GrexIt enables companies to better manage important processes such as
project management, customer support, sales and hiring via their email
inboxes -- the tool employees are already most comfortable using," said
Niraj Ranjan Rout, founder, GrexIt. "It is the simplest solution for
tagging, sharing and tracking important email conversations via Gmail and
an integral tool for any company moving from Microsoft Exchange to Google
Apps."

    "I was searching online for a tool that would enable Gmail collaboration
and we finally have that with GrexIt," said Jack Smith, Co-founder,
Vungle. "Our team gets frustrated at having dialogue where customers
forget to 'reply all' to threads. By using GrexIt shared labels our team
stays in the loop on all projects. And the fact that its all email based
is a huge plus."

    According to a report from industry research firm Radicati Group, the
average corporate email user sends and receives about 105 emails per day.
Which, a McKinsey Global Institute and International Data Corp. report
says takes up to 28 percent of a worker's time. The report goes on to
cite that time spent on email can be cut by 25 - 30 percent by

&lt;p&gt;Dec 3 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley trader Edward Glenn
Hadden is under   investigation by regulators at CME Group
 over trades in Treasury futures four years ago while he
was employed by Goldman Sachs, according to a regulatory
filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadden is a managing director and head of global interest
rates products at Morgan Stanley. Prior to joining Morgan
Stanley, Hadden was a partner at Goldman Sachs, and head of
government bond trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators at CME Group, which runs commodity and futures
exchanges, initiated a probe against Hadden over Treasury
futures orders placed on the expiration date in Dec. 2008,
according to a "broker check" report published by the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times first broke news of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing people briefed on the matter, the newspaper said the
probe aimed to establish whether Hadden's late trades had
manipulated closing prices and, in turn, made other of his
trades more profitable. ()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Morgan Stanley spokesman confirmed to Reuters that Hadden
is still employed with the bank but did not provide further
information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc board member Rajat Gupta can remain free on bail while he appeals his insider-trading conviction, an appeals court ruled on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta had been scheduled to surrender January 8 to start a two-year prison sentence. But after hearing arguments from Gupta's lawyer and prosecutors, a two-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York granted Gupta's request to stay out of prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 64, was convicted in June of leaking Goldman boardroom secrets to Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group hedge-fund manager at the center of a U.S. government crackdown on insider trading over the past four years. Gupta, also a former head of management consultancy McKinsey &amp; Co, has been free on $10 million bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Goldman director attended the hearing with his family. After the hearing, he hugged his lawyer, Seth Waxman, and patted him on the back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waxman declined to comment on the appeals court's ruling. A spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department had argued that Gupta should not be able to delay going to prison while he awaits the outcome of his appeal, which is expected to be heard by the 2nd Circuit as early as April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Tuesday's hearing, Waxman argued that Gupta's appeal would raise substantial questions that likely would result in his conviction being reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government hadn't proved its case, which relied on "classically inadmissible" or "entirely circumstantial" evidence, Waxman said. "It totally failed in that regard."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waxman said the trial judge, Jed Rakoff, erred in admitting an October 24, 2008 wiretapped conversation between Rajaratnam and David Lau, a Singapore-based portfolio manager at Galleon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the call, Rajaratnam told Lau that he "heard yesterday from somebody who's on the board of Goldman Sachs, that they are gonna lose $2 per share." But Waxman said there was no evidence Lau traded on the tip, and the call had been focused on the general discussions of the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reed Brodsky, the prosecutor who argued before the 2nd Circuit, countered that the wiretaps show that Rajaratnam had provided information to Lau so he could also benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government's evidence showed this was in furtherance of the conspiracy," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2nd Circuit had earlier denied Rajaratnam's similar bid to remain free on bail pending his appeal, which was argued October 25. The fund manager is serving an 11-year prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta is facing a related civil proceeding brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In a court filing late Tuesday, his lawyers argued that he should not pay any civil penalty in connection with the SEC's claims. The SEC has asked the court to impose the maximum allowable penalty of $15.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Despite the prospect of low lending rates for years to come, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) will continue to build new branch offices to take in more deposits to make loans and support some of its business franchises, a top bank executive said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Even in the current rate environment, deposits are a very good business," Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein said at an investor conference after being asked by a stock analyst if the company would consider spending less on new branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's 5,600 U.S. branches, second in number only to Wells Fargo &amp; Co's (WFC.N), have been important to the company's 18 percent growth in deposits, to $1.1 trillion, over the last 18 months, Braunstein said. This year the company has been adding 150 branches to its total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides catering to individuals with bank accounts, credit cards and home loans, branches support the company's services to small and mid-sized companies and its offerings of investment products to the affluent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Branches are core to our business," Braunstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock analysts and institutional investors have been increasingly pressing bank executives to justify building and maintaining branches when profit margins on deposits are at historic lows and when the Internet and mobile phones allow people to make more purchases without cash or make deposits without going to a bank. Some banks, notably Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), have been closing branches to save money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Braunstein, speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference, argued that this is a time for JPMorgan to spend to take market share of deposits and use branches to cement its relationships with customers. When the Federal Reserve allows lending rates to rise again, JPMorgan will make more money, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To the extent the rate environment normalizes over time - and it may take some time to do so - there is going to be significant upside," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking questions on other topics, Braunstein said that big banks are in better shape to undergo next year's round of Federal Reserve stress tests of their capital plans, which can call for spend cash dividends and stock buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with past stress tests, bank portfolios are of high quality because a lot of bad loans have been written off. Banks have also had time to earn money and build up their capital cushions. And they have learned how to improve their test scores by going over past results and talking with examiners, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chance of failing the stress tests has also been reduced because in the current round the Federal Reserve will allow failing banks a chance to submit a more cautious plan, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed has said it will publicly disclose plans that are rejected and resubmitted. Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan, at the same conference earlier in the day, said he plans to avoid having to redo his bank's plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braunstein also said that fourth-quarter revenue from capital markets is running 15 percent to 20 percent below that of the third quarter but should still be higher than a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reaffirmed past assessments from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon that JPMorgan should be able to make $24 billion in annual profit in more normal times. In recent years the company has fallen short of the goal as it recognized losses on mortgages and credit card loans, and received lower rates of interest on loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, JPMorgan reported $19 billion in net income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares were down 0.6 percent at $40.57 on Tuesday at the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dec 4 (Reuters) - Repsol filed a U.S. lawsuit to
block Chevron Corp's deal with Argentina's YPF
, ramping up the Spanish oil company's legal response
to the loss of its assets in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repsol is making good on a threat to launch legal action
against any company that partners with YPF after Argentina
seized control of Repsol's majority stake in the energy company
in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in New York on
Tuesday, comes a day after Repsol filed a complaint against
Argentina at the World Bank's international arbitration forum
over the asset seizure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron's willingness to capitalize on Argentina's
expropriation of Repsol's major interest in YPF is in stark
contrast with that of other major players in the oil and gas
industry," the lawsuit said, citing disapproving comments from
the chief executive of France's Total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Spanish court agreed last month to consider a Repsol
lawsuit against Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokesman said the San Ramon, California-based
company did not have an immediate comment on the U.S. action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit adds to a handful of high-profile legal battles
for Chevron in South America, including its year-long tussle in
Brazil following an offshore spill there and a two-decade
international fight over rainforest pollution in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the center of the Argentina dispute is YPF's discovery in
late 2011 of the Vaca Muerta ("Dead Cow") formation, which
contains an estimated 23 billion barrels of oil equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repsol had initiated, through YPF, negotiations with several
potential partners on Vaca Muerta, including Chevron, the
lawsuit said, but before a Chevron-YPF partnership could be
consummated, Argentina took steps in April to take over the
majority stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Repsol SA v. Chevron Corp in U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-cv-8799.&lt;/p&gt;

who are not heading into the stratosphere some ample entertainment on the
ground. 

    For tourism officials of Las Cruces, New Mexico, the opening of Spaceport
America to tourism could mean as many as 500,000 visitors a year, with
many of those visitors paying $200,000 a seat for a ride of a lifetime on
Richard Branson's prized SpaceShip 2 (SS2) suborbital spacecraft
currently in the final phases of testing. 

    What else is there to do in Las Cruces besides training for space?
Travel-Intel features a look at Las Cruces, New Mexico as a colorful
travel destination in its own right with a line-up of quirky attractions

Via Ecuavisa International</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUITO, Ecuador, Dec. 4, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ecuavisa, the leading TV network in Ecuador, has acquired the exclusive, long term U.S. broadcast rights for the top 'Primera A' division Ecuadorian football teams, whose matches will be aired live in the U.S. through its Ecuavisa International feed. The teams included in the exclusive agreement include Barcelona (currently ranked #1 in Ecuador), Emelec (#2), Deportivo Quito (#8), Deportivo Cuenca (#10) and Universidad Cat&#243;lica (who re-entered Division A in 2008).&#160;The announcement was made today by Ecuavisa CEO Xavier Alvarado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Securing the exclusive U.S. broadcast rights for these leading teams secures Ecuavisa's dominance as the network of choice for Ecuadorians living in the U.S. and football fans regardless of their ethnicity," said Alvarado.&#160;"Passionate about our hometown teams, Ecuadorians living in the U.S. will now be able to turn to Ecuavisa for all of their Primera A football coverage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We can now ensure our viewers that Ecuavisa will be broadcasting the matches of the top performing football teams in Ecuador's Primera A division," added Ecuavisa General Manager Guillermo Hidalgo.&#160;"Fans will be able to watch their team's matches live, cheer for their favorite players and have plenty of opportunity to analyze and debate every play.&#160;That is, afterall, what is most important to sports fans, second only to winning!"&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Ecuadorian football clubs have fought hard for international success. The first club to reach the finals of an international tournament was Barcelona, who reached the finals of the 1990 and 1998 Copa Libertadores, but lost both. In 2001, Emelec became the second club to reach the finals of an international tournament at the 2001 Copa Merconorte, but they too lost. In 2008, LDU Quito became the first club to win an international title by becoming the 2008 Copa Libertadores champion and went on to win the Recopa Sudamericana and the Copa Sudamericana, both in 2009.&#160;Perhaps 2013 will be the year Ecuadorian teams earn the opportunity to compete on the world field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Barcelona:&#160;&#160; Founded in 1925 and based in the populated city of Guayaquil, Barcelona Sporting Club is one of the strongest teams in the Ecuadorian football league.

			Emelec:&#160;Based in Guayaquil, Ecuador, Club Sport Emelec is a sports club which has the highest total number of Ecuadorian championship wins, when all sports are covered including swimming, basketball, boxing, chess, judo etc. Barcelona SC, their main rival has beaten them when only success in the field of football is taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Deportivo Quito: Based in Quito, Ecuador, Sociedad Deportivo Quito was founded in 1940, and currently plays in the Primera A division of the Ecuadorian football league.&#160;Known as 'La Academia de los Ecuatorianos desde 1940' by fans as well as sports journalists, the club earned this name due its playing style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Deportivo Cuenca:&#160;Based in Cuenca, Ecuador, Club Deportivo Cuenca is a professional football club which was founded in 1971. Nicknamed 'Morlacos', the team has one championship win under its belt, achieved in 2004, and four appearances in the Copa Libertadores championship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Chevron's cooperation agreement with Argentina's YPF,

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Mart&#237;n Marr&#243;n, the JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) banker tapped as chief executive officer for the Latin American unit, wants to expand throughout the region as demand for credit and financial advisory grows among companies and investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Marr&#243;n, a 20-year veteran at JPMorgan, succeeds Nicol&#225;s "Gucho" Aguz&#237;n, effective immediately, the bank said on Tuesday. Aguz&#237;n, who has headed the Latin American unit since 2005, will take over the lender's Asia Pacific business next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointments come as JPMorgan recasts responsibilities for some of its top investment and corporate banking executives after a move in July to combine two key business segments. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has set growing outside the United States as one key priority for the bank, currently the largest lender in its home market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marr&#243;n told Reuters in a phone interview that his mission is continuing Aguz&#237;n's mandate of beefing up presence by broadening the bank's portfolio of products and services across the region. JPMorgan, which recently opened an office in Colombia, plans to do so in Per&#250; - a country that has been posting high growth rates over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fundamentals in the region are better than before, and they will keep improving," Marr&#243;n said. "The region is luring investment and also exporting capital - for us, it is a key region where we will continue to expand in terms of presence and products and also geographically."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his new post, Marr&#243;n will continue to serve as head of Americas sales and trading for global emerging markets, a job he has held since 2007. Marr&#243;n was named co-senior country officer of Brazil in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aguz&#237;n will relocate to Hong Kong by year-end, where he will manage the day-to-day business before transitioning to Asia Pacific CEO during 2013, succeeding Jeff Urwin. Urwin will focus on his existing role as JPMorgan's global head of investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adding another talented, hands-on executive to our senior ranks in Asia will ensure that we stay focused on the tremendous opportunities that exist in the region for our clients and our firm, and will help Jeff to allocate more time to his global banking responsibilities over the coming months," the bank said in a memo obtained by Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aguz&#237;n, interviewed by phone along with Marr&#243;n, said his experience in Latin America will prove helpful in handling business in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his seven-year tenure in Latin America, JPMorgan doubled capital and staff for its Brazilian unit, consolidating the offer of all products and services excluding retail banking. Aguzin, a 22-year veteran of JPMorgan, held senior positions across the bank, including in mergers and acquisitions and capital markets, before becoming CEO for Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While they are vastly different cultures, there are similarities between Latin America and Asia, especially how the consumption boom and the emergence of new consumers is now reflected in all sectors," he said. "Just like in Latin America, we want to help our clients capitalize on this and increase our presence there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marr&#243;n will report to Daniel Pinto and Mike Cavanagh, the co-heads of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Asher Levine; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Alden Bentley and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 4 (Reuters) - Despite the prospect of low
lending rates for years to come, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
will continue to build new branch offices to take in more
deposits to make loans and support some of its business
franchises, a top bank executive said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Even in the current rate environment, deposits are a very
good business," Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein said at
an investor conference after being asked by a stock analyst if
the company would consider spending less on new branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's 5,600 U.S. branches, second in number only to
Wells Fargo &amp; Co, have been important to the company's
18 percent growth in deposits, to $1.1 trillion, over the last
18 months, Braunstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides catering to individuals with bank accounts, credit
cards and home loans, branches also support the company's
services to small and mid-sized companies and its offerings of
investment products to the affluent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Branches are core to our business," Braunstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock analysts and institutional investors have been
increasingly pressing bank executives to justify building and
maintaining branches when profit margins on deposits are at
historic lows and when the Internet and mobile phones allow
people to make more purchases without cash or make deposits
without going to a bank. Some banks, notably Bank of America
Corp, have been closing branches to save money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Braunstein, speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference,
argued that this is a time for JPMorgan to spend to take market
share of deposits and use branches to cement its relationships
with customers. When the Federal Reserve allows lending rates to
rise again, JPMorgan will make more money, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To the extent the rate environment normalizes over time -
and it may take some time to do so - there is going to be
significant upside," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking questions on other topics, Braunstein said that big
banks are in better shape to undergo next year's round of
Federal Reserve stress tests of their capital plans, which can
call for spend cash dividends and stock buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with past stress tests, bank portfolios are of high
quality because a lot of bad loans have been written off. Banks
have also had time to earn money and build up their capital
cushions. And they have learned how to improve their test scores
by going over past results and talking with examiners, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chance of failing the stress tests has also been reduced
because in the current round the Federal Reserve will allow
failing banks a chance to submit a more cautious plan, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed has said it will publicly disclose plans that are
rejected and resubmitted. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, at
the same conference earlier in the day, said he plans to avoid
having to redo his bank's plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braunstein also said that fourth-quarter revenue from
capital markets is running 15 percent to 20 percent below the
third quarter, but should still be higher than a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reaffirmed past assessments from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon
that JPMorgan should be able to make $24 billion in annual
profit in more normal times. In recent years the company has
fallen short of the goal as it recognized losses on mortgages 
and credit card loans and received lower rates of interest on
loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, JPMorgan reported $19 billion in net income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares were down 0.7 percent at $40.54 in late
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) board member Rajat Gupta can remain free on bail while he appeals his insider-trading conviction, an appeals court ruled on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta had been scheduled to surrender January 8 to start a two-year prison sentence.

Gupta, also a former head of management consultancy McKinsey &amp; Co, has been free on $10 million bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Goldman director attended the hearing with his family.

&lt;p&gt;* Nicol&#225;s Aguz&#237;n moving from Latin America to Asia Pacific&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan seeks to grow international business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Guillermo Parra-Bernal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Mart&#237;n Marr&#243;n, the JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co banker tapped as chief executive officer for
the Latin American unit, wants to expand throughout the region
as demand for credit and financial advisory grows among
companies and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based Marr&#243;n, a 20-year veteran at JPMorgan,
succeeds Nicol&#225;s "Gucho" Aguz&#237;n, effective immediately, the bank
said on Tuesday. Aguz&#237;n, who has headed the Latin American unit
since 2005, will take over the lender's Asia Pacific business
next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointments come as JPMorgan recasts responsibilities
for some of its top investment and corporate banking executives
after a move in July to combine two key business segments. Chief
Executive Jamie Dimon has set growing outside the United States
as one key priority for the bank, currently the largest lender
in its home market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marr&#243;n told Reuters in a phone interview that his mission is
continuing Aguz&#237;n's mandate of beefing up presence by broadening
the bank's portfolio of products and services across the region.
JPMorgan, which recently opened an office in Colombia, plans to
do so in Per&#250; - a country that has been posting high growth
rates over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fundamentals in the region are better than before, and they
will keep improving," Marr&#243;n said. "The region is luring
investment and also exporting capital - for us, it is a key
region where we will continue to expand in terms of presence and
products and also geographically."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his new post, Marr&#243;n will continue to serve as head of
Americas sales and trading for global emerging markets, a job he
has held since 2007. Marr&#243;n was named co-senior country officer
of Brazil in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aguz&#237;n will relocate to Hong Kong by year-end, where he will
 manage the day-to-day business before transitioning to Asia
Pacific CEO during 2013, succeeding Jeff Urwin. Urwin will focus
on his existing role as JPMorgan's global head of investment
banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adding another talented, hands-on executive to our senior
ranks in Asia will ensure that we stay focused on the tremendous
opportunities that exist in the region for our clients and our
firm, and will help Jeff to allocate more time to his global
banking responsibilities over the coming months," the bank said
in a memo obtained by Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aguz&#237;n, interviewed by phone along with Marr&#243;n, said his
experience in Latin America will prove helpful in handling
business in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his seven-year tenure in Latin America, JPMorgan
doubled capital and staff for its Brazilian unit, consolidating
the offer of all products and services excluding retail banking.
Aguzin, a 22-year veteran of JPMorgan, held senior positions
across the bank, including in mergers and acquisitions and
capital markets, before becoming CEO for Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While they are vastly different cultures, there are
similarities between Latin America and Asia, especially how the
consumption boom and the emergence of new consumers is now
reflected in all sectors," he said. "Just like in Latin America,
we want to help our clients capitalize on this and increase our
presence there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marr&#243;n will report to Daniel Pinto and Mike Cavanagh, the
co-heads of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 4 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co agreed to give
Netflix exclusive TV distribution rights to its movies,
becoming the first major studio to stream its movies to TV
viewers via Netflix instead of distributing them to HBO,
Showtime or other premium TV channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement begins in 2016, after Disney's current deal
with Liberty Media's pay-TV channel Starz expires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal gives Netflix streaming rights to movies from
Disney's live action and animation studios, including those from
 Pixar, Marvel, and the recently acquired Lucasfilms. Disney
bought the famed studio founded by George Lucas and responsible
for the "Star Wars" franchise for $4 billion on Oct. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movies from Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks studios are not
included in the deal, as that studio distributes its movies
through CBS's Showtime on TV. Disney recently signed a
deal to distribute DreamWorks' films theatrically after the
studio's deal with Viacom's Paramount Pictures expired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal's terms, Netflix can stream Disney movies 
beginning seven to nine months after they appear in theaters, as
Starz had done in Disney's prior agreement. The deal does not
cover DVD rentals of Disney movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement follows similar deals Netflix has inked with
smaller studios, including Relativity Media, The Weinstein
company and DreamWorks Animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix shares were up 12.9 percent to $85.83 in afternoon
trading following news of the agreement.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 4 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday
granted a bid by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc board
member Rajat Gupta to remain free on bail while he appeals his
insider-trading conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in New York granted Gupta's request following a hearing. Gupta
had been scheduled to surrender Jan. 8 to start a two-year
prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Motion is granted," Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes said in a
ruling from the bench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 64, was convicted in June of leaking Goldman Sachs
boardroom secrets to Raj Rajaratnam, the hedge-fund manager at
the center of a U.S. government crackdown on insider trading
over the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan sentenced Gupta
in October to two years in prison. Gupta has been free on $10
million bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2nd Circuit had earlier denied Rajaratnam's similar bid
to remain free on bail pending his appeal, which was argued Oct.
25. Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v. Rajat Gupta, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, No 12-4448.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 4 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co said it was
recasting responsibilities of some of its executives in
corporate and investment banking after deciding in July to put
two key business segments into one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps, announced on Tuesday in an employee memo provided

&lt;p&gt;Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said he would discuss a
lawsuit against Chevron for environmental damage in
Ecuador's jungle areas with Argentine President Cristina
Fernandez after plaintiffs took their case to that country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Ecuadorean court last year ordered Chevron to pay $19
billion for the contamination of watersheds over nearly 30 years
that plaintiffs say damaged the health of indigenous
tribespeople and farmers in the Ecuadorean Amazon. Because
Chevron has few assets in Ecuador, the plaintiffs are seeking
enforcement of the ruling in other countries, including
Argentina, Brazil and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, an Argentine judge ordered an embargo on up to
$19 billion worth of Chevron's assets in Argentina. The company
appealed the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has refused to make any payments and accuses
Ecuadorean courts of fraud - a charge the plaintiffs' lawyers
categorically deny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron seeks to delegitimize this legal action that it
lost against our Amazonian people," Correa told Argentine
television on Tuesday, hours before a planned meeting with
Argentina's Fernandez. "We're going to touch on the Chevron
case. We haven't intervened but of course we will always try to
back our citizens so that these rulings are enforced."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Internet holding company IAC/InterActive Corp to "sell" from "neutral" on increasing competition in the search business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's shares fell as much as 10 percent to $42.56 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said IAC is facing rising competition from AOL Inc and Demand Media Inc, which compete with IAC's business of buying search ads directing users to similar search result pages on Ask.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage expects higher competition to hurt IAC's revenue and margins. It cut its price target on the stock to $42 from $53.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also said the recent changes to Internet search giant Google Inc's policies could hurt IAC's search business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Union gave Google four months in October to make changes to its policy, including better informing users on how data will be used, and setting precise periods for data to be retained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said in January it was simplifying its privacy policy, consolidating 60 guidelines into a single one that would apply for all its services, including YouTube, Gmail and the Google+ social network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said it would pool data it collects on individual users across its services, allowing it to better tailor search results and improve service. Users cannot opt out of the new policy if they want to keep using Google's services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With recent changes to Google policies, we believe the risk of additional restriction around search redirection and arbitrage programs is rising," analyst Heath Terry wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Chandni Doulatramani in Bangalore)&lt;/p&gt;

      ExactTarget Chief Marketing Officer Tim Kopp will host a live webcast 
      featuring Forrester Research Inc. Vice President and Principal Analyst 
      Shar VanBoskirk and Microsoft Principal of Product Intelligence Matt 
      Fleckenstein at 2 p.m. Dec. 4 to discuss how marketers can best tackle

      Marketing.&#8221; &#8220;Even so, they admit that cross-channel efforts pose 
      significant challenges for them. Most respondents struggle to understand 
      customers&#8217; cross-channel interactions and to manage execution across 
      multiple technologies.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      VanBoskirk will discuss the study results and insight into what this 
      means for marketers. Key findings from the study include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        78 percent of marketers believe cross-channel marketing is important 
        or very important.
      
			
        76 percent are interested in an integrated messaging platform to 
        manage all customer data and execute across all digital direct 
        channels.
      
			
        51 percent believe their current marketing technologies fall short due 
        to lack of analytics that provide cross-channel data to improve 
        program performance or predict outcomes.
      
			
        44 percent power cross-channel campaigns through individual teams 
        focused on individual marketing channels, such as email, mobile, 
        social media and the Web.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, Dec 04 (Marketwire) -- 
Protecode, a leading provider of open source license management
solutions, today announced that its cloud-based, open source scanning and
license management solution, ProtecodeCloud, is now integrated as a
standard partner image in IBM SmartCloud. As an IBM Business Partner
Solution, ProtecodeCloud enables organizations to easily incorporate
license management into their cloud-based development environments.

Software (OSS) scanning and license management through any web browser
with a secure link. Organizations can scan their code portfolio and
automatically create software Bill of Materials. Users can obtain a list
of all open source and other third party projects, detect modified or
unmodified OSS files in their projects, and interact with a variety of
reports. Scanning can be scaled on demand to fit the dynamic requirements
of an organization.

    "Managing OSS licenses and ensuring compliance has become a necessary
component of a quality development process. Organizations involved in
cloud-based application development are increasingly deploying open
source solutions in order to accelerate development and lower costs, and
managing those licenses and ensuring compliance has become a necessary
component of a quality development process," said Kamyar Emami, COO,
Protecode. "With ProtecodeCloud now part of the standard IBM SmartCloud
offering, organizations can combine the power of IBM development tools
with Protecode's scanning solution with a simple click." 

    Protecode on IBM SmartCloud gives organizations a full overview of all
third party and open source content in their code base, along with the
associated license and copyright information. IBM users are able to
initiate a Protecode instance through their existing SmartCloud account,
acquire file credits from Protecode, and start scanning their code.
Additionally, IBM SmartCloud users can generate reports on license
obligations and license incompatibilities in their project, and consume
and generate Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) files for their supply
chain management. Organizations can also find security vulnerabilities,
encryption package information, and Export Control Classification Numbers
related to their corresponding open source packages.

			ExtraHop Makes Cloud Play with Industry-First Microsoft Hyper-V APM 
      Solution and New Analysis-as-a-Service
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Enables Confident Migration of Business-Critical Applications to 
      Microsoft Hyper-V and Windows Azure, and Eases IT Staff Shortages with 
      Cloud-Based IT Operations Analysis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExtraHop Networks, the leading provider of network-based&#160;application 
      performance management (APM) solutions, today announces two 
      offerings that enable enterprises to more effectively leverage the cloud 
      both for their own business-critical applications and to quickly augment 
      their IT staff with ExtraHop&#8217;s cloud-based remote analysis service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The First Agentless APM Solution for Microsoft Hyper-VGartner 
      projects that Microsoft&#8217;s Hyper-V virtualization platform will account 
      for 27 percent of the entire server virtualization market and 85 percent
			of the small-to-medium business server virtualization market by 
      2013. However, to trust these environments with business-critical 
      applications, organizations must be able to deterministically monitor 
      application performance within Hyper-V environments and correlate 
      performance issues across all tiers of the application delivery 
      chain&#8212;something that legacy, agent-based APM solutions cannot do.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Working with early-access versions of the new Windows Server 2012, which 
      was released for general availability in September, ExtraHop announces 
      the first agentless APM solution to run as a Hyper-V virtual appliance 
      taking advantage of the new Hyper-V Virtual Switch capability. For the 
      first time, Microsoft customers can achieve cross-tier operational 
      visibility in a Hyper-V environment, correlating metrics across the 
      application, network, web, database, and storage tiers. Enterprises can 
      monitor both public and private Windows Azure cloud environments with 
      the new enhancement and can even try the solution in these environments 
      free for 60 days with the ExtraHop 
      Discovery Edition download.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Agent-based APM tools do not offer cross-tier visibility, which is 
      required to provide capacity planning, pinpoint root causes in virtual 
      environments, and understand application and end-user performance,&#8221; said 
      Jesse Rothstein, CEO, ExtraHop Networks. &#8220;Our agentless approach is the 
      first solution for obtaining complete operational intelligence for 
      Hyper-V environments, and it&#8217;s the only way to do it without overhead or 
      manual configuration, which are especially burdensome in dynamic 
      virtualized environments.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Cloud-Based Application, Network, and Infrastructure Analysis with 
      ExtraHop Atlas ConnectWith skilled IT workers continually 
      cited as one of the top-five 
      workplace shortages, ExtraHop&#8217;s new cloud-based Atlas 
      Connect service enables enterprises to quickly and easily gain 
      secure remote access to ExtraHop&#8217;s IT operations experts with a single 
      click. With no network or security adjustments required, Atlas Connect 
      provides organizations with timely application, network, and 
      infrastructure analysis so they can focus staff resources on other 
      important IT projects. The new cloud-based offering also enables cloud 
      and managed service providers (MSPs) to deliver additional value to 
      their own customers by offering them the same analysis-as-a-service 
      options to help manage their IT environments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;One of our major focuses is being more proactive with our IT services. 
      I never realized how useful ExtraHop would be at enabling that,&#8221; said 
      John Trainor, Chief Information Officer, Aaron's Inc.&#160;&#8220;With 
      the Atlas service, we have a complete picture of what is going on across 
      all of our infrastructure. The Atlas Services report supplements our 
      team so that I don&#8217;t have to keep on staff a group of experts who look 
      at performance all day, every day. Instead, we can focus on our business 
      and on moving projects forward. I was shocked at how quickly we realized 
      value from the service, and it just gets better as we resolve 
      low-hanging fruit and move into more chronic, but hard-to-find, problem 
      areas.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detroit, Dec. 4, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On December 4, 2012, Steve Dibert, President of MFI-Miami, an internationally
recognized leader in investigating mortgage fraud, wrote on his
website that 
the rogue foreclosure against Jeffrey Reed, a former Green Beret
and combat veteran of Operation Desert Storm by JPMorgan Chase,
could destroy Jamie Dimon's chances of becoming the next U.S.
Treasury Secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			MFI-Miami claims this
nightmare began for Mr. Reed, his wife and his disabled son after
they signed a loan modification agreement with JPMorgan Chase in
September of 2010. &#160;When Mr. Reed made the third payment of
the modification agreement, JPMorgan Chase, N.A allegedly reneged
on the deal and through their attorneys Trott  Trott began a
process referred to as "Dual Tracking". &#160;This is a process in
which a mortgage servicer makes the homeowner believe the servicer
is working on their behalf when in reality the servicer is covertly
foreclosing on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from allegedly reneging on a signed contract, MFI-Miami believes JPMorgan Chase
violated several Michigan laws during the foreclosure process and
was brazen enough to cheat the state of Michigan and Leelanau
County out of the Michigan Real Estate Transfer Tax when JPMorgan
Chase deeded the house to Fannie Mae during Mr. Reed's redemption
period. &#160;The documents supporting MFI-Miami's claims can be
seen on MFI-Miami's 
website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&#160;"Let's face it, it is not cool to jerk around veterans
especially Green Berets or Navy SEALs,"&#160;&#160;MFI-Miami President Steve Dibert
explains, "Aside from it being bad karma to jerk around combat
veterans, it makes Jamie Dimon and his crew look un-American and
like a bunch of ingrates. Men like Jeff Reed dodged bullets for the
rest of us who didn't have the cojones to sign up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon could be the one who faces
serious repercussions for the actions that JPMorgan Chase
management has taken against Jeff Reed since Dimon is on the short
list to be nominated as the next U.S. Treasury Secretary in
January. &#160; Any bad decisions made by JPMorgan Chase management
in Reed's fight to keep his home could destroy Dimon's chances of
being nominated or being confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			"This is a clear sign that the management at JPMorgan Chase
and the attorneys at David Trott's law firm have lost all sense of
reality when it comes to dealing with not only homeowners but with
combat veterans," said MFI-Miami President Steve Dibert,
"First of all, you shouldn't jerk around veterans period.
&#160;You especially don't pick a fight with someone who's been
trained in guerilla warfare, to ignore pain, to ignore weather, to
live off the land and to eat things that would make a billy goat
puke."&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: Contact:Steve Dibert, President, MFI-Miami

&lt;p&gt;  MENLO PARK, CA, Dec 04 (Marketwire) -- 
InVisage, Inc., a Silicon Valley-based startup revolutionizing the
imaging world, today announced that it is a recipient of the prestigious
Red Herring Top 100 Global award. The award recognizes the leading
private companies from North America, Europe, and Asia, celebrating these
startups' innovations and technologies across their respective industries.

    "This prestigious award reinforces the huge impact our image sensors with
QuantumFilm technology will have on the industry at large," said Jess
Lee, president and CEO of InVisage. "We appreciate the recognition, and
are proud to be part of such an esteemed list of companies."

    Red Herring's Top 100 Global list has become a mark of distinction for
identifying promising new companies and entrepreneurs. Red Herring
editors were among the first to recognize that companies such as
Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, Skype, Salesforce.com, YouTube, and
eBay would change the way we live and work. 

    "Choosing the companies with the strongest potential was by no means a
small feat," said Alex Vieux, publisher and CEO of Red Herring. "After
rigorous contemplation and discussion, we narrowed our list down from
hundreds of candidates from across Global to the Top 100 Winners. We
believe InVisage embodies the vision, drive and innovation that define a
successful entrepreneurial venture. InVisage should be proud of its
accomplishment, as the competition was the strongest it has ever been."

    Red Herring's editorial staff evaluated the companies on both
quantitative and qualitative criteria, such as financial performance,
technology innovation, management quality, strategy, and market
penetration. This assessment of potential is complemented by a review of
the track record and standing of startups relative to their peers,
allowing Red Herring to see past the "buzz" and make the list a valuable
instrument of discovery and advocacy for the most promising new business
models from around the world.

servicer makes the homeowner believe the servicer is working on their
behalf when in reality the servicer is covertly foreclosing on them.

    Aside from allegedly reneging on a contract, MFI-Miami believes JPMorgan
Chase violated several Michigan laws during the foreclosure and failed to
pay the Michigan Real Estate Transfer Tax when JPMorgan Chase deeded the
house to Fannie Mae. These documents are available on MFI-Miami's website.

    "Let's face it, it's just not cool to jerk around veterans especially
Green Berets or Navy SEALs," MFI-Miami President Steve Dibert explains.
"Aside from it being bad karma to jerk around veterans, it makes you look
un-American and like an ingrate since men like Jeff Reed dodged bullets
for the rest of us who didn't have the cojones to sign up."

    JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon could be the one who faces the most
serious repercussions for the actions that JPMorgan Chase management has
taken against Jeff Reed since Dimon is on the short list to be nominated
as the next U.S. Treasury Secretary. Any bad decisions by JPMorgan Chase
management in Reed's fight to keep his home could destroy Dimon's chances
of being nominated or being confirmed.

    "This is a clear sign that the management at JPMorgan Chase and their
attorneys have lost all sense of reality when it comes to dealing with
not only homeowners but with combat veterans," said MFI-Miami President
Steve Dibert, "First of all, you shouldn't jerk around veterans and you
especially don't pick a fight with someone who's been trained in guerilla
warfare, to ignore pain, to ignore weather, to live off the land and to
eat things that would make a billy goat puke."

			AWS Marketplace Announces Support for Software Running on Microsoft 
      Windows&#174;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Amazon Web Services customers can find, buy, and 1-Click deploy 
      software running on Microsoft Windows Server including products from 
      Parallels, MicroStrategy, and Quest Software
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Open Source Operating Systems and Big Data solutions also now 
      available
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Amazon Web Services Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), 
      today announced that the AWS Marketplace now supports Windows-based 
      software and other new software categories including Big Data solutions. 
      AWS Marketplace is an online store that makes it easy for customers to 
      find, compare, and immediately start using the software they need to 
      build products and run their businesses. Customers can now quickly 
      discover and 1-Click deploy software products running on Windows Server 
      to the AWS Cloud, including well-known business intelligence, database, 
      and hosting solutions. As with all products in the AWS Marketplace, 
      customers pay only for what they use and can scale their software up or 
      down as needed. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances 
      running Windows Server, include 2003 R2, 2008, 2008 R2, and 2012 
      editions, and as with all Amazon EC2 Windows instances, customers have 
      the option of enterprise-class support and updates, while taking 
      advantage of the security, scalability, and pay-as-you-go pricing of 
      AWS. To learn more about the AWS Marketplace, visit http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Windows users will now be able to find, deploy, and start using popular 
      application infrastructure, development tools, and business software in 
      minutes. These customers can use the AWS Marketplace to easily search 
      and filter for Windows-compatible software, compare pricing across 
      different server types, and launch in the AWS region of their choice. 
      AWS Marketplace&#8217;s 1-Click deployment lets customers start their software 
      in minutes, automating the provisioning of hardware, and simplifying the 
      deployment and configuration of software. Software charges appear on 
      customers&#8217; existing AWS bills, and AWS consolidates payments through one 
      pipeline &#8211; there&#8217;s no need to set up and manage new accounts for every 
      software product. With no servers to purchase and configure, and no 
      complicated software deployment process, AWS is making it simple and 
      easy to use Windows-based software.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A selection of popular Windows Server software is now available in the 
      AWS Marketplace including products from Parallels Software, 
      MicroStrategy, and Quest Software. Parallels Software is offering Plesk 
      Panel, a widely used hosting control panel solution; MicroStrategy is 
      helping customers quickly build business dashboards with their 
      MicroStrategy 9.3 business intelligence platform; and Quest Software is 
      making available their Toad database productivity software which helps 
      customers support Oracle, SQL Server and MySQL databases running on AWS.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Windows ISVs and software resellers can now list their software in the 
      AWS Marketplace and sell their solutions to hundreds of thousands of 
      active AWS customers around the world. AWS Marketplace can reduce the 
      time to discover, purchase and deploy software dramatically, shortening 
      it from days (or weeks or months) to minutes compared to traditional 
      sales cycles. ISVs and resellers also benefit by having all billing, 
      collections, and disbursements automatically handled by AWS, with 
      software revenue deposited directly into the software vendor&#8217;s or 
      reseller&#8217;s account. This includes the ability to support pay-as-you-go 
      pricing with minimal additional programming effort: sellers simply set 
      the pricing for their software by instance size, and AWS tracks usage 
      and calculates the bill. ISVs can version products and the AWS 
      Marketplace can help notify customers when new versions are available.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Offering customers choice for their cloud infrastructure and enabling 
      open development is a priority for us, which is why we&#8217;re excited to 
      provide our Toad solution for on-demand use across managed databases,&#8221; 
      said Michael Sotnick, Vice President of Worldwide Channels and Alliances 
      for Quest Software (now part of Dell). &#8220;We deliver value to the AWS 
      ecosystem today through our freeware edition that enables more than two 
      million developers to easily leverage Toad for Oracle, Toad for SQL 
      Server and Toad for MySQL within the AWS cloud.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have customers who require an easy, fast method to get our Plesk 
      Control Panel up and running,&#8221; said John Zanni, Vice President of 
      Marketing and alliances, Parallels. &#8220;The integrated billing, including 
      software in the AWS Marketplace, makes using AWS efficient and 
      effective. Being able to tap into the AWS user base is a really 
      attractive strategy to broaden our customer reach.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AWS Marketplace now includes a Big Data category for customers who want 
      to analyze large amounts of data and are looking for ways to quickly 
      solve Big Data problems. Customers can now deploy and immediately start 
      using big data technologies such as Couchbase and MongoDB with the click 
      of a button. In addition, AWS Marketplace offers open source operating 
      systems CentOS, Debian and FreeBSD, extending the selection of operating 
      systems available in Marketplace which include Windows Server, Red Hat 
      Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, and Ubuntu.

			About Amazon Web Services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched in 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began exposing key 
      infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services -- now 
      widely known as cloud computing. The ultimate benefit of cloud 
      computing, and AWS, is the ability to leverage a new business model and 
      turn capital infrastructure expenses into variable costs. Businesses no 
      longer need to plan and procure servers and other IT resources weeks or 
      months in advance. Using AWS, businesses can take advantage of Amazon's 
      expertise and economies of scale to access resources when their business 
      needs them, delivering results faster and at a lower cost. Today, Amazon 
      Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost 
      infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands 
      of enterprise, government and startup customers businesses in 190 
      countries around the world. AWS offers over 30 different services, 
      including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple 
      Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Relational Database Service 
      (Amazon RDS). AWS services are available to customers from data center 
      locations in the U.S., Brazil, Europe, Japan, Singapore and Australia.

			Gemalto&#8217;s UpTeq NFC World&#8217;s First High-End SIM to Obtain American 
      Express, MasterCard and Visa Certifications
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Regulatory News:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gemalto (Euronext NL0000400653 GTO), the world leader in digital 
      security, announces that its UpTeq 
      NFC
			high-end SIM has obtained certifications from the 
      three largest global payment networks - American Express (AMEX), 
      MasterCard and Visa, in addition to previous certification by EMVCo. 
      Available in all form factors for 2G, 3G and 4G handsets, the UpTeq 
      NFC supports contactless payment and other secure services via AMEX 
      ExpressPay, MasterCard PayPass and Visa payWave, providing unmatched 
      flexibility to service providers and end users.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The UpTeq NFC has been certified with the widest scope of 
      functionalities possible. With an optimized delta certification for 
      product approval, this secure service platform can be tailored to fit 
      the needs of each individual NFC deployment. Following the Singapore NFC 
      launch in August, the fully certified UpTeq NFC is now being 
      deployed by Singapore&#8217;s three mobile operators &#8211; M1, SingTel and StarHub 
      &#8211; and will also support CEPAS1, a local payment standard used 
      for small value purchases. The high end SIM will also be customized for 
      the local requirements of KDDI in Japan, Rogers in Canada and Orange in 
      France, amongst others.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The UpTeq NFC acts as a tamper-proof secure element for 
      consumers&#8217; confidential credentials and payment data and is a crucial 
      part of enabling NFC transactions. The strict requirements needed to 
      obtain certification from AMEX, MasterCard and Visa translates into 
      confidence for end users. The flexibility from easy &#8216;onboarding&#8217; &#8211; the 
      addition of new NFC services - also makes it attractive for new high 
      value services such as mobile identification, coupon redemption, loyalty 
      programs and transit cards. The availability of this fully certified NFC 
      SIM on the market provides a strategic time-to-market advantage for 
      mobile operators and banks looking to deploy NFC massively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Our involvement and experience in the telecommunications and banking 
      sectors have enabled us to create a high end security device that 
      leverages the strengths of these two industries,&#8221; commented Fr&#233;d&#233;ric 
      Vasnier, Senior Vice President at Gemalto. &#8220;Combined with the fact 
      that our high availability Trusted Service Management centers in 
      Singapore, the US and France have received certification by MasterCard 
      and Visa, Gemalto is offering a unique service footprint to support 
      mobile NFC deployment anywhere in the world.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;* Higher labor costs, strong A$ boost costs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Chevron's overall 2013 budget just shy of Exxon's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Wheatstone LNG project in Australia still on budget&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dec 5 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp added $15 billion to
the cost of the Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) export
complex, as the U.S. oil company's largest single development
joins a growing list of Australian LNG projects to run over
budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new $52 billion estimate for Gorgon, now 55 percent
complete, came on Wednesday alongside Chevron's $36.7 billion
overall 2013 budget for capital and exploratory spending. That
compares with a 2012 budget of $32.7 billion, and is just shy of
the $37 billion annual budget of far-larger Exxon Mobil Corp
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other Australian LNG projects, Gorgon's inflated cost
is largely due to labor shortages, logistics challenges and the
strength of the Australian dollar. Half of the six other LNG
plants being built in the country have sustained cost increases
averaging more than 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said about one-third of the projected increase for
Gorgon from its 2009 estimate of $37 billion, or A$43 billion,
was due to the appreciating Aussie dollar and a change in the
mix of currencies since the project was sanctioned. Start-up is
still due in late 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron owns 47 percent of Gorgon, while Exxon and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc each hold 25 percent stakes and the
rest is shared by Japanese LNG buyers Osaka Gas, Tokyo
Gas and Chubu Electric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated cost figure for Gorgon, located on a remote
island off Western Australia, is basically right in the middle
of analyst estimates that ran from $45 billion to $60 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts and executives say the economics work out
regardless, since Gorgon gas contracts are linked to oil. While
the Aussie dollar has strengthened by about 20 percent since
2009, and half Gorgon's costs are in the currency, oil prices
are up about 80 percent in that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Geagea, head of Chevron's gas business, also points out
there will be few competing LNG suppliers over the next few
years. "I believe it will hit the market at the right time," he
said in an interview in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shipping LNG to Asian markets is now a hot topic, with Shell
saying earlier on Wednesday it would move the headquarters of
its integrated gas business to Singapore from Europe to account
for the shifting center of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a
highly anticipated report that found exporting LNG from the
United States would benefit the country's economy more than it
would harm it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEYOND GORGON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australian cost inflation could be felt well beyond Gorgon.
Chevron's $29 billion Wheatstone LNG, also in Western Australia,
is due to start up in 2016, though Chevron signed off on that
spending only a year ago when it had a better handle on costs,
and the company said on Wednesday it remained on budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our exploration program continues to discover additional
gas resources that could support future expansions of our
Australian LNG developments," Chevron Vice Chairman George
Kirkland added in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's overall LNG production, including Wheatstone as
well as a delayed plant in Angola starting up next year, will
grow to the oil-equivalent of 460,000 barrels per day (boepd) in
2017 from just under 200,000 boepd now. That is a huge
contributor to Chevron's goal of increasing its overall output
by 700,000 boepd to 3.3 million boepd over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from LNG, Chevron is going to spend heavily next year
on three projects in the Gulf of Mexico: Jack/St Malo, Big Foot
and Tubular Bells, with the first two due to start up in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also included in its list of major projects were deepwater
developments off Nigeria, the Chuandongbei natural gas project
in China, Papa-Terra off Brazil, Hebron off the coast of Canada,
the UK's Clair Ridge, and the Tengiz expansion in Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the San Ramon, California-based company's shift
of focus away from refining, its "downstream" budget for 2013 is
just $2.7 billion, down from $3.6 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Gorgon, Chevron's struggles with cost are only
exacerbated by the ambition of the project on Barrow Island.
Bringing in materials from the mainland adds to cost, and the
island is also Australia's most protected type of nature refuge,
so Gorgon managers face tight environmental guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also included in the price tag is the world's biggest carbon
capture and storage project, which will collect up to 4 million
tonnes of carbon dioxide a year in a reservoir under the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Netflix Inc doesn't plan to pass along the cost of the rights to Walt Disney Co movies to subscribers, a senior executive at the video streaming company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, which analysts estimate paid more than $350 million for the exclusive rights to stream Disney movies to TV beginning in 2016, is not considering a price increase to help finance the deal, said Ted Sarandos, the company's chief content officer, at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not contemplating" raising the $8-a-month subscription fee for unlimited online viewing, Sarandos said during an interview with filmmaker Harvey Weinstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal gives Netflix streaming rights to movies from Disney's live-action and animation studios, including those from Pixar, Marvel, and "Star Wars" producer Lucasfilm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix suffered from a consumer backlash and stock plunge after it announced an unpopular price increase in July 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Netflix's rising content costs have raised worries on Wall Street, with some analysts concerned that Netflix paid too much to get Disney's movies. Tony Wible, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, estimated in a report that Netflix paid more than $350 million a year to secure the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarandos called the arrangement with Disney a "game changer" that for the first time will bring new movies from a major Hollywood studio to an Internet-streaming service rather than a cable channel such as HBO or Showtime. Calling Disney a "near-perfect" media company, he said the two began discussing a deal before Disney acquired Lucasfilm and announced plans for new "Star Wars" movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney talked with other outlets before deciding Netflix was the best platform for its first-run movies, Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said. "This was the highest value deal for us to do. We are thrilled to do it with them," Rasulo said, also speaking at the UBS conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarandos said Disney's movies will bolster one of Netflix's most popular types of content - animated children's movies. Netflix had a previous deal to stream Disney movies through an agreement with Liberty Media's Starz network, which currently holds the exclusive rights to distribute new Disney films on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we looked at the data of when we used to have Starz, the ones that constantly performed for us were those big animated features, lots of repeat viewing," Sarandos said. "It's a nice, safe brand halo when you put your kid in front of an iPad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Netflix executives played down the importance of Disney movies to its service. At that time, 15 Disney titles including "Toy Story 3" and "Tangled" accounted for about 2 percent of U.S. viewing on the Netflix streaming service, the company said in a quarterly letter to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Sarandos said Netflix would like to bring more, fresher content from other studios to its service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said he thought investors' positive reaction to the Disney deal was unwarranted given the price Netflix likely paid. "Ultimately, we think that deals such as the Disney deal could spell doom for Netflix," said Pachter, who rates Netflix "underperform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Perhaps most importantly, a long-term and expensive content deal makes Netflix less attractive to potential acquirers," Pachter said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement received applause from Weinstein, who called it "probably the biggest content deal in the history of our business." He joked he had used Netflix as a "babysitter" at times with his two-and-a-half-year-old child. "Moving into the family area is a very smart play in terms of you almost cornering the market," Weinstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix already had deals to stream movies with smaller studios including Weinstein's studio, The Weinstein Co, as well as Dreamworks Animation and Relativity Media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarandos said he had not heard any response to the deal from Carl Icahn, the activist investor who recently purchased a nearly 10 percent stake in the company. Netflix adopted a poison pill defense to prevent a takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This relationship is pretty new," Sarandos said of Icahn. But he said Icahn has been "publicly and privately very supportive" of Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix shares, which rose 14 percent when the Disney deal was unveiled on Tuesday, gained 1.7 percent at $85.15 in Wednesday afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Disney shares were up 1 percent at $49.81 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Peter Lauria and James Dalgleish)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - An experimental drug showed impressive effectiveness and safety in a mid-stage trial against a common form of advanced breast cancer, lifting Pfizer Inc shares nearly 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 5 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp added $15 billion to
the cost of the Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) export
complex, as the U.S. oil company's largest single development
joins a growing list of Australian LNG projects to run over
budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new $52 billion estimate for Gorgon, now 55 percent
complete, came on Wednesday alongside Chevron's $36.7 billion
overall 2013 budget for capital and exploratory spending. That
compares with a 2012 budget of $32.7 billion, and is just shy of
the $37 billion annual budget of far-larger Exxon Mobil Corp
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other Australian LNG projects, Gorgon's inflated cost

			Chevron Announces $36.7 Billion Capital and Exploratory Budget for 
      2013
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced a $36.7 billion capital 
      and exploratory investment program for 2013. Included in the 2013 
      program are $3.3 billion of planned expenditures by affiliates, which do 
      not require cash outlays by Chevron.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Consistent with long-stated strategies, we&#8217;re investing in a portfolio 
      of very attractive oil and gas projects that will deliver volume growth 
      and real value to our stockholders,&#8221; said Chairman and CEO John Watson. 
      &#8220;Next year&#8217;s program supports several projects currently under 
      construction, including our Australian LNG projects and United States 
      deepwater developments. As these and other projects come online, we 
      anticipate production will reach our 2017 goal of 3.3 million barrels 
      per day. With our strong balance sheet and industry-leading producing 
      margins, I further expect to continue our pattern of significant 
      stockholder distributions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Approximately 90 percent of the 2013 spending program is budgeted for 
      upstream crude oil and natural gas exploration and production projects. 
      Another 7 percent is associated with the company&#8217;s downstream businesses 
      that manufacture, transport and sell gasoline, diesel fuel and other 
      refined products, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals.

      Investment of $33 billion is planned for exploration and production 
      activities, including major natural gas-related projects. Notable major 
      capital investments include developments in Australia, Nigeria, the U.S. 
      deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Kazakhstan, Angola and the Republic of Congo. 
      Planned capital spending also is directed toward improving crude oil and 
      natural gas recovery and reducing natural field declines for existing 
      producing assets throughout the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Australia, the Gorgon three-train LNG foundation project on Barrow 
      Island has been under construction for three years and is approximately 
      55 percent complete.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A cost and schedule review has been completed, and the total cost 
      estimate for the foundation project has increased from AU$43 billion 
      (US$37 billion) to AU$52 billion (US$52 billion). Plant startup is 
      planned for late 2014, leading to the first LNG cargo in the first 
      quarter 2015. The factors contributing to the increased costs and 
      schedule impacts include labor costs and productivity associated with 
      Barrow Island site infrastructure, logistics challenges and weather 
      delays. In addition, currency impacts due to the strengthened Australian 
      dollar and changes in the mix of currencies since project sanction 
      account for approximately one-third of the projected increase in U.S. 
      dollar outlays.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Gorgon project economics are attractive," said Vice Chairman George 
      Kirkland. "While investment requirements have grown, oil prices, which 
      directly impact the overall revenue stream, have increased&#160;by 
      approximately 80 percent over the same time period. In addition, the LNG 
      nameplate capacity has increased by 4 percent to 15.6 million tons per 
      year.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kirkland added, "Our exploration program continues to discover 
      additional gas resources that could support future expansions of our 
      Australian LNG developments. The Wheatstone LNG project is currently 7 
      percent complete and is on budget and on schedule."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the Gulf of Mexico, projects under development include Jack/St. Malo, 
      Big Foot and Tubular Bells. The Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot projects are 
      approximately 55 and 65 percent complete, respectively, and are on 
      budget. First production for both of these projects is expected in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upstream spending in 2013 for major capital projects in other regions 
      includes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Nigeria &#8211; further development of the Usan and Agbami deepwater fields 
        and construction and plant commissioning of the Escravos

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Advertising sales at Walt Disney Co's sports powerhouse ESPN are running slightly ahead of the level they reached at the same point last year, Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the ESPN cable television network, "we have now seen a slight improvement" in the pace of ad sales compared with a year ago, Rasulo said at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assessment for the cable network, a key driver of Disney results, was rosier than the one Rasulo gave when the company released quarterly earnings on November 8.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Passing on a pricy Disney distribution deal could help premium movie channel Starz become a more attractive acquisition target for media companies when Liberty Media spins it off in late December or January, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix said on Tuesday it signed a deal with Disney that gives it exclusive rights to stream Disney movies beginning in 2016, a pact analysts estimated to be worth more than $350 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starz currently has an agreement with Disney for the rights to stream movies 7 to 9 months after they come out in theaters. That deal expires in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Starz' owner, Liberty Media, fell about 5 percent on Tuesday, on concerns it will have a programming shortage. On Wednesday, the shares were up 98 cents, by 0.92 percent at $106.51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberty announced in August that Starz, which runs eponymous movie and TV channels as well as Encore-branded movie channels, will become a separate listed company with about $1.5 billion of debt. The spinoff is expected in late December or early January, according to Macquarie analyst Amy Yong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By not entering into another partnership, we believe this increases Starz' flexibility in the event of M," she said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starz ended the third quarter with 20.8 million Starz subscribers and 34.3 Encore subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starz becomes more attractive to a potential buyers such as Comcast and News Corp, neither of which has a premium movie cable channel, Yong said. She added that these media companies could potentially negotiate better movie deals for Starz or have their own movies to feature on Starz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal, citing an unidentified source, reported on Wednesday that Starz will begin discussions with potential buyers once it is spun off in early January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberty did not respond immediately to a request for comment on a Starz sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Liberty Chief Executive Greg Maffei said the company was "a long way down the road from somebody approaching us" to buy Starz. In October, Liberty Chairman John Malone said that once it is spun out, Starz could have synergies with media companies and said that "everybody could use a big brother."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISI analyst Vijay Jayant said in a research note on Tuesday that Malone's "big brother" comments imply that a potential sale may "be sooner rather than later." He said skipping a new deal with Disney could have saved Starz up to $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Starz could face a programming dearth starting in 2016 when it does not have Disney content, which makes up half of its schedule, according to Janney analyst Tony Wible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The deal leaves Starz with very few options," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starz has been airing original programming such as "Spartacus," a drama set in ancient Rome, and mob drama "Magic City" set in Miami in 1959. Wible said these original shows will not be able to make up for the loss of Disney movies, which could "impact the spin-off value" of Starz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Liana B.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Lisa Richwine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 5 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc doesn't
plan to pass along the cost of the rights to Walt Disney Co
 movies to subscribers, a senior executive at the video
streaming company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix, which analysts estimate paid more than $350 million
for the exclusive rights to stream Disney movies to TV beginning
in 2016, is not considering a price increase to help finance the
deal, said Ted Sarandos, the company's chief content officer, at
the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not contemplating" raising the $8-a-month
subscription fee for unlimited online viewing, Sarandos said
during an interview with filmmaker Harvey Weinstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal gives Netflix streaming rights to movies from
Disney's live-action and animation studios, including those from
Pixar, Marvel, and "Star Wars" producer Lucasfilm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix suffered from a consumer backlash and stock plunge
after it announced an unpopular price increase in July 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Netflix's rising content costs have raised worries on
Wall Street, with some analysts concerned that Netflix paid too
much to get Disney's movies. Tony Wible, an analyst with Janney
Montgomery Scott, estimated in a report that Netflix paid more
than $350 million a year to secure the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarandos called the arrangement with Disney a "game changer"
that for the first time will bring new movies from a major
Hollywood studio to an Internet-streaming service rather than a
cable channel such as HBO or Showtime. Calling Disney a
"near-perfect" media company, he said the two began discussing a
deal before Disney acquired Lucasfilm and announced plans for
new "Star Wars" movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney talked with other outlets before deciding Netflix was
the best platform for its first-run movies, Disney Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said. "This was the highest value
deal for us to do. We are thrilled to do it with them," Rasulo
said, also speaking at the UBS conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarandos said Disney's movies will bolster one of Netflix's
most popular types of content - animated children's movies.
Netflix had a previous deal to stream Disney movies through an
agreement with Liberty Media's Starz network, which currently
holds the exclusive rights to distribute new Disney films on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we looked at the data of when we used to have Starz,
the ones that constantly performed for us were those big
animated features, lots of repeat viewing," Sarandos said. "It's
a nice, safe brand halo when you put your kid in front of an
iPad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Netflix executives played down the importance of
Disney movies to its service. At that time, 15 Disney titles
including "Toy Story 3" and "Tangled" accounted for about 2
percent of U.S. viewing on the Netflix streaming service, the
company said in a quarterly letter to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Sarandos said Netflix would like to bring
more, fresher content from other studios to its service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said he thought
investors' positive reaction to the Disney deal was unwarranted
given the price Netflix likely paid. "Ultimately, we think that
deals such as the Disney deal could spell doom for Netflix,"
said Pachter, who rates Netflix "underperform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Perhaps most importantly, a long-term and expensive content
deal makes Netflix less attractive to potential acquirers,"
Pachter said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement received applause from Weinstein, who called
it "probably the biggest content deal in the history of our
business." He joked he had used Netflix as a "babysitter" at
times with his two-and-a-half-year-old child. "Moving into the
family area is a very smart play in terms of you almost
cornering the market," Weinstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix already had deals to stream movies with smaller
studios including Weinstein's studio, The Weinstein Co, as well
as Dreamworks Animation and Relativity Media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarandos said he had not heard any response to the deal from
Carl Icahn, the activist investor who recently purchased a
nearly 10 percent stake in the company. Netflix adopted a poison
pill defense to prevent a takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This relationship is pretty new," Sarandos said of Icahn.
But he said Icahn has been "publicly and privately very
supportive" of Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix shares, which rose 14 percent when the Disney deal
was unveiled on Tuesday, gained 1.7 percent at $85.15 in
Wednesday afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Disney shares were up
1 percent at $49.81 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* JP Morgan seeks $3.7 million from California ISO
    * FERC agrees with ISO request for more time to settle


    Dec 5 (Reuters) - U.S. federal energy regulators on
Wednesday dismissed a complaint by the energy trading arm of
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co against California's power grid
operator for energy generated in the second quarter of 2012.
    J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp, the JPMorgan unit, filed
the complaint with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) against the California Independent System Operator
(California ISO), on Sept. 14, 2012, alleging the state's grid
operator violated its tariff by underpaying JP Morgan about $3.7
million.
    This dispute is a side issue to FERC's recent decision to
temporarily suspend JP Morgan's market based rate authority to
trade physical power for six months starting April 2013, which
regulators imposed due to the bank's alleged factual
misrepresentations during an investigation into market
manipulation in the California ISO. 
    JP Morgan said in the dismissed complaint that it generated
energy pursuant to the California ISO's exceptional dispatch
instructions.
    The instructions enable the California ISO to commit
resources that are not cleared through normal market procedures
in order to maintain reliable grid operations under unusual
circumstances, like the loss of excessive amounts of generation
or transmission facilities.
    In most cases of exceptional dispatch, the California ISO
pays the generator a premium for the power produced. JP Morgan
alleged in its complaint that it did not receive the required
premium.
    JP Morgan and its subsidiary BE CA LLC control through
tolling agreements 10 generating units in the California ISO
market. JP Morgan alleged that between April 2012 and June 2012,
the California ISO exceptionally dispatched its units 18 times.
    Tolling agreements are like rental agreements - the bank
rents the plants from their owners and operates the facilities.
    The California ISO filed its answer to the JP Morgan
complaint in October, requesting the commission reject the
complaint as premature. The California ISO said that in addition
to the 18 exceptional dispatches that occurred during the second
quarter, JP Morgan has also disputed 115 exceptional dispatches
that took place on 35 different dates in July and August 2012.
    The California ISO said it was reviewing the JP Morgan
dispute and that the bank's complaint before the ISO completed
its review was improperly interfering with the grid operator's
settlement dispute process. The ISO said it designated this
dispute as complex and therefore has 15 months after the
applicable trading day to resolve the dispute.
    FERC agreed with the California ISO and dismissed JP
Morgan's complaint, without prejudice, as premature because the
bank has not exhausted the settlement dispute review process at

&lt;p&gt;Dec 5 (Reuters) - U.S. federal energy regulators on
Wednesday dismissed a complaint by the energy trading arm of
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co against California's power grid
operator for energy generated in the second quarter of 2012.
    J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp, the JPMorgan unit, filed
the complaint with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) against the California Independent System Operator
(California ISO), on Sept. 14, 2012, alleging the state's grid
operator violated its tariff by underpaying JP Morgan about $3.7
million.
    This dispute is a side issue to FERC's recent decision to
temporarily suspend JP Morgan's market based rate authority to
trade physical power for six months starting April 2013, which
regulators imposed due to the bank's alleged factual
misrepresentations during an investigation into market
manipulation in the California ISO. 
    JP Morgan said in the dismissed complaint that it generated
energy pursuant to the California ISO's exceptional dispatch
instructions.
    The instructions enable the California ISO to commit
resources that are not cleared through normal market procedures
in order to maintain reliable grid operations under unusual
circumstances, like the loss of excessive amounts of generation
or transmission facilities.
    In most cases of exceptional dispatch, the California ISO
pays the generator a premium for the power produced. JP Morgan
alleged in its complaint that it did not receive the required
premium.
    JP Morgan and its subsidiary BE CA LLC control through
tolling agreements 10 generating units in the California ISO
market. JP Morgan alleged that between April 2012 and June 2012,
the California ISO exceptionally dispatched its units 18 times.
     Tolling agreements are like rental agreements - the bank
rents the plants from their owners and operates the facilities.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 5 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc doesn't
plan to pass along the cost o f the rights to Walt Disney Co
 movies to subscribers, a senior Netflix executive said
on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, which analyst s estimate paid more than $3 5 0 million
for the exclusive rights to stream Disney movies to TV beginning
in 2016, is not considering a price increase to he lp finance the
deal, said Ted Sarandos, the company's chief content officer, at
the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference.
[ID: nL1E8N4CZ6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not contemplating" raising the $8-a-month
subscription fee for unlimited online viewing," S arandos said
d uring a n interview with filmmaker Harvey Weinstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal gives Netflix streaming rights to movies from
Disney's live-action and animation studios, including those from
Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix suffered from a consumer backlash and stock plunge
after it announced an unpopular price increase in July 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Netflix's rising content costs have raised worries on
Wall Street, w ith some analysts concerned that Netflix paid too
much to get Disney's movies. Tony Wible, an analyst with Janney
Montgomery Scott, estimated in a report that Netflix paid more
than $350 million a year to secure the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarandos called the arrangement with Disney a "game changer"
that for the first time will bring new movies from a major
Hollywood studio to an Internet-streaming service rather than a
cable channel suc h as HBO or Showtime. C alling Disney a
"near-perfect" media company, he said the two bega n discussing a
de a l before Disne y acqu ired Lucas film and anno unced plan s for
new "Star Wars" movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's movies will bolster one of Netflix's most popular
types of content - animated children's movies, Sarandos said.
Netflix had a previous deal to stream Disney movies through an
agreement with Liberty Media's Starz network, whi ch cur rently
holds the excl usive rights to dist ribute new Disney films on T V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we looked at the data of when we used to have Starz,
the ones that constantly performed for us were those big
animated features, lots of repeat viewing," Sarandos said. "It's
a nice, safe brand halo when you put your kid in front of an
iPad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix would like to bring more, fresher content from other
studios to its service, Sarandos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement received applause from Weinstein, who called
it "probably the biggest content deal in the history of our
business." He joked he had used Netflix as a "babysitter" at
times with his two-and-a-half year old child. "Moving into the
family area is a very smart play in terms of you almost
cornering the market," Weinstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarandos said he had not heard any response to the deal from
Carl Icahn, the activist investor who recently purchased a 10
percent stake in the company. Netflix adopted a poison pill
defense to prevent a takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This relationship is pretty new," Sarandos said of Icahn.
But he said Icahn has been "publicly and privately very
supportive" of Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix shares, which rose 14 percent when the deal was
unveiled on Tuesday, g ave some of those gains back in Wednesday
trading. Its shares were down 2.8 percent, or $2.44, to $84.21
in early afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Disney shares wer e up 
 35 cents, or less than 1 pe r cent, to $49.63 on the New York
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Regulatory News:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Publicis Groupe [EURONEXT Paris: FR0000130577 - PUB] and IBM today 
      outlined an aggressive global go-to-market plan to pursue the 
      multi-billion global market opportunity for business-to-business and 
      business-to-consumer eCommerce.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Working together, the companies are uniquely positioned to drive the 
      future of eCommerce by redefining the role of the transaction in the 
      brand experience. The partnership combines Publicis Groupe&#8217;s deep 
      experience in consumer insights, technology and building a broad 
      eCommerce ecosystem around transactions with IBM&#8217;s technology, expertise 
      and business process innovation to serve the needs of today&#8217;s Chief 
      Marketing Officers (CMOs) and Chief Information Officers (CIOs) who want 
      to align their organizations and purchase decisions around integrated 
      content and commerce.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Publicis Groupe&#8217;s Rosetta unit plans a global expansion to capture a 
      larger share of the growing demand for Commerce-related technology and 
      services. Commerce-related revenues Rosetta has derived from the 10+ 
      year IBM/Rosetta relationship have grown 100% in 2012 alone and are 
      expected to triple over the next three years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The go-to-market partnership enables Publicis Groupe to immediately 
      capitalize on an urgent need in the marketplace for a new type of agency 
      partner &#8211; a highly specialized commerce agency &#8211; that is able to connect 
      CMOs and CIOs of today&#8217;s global brands, facilitated by technology to 
      build and optimize the commerce and content ecosystem. The partnership 
      serves a rapidly expanding, global client list that includes: Aldo 
      (footware retail/Canada), Cencosud (grocery retail/Chile), Dorel 
      (consumer Products/US), Follett (educational services/US), Genco 
      (distribution/US), hhgregg (electronics retail/US), Holt-Renfrew (luxury 
      retail/Canada), Luxottica (eyeware retail/Italy), Newell-Rubbermaid 
      (consumer products/US), Sigma Pharma (healthcare/Australia) and T-Mobile 
      (telecommunications/US).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the next three years, Publicis Groupe plans to establish four 
      global Commerce hubs, beginning with an expansion of its current U.S. 
      hub on the West Coast, and then launch new centers in Western Europe, 
      China and Latin America. Each hub will consist of a team of 
      professionals skilled in the IBM Smarter Commerce offering portfolio. 
      The Publicis Rosetta team will work in concert with a local IBM team and 
      local agency professionals to deliver software and services with IBM 
      Smarter Commerce related offerings for clients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Publicis Groupe breaks down the nearly $600MM global market opportunity 
      by 2015 as: approximately $390MM in North America; $130MM in Western 
      Europe (France, UK and Germany); $30MM in China; and $30MM Latin America 
      (primarily Chile and Brazil).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the expanded focus on the global market, Publicis Groupe will 
      continue to deliver commerce solutions for leading brands at a 
      consistent and global scale while integrating the following critical 
      components: a full life-cycle strategy powered by customer-centric 
      market intelligence; world-class multi-channel customer experience and 
      creative; and enterprise-level tech strategy, execution and servicing; 
      and continuous product-based innovation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM&#8217;s Smarter Commerce initiative, launched in March 2011 is an approach 
      designed to accelerate key business processes covering the marketing, 
      sales, commerce, supply chain and customer service functions of business 
      clients to help meet the needs of the increasingly demanding digital 
      customer. The partnership will offer IBM software that supports Web 
      analytics, digital marketing and eCommerce, including product lines such 
      as IBM Coremetrics, Unica, DemandTec, Tealeaf, ILOG, Cognos and SPSS, 
      among others.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jean-Yves Naouri, Chief Operating Officer of Publicis Groupe and 
      Executive Chairman of Publicis Worldwide said, &#8220;A key reason for 
      Publicis Groupe&#8217;s acquisition of Rosetta was to continue to build 
      technology driven differentiation in the market. Our expanded 
      partnership is a clear statement of our ongoing confidence in Rosetta&#8217;s 
      differentiated value proposition centered on personalization and 
      commerce.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rosetta President, Tom Adamski continued, &#8220;In the past, marketing was 
      a distinct activity that led consumers through the various stages of the 
      &#8216;funnel,&#8217; culminating in the transaction. That&#8217;s no longer the case. The 
      transaction is now at the very center of the brand experience and the 
      beginning of a potentially deep and long-lasting relationship between 
      the brand and the consumer that technology has made possible for 
      marketers to achieve at scale. Expanding our partnership with IBM, we 
      can help clients realize the full potential.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Publicis Groupe projects the expansion will generate commerce-related 
      revenues for Rosetta alone approaching $100MM by 2013, and expects to 
      grow rapidly to total commerce-related revenue of over $300MM by 2015.

			Tanzania Expands Immunization Program To Include Pfizer&#8217;s Prevenar 13 
      For Prevention Of Pneumococcal Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			More than 1.7 Million Infants and Young Children in Tanzania to 
      Receive Coverage Against Pneumococcal Disease, a Leading Cause of 
      Pediatric Death in Developing Countries1,2,3
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) welcomes today&#8217;s announcement from the GAVI 
      Alliance that Pfizer&#8217;s pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Prevenar 13* 
      (pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine [13-valent, adsorbed]), 
      is now included in the expanded pediatric immunization program in 
      Tanzania. Pneumococcal disease is one of the leading causes of 
      vaccine-preventable deaths worldwide in children younger than 5 years of 
      age and results in more than one out of every five deaths in children 
      younger than 5 years of age in Tanzania.2,3
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The availability of Prevenar 13 in Tanzania is made possible by the 
      Advance Market Commitment (AMC), an innovative funding mechanism that 
      provides newer vaccines on a sustainable, affordable and accelerated 
      basis to the world&#8217;s poorest countries. In just two years, 20 countries, 
      including Tanzania, have introduced Prevenar 13 into their immunization 
      programs as part of the AMC. This potentially lifesaving vaccine is 
      being offered to help protect an estimated 10.5 million infants and 
      children in these developing countries from pneumococcal pneumonia and 
      invasive disease caused by the serotypes in the vaccine.1,4
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pfizer is accelerating access to Prevenar 13 to infants and children 
      who are most vulnerable, and our partnership with the GAVI Alliance 
      helps ensure that this goal is realized,&#8221; says Susan Silbermann, 
      president, vaccines, Pfizer. &#8220;Since pneumococcal pneumonia continues to 
      be a major threat to young children in Tanzania, the AMC has the 
      potential to significantly contribute to the achievement of the United 
      Nation&#8217;s fourth Millennium Development Goal of reducing infant mortality 
      two-thirds by 2015.&#8221;5
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While public health interventions have helped to decrease infant 
      mortality in Tanzania by 47 percent between 1990 and 2010,5 
      mortality rates are still among the highest in the world. There are more 
      than 100,000 deaths of Tanzanian children under the age of 5 every year.6
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On Dec. 6, 2012, representatives from the GAVI Alliance, including board 
      chair Dagfinn H&#248;ybr&#229;ten; the United Nations; government officials, 
      including Tanzania&#8217;s Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Hussein Ali 
      Mwinyi; and the country&#8217;s first lady, Salma Kikwete, will gather at a 
      health and vaccination center in Morogoro, outside Dar es Salaam, for 
      the official launch and immunization of the first Tanzanian child with 
      Prevenar 13.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer will supply up to 480 million doses of Prevenar 13 under the AMC 
      to help expand immunization programs against pneumococcal disease by 
      2023.7
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About the Advance Market Commitment (AMC)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has been a long-standing partner of the GAVI Alliance, since 
      March 2010, when the Company entered into the first 10-year agreement to 
      provide Prevenar 13 to infants and young children in the world&#8217;s poorest 
      countries under the AMC framework. Pneumococcal vaccines are expected to 
      reach more than 50 GAVI-supported countries by 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In December 2010, Nicaragua became the first GAVI-eligible country to 
      launch a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Prevenar 13, through the AMC. 
      To date, Prevenar 13 has been introduced into the national immunization 
      programs of the following GAVI-eligible countries: Benin, Burundi, 
      Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, 
      Djibouti, Gambia, Ghana, Guyana, Honduras, Malawi, Mali, Nicaragua, 
      Rwanda, Sao Tome, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Yemen and Zimbabwe.7
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To meet the growing global need for Prevenar 13, Pfizer is increasing 
      its manufacturing capabilities through a combination of capital 
      investment, process improvements and efficiency measures throughout its 
      supply network. Additionally, Pfizer is engaged in the development of a 
      preserved, multi-dose vial which, subject to the required regulatory 
      approval, World Health Organization prequalification and AMC eligibility 
      requirements, would provide an alternative option for developing world 
      countries.7
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Prevenar 13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13 was first introduced for use in infants and young children 
      in December 2009 in Europe and is now approved for such use in more than 
      120 countries worldwide.
			It is already the most widely used 
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the world, and more than 500 million 
      doses of Prevenar/Prevenar 13 have already been distributed worldwide.7 
      Currently, Prevenar 13 is included as part of a national 
      immunization program in more than 60 countries, offering coverage 
      against invasive pneumococcal disease to more than 30 million children 
      per year.7
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13 offers the broadest serotype coverage of any currently 
      available pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for prevention of pneumococcal 
      disease including invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia and otitis 
      media.8 The 13 pneumococcal serotypes in Prevenar 13 (1, 3, 
      4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) are among the most 
      prevalent invasive-disease causing strains in children worldwide.8,9
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13 is also approved for use in adults 50 years of age and older 
      in more than 100 countries, and is the first and only pneumococcal 
      vaccine to be granted World Health Organization prequalification in the 
      adult population.7
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13 is marketed in the United States as Prevnar 13&#174; 
      (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 
      Protein]).10
			In the United States, 
      Prevnar 13 is not indicated for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia 
      in the pediatric population.10
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pneumococcal Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumococcal disease is a group of illnesses caused by the bacterium Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), also known as pneumococcus.11 
      It includes invasive infections such as bacteremia and meningitis, as 
      well as non-invasive disease such as pneumonia and acute otitis media.11 
      While pneumococcus can infect people of all ages, infants and young 
      children and the elderly are at heightened risk.12 The World 
      Health Organization estimates that more than 1.6 million people &#8211; 
      including more than 800,000 children under 5 years of age &#8211; die every 
      year from pneumococcal infections. Nearly all these deaths occur in the 
      world&#8217;s poorest countries.13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Indications for Prevnar 13 in the United States
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the United States, Prevnar 13 is indicated for use in children six 
      weeks through 5 years of age for the prevention of invasive disease 
      (e.g., meningitis, bacteremia) caused by 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae 
      serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F). The 
      vaccine is also indicated in adults 50 years of age and older for active 
      immunization for the prevention of pneumonia and invasive disease caused 
      by the 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes contained in the 
      vaccine (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F). 
      Indication is based on immune responses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			World Health Organization Indication for 
      Prevenar 13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The World Health Organization prequalified Prevenar 13 for active 
      immunization of infants and children from 6 weeks through five years of 
      age against invasive disease, pneumonia and otitis media and for active 
      immunization of adults 50 years of age and older against pneumonia and 
      invasive disease caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 
      6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) contained in the vaccine. The 
      World Health Organization prequalification allows for the procurement of 
      Prevenar 13 by United Nations agencies. The prequalification is for 
      global use of the vaccine in a single-dose vial.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information for Prevnar 13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8226;Prevnar 13 should not be given to anyone with a history of severe 
      allergic reaction to any component of Prevnar 13 or any diphtheria 
      toxoid&#8211;containing vaccine
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8226;Children and adults with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV infection, 
      leukemia) may have a reduced immune response
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8226;In adults, the common side effects were pain, redness, or swelling at 
      the injection site; limitation of arm movement; fatigue; headache; 
      muscle pain; joint pain; decreased appetite; chills; or rash
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8226;In adults, immune responses to Prevnar 13 were reduced when given with 
      injected seasonal flu vaccine
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8226;A temporary pause of breathing following vaccination has been observed 
      in some infants born prematurely
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8226;The most commonly reported serious adverse events in children were 
      bronchiolitis (an infection of the lungs) (0.9%), gastroenteritis 
      (inflammation of the stomach and small intestine) (0.9%), and pneumonia 
      (0.9%)
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8226;In infants and toddlers, the most common side effects were tenderness, 
      redness or swelling at the injection site, irritability, decreased 
      appetite, decreased or increased sleep, and fever

		&lt;p&gt;
			LexisNexis Adds &#8220;Time Entry Advisor&#8221; and Integration with Microsoft 
      Outlook to Time Matters Practice Management Software for Law Firms
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Time Matters 12 Helps Lawyers Record All Billable Hours Worked and 
      Streamlines Law Firm Practice Management Activities
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LexisNexis&#174; Legal  Professional (www.lexisnexis.com), 
      a leading provider of content and technology solutions, today announced 
      the latest release of the company&#8217;s award winning Time Matters&#174; 
      practice management software for law firms. Time Matters 12 helps legal 
      professionals capture and record billable time using the new Time Entry 
      Advisor feature, and with the improved and expanded Time Matters 
      software add-in for Microsoft&#174; Outlook&#174;,
			lawyers 
      can work more efficiently.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;By expanding the integration of Time Matters with Microsoft Outlook and 
      through the addition of the new Time Entry Advisor feature, Time Matters 
      12 helps legal professionals operate more efficiently and helps law 
      firms to increase their revenues by capturing billable hours that might 
      otherwise be lost,&#8221; said Michael Lipps, vice president and managing 
      director, Legal Business Software Solutions for LexisNexis Legal  
      Professional.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new Time Entry Advisor feature automatically tracks unbilled 
      documents, events, tasks and other work, to help remind users to 
      complete billing information for those activities. Unbilled activities 
      are presented in an easy-to-use spreadsheet with filtering options 
      enabling lawyers and other firm personnel to access a chronological view 
      of potential billable entries the application has recorded. Users can 
      then click on individual tasks they wish to enter as billable client 
      work and update the time record accordingly. Additional filtering 
      options allow users to view unaccounted tasks by date, matter, client, 
      lawyer or type of task for easier recollection and time coding. 
      Ultimately, these features enable attorneys and firms to account for and 
      invoice billable client work more accurately to help increase firm 
      revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to a LexisNexis 
      survey conducted in May of this year, attorneys polled claimed they 
      typically bill an average of only six hours out of an average nine-hour 
      work day. This represents as much as a 33 percent loss of possible 
      billable time per year. Based on an average blended billable rate of 
      around $200 per fee earner, this could equate to a possible $110,000 in 
      additional annual revenue per attorney.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A follow-up 
      survey was conducted in July to help determine how these 
      non-billable hours were spent. The survey showed that &#8220;Practice 
      Management and Administrative Tasks&#8221; were the biggest culprit, and a 
      further ten percent of survey respondents claimed they couldn&#8217;t 
      accurately account for all their time as a result of their chaotic 
      schedules (e.g. travel to and from court), coupled with a variety of 
      personal distractions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Time Matters&#174;
			for Microsoft&#174; Outlook&#174; 
      is a new software add-in for Outlook that provides views of and access 
      to relevant Time Matters data directly from within Outlook. Users gain 
      one-click access to relevant practice management data &#8211; including 
      documents, contacts, notes, billing information and more &#8211; without ever 
      leaving Outlook. Users can also save a Microsoft Outlook email (as well 
      as single or multiple attachments to each email) as document records 
      within the Time Matters program. Providing lawyers access to important 
      case information from within the Outlook application many if not most 
      use every day, enables them to prepare more efficiently for a client 
      meeting or phone call and then complete a billing record for that 
      activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Time Matters is a flexible practice management application that allows 
      law firms and other organizations to manage and collaborate on legal 
      matters and to streamline their operations to increase profitability. 
      Through the Time Matters&#174; Mobility service, key features of 
      Time Matters can be accessed using Internet-connected smartphones and 
      other mobile or tablet devices, allowing legal professionals to be 
      productive even when they are not in the office. Click on the following

			Pfizer Presents Phase 2 Data Showing Investigational Therapy 
      PD-0332991 Plus Letrozole Significantly Improved Progression Free 
      Survival Compared With Letrozole Alone In Patients With ER Positive, 
      HER2 Negative Advanced Breast Cancer

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Randomized Phase 3 Study Evaluating CDK 4 and 6 Inhibitor, 
      PD-0332991, Planned for 2013
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. today announced randomized Phase 2 data that showed 
      PD-0332991 (PD-991) in combination with letrozole significantly extended 
      progression free survival (PFS) compared with letrozole alone in 
      post-menopausal patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human 
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) locally advanced or 
      metastatic breast cancer. For patients treated with the combination of 
      PD-991 plus letrozole, median PFS was 26.1 months, a statistically 
      significant improvement compared to the median PFS in women who received 
      letrozole alone, which was 7.5 months (HR=0.37 [95% CI: 0.21, 0.63]; P 
      0.001). These data were presented today and featured in a press 
      conference at the 35th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer 
      Symposium (Abstract #S1-6).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These results are especially important because of the magnitude of 
      clinical effect observed and the fact that PD-991 represents a potential 
      first-in-class compound. Based on these positive Phase 2 data, Pfizer is 
      planning to open a randomized Phase 3 study of PD-991 in this patient 
      population in 2013,&#8221; said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of 
      clinical development and medical affairs for Pfizer&#8217;s Oncology Business 
      Unit. &#8220;We are working with regulatory authorities to advance the 
      development of this promising compound in the most expeditious and 
      responsible way.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer1 and the 
      leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide.2 
      Estrogen receptor positive, HER2- breast cancer represents approximately 
      60 percent of all cases of breast cancer.3 Despite currently 
      available treatments, survival rates for advanced or metastatic breast 
      cancer remain low.4
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About the Phase 2 Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The focus of Phase 2 evaluation of PD-991 was to measure the clinical 
      activity of PD-991 in combination with letrozole versus letrozole alone 
      in post-menopausal women with ER+, HER2- locally advanced or metastatic 
      breast cancer. In Part 1, 66 patients were enrolled. Preliminary results 
      were presented in May 2012 at the IMPAKT Breast Cancer Conference in 
      Brussels, Belgium, and showed statistically significant improvement in 
      median PFS in the PD-991 plus letrozole arm versus the letrozole arm. 
      Part 2 enrolled 99 additional patients whose tumors were selected for 
      presence of biomarkers: cyclin D1 amplification and/or p16 loss. The 
      results presented here at SABCS reflect the combined interim data 
      analysis of parts 1 and 2 of the Phase 2 evaluation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In patients with measurable disease, the objective response rate was 45 
      percent for those women who received PD-991 plus letrozole versus 31 
      percent for those who received letrozole alone. The clinical benefit 
      rate (defined as complete response plus partial response plus stable 
      disease for &#8805;24 weeks) was 70 percent versus 44 percent, respectively. 
      The differences observed in the objective response rate and clinical 
      benefit rate were statistically significant. The most frequently 
      reported treatment-related Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) in patients 
      who received the combination therapy were neutropenia, leucopenia, 
      anemia and fatigue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Both Part 1 and Part 2 of this Phase 2 evaluation are ongoing but no 
      longer enrolling new patients. Final efficacy and safety data are 
      expected to be presented at a future medical congress.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In demonstrating very strong efficacy and a manageable tolerability 
      profile, these new data represent a potential major advancement in 
      breast cancer clinical research and our continued efforts to identify 
      new medicines that target patients most likely to have an optimal 
      response,&#8221; said Dr. Richard S. Finn, Associate Professor of Medicine, 
      Revlon/UCLA Women&#8217;s Cancer Research Program at Jonsson Comprehensive 
      Cancer Center, UCLA, and lead investigator of the Phase 2 trial. &#8220;The 
      oncology community is looking forward to the further evaluation of 
      PD-991 in the planned Phase 3 trial and very interested in the potential 
      for this novel CDK 4 and 6 inhibitor to improve the treatment landscape 
      for patients with advanced breast cancer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About PD-991
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PD-991 is an investigational, oral and selective inhibitor of the CDK 4 
      and 6 kinases. CDK 4 and 6 are two closely related kinases that enable 
      tumor cell progression during phase G1 to phase S in the cell cycle. 
      This progression is necessary for DNA replication and cell division. 
      Inhibition of CDK 4 and 6 has been shown to prevent the deactivation of 
      retinoblastoma, a tumor suppressor protein, and interfere with tumor 
      cell progression. In pre-clinical studies, PD-991 was shown to be an 
      inhibitor of cell growth and a suppressor of DNA replication by 
      preventing cells from entering S phase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to breast cancer, PD-991 is currently being evaluated 
      through Pfizer-sponsored and investigator-initiated research in other 
      cancers, including liposarcoma, non-small cell lung cancer, liver 
      cancer, ovarian cancer, glioblastoma, refractory solid tumors, multiple 
      myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Rosneft and ExxonMobil Sign Agreement for Western Siberia Tight Oil 
      Pilot Project
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rosneft and ExxonMobil 
      today signed a Pilot Development Agreement establishing a joint project 
      to assess the possibility of commercial production of tight oil reserves 
      at the Bazhenov and Achimov formations in Western Siberia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The agreement was signed by Igor Sechin, president and chairman of the 
      management board at Rosneft, and Stephen Greenlee, president of 
      ExxonMobil Exploration Company. Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief 
      executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), was present for 
      the signing, as well as the senior management of both companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The document is another step towards implementation of the long-term 
      strategic cooperation agreement the companies signed in August 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The companies will set up a joint venture to run a pilot program and 
      potential commercial production with equity interests of 51 percent for 
      Rosneft and 49 percent for ExxonMobil. Work will be carried out at 
      Rosneft&#8217;s 23 license blocks covering a total area more than 10,000 
      square kilometers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rosneft and its production subsidiaries will provide staff and access to 
      existing infrastructure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil will provide financing of up to $300 million for the pilot 
      program, as well as state-of-the-art technologies and specialists in 
      geology, development and well engineering and completion. ExxonMobil 
      will also provide production management services for drilling complex 
      horizontal wells so as to evaluate and commercially develop these tight 
      oil reserves.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The pilot program will encompass broad-reaching work across a number of 
      areas, including drilling new horizontal and vertical wells using the 
      latest fracturing technologies, deepening existing wells and 
      re-development of idle wells. The companies also plan to run an advanced 
      core survey program that will include geomechanical surveys. Drilling 
      will begin in 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upon completion of the pilot program, Rosneft and ExxonMobil will 
      jointly select blocks for commercial development in 2015. The two 
      companies will draw on their technical and production experience to 
      ensure commercially viable development and potential production growth 
      in Russia&#8217;s West Siberian basin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Maximizing production efficiency at every field and exploring new 
      technologies to exploit the potential of tight reservoirs is a strategic 
      priority for Rosneft,&#8221; said Sechin. &#8220;I am certain that our experience 
      and infrastructure in Western Siberia, coupled with the state-of-the-art 
      technologies of our partner ExxonMobil, will allow us to begin 
      developing large tight oil reserves.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tillerson said ExxonMobil would use experience gained in North America 
      resource development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The strategic combination of Rosneft&#8217;s operational experience in the 
      area and ExxonMobil&#8217;s advanced technology gains from tight oil 
      experience in North America and elsewhere provides a strong capability 
      to fully evaluate and potentially develop this large tight oil 
      resource,&#8221; said Tillerson.

&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - Walt Disney World marked the grand opening on Thursday of a new Fantasyland at its Magic Kingdom park in Orlando, Florida, where patrons won't have to wait very long to see exhibits and alcoholic beverages will be offered for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney World said the opening capped the largest expansion in the park's 41-year history, doubling the size of Fantasyland and offering two new rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fantasyland is the most popular land in the most popular theme park in the world," Disney spokeswoman Kim Prunty said. "It makes perfect sense that this is where we would look to expand the guest experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney declined to reveal the cost of the expansion, widely reported to be about $425 million, and company officials would not provide specifics on projected increased patronage and revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beer and wine will be available with dinner inside the park's new Be Our Guest restaurant. It is the first time alcohol is being served at the Magic Kingdom, but unlike other parks at Disney World, hard liquor will not be sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Fantasyland, which expanded from 10 acres to 21, takes over space previously devoted to "Mickey's ToonTown Fair," which closed in 2011 to make way for the expansion, and the "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" attraction which lasted from 1971 to 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fantasyland also incorporates an unspecified amount of previously unused space, but Prunty said she was unable to specify how much land had actually been added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new rides that feature Disney cartoon characters include one called the "Under the Sea-Journey of the Little Mermaid" and another dubbed "The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train," which remains under construction with an opening expected in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A duplicate "Dumbo, the Flying Elephant" ride was added to reduce previously long wait times at the iconic attraction popular with families with young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line for Dumbo now includes a playroom for children aged 2-12 where they can burn off energy while awaiting their turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more relaxing than keeping the kids standing in line and trying to keep them entertained," said Tim Dixon, 41, of Racine, Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other visitors, he held a pager that would signal his family when it was time for them to board the Dumbo ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The queue for the Little Mermaid ride snakes through a decorated indoor space shielded from the hot Florida sun and ends in an efficient constantly moving, conveyor belt-style boarding system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Tom Brown and Philip Barbara)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, Fla. Dec 6 (Reuters) - Walt Disney World marked
the grand opening on Thursday of a new  Fantasyland at its Magic
Kingdom park in Orlando, Florida, where patrons won't have to
wait very long to see exhibits and alcoholic beverages will be
offered for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

one called the "Under the Sea-Journey of the Little Mermaid" and
another dubbed "The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train," which remains
under construction with an opening expected in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A duplicate "Dumbo, the Flying Elephant" ride was added to
reduce previously long wait times at the iconic attraction
popular with families with young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line for Dumbo now includes a playroom for children aged
2-12 where they can burn off energy while awaiting their turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more relaxing than keeping the kids standing in line

&lt;p&gt;Facebook may be turning to its longtime pal Microsoft to complete its plan to create an external advertising network. Reports peg the social network as expressing serious interest in acquiring Microsoft&#8217;s Atlas Solutions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Atlas Solutions is an ad platform that Microsoft picked up in 2007 as part of its acquisition of aQuantive for $6 billion. Microsoft is looking to offload the property, and Facebook appears to be the leading candidate for it, according to multiple sources cited in separate reports from AllThingsD and Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When reached for comment, a spokesperson said Facebook doesn&#8217;t comment on rumors or speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should Facebook get its hands on the ad-serving technology, the social network would be in a prime position to release an external ad network, as has been rumored, to serve its ads on third-party properties. The development would certainly bolster Facebook&#8217;s appeal to ad buyers wanting to connect their display units to Facebook&#8217;s expansive people database. It would also make Facebook a more threatening challenger to Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sign photo via Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals, Social&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI (Reuters) - Gulf telecom operator Qtel QTEL.QA has hired J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM.N) to advise it on a potential bid for Vivendi's Maroc Telecom (VIV.PA), said four people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivendi aims to garner at least 5.5 billion euros ($7.14 billion) for its 53 percent stake in Morocco's biggest fixed and mobile operator, and has received initial expressions of interest from four carriers, sources told Reuters in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French conglomerate is exploring selling several assets as part of an ongoing strategy review intended to pay down debt, boost a flagging share price and reduce the group's exposure to capital-intensive telecom businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for J.P. Morgan, Qtel and Vivendi declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maroc Telecom, in which Vivendi first bought a stake in 2001, offers fixed-line, mobile and internet services in the kingdom, and is also one of Africa's main telecom operators with units in Burkina Faso, Gabon, Mali and Mauritania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maroc Telecom, which is Vivendi's second-biggest division, has seen its growth slow in recent years amid tough competition, prompting a recent round of staff reductions that led 800 employees to take redundancy packages by July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other bidders may emerge. France Telecom's CEO FTE.PA, which already owns a minority stake in the kingdom's second-biggest operator Meditel, has said Maroc Telecom would be a "strategically interesting" acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;United Arab Emirates-based Etisalat 7020.SE, Saudi Telecom 7010.SE, and South Africa's MTN (MTNJ.J) have also had spoken to Vivendi's advisers about Maroc Telecom, sources told Reuters in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kingdom of Morocco, which owns a 30 percent stake, would need to approve any sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qtel, majority owned by the Qatar government, has expanded into more than 16 countries in the past decade and spent nearly $4 billion this year to take majority ownership of its Iraqi unit Asiacell and Kuwaiti arm Wataniya NMTC.KW in separate deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the J.P. Morgan mandate, Qtel mandated six banks for a possible benchmark-sized dollar-denominated bond, lead arrangers said on Sunday, a move banking sources say may be to finance a potential bid for Maroc Telecom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is the potential bond issue and banks are also lining up to arrange a bridge financing agreement which may be used to finance the acquisition," said one banking source aware of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source added that Qtel should not have difficulty raising money to finance a bid. "It's a top-tier Qatar name with the backing of the state and a proven ability to do large transactions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For J.P. Morgan, the mandate win is another signal the U.S. lender is making key inroads in the wealthy Gulf state which has traditionally relied heavily on Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) and Barclays (BARC.L) to execute deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is currently an adviser to Qatar National Bank QNBK.QA, the Gulf state's largest lender, in its bid for Societe Generale's SoGN.PA Egyptian arm, a deal seen raising at least $2 billion for the French lender.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations and Stable Rating Outlooks are the result of stable 
      collateral performance since issuance. At issuance the property was 
      91.6% leased and 90% occupied. Per the third quarter 2012 rent roll, the 
      property was 96.7% leased and 91% occupied.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates are collateralized by a five-year fixed rate (5.658%) 
      loan that is amortizing on a 30-year schedule. The current balance of 
      the loan is $370.5 million, reduced from $374.6 million at issuance. The 
      loan matures in November 2016. In addition, there is a $150 million mezz 
      debt held outside the trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loan is secured by 1.94 million square feet (SF) of the 2.26 million 
      SF Palisades Center, a super-regional mall located in West Nyack, NY. 
      The anchors Macy's and Lord  Taylor own their own spaces. The in-line 
      tenancy consists of over 200 diverse mix of retailers and entertainment 
      tenants and the collateral is anchored by JC Penney, Burlington Coat 
      Factory, Dick's Sporting Goods, BJ' Wholesale Club, Target, and Home 
      Depot. As of year-end 2011, sales for in-line tenants at the property 
      remain strong at $537 per square foot (PSF)sf, compared to $529/PSF at 
      issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The property faces minimal near term lease rollover risk. Upcoming lease 
      expirations are scheduled as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;

      As part of its review, Fitch analyzed the performance of the loan and 
      its underlying collateral. Fitch modeled cash flow based on YE2011 OSAR 
      and normalized 2012 rent roll. Credits were given to the executed leases 
      that are not occupied. This is consistent with Fitch's underwriting 
      approach at issuance as all free rent/abatements, and leasing costs had 
      been reserved for up-front. At issuance, the loan had a Free Rent 
      Reserve account with a total balance of $10.1 million. Currently, the 
      account has a remaining balance of $1.07 million and is expected to be 
      depleted by the end of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) increased to 1.48x 
      from 1.40x at issuance (based on trailing 12 month Sept. 30, 2011). The 
      Fitch stressed loan-to-value ratio is 59.7% compared to 63.3% at 
      issuance.

			Samsung Invites Greater Waltham Area Residents and Businesses to 
      Recycle Electronic Waste for Free
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Global electronics leader teams up with Waltham and ERI to help the 
      environment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Samsung will host an E-Waste Collection Event on Saturday, December 8th, 
      from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Veterans Memorial Field Complex, 381 Forest 
      St., Waltham, Mass.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The event provides Waltham area residents and businesses an opportunity 
      to responsibly unload their old computers, TVs, computers, stereo 
      equipment, printers, and virtually any other unusable or unwanted 
      consumer electronics in a safe and environmentally-responsible way at no 
      cost.&#160;Electronic products contain valuable resources such as metal, 
      plastic, and glass which should be recycled instead of thrown away.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It is extremely important to us that we serve as a positive, 
      sustainable example for the rest of our industry,&#8221; said Michael Moss, 
      Director of Corporate Environmental Affairs for Samsung Electronics 
      America.&#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s particularly rewarding to be able to provide 
      opportunities such as these free collection events.&#160;Proper recycling of 
      electronics is the responsible thing to do for our planet. We&#8217;re working 
      to help make it easier to do the right thing.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This event is part of Samsung Recycling Direct (SRD), a recycling 
      program that focuses on protecting people, the environment, and 
      developing countries from the threats posed by improper disposal and 
      management of e-waste.&#160;Samsung earned the distinction of being the first 
      manufacturer to achieve e-Steward Certification. This recognition 
      acknowledges the company&#8217;s dedication to protecting human health and the 
      environment by adhering to the highest standard of environmental 
      responsibility and worker protection in electronic equipment disposal. 
      Since 2008, Samsung Recycling Direct has recycled more than 232 million 
      pounds of electronic waste in the United States to date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The e-waste collected at Saturday&#8217;s event will be recycled by Samsung&#8217;s 
      recycling partner Electronic Recyclers International (ERI), a 
      Holliston-based company that is the largest electronic waste recycler in 
      the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re extremely proud to be partnering with Samsung for this special 
      program,&#8221; said John Shegerian, Chairman and CEO of ERI. &#8220;Samsung is an 
      organization that has long been forward-thinking in terms of 
      environmental concerns. Together, we are helping the people of 
      Massachusetts become more environmentally responsible and offering them 
      a convenient opportunity to safely dispose of their old electronic junk 
      at the same time.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARMIEL, Israel, Dec. 6, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Protalix BioTherapeutics, Inc. (NYSE-MKT:PLX) (TASE:PLX), announced today that it has entered into a Clinical Development Agreement with Pfizer Inc. under which Protalix will continue to manage, administer and sponsor current, ongoing clinical trials relating to ELELYSOTM (taliglucerase alfa). Protalix is currently sponsoring adult and pediatric extension studies of ELELYSO. &#160;New clinical trials for ELELYSO will be conducted and sponsored by Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Under the terms of the agreement, Protalix is eligible to receive a milestone payment of $8.3 million upon the achievement of certain near-term clinical development milestones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	This agreement helps to maintain the continuity of the ongoing clinical trials for Gaucher patients and physicians and reinforces the companies' mutual commitment to the Gaucher community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On November 30, 2009, Pfizer and Protalix entered into an agreement to develop and commercialize taliglucerase alfa, an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of Gaucher disease. &#160;Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer received exclusive worldwide licensing rights for the commercialization of taliglucerase alfa, while Protalix retained the exclusive commercialization rights in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Protalix BioTherapeutics, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Protalix is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of recombinant therapeutic proteins expressed through its proprietary plant cell based expression system, ProCellEx&#174;.&#160;Protalix's unique expression system presents a proprietary method for developing recombinant proteins in a cost-effective, industrial-scale manner.&#160;Protalix's first product manufactured by ProCellEx, Elelyso&#8482; (taliglucerase alfa), was approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May 2012, and by the Israeli Ministry of Health in September 2012.&#160;Protalix is partnered with Pfizer Inc. for worldwide development and commercialization, excluding Israel, where Protalix retains full rights.&#160;Marketing applications for taliglucerase alfa have been filed in additional territories as well.&#160;Protalix's development pipeline also includes the following product candidates: PRX-102, a modified version of the recombinant human alpha-GAL-A protein for the treatment of Fabry disease; PRX-105, a pegylated recombinant human acetylcholinesterase in development for several therapeutic and prophylactic indications, a biodefense program and an organophosphate-based pesticide treatment program; an orally-delivered glucocerebrosidase enzyme that is naturally encased in carrot cells, also for the treatment of Gaucher disease; pr-antiTNF, a similar plant cell version of etanercept (Enbrel&#174;) for the treatment of certain immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis; and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/8gqkt7/emerging) 
      has announced the addition of the "Emerging 
      Opportunities in Mexico's Cards and Payments Industry: Market Size, 
      Trends and Drivers, Strategies, Products and Competitive Landscape" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The debit cards category was the prime driver of growth during the 
      review period recording a CAGR of 13.58% between 2008 and 2012. The 
      highest transaction value during the review period was also reported in 
      the debit cards category, with MXN2.6 trillion (US$213.2 billion) in 
      2012. In the credit card category, the overall transaction value in 2012 
      was only MXN471.1 billion (US$38.0 billion). Domestic service provider 
      Carnet is expected to transform the cards market in Mexico during the 
      forecast period. Carnet is issued by Prosa, the company formed by top 
      Mexican banks: HSBC Mexico, Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, Banco Invex, 
      Grupo Financiero Santander SAB, Grupo Scotiabank and Banjercito. These 
      banks are expected to promote Carnet cards as an alternative to foreign 
      scheme providers such as Visa and Prepaid, which are more costly in 
      terms of processing. The expansion of Prosa's ATM network is expected to 
      facilitate their wider use and issuance within Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key Highlights
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - The debit cards category was the prime driver of growth during the 
      review period recording a CAGR of 13.58% between 2008 and 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Domestic service provider Carnet is expected to transform the cards 
      market in Mexico during the forecast period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - The expansion of Prosa's ATM network is expected to facilitate their 
      wider use and issuance of Carnet cards within Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - The prepaid cards category exhibits the strongest growth prospects 
      over the forecast period. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.09% 
      over the forecast period, driven by government payroll cards, government 
      welfare or benefit cards, prepaid travel and transport cards, and 
      prepaid gift cards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Mexican banks employ low pricing to promote prepaid card products. 
      Most banks charge no annual or card replacement fees, and do not charge 
      for balance inquiries and cash withdrawals at parent-bank ATMs. Fees are 
      typically only charged for overseas use of cards.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 7 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and the UK
government are close to a settlement in which the bank and its
employees could pay about 500 million pounds ($801.03 million)
in back taxes, the Financial Times reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the newspaper, these taxes were avoided through
the use of an offshore trust for bonus payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank, which is in the final phase of shutting down
the trust, has asked more than 2,000 of both its current and
former employees to contribute to this settlement, according to
the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who choose not to participate might have to pay
higher taxes once the trust assets are liquidated, the newspaper
reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the trust said JPMorgan had given them until
Friday to voluntarily pay tax at a rate of their choosing in a
"blind auction" that would be used to establish an average
contribution rate, the Financial Times said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This news comes a day after coffee chain Starbucks 
said it could pay about 20 million pounds in corporation tax in
Britain, surrendering to widespread public criticism over
allegations of tax avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Cha-ching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the sound ringing in the ears of Hollywood studio executives after Walt Disney Co landed a rich deal with Netflix to stream its movies to television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix's arrival as a bidder for the television rights to Hollywood movies means that the studios can now play the company off of traditional pay-TV networks like Time Warner's HBO to extract higher fees in contract renewal talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Netflix couldn't have come along at a better time for the studios, which were being threatened with having their fees slashed by the pay-TV networks who have argued for years that they are better served by investing in original programming than licensing movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix isn't the only company to emerge on the scene, either. The streaming video ambitions of Amazon.com Inc, Google Inc and Apple Inc set the stage for fierce bidding between these technology giants and the pay-TV networks for the rights to bring Hollywood movies into the living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those technology brethren, however, don't have the liquidity concerns that, some analysts say, could affect Netflix's ability to shoulder the costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal's terms, Disney stands to collect an estimated $350 million a year from Netflix for its movies beginning in 2016, according to Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible. Disney only earned around $250 million a year under its previous deal with Starz, the cable network in the process of being spun off from Liberty Media, Wible said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Licensing movies for streaming access, whether online or on TV, is an important part of the business model for Hollywood studios given the migration of viewers to tablets and mobiles devices and the secular decline in DVD sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Netflix signed the Disney deal this year but isn't getting access to its films until 2016 underscores its aggressiveness and the importance it places on usurping streaming rights to Hollywood films from pay-TV networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every other studio is going to want to get in on the action when these kinds of dollars are being offered," said former Universal Studios CEO Frank Biondi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix even has set its sights on Warner Bros, the studio owned by Time Warner. Warner's deal with HBO is up in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This gives Warner the opportunity to do other things, to look at this," Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos told the New York Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a Reuters source with knowledge of the situation, Netflix is talking to Sony, another studio whose films are distributed by Starz, about a deal similar to the One struck with Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Sony and Netflix declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comcast-owned Universal Studios' deal to license some of its movies to HBO expires in 2016, Biondi noted. Universal already licenses some of its movies to Netflix, including this year's surprise hit "The Lorax," to Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs are already emerging of the pressure Netflix can exert. In August, HBO extended its deal with News Corp's 20th Century Fox even though it wasn't due to expire for three years, Wible said. The new deal gives HBO TV rights to 20th Century Fox movies until 2022, a long-term deal Wible said was designed to keep the studio's movies away from Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAY UP OR GET OUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choice pay-TV networks now face is this: pay up for movie rights or invest that money instead in their own original programming. Some have already slashed licensing budgets, believing movies aren't as popular with subscribers as original shows like HBO's "Boardwalk Empire" or Showtime's "Homeland."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showtime, for instance, tried to cut the prices it was paying Paramount, Universal and MGM for movies by half in 2009, prompting those studios to join forces to launch their own network, EPIX, instead of accept a reduced fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We changed our strategy a few years back, spent a lot less on motion pictures and more on original production," said Les Moonves, CEO of Showtime's parent company CBS Corp, at a media conference in New York on December 4. "Out of that came 'Dexter,' came 'Weeds,' came 'Shameless,' came 'Californication' and now came 'Homeland.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starz essentially said in a statement that it let Disney's movies go - rather than have them stolen away by Netflix - to pursue an original programming strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our decision not to extend the agreement for Disney output ... allows us the opportunity to implement our plan to dramatically ramp up our investment in exclusive, premium-quality original series, which will best meet the needs of our distributors and subscribers," Starz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That strategy allows pay-TV networks to not only lure subscribers with high-quality shows, but also syndicate to TV stations domestically and overseas: collecting licensing fees for their own content rather than paying for others'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIQUIDITY CONCERNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Disney deal follows exclusive deals Netflix struck to stream first-run movies from smaller studios like Relativity Media and DreamWorks Animation, the latter deal costing an estimated $30 million for the rights to films like "Shrek" and "Kung Fu Panda," according to Wible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deals Netflix has signed have saddled it with nearly $5 billion in commitments to studios over the next three years, according to its filings, prompting some analysts, such as Wedbush Securities' Michael Pachter, to worry about liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix needs to spend heavily for newer movies and TV shows to grow its base of 25 million U.S. subscribers, Pachter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have Amazon, Google, and Apple breathing down their necks and won't let them pay less," he said. "Netflix has shown this is a business and they have a lot of potential competitors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pachter, however, viewed the Disney deal as a positive sign that the studio is confident Netflix will still be operating in 2016, when the deal starts, since some of the money owed under the Disney contract comes due before then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still in its early years, Netflix continues to tinker with a business model that started by mailing DVDs. Besides paying hefty amounts for new films, Netflix itself has gotten into original programming, producing such shows as "Lilyhammer," which stars former "Sopranos" actor Steven Van Zandt as a former mobster who goes into the witness protection program in Norway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lisa Richwine and Liana Baker; Editing by Nick Zieminski)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is in market with a $1 billion, five-year revolver that will back the company's spinoff of its animal health division, sources told Thomson Reuters LPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan is lead left. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays and Morgan Stanley are to the right of JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer declined to comment. JP Morgan and Barclays declined to comment. BAML and Morgan Stanley did not return calls by press time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing will be based on corporate ratings of the spun-off entity, to be called Zoetis. Ratings are expected to fall in the Baa2/BBB to Baa3/BBB- range, according to sources. If Zoetis obtains ratings of Baa2/BBB it will pay 15bp if the facility remains undrawn. The company will pay LIB+125 if it draws down amounts under the revolver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if the new company obtains ratings of Baa3/BBB- it will pay 20bp if the facility remains undrawn. The company will pay LIB+150 on amounts drawn under the revolver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the company's ratings were to change beyond those categories the company would pay a range between 12.5bp to 32.5bp if the facility remains undrawn and a drawn spread that would range from LIB+112.5 to LIB+225.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer filed a registration in August for the initial public offering of a minority stake in the new animal health company. The giant drug concern announced its spinoff plans in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley IPO is expected to take place next year. The spinoff is part of an ongoing makeover by Pfizer to divest non-pharmaceutical businesses and boost shareholder returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company agreed in April to sell its baby formula business to Nestle SA for $11.85 billion. In the third quarter of 2011, Pfizer sold its capsule-making business Capsugel to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for $2.38 billion in cash. - MS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing By Jon Methven)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 7 - On Dec. 4, 2012, Netflix Inc. (rated 'BB-' with a stable
rating outlook) and The Walt Disney Co. (A/Stable/A-1) announced a
licensing agreement that will make Netflix the exclusive U.S. subscription
television service for first-run live-action and animated feature films from The
Walt Disney Studios, starting with films released in 2016. We believe this is a
groundbreaking agreement, as it is the first such arrangement between an online
subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) operator (Netflix) and one of the major U.S.
studios. (Netflix already has first-run distribution agreements with a number of
independent studios, including DreamWorks Animation SKG.) It is also a
significant loss to Liberty Media, owner of the Starz LLC
(BB/Stable/--) premium movie service and the current U.S. pay TV distributor of
Disney films through 2015, because of the high profile of Disney (including
Pixar and Marvel) films.

The Netflix/Disney deal has no immediate impact on the credit quality of the 
participants, .given the three-year lead time before this agreement starts and 
the contractual delay between theatrical release and pay television 
availability (nine-plus months after theatrical release). Over the long term, 
however, our credit ratings on certain of the participants, as well as other 
entertainment companies, could be affected.

THE WALT DISNEY CO.
We believe that the Netflix transaction could be a minor credit positive for 
Disney, but is unlikely to move the rating. Based on press reports, Netflix 
will be paying Disney significantly more than what Starz is currently 
paying--and more than what Starz was offering to renew the contract. In 
addition, there could be some minor upside to our 2013 revenue estimates for 
Disney, as some of the company's direct-to-home videos will be made available 
on Netflix beginning in 2013. Lastly, in a separate agreement, Disney is also 
making available immediately selected titles from its library. Despite these 
positives, it is highly unlikely that we'll raise our rating on Disney, as we 
expect the company to use the incremental cash flow for acquisitions, share 
repurchases, or dividend increases.

NETFLIX INC.
In our view, the cost of the licensing agreement with Disney could cause some 
intermediate-term earnings pressure for Netflix, though we think it is a 
longer-term business positive for the company. The Disney deal will give 
Netflix access to very attractive family-oriented content, especially animated 
Disney and Pixar films. This will likely aid Netflix's efforts to acquire new 
subscribers (especially as we get closer to the launch of the Disney contract 
in 2016), and could lay the groundwork for Netflix expanding its service 
offerings beyond its traditional streaming service.. We think this will be 
increasingly important as 2016 approaches, because the majority of the Disney 
agreement cost will begin to accrue and become payable in 2016. In the shortr 
term, the agreement places added pressure on Netflix to accelerate subscriber 
acquisition or possibly increase prices in order to preserve its EBITDA margin 
and cash flow. Netflix will need to significantly expand its subscriber base 
over the next three to four years in order to afford this and other potential 
content contract renewals.

STARZ LLC
The Disney/Netflix deal is a credit negative for Starz over the longer term, 
in our opinion. The agreement will deprive Starz of a significant portion of 
its live action and family movie content beginning in 2016, and could reduce 
its negotiation leverage in carriage agreement renewals with cable operators. 
Several cable operators have aggressively communicated their focus on reducing 
subscriber fees to cable networks. We believe that the agreement between 
Disney and Netflix also could push Starz to further increase its investment in 
original programming. The success or failure of its original programming 
efforts will take on greater importance in the absence of Disney content being 
available in 2016. 

OTHER PREMIUM TV NETWORKS
We believe the agreement could have a long term negative impact on the three 
other premium television channels (HBO, owned by Time Warner Inc. 
(BBB/Stable/A-2); Showtime, owned by CBS Corp. (BBB/Stable/A-2); and Epix, a 
joint venture between Viacom Inc. (BBB+/Stable/A-2), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. 
(B/Stable/--) and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (B/Positive/--)), as it could 
lead to more aggressive competition from a stronger Netflix, a weakened Starz, 
and additional SVOD players, such as Amazon and Apple, which would want to 
keep up with Netflix.

In our opinion, the deal with Disney elevates Netflix to the same competitive 
position as the premium television channels. Historically, Netflix focused on 
television shows and older film libraries, but this contract, along with its 
recent contract with DreamWorks, will give Netflix access to a film slate that 
rivals those of the other channels. The upside potential is that Netflix may 
be able to increase subscriber fees, eventually putting the company on 
stronger financial footing and enabling it to use its improved financial 
flexibility to pursue other studio distribution deals as they come up for 
renewal. The downside scenario could be one of insufficient subscriber growth 
amid increased competition, leading to pressure on credit measures.

Starz, on the other hand, would be left with only its existing Sony 
distribution agreement and would need to aggressively pursue other studio 
deals and possibly increase its original programming efforts to remain 
competitive. Even if neither Netflix nor Starz were to land those contracts, 
they could certainly push up pricing for the eventual winners.

In addition to Sony's agreement with Starz (which expires in 2016), the other 
significant agreements are 20th Century Fox with HBO (recently renewed through 
2022), Warner Brothers with HBO (expires in 2014), Paramount with Epix, and 
NBC Universal with HBO (expires at the end of 2015). Both HBO and Showtime 
have increased their strategic emphasis on original programming content, with 
significant success, which could provide downside protection against the loss 
of a studio distribution agreement.

OTHER FILM STUDIOS
We believe the Netflix/Disney agreement could be a positive for all the film 
studios if competitive bidding does materialize from SVOD competitors, leading 
to higher pricing for the studios.

&lt;p&gt;* In final stages of negotiating deals with two partners-CEO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Not concerned about Repsol lawsuit against Chevron-YPF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Argentine government's gas price rise will help company&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Plans to tap bond market for up to $500 mln next year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Sarah Young&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Argentine energy firm YPF
 is close to inking two partnership deals, putting it
on the right t r ack to meet its investment goals and bring huge
shale gas resources onstream months after it was nationalised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YPF chief executive Miguel Galuccio said on Friday he
expected the company to finalise a deal with U.S. oil major
Chevron and one with Argentine company Bridas Holding
before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are progressing with two companies. One is Chevron and
the other is Bridas. We are now in the final stages of the
commercial discussions," Galuccio told an investment seminar in
London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YPF says it needs to invest over $30 billion in the next
five years, $4.5 billion of which is to come from strategic
partners, to help pay to develop Argentina's huge shale oil and
gas resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finalising one of the deals would be the first major
investment in YPF since Argentina's left-leaning government
seized a majority stake in the company from Spanish oil firm
Repsol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signing of commercial terms between YPF and Chevron, which
Galuccio said would be agreed before the end of the year, would
build on an accord the two signed in September and against which
Repsol has filed a U.S. lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galuccio said he was "very confident" that the legal threats
to YPF's deal with Chevron would not impact it, adding that it
was not something he was concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The issue between Repsol and the Argentinean national
government has nothing to do with YPF," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no claim that Repsol can do to freeze or stop the
development of the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LURE OF SHALE GAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership deals with both Bridas and Chevron will
focus on YPF's extensive shale gas and oil resources, which
include the mammoth Vaca Muerta ("Dead Cow") formation in
southern Argentina, thought to hold an estimated 23 billion
barrels of oil equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galuccio did not specify how big the deals with the two new
partners would be, but estimated the area on which Bridas was
looking to partner would cost an initial $2 billion to develop,
with the full development of the block costing $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a farm-in type of agreement where they (the partner)
will carry YPF for a few years," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So-called "farm-in" deals enable a company to take a share
of an oil or gas block in return for funding a portion of the
exploration and development costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bridas Holding's owner Carlos Bulgheroni, a South American
oil mogul, told Reuters on Thursday that his company was
considering making a substantial investment in YPF. Asked if the
investment would be in the range of $500 million, he said, "much
more".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bridas Corp., half owned by Bridas Holding and half by
China's CNOOC, holds 40 percent of Argentina's Pan
American Energy. The remaining 60 percent is held by BP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YPF's $30 billion plus investment costs for the next five
years will be helped by a rise in wellhead gas prices recently
announced by the Argentine government to attract foreign
investment into shale gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will help the bottom line," Galuccio said, calling the
new gas price of $7.50 per million British Thermal Units "very
competitive", and adding that it would help bring about a "step
change" in investment in gas in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will also seek funding from the international
bond market, Galuccio said, announcing plans to tap the market
for up to $500 million in the first or second quarter next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 7 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc is in market
with a $1 billion, five-year revolver that will back the
company's spinoff of its animal health division, sources told
Thomson Reuters LPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan is lead left. Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
Barclays and Morgan Stanley are to the right of JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer declined to comment. JP Morgan and Barclays declined
to comment. BAML and Morgan Stanley did not return calls by
press time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing will be based on corporate ratings of the spun-off
entity, to be called Zoetis. Ratings are expected to fall in the
Baa2/BBB to Baa3/BBB- range, according to sources. If Zoetis
obtains ratings of Baa2/BBB it will pay 15bp if the facility
remains undrawn. The company will pay LIB+125 if it draws down
amounts under the revolver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if the new company obtains ratings of Baa3/BBB- it
will pay 20bp if the facility remains undrawn. The company will
pay LIB+150 on amounts drawn under the revolver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the company's ratings were to change beyond those
categories the company would pay a range between 12.5bp to
32.5bp if the facility remains undrawn and a drawn spread that
would range from LIB+112.5 to LIB+225.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer filed a registration in August for the initial public
offering of a minority stake in the new animal health company.
The giant drug concern announced its spinoff plans in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan
Stanley IPO is expected to take place next year. The spinoff is
part of an ongoing makeover by Pfizer to divest
non-pharmaceutical businesses and boost shareholder returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company agreed in April to sell its baby formula
business to Nestle SA for $11.85 billion. In the third quarter
of 2011, Pfizer sold its capsule-making business Capsugel to
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for $2.38 billion in cash. - MS&lt;/p&gt;

Zacks' analyst wrote, "We are maintaining our Neutral recommendation on JetBlue Airways based on impressive third quarter results, initiatives to expand operations, cost-saving steps and beneficial partnerships. For the July-September period, the company surpassed our projections for both earnings and revenue, owing to better operational efficiency. Looking ahead, we expect JetBlue to benefit from its low-cost structure and improving travel demand. Other major positives for the company include ancillary revenue growth opportunities and a robust liquidity profile. However, with these aspects already well reflected in the stock price, we do not see any near-term strong driving catalyst for the company. "&lt;/p&gt;

Zacks' analyst wrote, "j2 Global reported impressive third-quarter 2012 results with both the top and bottom lines beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates. Record low churn, strong revenue and EBITDA growth along with solid cash position and long-term growth prospects of value-added outsourced messaging services, will drive j2 Global's earnings higher in the near future. Moreover, exploration of new opportunities for both digital facsimile and voice services, through new acquisitions will further act as tailwinds for the company going forward. However, weaker economic growth has thereby resulted in future tech spending slowdown by business enterprises, which can impact the company's growth. Currently, the company's stock is trading near 52-week high. Accordingly, we maintain our long-term Neutral recommendation on j2 Global."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, Dec. 7, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Santo Mining Corporation (OTCBB:SANP),(the "Company"), is pleased to announce that Santo Mining has received the Acme Laboratories Certified Analysis (the "Analysis") on 193 soil samples collected in November of this year. This Analysis &#160;identifies the presence of several gold and silver anomalies on the 100% owned WALTER exploration concession application located one mile east of Perilya Cerro de Maimon Mine (VMS) and west of Barrick's Pueblo Viejo's world class mine to the east.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On November 14, 2012, 193 geochemical soil, rock and sediment samples were delivered to Acme Laboratories for multi-element analysis including gold, silver and copper. The samples were systematically collected by the Santo Mining exploration team based on a 100 meter grid pattern over the entire area at a consistent depth of 70 centimeters using a combination of a small gas-powered auger to bore a hole and followed by a hand auger to retrieve a sterile sample. According to a previously Santo Mining press release by a qualified geological consultant "This concession has considerable potential of finding Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide (VMS) deposits similar to Perilya Gold's nearby Cerro de Maimon, Loma Pesada, Loma La Mina, etc."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Preliminary interpretation of all first-pass, multi-element soil geochemical assay results by staff geologist Elpidio Moronta has identified four high priority and fourteen lower priority prospective areas for gold mineralization. To compensate for the loss or dispersion of key metals of economic interest, including gold, silver and copper, Santo Mining has adopted a multi-element approach where key "pathfinder" elements were identified to highlight surface and near-surface soil geochemical anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	These gold anomalies have generally been supported by corresponding silver, arsenic, barium, copper, mercury, nickel and lead pathfinder metallic elements. The pathfinder elements are often associated with gold deposits and generally more soluble and transportable and their detection can lead geologists to gold mineralization. These pathfinder elements are relatively stable in the near-surface weathered environment. However, during the final analysis of the geochemical results, particular emphasis will be given to lead and the heavier pathfinder elements which can provide more reliable identification of drill targets in transported alluvium mediums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Surface Soil Geochemical sample assays from the east portion of Walter revealed anomalous gold with assays up to 50 ppb which is more than 15 times the estimated regional background for gold of 3.0 ppb. The Acme analysis includes the following anomalies by element: Au (gold) 4 separate anomalies of 50.0, 26.9, 17.5 and 17.3 ppb; Ag (silver) with several between 45-182 ppb; and Zn (zinc) 50-558 ppm or parts per million. The strength of these silver, arsenic, barium, mercury and lead anomalisms may point to the existence of mineralization in the Maimon schist bedrock (bimodal metavolcanics formation) that reportedly lies below the 10m deep quaternary alluvial sediments. For the novice this approach to surface soil geochemical surveying only measures trace elements of gold and silver in ppb or parts per billion which have leached into overlying soils and does not represent the grade of potential buried ore bodies which are measured in ppm (parts per million) or its equivalent g/t (grams per metric ton).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It is significant to note that Barrick Gold's Pueblo Viejo property, with reported 25 million ounce gold reserve, is 1 mile to the east, and Perilya's Cerro de&#160;Maimon gold mine property is 1 mile southwest of Walter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Al French, the CEO of Santo Mining, stated "Now that we have successfully completed exploration Phase II we are optimistic that we are on track to define multiple shallow drill targets for gold. During the next two weeks we will focus on collecting close-spaced follow-up surface soil geochemical samples surrounding the four gold anomalies. Meanwhile the Acme assay reports have been forwarded to qualified geologists for a detailed technical review, interpretation, and preparation of anomaly charts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WARSAW Dec 7 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil 
agreed to sell two shale gas exploration concessions in Poland
to the country's top refiner PKN Orlen for an
undisclosed price, the groups said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon dropped its exploration plans in June after test wells
failed to produce commercial quantities of gas, dealing a blow
to Poland's hopes of becoming a major producer of the
non-conventional gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The local shale gas industry was eager to know what would
happen with the U.S. group's six concessions. It has to date
relinquished three and, after the completion of the deal with
PKN, will still have to decide on the fate of one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, subject to approval from the environment ministry
which handles exploration permits in Poland, marks PKN's growing
leverage in developing resources that could help Poland cut its
dependence on Russian supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will increase the number of PKN's shale gas exploration
licences to 10. The group plans to allocate up to 5.1 billion
zlotys ($1.6 billion) on exploration projects, mainly shale gas,
in the years 2013-2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PKN and another state-controlled group PGNiG stand
at the forefront of Poland's shale gas drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central and Eastern Europe's largest economy relies on
Russia's Gazprom for more than half the gas it
consumes. Warsaw wants commercial production of shale gas to
start as soon as possible so it can limit this dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poland had high hopes for shale gas after a U.S. study from
2011 estimated Polish reserves at 5.3 trillion cubic metres,
enough to cover domestic demand for some 300 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But estimated reserves were slashed to about a tenth of that
in a government report published in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - ExxonMobil (XOM.N) agreed to spend $300 million on advanced horizontal drilling and fracking at Russian state oil company Rosneft's (ROSN.MM) Siberian fields in a project designed to help Russia realize its vast tight oil potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies will form a joint venture, split 51-49 between Rosneft and Exxon, to carry out the pilot program and launch commercial production if they find sufficient oil in the Bazhenov shale and the nearby Achimov formations of Western Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bazhenov is the world's largest source rock. However, Russia, still rich in conventional reserves, has yet to follow in the footsteps of the United States in deploying advanced horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies, which is known as fracking, on a commercial scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the core fields of Western Siberia in decline, however, the government of Russia, the world's largest crude producer, has offered tax breaks for companies who drill into "tight" formations where hydrocarbons are trapped in non-porous rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several oil companies are drilling the Bazhenov on a limited scale to test the economics of these more expensive production techniques in Western Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Melissa Akin; Editing by Alison Birrane)&lt;/p&gt;

$300 million on advanced horizontal drilling and fracking at
Russian state oil company Rosneft's Siberian fields in
a project designed to help Russia realise its vast tight oil
potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies will form a joint venture, split 51-49
between Rosneft and Exxon, to carry out the pilot programme and
launch commercial production if they find sufficient oil in the
Bazhenov shale and the nearby Achimov formations of Western
Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bazhenov is the world's largest source rock. However,
Russia, still rich in conventional reserves, has yet to follow
in the footsteps of the United States in deploying advanced
horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies, which
is known as fracking, on a commercial scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the core fields of Western Siberia in decline, however,
the government of Russia, the world's largest crude producer,
has offered tax breaks for companies who drill into "tight"
formations where hydrocarbons are trapped in non-porous rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several oil companies are drilling the Bazhenov on a limited
scale to test the economics of these more expensive production
techniques in Western Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - Walt Disney World marked the grand opening on Thursday of a new Fantasyland at its Magic Kingdom park in Orlando, Florida, where patrons won't have to wait very long to see exhibits and alcoholic beverages will be offered for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney World said the opening capped the largest expansion in the park's 41-year history, doubling the size of Fantasyland and offering two new rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fantasyland is the most popular land in the most popular theme park in the world," Disney spokeswoman Kim Prunty said. "It makes perfect sense that this is where we would look to expand the guest experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney declined to reveal the cost of the expansion, widely reported to be about $425 million, and company officials would not provide specifics on projected increased patronage and revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beer and wine will be available with dinner inside the park's new Be Our Guest restaurant. It is the first time alcohol is being served at the Magic Kingdom, but unlike other parks at Disney World, hard liquor will not be sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Fantasyland, which expanded from 10 acres to 21, takes over space previously devoted to "Mickey's ToonTown Fair," which closed in 2011 to make way for the expansion, and the "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" attraction which lasted from 1971 to 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fantasyland also incorporates an unspecified amount of previously unused space, but Prunty said she was unable to specify how much land had actually been added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new rides that feature Disney cartoon characters include one called the "Under the Sea-Journey of the Little Mermaid" and another dubbed "The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train," which remains under construction with an opening expected in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A duplicate "Dumbo, the Flying Elephant" ride was added to reduce previously long wait times at the iconic attraction popular with families with young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line for Dumbo now includes a playroom for children aged 2-12 where they can burn off energy while awaiting their turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more relaxing than keeping the kids standing in line and trying to keep them entertained," said Tim Dixon, 41, of Racine, Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other visitors, he held a pager that would signal his family when it was time for them to board the Dumbo ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The queue for the Little Mermaid ride snakes through a decorated indoor space shielded from the hot Florida sun and ends in an efficient constantly moving, conveyor belt-style boarding system.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A new blood clot preventer from Pfizer Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co reduced the risk of recurrence of clots in veins and lungs and death by 80 percent with no increase in major bleeding in a study testing extended use of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year-long trial of 2,486 patients who had been previously treated for the condition known as venous thromboembolism (VTE) the drug, apixaban, met the combined primary goal by significantly reducing the recurrence of blood clots and death from any cause compared with a placebo, according to data presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of recurrence or death was 11.6 percent in the placebo group compared with 3.8 percent for those who got 2.5 milligrams of apixaban and 4.2 percent for the 5 mg dose of the drug. The results were also published in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incidence of major bleeding, always a concern with blood thinners, was extremely low in all three arms of the trial, researchers said - 0.5 percent for placebo, 0.2 percent for the low dose of apixaban and 0.1 percent for the higher dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Usually when you have an effective antithrombotic you have to pay a price in terms of bleeding. This was not the case in this study," Dr. Giancarlo Agnelli, the study's principal investigator, said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no evidence at all of increased major bleeding and this is extremely important because you are comparing an active drug with placebo," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a slightly higher rate of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, such as nose bleeds that required medical attention, observed in patients taking the higher dose of apixaban at 4.2 percent compared with the low dose and placebo, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apixaban belongs to a new class of blood thinners that aim to replace decades old and difficult to use warfarin. The drug, which will be sold under the brand name Eliquis, is widely considered to be one of the most important new medicines for Pfizer and Bristol-Myers, both of which saw their top selling products lose patent protection in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWAITING U.S. APPROVAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is approved in Europe and awaiting a U.S. approval decision for preventing blood clots and strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation - a type of irregular heart beat - and is also being tested against warfarin as a primary treatment for VTE with data expected next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rival drug from Bayer and Johnson &amp; Johnson called Xarelto is already approved for both conditions, but based on clinical data analysts have said they believe Eliquis is the best class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An approval for extended use in VTE patients, during which they would take the drug for at least a year after initial treatment, could significantly boost future sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The evidence is for one year. The next step would be to see whether this clinical benefit is extended after one year," Agnelli said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VTE consists of deep vein thrombosis, typically blood clots in the legs, and pulmonary embolism, which are dangerous clots in the lungs. Clots that begin in the extremities can travel to the heart and lungs and can be fatal. VTE is typically treated with warfarin for three to six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, "there is quite a remarkable level of uncertainty about whether to extend or not," explained Agnelli, professor of internal medicine at the University of Perugia in Italy, who presented the data at the ASH meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Extended treatment might be clinically relevant because the recurrence rate after stopping treatment can be 10 percent in the first year," Agnelli said. "Reducing the recurrence of VTE means reduced hospitalization costs and in some cases fewer fatal events."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicians have been looking for alternatives to warfarin, which must be closely monitored to keep levels therapeutic but not toxic. The new drugs do not require monitoring or the dietary and lifestyle changes necessary with warfarin. But they still face an uphill battle as warfarin is far less expensive, and doctors have a comfort level using a drug that has been around for more than half a century despite the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients in the study had received treatment with warfarin for six to 12 months before starting the one-year extension trial that aimed to show further treatment could reduce recurrence rates and to see if the lower dose of apixaban was a viable option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is quite clear that the lower dose is as effective as the higher. For the first time we showed that by reducing the dose of an antithrombotic agent in this clinical setting we can have the same efficacy with no major bleeding," Agnelli said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is actually something that could change clinical practice," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Jilian Mincer, Berard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - As the prosperous, coastal Indian state of Gujarat goes to the polls this week, few doubt Narendra Modi will win a fourth successive term as its chief minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is not clear is whether the popular, but divisive 62-year-old will win a big enough mandate to secure the backing of his party to lead the charge against Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's coalition in a general election due by 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many believe that only Modi can reinvigorate the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has failed to capitalize on the troubles of a government hit by a sharp economic downturn to a string of corruption scandals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surely, they argue, voters across the country will elect a leader who has ably brought Gujarat its uninterrupted power supplies, smooth roads and flood of investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, however, if Modi is catapulted by this week's state election into poll position as the BJP's leader for 2014, it could ultimately scupper his party's chances of winning back power for the first time since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics speak of him as an authoritarian and vindictive leader. Worse, the toxic memory of religious riots that tore through his state a decade ago leaves suspicions that Modi remains a Hindu hardliner who will alienate more voters than his leadership and oratory skills could hope to gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's capable of wrecking the BJP's hopes at the national level," said James Manor, professor of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London. "He doesn't excite large numbers of voters outside Gujarat. He frightens many more than he excites."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such an outcome may create more political risk in a country that has fallen out of favor with investors over the past two years thanks to policy drift and incompetence in New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A weakened BJP incapable of taking on Singh's Congress party will probably lead to a highly fractured vote in the 2014 general election. That, in turn, will yield a coalition government packed with powerful regional parties that could thwart the reforms that businesses are clamouring for to revive economic growth, on track for its worst year in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POWERING UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gujarat will vote in a staggered election on December 13 and December 17. A narrow victory for Modi, or a shock defeat, would probably scupper his chances of leading the BJP into 2014. But he is unlikely to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A poll published by India Today magazine in November showed the BJP was set to increase its share of the state legislature's 182 seats to 128 from the 117 it won five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poll also ranked Modi as a more popular leader than Rahul Gandhi, scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has ruled India for most of its post-independence era and the Congress party's presumed candidate to succeed Manmohan Singh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi's rise could also revive the BJP. The party is adrift, its leadership plagued by internal squabbles and its Hindu-revivalist ideology lacking the appeal it had in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi's record in Gujarat - strong governance, job creation and promises of more affordable housing and healthcare - strike a chord with middle-class voters who form the BJP's traditional support base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think he's a great asset," said Swapan Dasgupta, a political analyst with links to the BJP. "The projection of him will energize the BJP to a very, very large extent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dasgupta said other party leaders' wariness of Modi would wither away if he won convincingly in Gujarat, and he would likely emerge as the "de facto leader" of the BJP for 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIABILITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Modi's ascent could prove a double-edged sword for the BJP. Many Indians have not forgiven Modi for the violence that killed between 1,000-2,000 people, mainly Muslims, in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics accuse him of not doing enough to stem the riots, or even of quietly encouraging them - allegations he has strenuously denied and which have never been proved in inquiries - and he is still viewed with suspicion outside India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain renewed diplomatic ties with Modi in October but other nations, including the United States, have still not. Washington denied him a travel visa in 2005 for religious intolerance. In November, a group of U.S. lawmakers urged Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to continue this policy, citing the possibility of Modi running for higher office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the riots, Modi has benefited from an image makeover, toning down his speeches and holding fasts to promote religious harmony. He has more than a million Twitter followers, has held a web cam chat with voters and regularly hosts Bollywood stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say that it is the same Modi underneath, too mistrusted to muster the nationwide support that the BJP's last prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was able to command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The 2002 massacre will haunt him for as long as he lives," said political analyst Paranjoy Guha Thakurta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still vilified by many non-Hindus, having Modi as its prime ministerial candidate could throttle the BJP's efforts to recapture lost ground in northern states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which have substantial Muslim populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse, the BJP could lose key allies it needs to form a national government. Nitish Kumar, the powerful leader of Bihar, would probably shun a BJP-led coalition with Modi at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most likely outcome for the 2014 election would be a three-way split between Congress, the BJP, and regional parties, according to Anjalika Bardalai, an analyst at the Eurasia Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In such a scenario, the BJP's ability to form alliances with other parties would be a crucial determinant of its ability to govern," said Bardalai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And this is an important area where Modi might well end up being a liability for the party, because his divisiveness might rule out or - at the very least - compromise the possibility of alliances with some of the major regional parties whose support the BJP would seek."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Congress party, which now runs a minority government, relies on such regional parties to push policies in the teeth of fierce opposition, as it did last week when seeking parliament's approval for controversial retail sector reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the BJP in a "horrendous mess" and Congress also likely to lose seats, the 2014 elections could see the rise of a "third force clinging on to power tenuously", according to James Manor of the University of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That government will probably not last more than a couple of years and then we'll have another parliamentary election."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Annie Banerji; Editing by John Chalmers and Neil Fullick)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Dinesh Nair&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUBAI Dec 6 (Reuters) - Gulf telecom operator Qtel
 has hired J.P. Morgan Chase to advise it on a
potential bid for Vivendi's Maroc Telecom, said four
people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivendi aims to garner at least 5.5 billion euros ($7.14
billion) for its 53 percent stake in Morocco's biggest fixed and
mobile operator, and has received initial expressions of
interest from four carriers, sources told Reuters in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French conglomerate is exploring selling several assets
as part of an ongoing strategy review intended to pay down debt,
boost a flagging share price and reduce the group's exposure to
capital-intensive telecom businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for J.P. Morgan, Qtel and Vivendi declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maroc Telecom, in which Vivendi first bought a stake in
2001, offers fixed-line, mobile and internet services in the
kingdom, and is also one of Africa's main telecom operators with
units in Burkina Faso, Gabon, Mali and Mauritania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maroc Telecom, which is Vivendi's second-biggest division,
has seen its growth slow in recent years amid tough competition,
prompting a recent round of staff reductions that led 800
employees to take redundancy packages by July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other bidders may emerge. France Telecom's CEO,
which already owns a minority stake in the kingdom's
second-biggest operator Meditel, has said Maroc Telecom would be
a "strategically interesting" acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;United Arab Emirates-based Etisalat, Saudi Telecom
, and South Africa's MTN have also had spoken
to Vivendi's advisers about Maroc Telecom, sources told Reuters
in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kingdom of Morocco, which owns a 30 percent stake, would
need to approve any sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qtel, majority owned by the Qatar government, has expanded
into more than 16 countries in the past decade and spent nearly
$4 billion this year to take majority ownership of its Iraqi
unit Asiacell and Kuwaiti arm Wataniya in separate
deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the J.P. Morgan mandate, Qtel mandated six
banks for a possible benchmark-sized dollar-denominated bond,
lead arrangers said on Sunday, a move banking sources say may be
to finance a potential bid for Maroc Telecom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is the potential bond issue and banks are also lining
up to arrange a bridge financing agreement which may be used to
finance the acquisition," said one banking source aware of the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source added that Qtel should not have difficulty
raising money to finance a bid. "It's a top-tier Qatar name with
the backing of the state and a proven ability to do large
transactions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For J.P. Morgan, the mandate win is another signal the U.S.
lender is making key inroads in the wealthy Gulf state which has
traditionally relied heavily on Credit Suisse and
Barclays to execute deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is currently an adviser to Qatar National Bank
, the Gulf state's largest lender, in its bid for
Societe Generale's Egyptian arm, a deal seen raising
at least $2 billion for the French lender.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs bankers failed to raise red flags about Lernout &amp; Hauspie's accounting irregularities more than a decade ago, costing speech recognition software pioneers at Dragon Systems nearly all of their life's work and about $600 million, a lawyer told a jury on Monday in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Speech recognition pioneers accuse bank of shoddy work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dragon lawyer: Goldman bankers had concerns about Lernout

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects to change regularities to irregularities in the lead)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Goldman on trial for its advice to Dragon Systems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Speech recognition pioneers accuse bank of shoddy work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Opening arguments at Boston trial expected Monday
afternoon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Tim McLaughlin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Monday
ordered Goldman Sachs Group Inc to take down statements
from its website related to its representation of Dragon Systems
in a 2000 sale that blew up when acquirer Lernout &amp; Hauspie went
bankrupt after accounting irregularities emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A two-month jury trial in the civil case is expected to
begin Monday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Boston. Lawyers
for Dragon's founders are expected to accuse the iconic Wall
Street bank of negligent misrepresentation and malpractice in
their opening arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Patti Saris began Monday's proceedings
by chastising attorney Alan Cotler for talking to a Boston Globe
reporter on the eve of the trial. Cotler is representing Janet
and James Baker, speech recognition pioneers who agreed to sell
Dragon to Lernout &amp; Hauspie in the $580 million all-stock deal
that ultimately fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You cannot talk to the press," Saris told Cotler, who made
an apology to the court. "I don't know why you did."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge also expressed concern that Goldman Sachs' public
relations team had been making comments to the press on deep
background. "That seems to be the case," the judge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Saris ordered Goldman Sachs attorneys to take
down the bank's response on its website to a July 15 New York
Times story about the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now, there's a complete block on talking about the
case," Saris told several lawyers assembled in her courtroom in
U.S. District Court in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1999, Dragon Systems hired Goldman as its financial
adviser. The company was struggling and a potential acquirer
opted not to pursue a deal, according to Goldman's defense in
the case. The bank says the claims brought by the Bakers are
without merit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belgium-based Lernout &amp; Hauspie later offered to buy the
suburban Boston company for cash and stock. But without seeking
Goldman's advice or consulting with her board, Janet Baker, a
founder of the company, agreed instead to an all-stock deal,
according to Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman says it recommended to Dragon that it hire
professionals to do an extensive review of Lernout &amp; Hauspie's
accounting procedures. Dragon chose not to do that, Goldman
says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2001, U.S. Marshals arrested Gaston Bastiaens, a key
figure at L, at his home in suburban Boston. He was picked up
on a Belgian warrant that accused him of fraud, insider trading,
stock market manipulation and accounting law violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bastiaens was CEO of Lernout &amp; Hauspie when the 2000 fraud
allegations sent the company's stock into a tailspin, erasing
nearly $10 billion in shareholder value while forcing the
company into bankruptcy protection.

&lt;p&gt;* Workers demand Brazil escape in case of spills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* "Excessive" prosecutions limit oil hiring -De Luca&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Chevron case latest drag on slowing Brazil oil sector&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Walter Brandimarte and Rodrigo Viga Gaier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Oil companies are having
trouble hiring foreign workers crucial to Brazil's booming
offshore oil industry because of criminal and civil cases
against Chevron Corp and Transocean Ltd 
employees, the head of an industry association said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some prospective workers needed to operate high-tech drill
rigs and other offshore oil equipment want guarantees of a swift
exit from Brazil in case of an offshore spill, Jo&#227;o Carlos de
Luca, president of the Brazilian Petroleum Institute, said at a
Rio de Janeiro conference on the country's investment risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some companies had to make amendments to work contracts,
offering helicopters and open plane tickets so their workers can
leave the country immediately if there is an accident," De Luca
said. "With the absence of rights auctions and the repercussions
from the Frade spill, it was a very bad year for the Brazil oil
business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chevron-Transocean criminal and civil lawsuits from the
November 2011 Frade oil spill are one of the latest problems for
the once-galloping industry. It also faces changes in the law, a
lack of new lease auctions, royalty disputes and the inability
of companies to comply with government mandates to use local
goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shortage of skilled labor also means Brazil needs
specialized foreign workers for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to seek nearly $20 billion in civil damages
from Chevron and Transocean and then press criminal charges
against 17 Chevron and Transocean employees sent fear through
Brazil's growing community of foreign oil workers earlier this
year. The criminal charges against the two companies could carry
jail terms of up to 31 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers fear their passports, like those of the
Chevron-Transocean 17, could be seized, forcing them to remain
in the country, perhaps for years, captive to Brazil's
notoriously slow justice system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the "excessive" legal prosecutions, De Luca said
workers' concerns are understandable, but may be overblown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many of the worried workers are highly sophisticated
technicians, he added, they may not fully understand how Brazil
works. Some of them "are not culturally sophisticated," De Luca
told the audience at the conference at Rio de Janeiro's
Federation of Industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courts have allowed many of the Chevron-Transocean 17 to
travel to visit family, take vacations or even accept new jobs,
as long as a 500,000 real ($240,000) bond is posted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, some oil drill rig operators even considered
not bringing any more rigs to Brazil, he said, but these
employers and their largely foreign crews are now less worried
about working in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think things are accommodating and returning to normal,"
De Luca said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De Luca did not name companies facing difficulties hiring
workers, though the bulk of Brazil's deepwater offshore drilling
rigs are owned and operated by foreign companies such as
Transocean and Ocean Rig UDW Inc. Such companies,
which also do the bulk of offshore drilling worldwide, work on
contract to operators such as state-led Petrobras and
Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3,600-barrel Frade spill was far less severe than other
recent offshore accidents. More than 5 million barrels of oil
were spilled in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in BP Plc's 
 Macondo field in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven people died 
in the Macondo accident, and beaches and fishing grounds were
polluted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 15, BP agreed to pay a record $4.5 billion in
penalties and plead guilty to criminal misconduct for the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No workers were hurt in the Frade spill, and oil never came
near shore. Brazil's oil regulator, the ANP, said there was no
discernible environmental damage from the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frade is operated by Chevron, which has a 52 percent stake. 
Petrobras owns 30 percent, and Frade Jap&#227;o, a joint
venture between Japan's Sojitz Corp and Inpex Corp
 trading houses, holds 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/vbv9f8/google_vs) 
      has announced the addition of the "Google 
      vs. Microsoft in Social Search" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A "social search" is that puts search queries into a social context. 
      With social search, each searcher sees unique results that are shaped by 
      the characteristics of his social network friends including interested, 
      posts, likes, and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There is a continuously and rapidly increasing amount of social data 
      that is commonly known as User Generated Content (UGC). UGC, if indexed 
      and searched, provides valuable information to the searcher including 
      up-to-date, highly relevant, personalized information about topics being 
      searched.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Now search engines have an additional source for external citations 
      including links shared on social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, 
      FriendFeed and Google+.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This research evaluates Google and Microsoft in social search including 
      a comparative analysis and SWOT analysis for the two companies in social.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LONDON/ABUJA Dec 10 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil lifted
its force majeure on its Nigerian Qua Iboe crude oil grade, the
oil major said on Monday, slightly easing concerns about supply
from Africa's biggest oil exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mobil Producing Nigeria, operator of the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC)/MPN Joint Venture confirms that it
has lifted the force majeure it declared on November 20, 2012,"
it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders said the oil major lifted the force majeure last
week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move by ExxonMobil follows that of Shell which lifted
the last of its three force majeures in late November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Eni's Brass River stream remains under a force
majeure, according to traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The force majeures were imposed due to flooding and theft in
the region and have led to a decline in exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria is among the world's top 10 crude oil exporters and
usually ships around 2 million bpd, but a major fire caused by
oil theft, Exxon's spill and flooding severely hit output in
October and November, and caused lengthy delays to loading
programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  CHELMSFORD, MA, Dec 10 (Marketwire) -- 


--  Health and long-term care risk management company LifePlans selects
    Aspect(R)unified interaction management solution, unites disparate
    technologies
    
    
--  Streamlined view of multichannel customer interactions integrates
    Microsoft Dynamics CRM(TM) with Aspect(R)Unified IP(R)
    
    
--  Innovation of Microsoft Dynamics CRM offering built on Aspect's
    Applications Foundation

    

Aspect Software, a leading provider of next generation customer
contact and enterprise workforce optimization, today announced that
LifePlans, a long-term care insurance service, risk management, and
research company, has selected Aspect's Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Aspect
Unified IP to optimize its existing Aspect Unified IP, Productive
Workforce(TM) and Microsoft Dynamics CRM infrastructure and improve
overall business processes and productivity across their organization.

    Dynamics CRM for Aspect Unified IP is a next-generation customer contact
innovation, leveraging the interaction management capabilities of Aspect
Applications Foundation and Microsoft's foundational customer
relationship management technology (Dynamics CRM 2011). Through easier
information access, intelligent customer interaction and workflow
automation, it provides call centers with superior support for
consistently providing better agent customer interaction experiences and
business outcomes, by integrating the versatility of Microsoft's CRM
platform with the core agent empowerment and workflow automation
strengths of Aspect's interaction management solution. The Aspect
Applications Foundation, which allows easily-configured innovative
solutions through packaged functional components and APIs, enables
organizations and their agents to bring their own experience to the call
center and find more effective, efficient ways to deliver a better
customer experience.

    LifePlans, a premier health and long-term care risk management company,
which assists health plans and long-term care insurers to manage risk
through innovative, evidence-based solutions, selected Microsoft Dynamics
CRM for Aspect Unified IP in order to analyze their customer and
transactional data to gain greater visibility into their customer
activity and agent workflow. Due to the company's vast client base, and
the multiple processes and transactional requirements of each of their
clients, a fragmented infrastructure had begun to cause task and
information management challenges across the company. They saw Microsoft
Dynamics CRM for Aspect Unified IP as a solution that could bring their
information and people together to effectively collaborate and customize
their desired capabilities. 

    "Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Aspect Unified IP has helped us improve
customer care by creating a more efficient workflow for a better
agent-customer experience," said Steve McIsaac, LifePlans VP of
Information Technology. "Our transition to this solution was seamless
because Aspect took a hands-on approach from day one, using a project
methodology and functionality that was a perfect fit for LifePlans. It
was a highly structured process and they were very dedicated to the
implementation, helping us make everything come together and work." 

    Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Aspect Unified IP provides clients with a
single interface to deliver exceptional customer experiences by
converging the contact center and the enterprise using customer
relationship management strategies. The robust integration between Aspect
Unified IP and Microsoft Dynamics CRM provides a complete 360 degree view
of customer interactions and contact opportunities as well as contact
control to maximize customer value and retention. And in addition to
enabling collaboration capabilities through IM and presence, the solution
provides synergies with Microsoft tools such as Microsoft Lync 2010 and
Microsoft SharePoint 2010. Agents are able to more quickly find and
collaborate with the most qualified experts and access related knowledge
resources, helping them speed issue resolution and improve interaction
quality and outcomes.

    "LifePlans' application of the Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Aspect Unified
IP solution really illustrates the fusion of Aspect's collaborative
customer approach and the innovative power of our Aspect Applications
Foundation," said Chris Koziol, Aspect president and general manager,
Interaction Management division. "This versatile foundation, created by
optimizing LifePlans' current technology investment, should provide
LifePlans new levels of cost savings, productivity and business
efficiencies that will help LiefPlans' customer value and foster
long-term loyalty." 

    "Aspect really understands how to leverage the strength of Microsoft
Dynamics CRM by creating a truly complete and holistic view the
customer's experience," said Craig Dewar, Director, Microsoft CRM Product
Marketing. "Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Aspect Unified IP is a true
example of next-generation customer contact innovation by providing
superior support for better customer experiences and business outcomes
through easier information access, intelligent customer interaction and
workflow automation."

			WIN Consortium and Pfizer Collaborate to Advance Personalized Cancer 
      Care
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worldwide Innovative Network (WIN) in personalized cancer medicine 
      consortium today proudly announced that Pfizer, 
      Inc (NYSE:PFE) is the first pharmaceutical company to become a 
      member of the consortium. Founded on the recognition that greater 
      success can be achieved through collaboration than any organization can 
      achieve alone, the WIN Consortium is a global network of leading 
      academic, industry, and patient advocacy organizations working to make 
      personalized cancer care a reality for patients worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer&#8217;s strong corporate commitment to the development of drugs using a 
      precision medicine approach, coupled with the company&#8217;s deep breadth of 
      experience in the development of oncology therapeutics, strategically 
      align the company&#8217;s goals and capabilities with the mission of the WIN 
      Consortium. As the newest member of the consortium, Pfizer will play an 
      integral role in shaping the future achievements of this collective 
      group on behalf of cancer patients around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			"Bringing the latest advances in personalized cancer medicine to the 
      patient requires collaboration and partnerships between multiple sectors 
      of the health sciences community,&#8221; said Professor Alexander 
      Eggermont, General Director, Institut Gustave Roussy and Vice-Chairman 
      of WIN Consortium.&#8220; Pfizer's strong commitment to the development of 
      targeted cancer therapeutics and its breadth of expertise in oncology 
      drug development will play a key role in accelerating the pace at which 
      patients can benefit from advances in personalized cancer medicine. We 
      are proud to have Pfizer as WIN's first pharmaceutical partner and 
      believe that this collaboration will benefit cancer patients worldwide."
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer&#8217;s advanced capabilities in the development of targeted oncology 
      therapies will provide a breadth of insights and opportunities to the 
      Consortium. Pfizer is actively developing a strong pipeline of oncology 
      drugs active against a specific target or pathway, with programs in 
      areas including oncogenic drivers / cell signaling, antibody drug 
      conjugates, anti-angiogenesis, and cancer stem cells, metabolism, and 
      epigenetics. As the world&#8217;s largest research-based pharmaceutical 
      company, Pfizer is active in over 100 oncology focused clinical trials 
      annually.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Pfizer is excited to become the first pharmaceutical company to join 
      the WIN Consortium and to be able to contribute our expertise and 
      resources in oncology drug development to this important collaboration,&#8221; 
      said Dr. Richard Buller, Vice President of Translational Oncology 
      for Pfizer&#8217;s Oncology Business Unit. &#8220;Personalized cancer care is an 
      important part of our mission at Pfizer and this initiative provides a 
      unique forum to collectively share insights, exchange ideas, and 
      positively impact cancer patients.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;

			Nuron Biotech Acquires Commercial, Preventive Vaccine Meningitec&#8482; 
      from Pfizer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Nuron 
      Biotech Inc., a specialty biologics and vaccines company, today 
      announced it has acquired from Pfizer Inc. Meningitec&#8482;, which is a 
      vaccine for the prevention of invasive disease caused by Neisseria 
      meningitidis serogroup C. Meningitec is a preservative free vaccine, 
      which is registered in 23 countries throughout the world. N. 
      meningitidis is a major cause of infectious disease worldwide, with 
      a majority of cases occurring in children, and can lead to meningitis, 
      sepsis and pneumonia. Without treatment, mortality is up to 90 percent1, 
      and death may occur within 48 hours. Nuron Biotech will work closely 
      with Pfizer to ensure a seamless transition and to continue the ready 
      availability of Meningitec to patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Meningitec is a tremendous opportunity to expand Nuron Biotech&#8217;s 
      portfolio with a commercially successful vaccine with an established 
      market,&#8221; said Shankar Musunuri, Ph.D., MBA, Chief Executive Officer and 
      Founder of Nuron Biotech. &#8220;The addition of Meningitec represents an 
      important milestone toward bringing innovative biologics and vaccines to 
      patients with unmet needs around the world. Vaccines such as Meningitec 
      and HibTITER have established track records in the prevention of 
      infectious disease, and we are excited to see such high quality 
      life-saving products in our portfolio.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are planning to expand into markets with unvaccinated and 
      under-vaccinated populations, helping us address public health needs 
      around the world,&#8221; said Richard C. Dinovitz, Vice President, Marketing 
      and Business Development at Nuron Biotech. &#8220;Meningitec is a proven, 
      life-saving, preventative vaccine. In the early 2000s, Meningitec played 
      a pioneering role in reducing disease caused by N. meningitidis serogroup 
      C by 93 percent
			in children in the U.K.&#8221;2
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Neisseria Meningitidis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Neisseria meningitidis is a major cause of global invasive 
      bacterial disease, including meningitis, sepsis and pneumonia. The 
      bacteria live asymptomatically in the nasopharynx in approximately 10 to 
      25 percent of the population and may enter the bloodstream through the 
      nose and throat, potentially affecting multiple areas throughout the 
      body. N. meningitidis is estimated to cause 500,000 cases of 
      disease annually worldwide with a 10 to 20 percent fatality rate. 
      Without treatment, the mortality rate can reach a staggering 90 percent1, 
      and death may result within 24 to 48 hours. Up to 19 percent of 
      survivors suffer from hearing loss, brain damage, renal failure or limb 
      amputations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			N. meningitidis has been identified as having 12 serogroups, or 
      bacterial types sharing common antigens. Five serogroups are responsible 
      for most disease worldwide and have the potential to instigate 
      epidemics. Geographic distribution and epidemic potential are largely 
      determined by the serogroup of the bacteria. Meningococcal Serogroup C, 
      in particular, is a major cause of endemic disease in Europe and the 
      Americas, and numerous outbreaks have occurred in both schools and 
      communities.

			About Meningitec&#8482;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Meningitec&#8482; (Meningococcal Serogroup C Conjugate Vaccine) is a 
      preservative free vaccine, which is delivered in ready-to-use pre-filled 
      syringes for intramuscular injection for the prevention of invasive 
      disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C. Over 50 
      million doses of Meningitec have been distributed since launch, and it 
      is registered in 23 countries, including France, Germany, Spain, Greece 
      and Australia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Throughout the early 1990s, the incidence of serogroup C infection rose 
      dramatically in the United Kingdom, from 2.3 per 100,000 in 1993/94 to 
      4.6 per 100,000 in 1996/97 leading authorities to implement measures to 
      bring a vaccine against the disease to the population. Meningitec, along 
      with other vaccines against N. meningitidis, pioneered a 93 
      percent reduction in annual cases between 1998/99 and 2003/04.2

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nieuwegein, the Netherlands, 10 December 2012 &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has made Ordina a Microsoft Gold Partner in Communications. Microsoft grants this title to companies with extensive know-how of Lync, Microsoft's complete communications solution. The Gold Partner in Communications must also have proven experience with successful implementations of Lync. The appointment is a clear boost to Ordina's services portfolio in the field of United Communications  Collaboration, one of the company's main innovation themes. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"Being made a Microsoft Gold Partner in Communications is clear recognition of our know-how and expertise in the field of our innovation theme Unified Communications  Collaboration", says Barend de Zoete, Director of Professional Services  Projects at Ordina. "Lync is an important product in our service package in this field. We have chosen to invest in the expansion of our services and expertise in the field of Lync. Last week, we launched our Lync-in-the-box product, which allows organisations to explore the possibilities of Unified Communications  Collaboration without any obligation to buy. We also closed a cooperation agreement with Aspect, aimed at integrating Lync in Aspect software. Thanks to this cooperation, contact centres will also be able to benefit from the advantages of Unified Communications. For us, being appointed Gold Partner in Communications by Microsoft means additional recognition of our know-how and expertise in the field of Unified Communications  Collaboration."&#160;&#160; &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Lync integrates all business communications in a single platform, combined with information on the physical availability of a person. This allows employees to very quickly see the best way to contact a colleague, whether this is via telephone, chat or e-mail. Long-distance cooperation and discussions are also more efficient with Lync. For instance, you can arrange a conference call and everybody can work on the same document simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Gold Certified Partner status is a global quality label that Microsoft grants to companies with a sufficient number of certified professionals. The partner also has to demonstrate that these employees have applied their Microsoft know-how and skills in client projects. Ordina has extensive experience with the implementation of Lync together with the implementation of Samen Slimmer Werken (working smarter together) in the processes of organisations.&#160; Ordina uses the combination of software solutions such as Lync with its know-how of how to adopt these solutions in processes and operating methods to provide organisations all-round support in their transition towards a more efficient and more effective way of working. &lt;/p&gt;

      Condusiv Technologies Releases V-locity 4 VM Acceleration Software for 
      up to 50 Percent Performance Improvement of All VMware and Microsoft 
      Hyper-V Virtual Platforms
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      New V-locity 4 VM acceleration software optimizes reads and writes, 
      enabling faster applications and more VMs on a single, physical server 
      without adding any additional storage hardware.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Condusiv&#8482; 
      Technologies, formerly Diskeeper Corporation, the leader in 
      high-performance software optimizing technology, people and businesses, 
      today announced the release of V-locity&#174; 4, application 
      performance and virtual storage software for virtualized environments 
      including all VMware ESX/ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V virtual platforms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			V-locity 
      4 acceleration software allows IT organizations to go substantially 
      faster in virtualized environments without the cost of new or additional 
      storage hardware.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By optimizing reads and writes at the server, V-locity 
      4 boosts Virtual Machine (VM) performance up to 50% for faster 
      response times and improved I/Os per second eliminating application 
      bottlenecks and enabling more VMs on a single, physical server. Because 
      VMs share server and storage resources, the only way to get the full 
      value of virtualization and protect CAPEX investment is by improving I/O 
      response time while increasing bandwidth to the VM without adding 
      additional hardware.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moreover, by solving the I/O bottlenecks at the source proactively and 
      transparently, customers can just install V-locity 4 and continue to 
      experience performance improvements without any further efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Condusiv V-locity product has consistently increased the 
      performance of our VMs. These noted performance gains are even more 
      readily apparent to me and our other administrators through our usage of 
      the new Benefit Analyzer functionality built into the newest V-locity 
      4.0 product. This functionality not only allows us to more easily 
      generate reports that visually show the benefits of the product to 
      ourselves, it also provides us with great documentation for 
      demonstrating the benefit of V-locity 4.0 to our managerial staff. For 
      example, one of our Remote Desktop Session host servers experienced a 
      190% improvement in normalized I/Os per second while latency was reduced 
      by 190% as well. We particularly like the IntelliWrite functionality of 
      V-locity 4.0,&#8221; said Bryan Stephens, Technology Services Specialist, 
      Information Technology, Angelo State University Member, Texas Tech 
      University System.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			V-locity 4 VM acceleration software is a ground-breaking solution for 
      NAS and SAN network storage applications.
			Condusiv Technologies 
      will guarantee a minimum of 25% performance boost on virtual machines, 
      OR THE SOFTWARE IS FREE!

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The primary barriers to performance on a virtual platform are:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Unnecessary I/Os. The Windows operating system generates 
        unnecessary I/O operations by breaking a single file into several 
        pieces upon write. As each piece requires additional operations on the 
        storage layer, the net result is an I/O penalty incurred for every 
        write and subsequent read.
      
			
				I/O bottlenecks. Without proactively addressing the most 
        frequently accessed data on the server side, that data must travel the 
        full distance between server and storage increasing latency and 
        stealing storage bandwidth.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Applications, mobile devices and Big Data are creating tremendous 
      amounts of data. This explosion of data has also created an I/O 
      explosion. While virtualization provides our customers with the agility 
      and scalability required to meet increasing data challenges and helps 
      with cost savings, it is aggravating the I/O bottleneck problem. Unless 
      organizations address these I/O challenges, they won&#8217;t be able to 
      realize the full value of their virtualization investment,&#8221; said Jerry 
      Baldwin, CEO of Condusiv Technologies. &#8220;V-locity 4 with IntelliMemory 
      and IntelliWrite technology eliminates unnecessary I/O and bottlenecks 
      at the source, improving performance by up to 50% on all VM platforms 
      enabling more VMs on a single physical server without additional CAPEX 
      hardware cost.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New proactive technology:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			IntelliMemory&#8482; RAM caching technology. Reduces 
      I/O bottlenecks by intelligently caching active data, thus eliminating 
      unnecessary I/O traffic and improving performance by up to 50%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			IntelliWrite&#174;
			technology automatically prevents the 
      Windows operating system from breaking files into pieces and writing 
      those pieces in a performance penalized manner. This proactive approach 
      improves performance while preventing any negative impact to advanced 
      SAN/NAS features like snapshots replication, data deduplication or thin 
      provisioning growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Redesigned User Interface: Completely redesigned UI for ease of 
      use and product family continuity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			V-Aware&#174;
			technology detects external 
      resource usage from other virtual machines on the virtual platform and 
      eliminates any resource contention that might slow performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CogniSAN&#174;
			technology detects external 
      resource usage within a shared storage system, such as a SAN, and allows 
      for transparent optimization by not competing for resources utilized by 
      other VMs over the same storage infrastructure. It does this without 
      intruding upon any SAN-layer operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			InvisiTasking&#174; technology allows all the 
      V-locity 4 &#8220;background&#8221; operations within the VM to run with zero 
      resource impact on current production.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      V-locity also offers advanced methods that allow storage devices to 
      reclaim unused space. This includes trim and unmap support, as well as 
      automatic zeroing of free space to make compaction easy &#8211; online, 
      automatically. It can also be used to reclaim space during storage 
      migration, taking full advantage of storage features and performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      V-locity includes a Benefit Analyzer feature that helps deliver a before 
      and after performance comparison for V-locity allowing a user to 
      validate with supervisors and stakeholders the key benefits the product 
      brings to the business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      System Requirements:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      V-locity 4 installs on all Windows virtual machines and supports:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Windows XP (requires SP2), Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8,

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SAN ANTONIO - December 11, 2012 - Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today announced that its affiliate, Tesoro Logistics LP (NYSE:TLLP) ("TLLP" or the "Partnership"), has executed a definitive agreement to purchase Chevron Pipe Line Company's Northwest Products System for $400 million. &#160;The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close during the first quarter of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Northwest Products System consists of the Northwest Product Pipeline, a 760-mile Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-regulated common carrier products pipeline which extends from Salt Lake City, Utah to Spokane, Washington, a separate five-mile jet fuel pipeline to the Salt Lake City International Airport and the Northwest Terminalling Company consisting of the Boise and Pocatello, Idaho and Pasco, Washington refined products terminals, which are not subject to FERC regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Nastel 
      Technologies, a global provider of application 
      performance monitoring solutions for mission-critical applications 
      from the datacenter to the cloud, today announced support for IBM&#8217;s new 
      CICS Transaction Server (TS) for z/OS V5.1 and their System Z operating 
      system, adding to the company&#8217;s already robust portfolio of real-time 
      performance monitoring solutions, both distributed and mainframe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nastel has long provided support for the mainframe as part of its 
      middleware-centric application performance monitoring solution, 
      AutoPilot&#174;, whose cross-platform capabilities help enterprises 
      rationalize their monitoring in order to contain costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nastel&#8217;s early-to-market support for the auto-discovery and monitoring 
      of transactions by CICS TS V5.1, the latest version of IBM&#8217;s solution, 
      underlines the company&#8217;s commitment to this important middleware 
      platform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Using AutoPilot, enterprises can automatically discover and monitor the 
      flow of CICS TS transactions in real-time. In addition they can trace 
      messages, transactions and Web Services from the distributed 
      infrastructure across to the mainframe environment and back. This 
      visibility provides IT with the necessary detail to resolve problems 
      rapidly at the same time delivering the business real-time status of 
      their milestones,&#8221; said Charles Rich, vice president of Product 
      Management at Nastel. &#8220;Most importantly, AutoPilot for IBM CICS TS&#8217; 
      built-in real-time 
      analytics alerts IT about emerging problems before users are 
      impacted, enabling IT to be less reactive.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			AutoPilot 
      for IBM CICS TS functions:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Track messages and transactions within WMQ and CICS
      
			
        Stitches z/OS transactions to distributed transactions across tiers
      
			
        Compares actual performance to expected using user-defined SLAs
      
			
        Supports failover in a CICSPLEX environment
      
			
        Enables invoking of EXEC CICS and EXEC SQL commands
      
			
        Supports CICS Transaction Filters and Group Names
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nastel also announced AutoPilot 
      for System Z, a solution that monitors the operation of the System Z 
      operating system, automatically detecting trends in performance and 
      issuing notification about pending problems before damage occurs. 
      AutoPilot for System Z correlates the real-time z/OS state with that 
      from the distributed infrastructure providing instant end-to-end 
      visibility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Features include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Real-time monitoring and analysis of Address Space, z/OS DB2, MQ and 
        z/OS CICS statistics
      
			
        Prebuilt reports for data analysis and troubleshooting

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The donated hardware will support a wide range of KIPP&#8217;s programmatic 
      and operational needs. In the near term, the hardware will increase 
      efficiencies for the teachers and administrators at KIPP NYC's nine 
      schools, and expand and centralize data storage capabilities, as well as 
      support more robust backups and disaster recovery protocols. Over the 
      long term, the hardware will enable KIPP NYC to offer more classes to 
      students in new disciplines, such as video production and editing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "This donation to KIPP continues our commitment to supporting education 
      and doing our part to help strengthen our communities," said Guy 
      Chiarello, Chief Information Officer, JPMorgan Chase  Co. "This new 
      hardware will not only enable KIPP to continue to provide quality 
      education to students in New York City, but it will bring new classes to 
      the curriculum. We are pleased to make this contribution to KIPP."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "This donation has the potential to address the schools' disaster and 
      business recovery needs, improve file storage and help move along 
      educational solutions the schools are working on, said Ed Laux, Managing 
      Director for Technology at KIPP. "We have limited resources internally &#8212; 
      we're focused on the children. But through this unique relationship that 
      we've developed with JPMorgan Chase, they've become an extension of our 
      team.&#160;We talk about the schools' challenges, needs, and opportunities, 
      and they've provided not only much-needed technology, but technical 
      expertise as well."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase provided several technological 
      improvements to KIPP NYC, configuring the schools' SharePoint software 
      to enable teachers and the administration to more efficiently create and 
      search reports, which in turn will help improve the quality of education 
      they can provide to students. The firm also collaborated with Syracuse 
      University, whose Information Technology students are helping to develop 
      requirements and provide an analysis for an Open Source Curriculum 
      Platform (OSCP), which will allow KIPP teachers to upload their 
      documents, pictures, videos and other materials from their curricula to 
      a website that is accessible to other teachers in the network. With the 
      OSCP, educators will be able to perform various functions, such as 
      search and browse, add, update, and branch the curriculum.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase also recently provided financing to help KIPP expand its 
      network of schools in low-income communities in Bronx, N.Y.; Lynn, 
      Mass.; and Washington, DC. Through the New Markets Tax Credit program, 
      the firm invested over $38 million to help KIPP construct the first high 
      school in New York City, a middle and high school in Lynn, and a 
      renovation and expansion of KIPP DC. KIPP NYC College Prep in the Bronx 
      will be KIPP's first high school program in New York City. It will 
      enroll up to 1,000 students. KIPP Academy Lynn is a new middle and high 
      school building that will house more than 40 classrooms in addition to a 
      library, cafeteria, gymnasium and outdoor ball field. JPMorgan Chase 
      also facilitated a transformational renovation and expansion of KIPP 
      DC's Shaw campus that will eventually enroll approximately 1,000 
      preschoolers through 8th graders.

&lt;p&gt;* Power generation fuels gas demand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Natgas to account for more power generation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* N. American gas supply to spur global trade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dec 11 (Reuters) - Soaring oil and gas production will
propel North America into becoming a net energy exporter by
2025, Exxon Mobil Corp said in its annual energy
outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half of the growth in unconventional natural gas
supply over the next two decades will be in North America,
supplies that will help reshape global markets, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improvements in drilling technology such as hydraulic
fracturing have unlocked vast shale oil and gas reserves,
leading to a surge in production and reduction in the United
States' dependence on foreign energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has invested heavily in U.S. natural gas assets in
recent years, beginning with its 2010 purchase of shale gas
operator XTO Energy. The Irving, Texas company is also investing
in the search for crude oil produced from rock formations, but
those supplies are so-far relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's still very much early days for tight oil," William
Colton, vice president for strategic planning at Exxon told
reporters on a media call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Exxon said it would buy Denbury Resources
Inc's crude oil properties in the Bakken shale in North Dakota
for $1.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing supplies of North American natural gas are expected
to spur trade with countries in Asia and Europe, said Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies including Exxon have already lined up to get
permission to ship the country's cheap natural gas overseas. The
only gas export terminal approved by the United States so far is
Cheniere Energy Inc's Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural gas, which emits up to 60 percent less carbon
dioxide than coal when used for electricity generation, is
expected to overtake coal by 2025 as the second most-used fuel,
according to the Exxon report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon expects natural gas, which has been one of its biggest
investment areas in recent years, to account for 30 percent of
global electricity generation by 2040 compared with less than 25
percent now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power plants in the United States are already using less
coal as they switch to more efficient plants fired by natural
gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said developing nations such as India and China will
drive global energy demand, which is expected to increase 35
percent between 2010 and 2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's findings are similar to two recent reports from the
Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the International
Energy Agency (IEA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EIA said last Wednesday that U.S. natural gas production
would grow faster than expected through the next two decades,
paving the way for the country to be a net gas exporter as early
as 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IEA said last month that the United States will overtake
Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's top oil producer by 2017
and North America will become a net oil exporter by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Dec 11 (MARKET WIRE) --
Canada's independent petroleum marketers need a break from high credit
card fees. The Canadian Independent Petroleum Marketers Association
(CIPMA) is asking Visa to rethink its proposed fee increase. At a time
when retailers are struggling and banks and credit card companies are
posting record profits, Visa recently advised retail merchants that it
will be increasing the already high fees they charge to process a credit
card payment AND adding yet another higher cost 'Premium card' to an
already crowded credit card marketplace.

    Independent petroleum marketers who sell and distribute close to 25% of
retail gasoline in Canada, operate on very thin and generally stable
margins. "Credit card fees are calculated as a percentage of the total
amount of the sale, so as gas prices increase and more and more higher
cost premium cards are introduced, our members are getting hit twice,"
says Tricia Anderson, President of CIPMA. Anderson notes that on a credit
card sale, the independent petroleum marketer is currently paying over
1/3 of their total operating margin to credit card companies such as Visa
merely to process a payment. From the balance, independent marketers must
pay all other operating costs including salaries, benefits, facilities
rent, utilities, taxes, maintenance and capital improvements. One CIPMA
member noted that: "Visa is taking home more from our business than our
family is. And we are the people putting the investment, time and energy
into running the business." 

    Independent petroleum marketers also bear the brunt of paying for credit
card fees on taxes they collect for government. The average tax on
gasoline has increased significantly since 2009. On an average
transaction, a retailer pays over 40 cents simply to cover credit card
fees on taxes that they collect.

    Over 40% of all retail fuel purchases at CIPMA members' sites are done by
credit cards.

    CIPMA is a national, not-for-profit trade association representing the
unique interests of independent, (i.e. non-refiner) marketers of
petroleum products. Independent petroleum marketers are small and medium
sized enterprises whose success is built on solid business practices and
strong connections to the communities they serve. CIPMA member companies
distribute and sell petroleum and renewable fuels to the wholesale,
commercial, farm, and industrial and retail markets. CIPMA members employ
directly and indirectly over 20,000 Canadians in communities across
Canada.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - A Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) attorney argued on Tuesday that the bank cannot be liable for the losses of a husband and wife pair who sold their company to a Belgian software firm that collapsed in an accounting fraud, since Goldman had not been hired to seek out a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street giant is facing off in U.S. District Court in Boston against the founders of speech-recognition software company Dragon Systems, who contend they lost their life's work and about $600 million after selling their company to Lernout &amp; Hauspie in an all-stock deal months before L collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no question that Dragon and its stockholders were also defrauded," said John Donovan, an attorney with Boston law firm Ropes &amp; Gray, in his opening remarks defending Goldman in the civil suit. "Goldman's job was not to detect fraud. When you hire a banker, you ask it to do certain things but delving into the books, doing accounting and finding fraud is not one of them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day earlier, the attorney for Janet and James Baker, who founded Dragon in 1982 in their suburban Boston home with $30,000, had argued that the couple relied on Goldman's advice in agreeing to sell their firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bakers owned 51 percent of the company but only were able to sell a few million dollars worth of L stock before the company collapsed in an accounting fraud. The Bakers and two other early Dragon employees are seeking several hundred million dollars in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's reputation has been tarnished in recent years amid allegations that it has treated clients shabbily. Earlier this year one executive leaving the bank published a resignation letter calling the bank a "toxic" place where managing directors referred to their clients as "muppets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the months leading up to Dragon's decision to sell to L, Dragon management and owners were under intense financial pressure, facing falling sales and a cash crunch, Donovan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that Goldman had urged Dragon's board to slow the pace of negotiations with L and to commission more active accounting reviews of the buyer's results. Instead, Dragon management pushed aggressively ahead, with Janet Baker and a counterpart at their suitor writing out a deal on a piece of paper that changed L's offer from cash and stock to all stock, Donovan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They pushed ahead with the deal because after a failed 1999 initial public offering, Dragon needed cash to continue, Donovan argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Goldman had told them to walk away, as they now say Goldman should have, they would have been left with tears in their eyes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman denied civil claims that include gross negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.

      integrated system for educator effectiveness. The company&#8217;s system 
      outlines a step-by-step process to improve teacher practice, and arms 
      educators with a set of powerful tools that can be used to complete each 
      step. Research shows that districts and schools that use the tools in 
      School Improvement Network&#8217;s integrated system for educator 
      effectiveness produce better teachers, and as a result experience 
      dramatic increases in student achievement, driving up student test 
      scores by as much as 30 percent in a single year. School Improvement 
      Network works with thousands of schools and districts in every state and 
      around the world and has visited over 3,500 classrooms to document best 
      practices in action. Learn more at http://www.schoolimprovement.com.

			ExxonMobil&#8217;s Outlook for Energy Forecasts Shift in Global 
      Energy Balance and New Opportunities for International Trade and 
      Economic Growth
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Global energy demand expected to be 35 percent higher in 2040 versus 
        2010 as population and economy grow
      
			
        North America likely to transition to net energy exporter by 2025
      
			
        Oil and natural gas supplies benefit from advanced technologies and 
        will meet about 60 percent of global energy demand in 2040
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The global energy landscape will evolve significantly as regional 
      demand-and-supply patterns shift in the coming decades, creating new 
      opportunities for international trade and economic growth, says ExxonMobil&#8217;s 
      Outlook for Energy: A View to 2040, which was
			released 
      today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Energy is fundamental to our way of life and essential to grow our 
      economy,&#8221; said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of 
      Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). &#8220;Understanding future energy trends 
      is critical for effective policy decisions that can help ensure safe, 
      reliable and affordable energy development and economic growth, job 
      creation and expanded global trade.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In its annual forecast, ExxonMobil projects that global energy demand in 
      2040 will be approximately 35 percent higher than in 2010. Future energy 
      needs will be supported by more efficient energy-saving practices and 
      technologies, increased use of less-carbon-intensive fuels such as 
      natural gas, nuclear and renewables, and the development of 
      unconventional energy sources that were previously inaccessible without 
      technology advances.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Oil will continue to be the most widely used fuel, but natural gas -- 
      the fastest growing major fuel -- is expected to overtake coal by 2025 
      as the second most used fuel. Demand for natural gas will increase by 
      about 65 percent through 2040, and 20 percent of global production will 
      occur in North America, supported by growing supplies of gas from shale 
      and other unconventional sources.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      New technologies will continue to be key to development of reliable and 
      affordable energy, which is central to economic growth and human 
      progress, the Outlook for Energy concludes. Significant 
      advancements in oil and natural gas technologies have safely unlocked 
      vast new supplies, already changing the energy landscape in North 
      America and expanding supplies to help meet growing global energy demand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Outlook for Energy projects that North America is likely to 
      transition to a net energy exporter by 2025. Over the next two decades, 
      more than half of the growth in unconventional natural gas supply will 
      be in North America, providing a strong foundation for increased 
      economic growth across the United States, and most notably in industries 
      such as energy, chemicals, steel and manufacturing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These resources will also create new opportunities for global trade with 
      countries in Europe and the Asia Pacific region, which are reliant on 
      international markets to meet domestic energy requirements. The changing 
      landscape and resulting trade opportunities will continue to provide 
      consumers with more choices, value, wealth and good jobs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Outlook for Energy projects that energy for electricity 
      generation will continue to be the largest component of global demand 
      and is expected to grow by 50 percent to 2040. The growth reflects an 
      expected 85 percent increase in electricity demand, led by developing 
      countries where 1.3 billion people are currently without access to 
      electricity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As the world gradually transitions from coal to cleaner fuels for 
      electricity generation, natural gas, nuclear and renewable energy 
      sources, including wind and solar, will represent a greater share of the 
      global energy mix. Natural gas, which emits up to 60 percent less carbon 
      dioxide than coal when used for electricity generation, will grow the 
      most. By 2040, natural gas will account for 30 percent of global 
      electricity generation, compared to less than 25 percent today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Outlook for Energy highlights the important role of 
      efficiency in helping balance energy demand with the growing world 
      economy. Energy-saving practices and technologies, such as hybrid 
      vehicles and high-efficiency natural gas power plants, will help 
      countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
      (OECD) increase economic output by 80 percent without increasing total 
      energy use. In the transportation sector, the number of cars on the road 
      worldwide is expected to approximately double by 2040, but the fuel 
      demand will actually plateau and gradually decline as consumers turn to 
      smaller, lighter vehicles and technologies improve fuel efficiency.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Outlook for Energy is developed each year by a team of 
      experts using a combination of public and proprietary sources, and 
      guides ExxonMobil's global investment decisions. Many of its findings 
      are similar to those from other respected organizations, including the 
      International Energy Agency. ExxonMobil publishes The
			Outlook
			for Energy each year to encourage broader understanding of energy 
      issues among policymakers and the public to enable informed decisions on 
      energy issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Among this year&#8217;s findings:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Energy demand in non-OECD countries will increase 65 percent by 2040 
        compared to 2010, reflecting growing prosperity in nations that 
        include more than 80 percent of the world&#8217;s population.
      
			
        Electricity generation is expected to account for more than half of 
        the increase in global energy demand over the next few decades. 
        Natural gas, nuclear and renewables will grow to meet rising 
        electricity demand, while coal and oil use for power generation will 
        decline.
      
			
        Global transportation-related energy demand will rise by more than 40 
        percent from 2010 to 2040. The growth is almost entirely from 
        commercial transportation -- heavy duty, aviation, marine and rail -- 
        as expanding economies and international trade spur greater movement 
        of goods.
      
			
        Evolving demand and supply patterns will open the door for increased 
        global trade opportunities. The changing energy landscape in 
        conjunction with an abundance of free trade opportunities will help 
        lead to more choices and creation of value that helps fuel economic 
        growth and improve living standards worldwide.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demand for reliable, affordable energy exists every day in every 
      community. Meeting this demand requires foresight and effective 
      long-term planning followed by huge investments and years of work to 
      build the infrastructure required to produce and deliver energy around 
      the world. It also takes an ongoing ability to understand and manage an 
      evolving set of technical, financial, geopolitical and environmental 
      risks in a dynamic world. The Outlook for Energy is an essential 
      tool to help ExxonMobil provide the energy needed for continuing human 
      progress.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co jumped to first in a U.S. customer satisfaction survey, as its three biggest rivals, including perennial leader Wells Fargo &amp; Co, posted a decline in their scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, saw its score climb nearly 6 percent from last year to 74 on a 100-point scale. But smaller banks and credit unions continued to record higher numbers than all large banks, according to an annual report by the American Customer Satisfaction Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big banks have drawn the ire of customers for receiving bailouts during the financial crisis and for rolling out higher fees in recent years. Still, the survey found that all of the large banks, except for Bank of America Corp, have seen their scores match or eclipse pre-financial crisis levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The gap now from Bank of America to everyone else is pretty big," said David VanAmburg, managing director of the ACSI. High fees were the biggest concerns of its customers, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey rates satisfaction with banks' checking, savings and personal loan accounts. ACSI, which was founded at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, interviews about 70,000 customers each year for its surveys of 230 companies in 47 industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo had held the top spot among big banks for 11 years, counting eight years for Wachovia, which Wells bought in 2008. Its 3 percent drop to 71 is a concern for the bank, but not a major one unless a downward trend develops, VanAmburg said. Over the years, the bank has touted its No. 1 ranking in the survey, even as it was completing a major merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Chase's score showed the bank is boosting the reliability and quality of its banking experience, producing increases in the past two years, VanAmburg said. Citigroup Inc's score fell 4 percent to 70, while Bank of America's fell 3 percent to 66.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller banks as a group stayed flat with a score of 79 in this year's survey, while credit unions fell 6 percent to 82.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 11 (Reuters) - Soaring oil and gas production will
propel North America into becoming a net energy exporter by
2025, Exxon Mobil Corp said in its annual energy
outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half of the growth in unconventional natural gas
supply over the next two decades will be in North America, Exxon
said in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent drilling innovations such as hydraulic fracturing
have unlocked vast shale oil and gas reserves, leading to a
surge in production and reducing the United States' dependence
on foreign energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies including Exxon have already lined up to get
permission to ship the country's cheap natural gas overseas. The
only gas export terminal approved by the United States so far is
Cheniere Energy Inc's Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Energy Information Administration said last Wednesday
that U.S. natural gas production would grow faster than expected
through the next two decades, paving the way for the country to
be a net gas exporter as early as 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency said last month that the
United States will overtake Saudi Arabia and Russia as the
world's top oil producer by 2017 and North America will become a
net oil exporter by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural gas, which emits up to 60 percent less carbon
dioxide than coal when used for electricity generation, is
expected to overtake coal by 2025 as the second most-used fuel,
according to the Exxon report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon expects natural gas, which has been one of its biggest
investment areas in recent years, to account for 30 percent of
global electricity generation by 2040 compared with less than 25
percent now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power plants in the United States are already using less
coal as they switch to more efficient plants fired by natural
gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said developing nations such as India and China will
drive global energy demand, which is expected to increase 35
percent between 2010 and 2040.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SUGAR LAND, TX, Dec 11 (Marketwire) -- 
Reported by Annette Kreuger, Industrial Info Resources (Sugar Land,
Texas) -- Over the past few years, plant closures throughout the
pharmaceutical-biotech industry became so common that news of another
barely spurred interest beyond those immediately affected. Despite the
regularity of these closings, some perceived that a few of the sites, the
"mega sites," were somehow sacrosanct. Despite evidence to the contrary,
Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) (New York, New York) 2010 decision to severely trim
operations at its 550-acre, 2.5 million-square-foot Pearl River campus
was met with almost a state of disbelief for locals. But a ray of light

&lt;p&gt;Singapore shares inched higher by midday, extending gains for

percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs expects oil prices to fall in the coming years

12-month target of 3,500 points for the STI, citing its
attractive valuations and as it favours cyclicals compared to

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - IBM ads urge us all to follow its lead and help "build a smarter planet." Let's hope other companies don't follow Big Blue's latest move: an overhaul of its 401(k) plan that shifts its matching contribution to a once-a-year affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting next year, IBM will shift its matching contribution from semi-monthly to a lump sum paid each December 31. Leave the company before December 15, and you'll get no match at all for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retirement plan experts say it is a clever money-saving move -- and one that allows Big Blue to focus its benefit resources on workers who are sticking with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For loyal workers, the shift means 11 lost months every year of opportunity for dollar-cost averaged contributions and potential investment growth. And it makes the 401(k) plan less valuable to employees who leave IBM - either on their own or through layoff or disability. They'll lose the entire match for that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This change reflects our continuing commitment to invest in our employee 401(k) plans while maintaining business competitiveness in a challenging economic environment," said an IBM spokesman. "IBM's 401(k) plans remain among the best in the industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to employer contributions ranging from 6 percent to 10 percent of salary, the spokesman noted that IBM makes automatic contributions even for employees who do not contribute to the plan themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is widely viewed as an employee benefits trend-setter. The company last made retirement plan headlines in 2008 when it replaced its defined benefit pension plan with a cutting-edge 401(k) plan featuring very generous matching contributions -- depending on hire date and years of service -- low fees and access to free financial advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, IBM's 401(k) plan is the largest private sector defined contribution plan in the country, with $37.6 billion in assets. It is the 14th-best, according to the annual ranking of top 30 plans released this week by Brightscope, which rates and analyzes plans (here).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're a major trend-setter, so a lot of other companies will be looking very closely at this move," said Brooks Herman, Brightscope's head of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A national trend toward annual matches would be bad news for workers, especially middle- and lower-income households already finding it very difficult to build significant nest eggs through the 401(k) system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's shift to an annual contribution will save money on matches to employees who leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If plan sponsors want to cut spending, they're going to look at the smartest way to use their resources," said Alison Borland, vice president of retirement product strategy at Aon Hewitt. "Do I want to focus on long or short service? Do I want to focus on employees who stick around, or those who leave during the year?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change also will give IBM a big cash flow advantage. "They can time the plan contributions and invest the money elsewhere," said Roger Wohlner, a financial planner who advises small and medium-sized workplace retirement plans. "I'm sure IBM has some extremely bright treasury and cash management people who figured out this would be a nice windfall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aon Hewitt reports that just nine percent of plans make annual lump sum contributions now. "These are plans that just set it up this way years ago," Borland said. "IBM is the first large company to make a change like this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's example could appeal to smaller plans looking to solve a key administrative headache, said Jason Roberts, CEO of the Pension Resource Institute, which provides consulting and training services to retirement plan service providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the most common Department of Labor rule violations that gets plans in trouble is the burden of segregating matching contributions from payroll," Roberts said. "That's not a problem for big, sophisticated companies like IBM, but some small plan sponsors might see an annual contribution as a way to simplify the administrative burden."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, IBM workers have been lighting up the Internet and social media with complaints about the changes, and Alliance@IBM -- an employee group affiliated with the Communications Workers of America that is trying to unionize IBM workers -- is running a petition drive urging Big Blue to rescind the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although workers can continue to make regular payroll contributions and allocate those contributions throughout the year, the shift does mean 11 lost months of opportunity for dollar-cost averaged contributions and potential investment growth of the matching funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One thing we are trying instill with plan participants is the importance of staying consistent with your allocations, maintaining the appropriate portfolio mix through rebalancing and the benefit of smoothing volatility through contributions over time," said Roberts. "This allocates a big chunk of your contribution all at once."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's 401(k) will be less valuable for any workers who leave IBM, either on their own or through layoff or disability, since they'll lose an entire year of matching contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's U.S. workforce has shrunk over the past ten years from 160,000 to just 92,000, according to Alliance@IBM, which tracks workforce trends at the company. The workplace group worries the 401(k) changes could prompt the company to lay off workers late in the year to save money on the match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM employees recognize how good the 401(k) plan is, but the company has done a tremendous amount of job outsourcing to places like China and the Philippines. We're worried this will incentivize IBM to make even more job cuts in the U.S." said Lee Conrad, Alliance@IBM's national coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Would they do a mass layoff just before the date-of record?" asks Wohlner. "I'm not saying IBM is anything but an ethical employer, but if this trend took hold and layoffs occur in early December, you'd have to wonder if that's part of the reason. It raises a lot of questions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Lauren Young and Nick Zieminski; Follow us @ReutersMoney or here)&lt;/p&gt;

their hands on a proposal together just before the vote has to
take place," said Blankfein, among corporate executives meeting
with politicians to push for a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein also warned bond investors to be careful about
losses they will suffer when interest rates rise as the economy
improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the big risks that is looming," Blankfein said, is
that "people are once again complacent about this low level of
interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At some point there will be a reversal and that will have
an effect on portfolios and people will have losses," Blankfein
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Goldman is urging companies to sell bonds
to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are advising all companies," he said, "to borrow as much

they are going to need it, because interest rates are so cheap."&lt;/p&gt;

Protonix, which belongs to a class of widely used medicines called proton pump inhibitors (PPI), has since gone off patent and is available in cheap generic versions as pantoprazole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protonix was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for short-term treatment of erosive esophagitis -a condition related to gastro-esophageal reflux disease, or GERD, that can only be diagnosed via endoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department accused Wyeth of training its sales force to promote Protonix for all forms of GERD, which is far more common and likely to lead to significantly higher sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wyeth tried to cheat the system by obtaining a limited FDA approval for Protonix, fully intending to promote this drug for additional, unapproved uses," U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Wyeth allegedly promoted Protonix as the "best PPI for nighttime heartburn" even though there was never any clinical evidence that it was more effective than any other PPI, such as AstraZeneca's Nexium, for that use, the Justice Department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer issued a statement saying that it was not the target or subject of this case, but felt that settling it was in its best interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Resolving this investigation regarding Wyeth's historical promotional practices of Protonix is the right thing to do," the company said. "In settling, we avoid both the cost and distraction of litigation and we expressly deny the allegations of wrongdoing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were down 14 cents at $25.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Maureen Bavdek and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 12 (Reuters) - A six-month electricity trading
ban imposed on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. by federal energy
regulators is "not that big a deal," Chief Executive Jamie Dimon
said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ban, which will prevent the bank from selling
electricity at competitive market rates, is one of the most
serious punishments that can be levied by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC), the top U.S. power market
regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not worried about it," Dimon said at The New York Times
Dealbook Conference in New York. He said the ban would not have
an economic impact on the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ban highlights the increasing scrutiny Wall Street banks
are receiving from FERC, which has stepped up its enforcement
after a 2005 law that gave it additional powers in the wake of
the Enron scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said JPMorgan would continue to fight the ban, which
he said was wrongly imposed. "We think we're entitled to, when
they're wrong, to fight it, you know, legitimately. That's what
courts are for," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dimon, who recently estimated the bank's annual
regulation tab at more than $1 billion, seemed resigned to
eventually losing the fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My experience in life is that regulators always win
anyway," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for FERC declined comment, citing the agency's
policy of not discussing ongoing cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides JPMorgan, FERC has also charged Barclays Bank Plc
 and Deutsche Bank AG with alleged power
market manipulation in the United States. It has proposed a
record $470 million fine for Barclays and is seeking $1.5
million from Deutsche Bank. Both banks are fighting the charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's punishment is unique in that it stems from a
dispute over the bank's refusal to hand over documents in a
market manipulation investigation, not a finding of
manipulation. When FERC last imposed a similar ban on a major
market player, the target was Enron Corp, the trading firm that
infamously manipulated the California power market in 2000 and
subsequently blew up in an accounting scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff has denied the agency is
increasingly going after banks. "We're an equal opportunity
enforcer," he told reporters last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said, "Sometimes the penalties dwarf the crime - I
mean, not even close. I'm not that sure that's fair to my
shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trading ban, announced Nov. 15, is scheduled to take
effect next April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish police arrested a Panamanian woman on Wednesday who landed in Barcelona from Bogota, Colombia with cocaine stuffed inside her breast implants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman was taken to the police at Barcelona's El Prat airport after her vague answers to questions about the reasons for her trip from Bogota raised suspicion at the border control, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spanish authorities carry out rigorous checks of passengers arriving on so-called "hot flights" from Latin America, to fight drug smuggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When border police discovered fresh scars and blood-stained gauze on the woman's chest she was taken to a nearby hospital to check her claim that she had recently undergone breast implant surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implants were found to carry 1.38 kg of cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Tracy Rucinski; Editing by Fiona Ortiz and Paul Casciato)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said on Wednesday that
he believes his successor is working at the firm now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the choice is ultimately up to Goldman's board of
directors, Blankfein said: "It is a very high likelihood, close

Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein made the comments at a New York Times conference

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve appears likely to adopt numerical guideposts for monetary policy early next year. They would work by indicating to financial markets and the public that, for instance, as a falling jobless rate edges close to 6.5 percent, the central bank will start thinking about pulling back on its bond-buying stimulus. That&#8217;s as long as inflation, the other key parameter of policy, does not exceed a certain pre-established level (most likely 2.5 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, however, wonders in a research note if the Fed is making the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would such a move be a good idea? We&#8217;re not so sure. Calendar guidance may be theoretically flawed, but it is working reasonably well in practice. Fed officials have managed to keep expectations for the funds rate in the next few years pinned near zero, and the market now understands that this is more of a commitment to the promotion of future economic recovery than an expectation of future economic weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Threshold guidance is theoretically appealing because it makes this commitment even more explicit, but it could be problematic in practice because the unemployment rate &#8211; almost certainly the activity variable of choice &#8211; is an imperfect measure of progress toward the committee&#8217;s jobs mandate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - IBM ads urge us all to follow its lead and help "build a smarter planet." Let's hope other companies don't follow Big Blue's latest move: an overhaul of its 401(k) plan that shifts its matching contribution to a once-a-year affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting next year, IBM will shift its matching contribution from semi-monthly to a lump sum paid each December 31. Leave the company before December 15, and you'll get no match at all for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM declined to comment, but retirement plan experts say it is a clever money-saving move -- and one that allows Big Blue to focus its benefit resources on workers who are sticking with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For loyal workers, the shift means 11 lost months every year of opportunity for dollar-cost averaged contributions and potential investment growth. And it makes the 401(k) plan less valuable to employees who leave IBM - either on their own or through layoff or disability. They'll lose the entire match for that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is widely viewed as an employee benefits trend-setter. The company last made retirement plan headlines in 2008 when it replaced its defined benefit pension plan with a cutting-edge 401(k) plan featuring very generous matching contributions ranging from six to ten percent - depending on hire date and years of service -- low fees and access to free financial advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, IBM's 401(k) plan is the largest private sector defined contribution plan in the country, with $37.6 billion in assets. It is the 14th-best, according to the annual ranking of top 30 plans released this week by Brightscope, which rates and analyzes plans (here).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're a major trend-setter, so a lot of other companies will be looking very closely at this move," said Brooks Herman, Brightscope's head of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A national trend toward annual matches would be bad news for workers, especially middle- and lower-income households already finding it very difficult to build significant nest eggs through the 401(k) system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's shift to an annual contribution will save money on matches to employees who leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If plan sponsors want to cut spending, they're going to look at the smartest way to use their resources," said Alison Borland, vice president of retirement product strategy at Aon Hewitt. "Do I want to focus on long or short service? Do I want to focus on employees who stick around, or those who leave during the year?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change also will give IBM a big cash flow advantage. "They can time the plan contributions and invest the money elsewhere," said Roger Wohlner, a financial planner who advises small and medium-sized workplace retirement plans. "I'm sure IBM has some extremely bright treasury and cash management people who figured out this would be a nice windfall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aon Hewitt reports that just nine percent of plans make annual lump sum contributions now. "These are plans that just set it up this way years ago," Borland said. "IBM is the first large company to make a change like this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's example could appeal to smaller plans looking to solve a key administrative headache, said Jason Roberts, CEO of the Pension Resource Institute, which provides consulting and training services to retirement plan service providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the most common Department of Labor rule violations that gets plans in trouble is the burden of segregating matching contributions from payroll," Roberts said. "That's not a problem for big, sophisticated companies like IBM, but some small plan sponsors might see an annual contribution as a way to simplify the administrative burden."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, IBM workers have been lighting up the Internet and social media with complaints about the changes, and Alliance@IBM -- an employee group affiliated with the Communications Workers of America that is trying to unionize IBM workers -- is running a petition drive urging Big Blue to rescind the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although workers can continue to make regular payroll contributions and allocate those contributions throughout the year, the shift does mean 11 lost months of opportunity for dollar-cost averaged contributions and potential investment growth of the matching funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One thing we are trying instill with plan participants is the importance of staying consistent with your allocations, maintaining the appropriate portfolio mix through rebalancing and the benefit of smoothing volatility through contributions over time," said Roberts. "This allocates a big chunk of your contribution all at once."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's 401(k) will be less valuable for any workers who leave IBM, either on their own or through layoff or disability, since they'll lose an entire year of matching contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's U.S. workforce has shrunk over the past ten years from 160,000 to just 92,000, according to Alliance@IBM, which tracks workforce trends at the company. The workplace group worries the 401(k) changes could prompt the company to lay off workers late in the year to save money on the match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM employees recognize how good the 401(k) plan is, but the company has done a tremendous amount of job outsourcing to places like China and the Philippines. We're worried this will incentivize IBM to make even more job cuts in the U.S." said Lee Conrad, Alliance@IBM's national coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Would they do a mass layoff just before the date-of record?" asks Wohlner. "I'm not saying IBM is anything but an ethical employer, but if this trend took hold and layoffs occur in early December, you'd have to wonder if that's part of the reason.

		&lt;p&gt;MINNEAPOLIS - Dec. 12, 2012 - Best Buy, the global leader in consumer electronics, announced it will launch the Microsoft Surface tablet on BestBuy.com today at Noon CST. The Surface will also be available in all Best Buy and select Best Buy Mobile specialty stores nationwide this Sunday, Dec. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;"Right now the only place you can get a Microsoft tablet is at a Microsoft store. That all changes today as BestBuy.com begins offering the Surface," said Scott Durchslag, President of BestBuy.com. "Customers have come to expect Best Buy - both its store and website - to be the place with the broadest selection of consumer electronics and our sale of this much-hyped new tablet just reinforces that point."&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Best Buy sells 45 exclusive Windows 8 devices and has invested thousands of training hours for Blue Shirts and Geek Squad Agents to help consumers make the Windows 8 choices that best fit their individual needs. Every Best Buy store has a specially-skilled Windows 8 expert on hand. Best Buy features services aimed at improving customers' tablet experiences, including Walk Out Working as well as a full array of accessories for customers to protect and personalize their new tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;"Consumers have heard about this tablet and now even more customers can experience it," said Scott Anderson, merchant vice president for tablets at Best Buy. "Starting this weekend we will have almost 1,400 stores where people can buy it. The Surface is a fantastic add to our already enormous tablet assortment and makes Best Buy the destination for gift givers this year."&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;According to the Consumers Electronics Association, when asked specifically which CE device consumers want the most this year, the most requested are tablets. In addition, the CEA report found that consumers wanted a tablet (8 percent) more than money (5 percent) and peace and happiness (5 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;The Surface retails for $499.99 (32GB - tablet only), $599.99 (32GB with black touch cover) or $699 (64GB with black touch cover).&lt;/p&gt;

      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced that John Partridge will retire as 
      the company&#8217;s president, effective March 31, 2013. In this role, 
      Partridge leads the company&#8217;s technology, emerging product, processing 
      and client services functions. Additionally, he spear-headed the 
      integration of recent acquisitions, including CyberSource, PlaySpan and 
      Fundamo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      John will continue to manage his portfolio of responsibilities through 
      March, 2013 and work closely with Visa&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, 
      Charles W. Scharf, on a transition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I have known John for more than a decade and have tremendous respect

      During his 13 years with Visa, Mr. Partridge made several significant

			JP

      Energy, a division of Truman Arnold Companies (TAC) 
      have announced that TAC is contributing its Caddo Mills, TX and North 
      Little Rock, AR terminal operations to JP Energy.
			Terms of 
      this agreement were not disclosed.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Prior to the transaction TAC 
      owned 100% of the Caddo Mills terminal and 100% of the North Little Rock 
      terminal, which was previously co-owned with the shareholders of Coulson 
      Oil Company and branded Arkansas Terminaling and Trading.
			In 
      place since the 1980s, this has been a &#8220;highly valued relationship&#8221; said 
      Mike Coulson, Chairman of the Board of Coulson Oil Company.
			&#8220;We 
      have enjoyed our longstanding relationship with TAC and are now equally 
      excited to be tapping into JP 
      Energy&#8217;s expertise.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			According to Greg Arnold, President  CEO of TAC, this move will 
      allow the privately owned company to place a greater emphasis on its 
      energy marketing and aviation services business, as TAC 
      continues to expand its national footprint.
			TAC 
      currently markets refined fuels in 48 states and aviation operations in 
      14 major markets.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Greg Arnold continued, &#8220;TAC partnering with JP 
      Energy is a synergistic move for both companies.
			The 
      terminals have been solid performers for us and come with a team of 
      associates that are second to none. Adding these operations to JP 
      Energy&#8217;s network of midstream assets is a perfect complement to their 
      business model.
			In addition, TAC Energy&#8217;s supply  
      logistics services to our wholesale customers will be strengthened by 
      utilizing the JP Energy supply chain.
			It&#8217;s a win for both 
      companies and our customers.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In conjunction with the move, TAC President  CEO Greg Arnold will 
      be appointed to the JP 
      Energy Board of Directors.
			J. Patrick 
      Barley, President  CEO of JP Energy, stated, &#8220;The addition of Greg to 
      our board brings us the experience and intellectual capital of one of 
      the leading independent oil marketers in the nation. This combined with 
      TAC&#8217;s experience in terminal operations, trading, and supply  logistics 
      will be a tremendous benefit to JP Energy.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dec 13 - Fitch Ratings has assigned Korea Finance Corporation's (KoFC,
'AA-'/Stable) proposed long-term senior unsecured JPY20bn notes maturing in December 2014 a
'AA-' rating. The proceeds will be used for KoFC's general operations, including extending
foreign currency loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notes are rated at the same level as KoFC's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) as
they represent direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company.
KoFC's IDR is in turn equalised with the IDR of South Korea's sovereign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rating reflects Fitch's belief of an extremely high probability of support from the
government for KoFC. The Korean government is legally obliged to cover KoFC's losses should its
capital reserve funds fail to do so, as per Article 31 of the KoFC Act. That said, any change in
South Korea's sovereign ratings or the KoFC Act will affect KoFC's ratings directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KoFC is 100%-owned by the government and is mandated to provide financial support to SMEs
and new growth industries, and to promote stability in domestic financial markets. KoFC has a
90.26% stake in KDB Financial Group and does not take deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Dec 14 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and
Google Inc's Motorola Mobility unit have requested a
federal judge in Seattle to keep secret from the public various

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp is willing to pay about 300 million reais ($144 million) to settle lawsuits in Brazil over an oil spill last year, a senior executive and a federal prosecutor said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks over a possible settlement reinforce expectations of a swift resolution for Chevron (CVX.N), the No. 2 U.S. oil company, and its drilling contractor Transocean Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related moves by Brazil's oil regulator, the ANP, could also lead to a quick restart of output at Chevron's Frade field, the location of the spill, which has been shut since March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We could have an agreement before Christmas," Gisele Porto, the prosecutor responsible for the case, said after a public hearing. "The amount is reasonable, and I don't think I could get a judge to sign off on more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said Chevron and Brazil's oil regulator, the ANP, suggested that the settlement include 311 million reais worth of damages and additional measures to improve the safety of offshore oil operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's our understanding that if this settlement is accepted that the civil lawsuits will be extinct," said Rafael Jaen Williamson Chevron's director of corporate affairs in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron will pay the entire cost of the settlement, Williamson said. Transocean was found to have no responsibility in the spill by the ANP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIGGEST-EVER PROSECUTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expected settlement amount is less than 1 percent of the nearly $20 billion in damages initially sought by prosecutors in the case, Brazil's largest-ever environmental prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The prosecutor asked for too much and asked for it before investigations of the spill were even complete," said Porto, who took over the case earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed settlement represents between six weeks to two months of Chevron's share of output from the Frade field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has a 52 percent stake in the Frade field, which was producing 60,000 barrels a day before it was closed on March 15. The heavy crude pumped at Frade trades at a discount to Brent crude, which has averaged $110.33 per barrel since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's state-led Perobras owns 30 percent of output from Frade and Frade Japan, a Japanese group controlled by Sojitz Corp (2768.T) and Inpex Corp (1605.T), owns 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm extremely disappointed," said Eduardo Santos de Oliveira who launched the original lawsuit but handed off the case to Porto and colleagues when it was moved from Campos de Goytacazes to Rio de Janeiro in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this sends a message that you can pollute and then escape a conviction by just paying a fine, I don't think that's right," he said in a telephone interview on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, Transocean and 17 of their employees also face criminal charges that carry jail terms of up to 31 years in the largest environmental prosecution in Brazil's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That case has also been shifted to Rio de Janeiro and will be handled by Porto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OUTPUT EXPECTED TO RESUME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While smaller than the fines originally requested by Oliveira, Chevron's Williamson said the value of the proposed settlement is well above what other such cases would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the amounts paid to settle lawsuits in the 750,000-barrel Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989 and the 5-million-barrel 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster the Gulf of Mexico, Chevron lawyers determined that 30 million reais would be a reasonable amount for its 3,600 barrel spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron and the ANP proposed paying 90 million reais, or triple its baseline estimate, for environmental damages, Porto said. The rest of the settlement's cost would be to pay for equipment and measures to prevent future spills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate regulatory case, the ANP is wrapping up its investigation of the spill by checking if Chevron has taken the necessary steps to correct problems, said Raphael Moura, operational security superintendent of the ANP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If inspections of the installations in the Frade field are satisfactory, Chevron could be given the go ahead to restart production within two months, Moura said after the hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'd be ready to ramp up production almost immediately," Williamson said. He added that permission to drill new wells or restart water injection to boost output would require additional regulatory clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one was hurt in the Frade accident. No oil reached shore, and there was no discernable environmental damage, according to the ANP. Nor was there any measurable harm to marine animals, Chevron lawyers said at the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon cases thousands of seabirds and other animals such as whales and turtles were killed and fishing grounds were polluted and disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleven were killed and 17 injured in the fire on BP Plc's (BP.L) Deepwater Horizon drilling rig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 15, BP agreed to pay a record $4.5 billion in penalties and plead guilty to criminal misconduct charges in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jeb Blount; Edited by Brad Haynes and Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

      company's solid financial profile and strong credit metrics. On a pro 
      forma basis, Fitch estimates a total debt to EBITDA of around 1.1x and a 
      net debt to EBITDA close to 0.7x.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The structure of the transaction contemplates a call option for KOF to 
      acquire the remaining 49% equity interest at any time during the 
      following seven years, and also includes a put option for KOF to sell 
      back the 51% equity stake to KO during the sixth year. KOF will have 
      full control of the day-to-day operations of CCBP and will account its 
      results under the equity method.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Fitch's opinion this transaction is consistent with KOF's growth 
      strategy to enter into new geographies with attractive economic growth 
      prospects and share similar demographic and cultural characteristics 
      with its Latin American territories.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The KOF's ratings reflect the company's substantial free cash flow 
      generation, solid financial position, ample financial flexibility and 
      strong business profile. The foreign currency IDR is rated above 
      Mexico's country ceiling of 'A-', the country where the company is 
      domiciled, given that transfer and convertibility risks are mitigated by 
      the company's strategic relationship with The Coca-Cola Company (KO, 
      rated 'A+'/Stable) and the explicit and implicit financial support KOF 
      has received from KO; in addition the ratings consider the geographical 
      diversification of the EBITDA generated outside Mexico, as well as its 
      strong credit profile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF's ratings are underpinned by its solid business position as the 
      largest bottler in the world of Coca-Cola products with operations 
      across Latin America. Despite the strong competition present in the 
      industry, the company's profitability margins are among the highest in 
      the business, driven by excellent product segmentation, superior 
      execution at the point of sale and appropriate pricing architecture for 
      its broad portfolio of products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company's diverse revenue stream from its bottling operations 
      outside Mexico, provides with cash flow and currency diversification. 
      Fitch believes that a geographical diversified revenue stream lowers 
      business risks and cash flow volatility. For the latest 12 months (LTM) 
      ended Sept. 30, 2012, Fitch estimates that operations from South 
      American accounted around 61% of total volume, 55% of total sales and 
      53% of EBITDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's long term expectation is that KOF's credit metrics remain solid. 
      For the latest 12 months (LTM) ended Sept. 30, 2012, the company's total 
      debt to EBITDA and net debt to EBITDA were 0.8x and 0.4x, respectively, 
      while EBITDA to gross interest expenses was 14.3x. For this period the 
      total amount of debt was MXN20.6 billion out of which 52% corresponded 
      to debt issued in the capital markets and 48% to bank loans. KOF's debt 
      exposure to currency risk is mitigated by maintaining a net dollar debt 
      exposure below USD 700 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF has ample liquidity. As of Sept. 30, 2012, the company had MXN11.1 
      billion of cash and marketable securities and annual free cash flow 
      generation (FCF) of around MXN3 billion. This compares favorably with 
      short term maturities of approximately MXN5 billion in 2013, considering 
      the amount due from the transaction of Philippines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF's operative performance continued with sales and volume growth due 
      to acquisitions and organic growth, while profitability was impacted 
      mainly by higher sweetener costs and increased operating expenses. The 
      company's LTM net revenues at Sep. 30, 2012 were MXN144 billion which 
      represented an increase of 25% as compared to the same period of 2011. 
      The LTM EBITDA margin at Sept. 30, 2010 was 18% against 20% for the same 
      period of 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      What could trigger a rating action?
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Downward movements in the ratings could be triggered by a change in the 
      company's long term capital structure. Negative rating actions could 
      also result from a sustained deterioration of its free cash flow 
      generation, driven by operating pressures or an adverse economic 
      climate, or a lack of support from KO.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  CALGARY, ALBERTA, Dec 14 (MARKET WIRE) --
Celtic Exploration Ltd. ("Celtic") (TSX:CLT) announced today that holders
("Shareholders") of common shares of Celtic ("Celtic Shares") and holders
("Debentureholders") of 5.00% convertible unsecured subordinated
debentures of Celtic due April 30, 2017 ("Debentures") have each approved
the special resolution relating to the proposed acquisition of Celtic by
ExxonMobil Celtic ULC (the "Purchaser"), an indirect subsidiary of Exxon
Mobil Corporation, pursuant to a plan of arrangement under the Business
Corporations Act (Alberta) (the "Arrangement").

    The Arrangement was approved by approximately 99.82% of the votes cast by
Shareholders and by holders of 71.81% of the aggregate principal amount
of Debentures (of which 100% were voted in favour of the Arrangement) at
the special meeting of Shareholders and Debentureholders held earlier
today (the "Meeting"). The final order in respect of the Arrangement was
also granted today by the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta. 

    At the Meeting, Shareholders also approved ordinary resolutions
approving: (i) a stock option plan for Kelt Exploration Ltd. ("Kelt") to
be effective upon completion of the Arrangement; (ii) a restricted share
unit plan for Kelt to be effective upon completion of the Arrangement;
and (iii) the private placement of up to 6,000,000 common shares of Kelt
("Kelt Shares") at a subscription price equal to the estimated net asset
value of Kelt on a per share basis following completion of the
Arrangement, of C$2.32 per Kelt Share, for aggregate gross proceeds of
approximately C$13.9 million (the "Private Placement"). The Private
Placement is expected to close immediately following completion of the
Arrangement.

    The closing of the Arrangement remains subject to the receipt of the
approval of the Arrangement under the Investment Canada Act (the
"Investment Canada Approval") and the satisfaction or waiver of the other
conditions specified in the arrangement agreement between Celtic,
ExxonMobil Canada Ltd., the Purchaser and Kelt entered into on October
16, 2012 (the "Arrangement Agreement"). A "no action" letter confirming
that the Commissioner of Competition does not intend to make an
application to the Competition Tribunal under section 92 of the
Competition Act (Canada) (the "Competition Act") in respect of the
Arrangement has been received and accordingly, no further approval is
required under the Competition Act.

concerning the ability to obtain the Investment Canada Approval; the
ability of the parties to satisfy the other conditions to the closing of

contemplated; the completion of the Private Placement as currently
contemplated; and the business, properties and management of Kelt upon

expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements and
information are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed
on the forward-looking statements and information because there can be no
assurance that they will prove to be correct.

    Since forward-looking statements and information address future events
and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and
uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those
currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These
include, but are not limited to: the risk that the Arrangement may not
close when planned or at all or on the terms and conditions set forth in
the Arrangement Agreement; the failure to obtain the necessary Investment

    Cautionary Statement on BOEs

    Where amounts are expressed on a barrel of oil equivalent ("BOE") basis,
natural gas volumes have been converted to oil equivalence at six
thousand cubic feet per barrel and sulphur volumes have been converted to
oil equivalence at 0.6 long tons per barrel. The term BOE may be
misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of
six thousand cubic feet per barrel is based on an energy equivalency
conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not
represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. 

    This release does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation
of an offer to sell any security, or a solicitation of votes with respect
to any security.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 14 - Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following ratings for Coca-Cola
Femsa S.A.B. de C.V. (KOF):

--Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A';
--Local Currency IDR at 'A';
--National Scale Long Term Rating at 'AAA(mex)';
--National Scale Short Term Rating at 'F1+(mex)';
--Senior Notes for USD500 million at 'A'.

The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Philippines Acquisition Credit Neutral

KOF's ratings incorporate the acquisition of 51% equity interest in the
operations of Coca-Cola Bottling Philippines Inc. (CCBPI) owned by KO. The total
value of the transaction was USD688.5 million and will be financed with short-
and medium-term bank loans of USD700 million. Fitch considers that the debt
funded transaction is manageable given the company's solid financial profile and
strong credit metrics. On a pro forma basis, Fitch estimates a total debt to
EBITDA of around 1.1x and a net debt to EBITDA close to 0.7x.

The structure of the transaction contemplates a call option for KOF to acquire
the remaining 49% equity interest at any time during the following seven years,
and also includes a put option for KOF to sell back the 51% equity stake to KO
during the sixth year. KOF will have full control of the day-to-day operations
of CCBP and will account its results under the equity method.

In Fitch's opinion this transaction is consistent with KOF's growth strategy to
enter into new geographies with attractive economic growth prospects and share
similar demographic and cultural characteristics with its Latin American
territories.

The KOF's ratings reflect the company's substantial free cash flow generation,
solid financial position, ample financial flexibility and strong business
profile. The foreign currency IDR is rated above Mexico's country ceiling of
'A-', the country where the company is domiciled, given that transfer and
convertibility risks are mitigated by the company's strategic relationship with
The Coca-Cola Company (KO, rated 'A+'/Stable) and the explicit and implicit
financial support KOF has received from KO; in addition the ratings consider the
geographical diversification of the EBITDA generated outside Mexico, as well as
its strong credit profile.

KOF's ratings are underpinned by its solid business position as the largest
bottler in the world of Coca-Cola products with operations across Latin America.
Despite the strong competition present in the industry, the company's
profitability margins are among the highest in the business, driven by excellent
product segmentation, superior execution at the point of sale and appropriate
pricing architecture for its broad portfolio of products.

The company's diverse revenue stream from its bottling operations outside
Mexico, provides with cash flow and currency diversification. Fitch believes
that a geographical diversified revenue stream lowers business risks and cash
flow volatility. For the latest 12 months (LTM) ended Sept. 30, 2012, Fitch
estimates that operations from South American accounted around 61% of total
volume, 55% of total sales and 53% of EBITDA.

Fitch's long term expectation is that KOF's credit metrics remain solid. For the
latest 12 months (LTM) ended Sept. 30, 2012, the company's total debt to EBITDA
and net debt to EBITDA were 0.8x and 0.4x, respectively, while EBITDA to gross
interest expenses was 14.3x. For this period the total amount of debt was
MXN20.6 billion out of which 52% corresponded to debt issued in the capital
markets and 48% to bank loans. KOF's debt exposure to currency risk is mitigated
by maintaining a net dollar debt exposure below USD 700 million.

KOF has ample liquidity. As of Sept. 30, 2012, the company had MXN11.1 billion
of cash and marketable securities and annual free cash flow generation (FCF) of
around MXN3 billion. This compares favorably with short term maturities of
approximately MXN5 billion in 2013, considering the amount due from the
transaction of Philippines.

KOF's operative performance continued with sales and volume growth due to
acquisitions and organic growth, while profitability was impacted mainly by
higher sweetener costs and increased operating expenses. The company's LTM net
revenues at Sep. 30, 2012 were MXN144 billion which represented an increase of
25% as compared to the same period of 2011. The LTM EBITDA margin at Sept. 30,
2010 was 18% against 20% for the same period of 2011.

What could trigger a rating action?

Downward movements in the ratings could be triggered by a change in the
company's long term capital structure. Negative rating actions could also result
from a sustained deterioration of its free cash flow generation, driven by
operating pressures or an adverse economic climate, or a lack of support from
KO.

Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. The ratings above
were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore, Fitch has been
compensated for the provision of the ratings.

&lt;p&gt;* Federal prosecutor expects settlement before Christmas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Chevron says willing to pay damages, prevention costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jeb Blount&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp 
would be willing to pay about 300 million reais ($150 million)
to settle lawsuits in Brazil over an offshore oil spill last
year, a senior executive and a federal prosecutor said on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks over a possible settlement reinforce expectations
of a swift resolution for Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. oil company,
and its drilling contractor Transocean Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We could have an agreement before Christmas," Gisele Porto,
the prosecutor responsible for the case, said after a public
hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she is drafting a settlement for a total of 311
million reais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies face up to $20 billion in damages and some of
their executives face jail terms of up to 31 years in the
largest environmental prosecution in Brazil's history. Porto
said a judge is unlikely to accept the steep fines sought by the
prosecutor who first filed the charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courts have also overturned drilling bans against Chevron
and Transocean in recent months, allowing the companies to
resume operations in Brazil, home to some of the world's largest
offshore oil discoveries of the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using settlements following larger spills in the United
States like the Exxon Valdez and the Deepwater Horizon disaster
in the Gulf of Mexico as a benchmark, Chevron lawyers calculated
environmental damages of 30 million reais would be reasonable in
the Brazil case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron would be willing to pay three times that in damages,
said Rafael Jaen Williamson, director of corporate affairs in
Brazil, along with other measures to prevent future spills,
bringing the cost of a settlement to around 300 million reais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors initially sought far larger penalties for the
3,600-barrel spill in the Frade Field northeast of Rio de
Janeiro in November 2011, although the spill was far less severe
than other recent offshore accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one was hurt in the Frade accident. No oil reached shore,
and there was no discernable environmental damage, according to
Brazil's petroleum regulator, the ANP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 5 million barrels of oil were spilled in the 2010
Deepwater Horizon disaster in BP Plc's Macondo field.
Eleven people died in the accident, and beaches and fishing
grounds were polluted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 15, BP agreed to pay a record $4.5 billion in
penalties and plead guilty to criminal misconduct charges in the
United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India and Pakistan sealed an agreement to ease tough visa restrictions for travelers on Friday as the nuclear-armed neighbors move slowly to rebuild relations that soured in 2008 when Pakistani militants attacked India's financial capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord was signed by India's home minister and his Pakistani counterpart, weeks before the two cricket-loving nations play their first series in India since the attacks that killed 166 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not only historic but this is a step forward for the two countries in the progress of peace," said Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik during a three-day visit to New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the previous arrangement, Pakistani business travelers were restricted to certain cities, prohibiting their travel from Delhi to the nearby thriving business hub of Gurgaon without permission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businessmen had to report to Indian police stations in the evenings "like a criminal", Pakistani trade official Zafar Mahmood complained in April during a Pakistani trade fair in New Delhi. Indians visiting Pakistan face similar restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change will permit visitors to travel to five places now instead of three and some businessmen will get multiple-entry visas, exempting them from reporting to the police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite thousands of years of shared heritage, India and Pakistan have tense relations - a legacy of three wars since their independence from Britain in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two governments agreed to relax visa rules in principle in September, when former Indian foreign minister SM Krishna visited Islamabad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is likely to issue up to 3,000 multi-city visas to Pakistani cricket fans and an additional 300 to VIPs for the cricket series that starts on Christmas day, allowing Pakistanis to cheer on their national team on Indian turf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a baby step towards reducing the tensions between India and Pakistan," said Ashok Mehta, a former major general of the Indian army. "But it's still significant, especially because nothing is happening on big-ticket items like border management and terrorism - the real ice-breakers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malik promised India that Pakistan would convict those responsible for the 2008 attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I assure the Indian authorities that we will not leave any stone unturned and the day is not far when you will see the conviction and you will see the justice done," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Tom Pfeiffer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - The head of Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) mergers and acquisition business denied that he had any role in the 2000 sale of voice recognition software company Dragon Systems to a buyer that collapsed soon afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragon's founders have sued Goldman, accusing the Wall Street bank of failing them by advising them to pursue the $580 million all-stock sale to Lernout &amp; Haupsie shortly before the Belgian software company went bankrupt in an accounting scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene Sykes, who has spent his entire banking career at Goldman and now runs its M business, denied in video testimony played in U.S. District Court in Boston on Friday that he had worked on that deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am pretty certain I had no involvement, but I also was involved in many transactions and had a lot of people involved in a lot of transactions," Sykes said in a video deposition recorded in December 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sykes has spent most of his career in Goldman's M operation, during the time of the Dragon deal, he was working at its principal investment area, the department that invests the company's own money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janet and James Baker, who founded Dragon and owned 51 percent of it, said they had lost their life's work after they sold the company. They had only sold a few million dollars worth of the stock they had received before L's collapse wiped out the value of their remaining shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bakers and two other early Dragon employees have sued Goldman for several hundred million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman lawyers have argued that the Bakers hired the bank to structure a deal with L, not to investigate it for accounting fraud. They have said that Goldman advised Dragon to hire an accountant to analyze the buyer's stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman denied civil claims that include gross negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. The jury trial, which began on Monday, is expected to last two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TECH BUBBLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, and L's collapse, came around the end of the technology stock bubble of the late 1990s, a time when investors had been eagerly chasing new and sometimes poorly managed Internet companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sykes, who today has a seat on Goldman's powerful 28-member management committee, said he had been unaware of the specifics of L's collapse prior to being called to testify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't recall that I ever became aware of it independently of hearing that I was going to be deposed in this case," Sykes said, adding that he knew the name was "a newsworthy item at some point years ago" but had not recalled specifics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dressed in a tie and white shirt, with his jacket over the back of his chair, Sykes said his role was to advise clients and negotiate deals, but that clients make their own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I make sure I try to give them the right advice so that they can make good decisions about the various options they have," Sykes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the four Goldman bankers who advised Dragon on the deal said in early court testimony that he had reported to Sykes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's reputation has been tarnished in recent years by allegations that the company has treated clients shabbily.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - The American wife of one of Britain's richest men, whose body lay rotting at their London home for two months after her death, died from cocaine abuse, a coroner said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eva Rausing, whose husband Hans is heir to a fortune from the Swedish packaging firm Tetra Pak, was found in July in an advanced state of decomposition under layers of clothes and bin liners in a fly-infested room on the second floor of their six-storey townhouse in an upmarket area of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 48-year-old's body was only discovered after police officers went to their house after stopping her husband for driving erratically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was found with a silver foil in her hand which had been rolled up as a pipe, indicating it had been used for smoking cocaine. A post-mortem established that she had died more than two months earlier in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deputy coroner Shirley Radcliffe ruled that Rausing, who suffered from the heart condition tricuspid valve disease and had had a pacemaker fitted, had died from cocaine intoxication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hans Rausing, who was given a suspended 10-month jail sentence in August for preventing the "lawful and decent" burial of his wife, said he had not been able to deal with losing her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm devastated by my beloved wife's death," he said in a statement read to Westminster Coroners' Court. "I could not cope with her dying or confront the reality of her death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said how he had been in the bathroom shaving when he heard her slide off the bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She landed sideways and her head was resting on a pillow. I tried to pull her up. I shouted 'Eva, Eva, Eva'," he said, before covering her body with duvets and bedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple, who have four children, had a long history of problems with drugs. They first met at a U.S. rehabilitation center and gave generously to addiction treatment centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eva Rausing's family have said they believed she turned to drugs in her late teens to overcome acute shyness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swedish Rausing family made a fortune by building up the Tetra Pak drinks packaging business, but Hans's father sold his share of it to his brother in the 1990s, and is now worth an estimated $10 billion, according to Forbes magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Michael Holden.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 14 (Reuters) - Mexico's Coca-Cola FEMSA SAB de CV
, the world's largest coke bottler, will buy a 51
percent stake in Coca-Cola Co's Philippine bottling
operations for $688.5 million in cash to expand its presence in
the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal may signal more Asian acquisitions for Coca-Cola
FEMSA, a joint venture of Coca-Cola Co and Mexican retailer and
beverage company Femsa, as Latin America offers
little room for expansion, the company said in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market in Philippines represents the expansion of our
global footprint beyond Latin America, reinforcing our exposure
to fast growing economies," Carlos Salazar Lomelin, Coca Cola
FEMSA chief executive officer, said in a statement, adding the
Southeast Asian country had healthy growth prospects and a
dynamic consumption profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently Coca Cola FEMSA operates in Mexico, Central
America, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca Cola FEMSA will have the option to acquire the
remaining 49 percent of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc
(CCBPI) at any time during the seven years following the closing
of the deal, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola FEMSA said in February that it was considering a
controlling stake in CCBPI and had signed an agreement with U.S.
beverage giant Coke giving it the first chance to make a deal
for the Asian bottler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October the company said it expected to close the deal by
the end of the year, after the acquisitions of local rivals
Grupo Tampico, Grupo CIMSA and Grupo Fomento Queretano, led to a
20 percent jump in third-quarter revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Philippines operation has 23 production plants and is
expected to sell about 530 million unit cases of beverages in
2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Bottlers Philippines, Inc. (CCBPI) for an amount of US$688.5 million in
an all-cash transaction.

multiple of approximately 13.5 times. As part of the agreement, Coca-Cola
FEMSA will have an option to acquire the remaining 49% of CCBPI at any
time during the seven years following the closing and will have a put
option to sell its ownership to The Coca-Cola Company any time during
year six. The transaction is expected to close in early 2013.

bottling footprint beyond Latin America, reinforcing its exposure to fast
growing economies and its commitment to The Coca-Cola System. The
Philippines has one of the highest per capita consumption rates of
Coca-Cola products in the region and presents significant opportunities
for further growth. Coca-Cola FEMSA believes that by leveraging its
proven expertise and operating capabilities in an economy with vibrant
growth prospects and an attractive socio-economic and demographic profile
it will be capable to capture the opportunities and further improve the
bottler's operations and financial results.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Dec 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and
Google Inc's Motorola phone unit remain millions of
dollars apart in their respective valuations of video and wi-fi
patents at issue in a pivotal case before a federal judge in
Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome, expected sometime next year, could be a key 
development in the balance of power between Microsoft and Google
- and the rest of the technology industry - in the running
battle over ownership of the technology underlying increasingly
popular smartphones, tablets and game consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trial, held Nov. 13-20 in the Western District of
Washington federal court, was designed to settle the matter of
how much Microsoft must pay Motorola for use of two of its
standard, essential patents used in its Xbox game console and
other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In redacted post-trial filings made public on Monday -
essentially its final arguments before the judge - Microsoft
argued that it should pay no more than $502,000 per year for
Motorola's H.264 video compression patent, and no more than
$736,000 per year for Motorola's 802.11 wi-fi technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola - acquired by Google earlier this year, partly for
its valuable patent portfolio - submitted a far larger
valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its filing, also made public in redacted form on Monday,
Motorola said it was due payment of 2.25 percent of the selling
price of Microsoft products such as the Xbox and Windows 7
operating system that use the patents in question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola argued that a fair cross-licensing deal would
result in net payments to Motorola which it would be willing to
cap somewhere between $100 million and $125 million per year, 
solely for the H.264 patent portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 802.11 patents, it claimed a net payment of 1.15
percent to 1.73 percent of Microsoft end-product prices, which
would mean millions of dollars more per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Robart is expected to rule on the
case early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case in U.S. District Court, Western District of
Washington, is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc., 10-cv-1823.&lt;/p&gt;

Described by some as "the experience of a lifetime," each telenovela fan enjoyed
a vacation for five to Universal Studios Hollywood to receive star treatment
with the "VIP Experience" - an exclusive behind-the-scenes guided tour of a
working movie studio including front of the line access for all theme park
rides, shows and attractions. 

"The weekend was just incredible. From the first day, we were treated like
superstars," said Ana Brown, 31, winner from San Antonio. "It was so great to be
able to meet two telenovela stars that are currently acting in one of my
favorite novelas. I had to remind myself that they weren`t the characters
themselves, but the talented actors that bring them to life." 

In partnership with Univision Communications Inc, the leading media company
serving Hispanic America, the seven winners were selected from a combination of
local radio promotions and an online sweepstakes through Univision.com. Another
opportunity to win came from a joint promotion with Family Dollar-- all part of
the year-long Coca-Cola Telenovela Club program. The winners experienced an
incredible weekend alongside two of Hispanic-America`s biggest novela actors,
Jaime Camil and Patricia Navidad, stars of the hit Univision Network series "Por
Ella Soy Eva" (For Her, I`m Eva), a family-oriented novela produced by Televisa.


"For more than 100 years, Coca-Cola has been part of the celebrations shared by
Hispanic families. From bautizos to quincea&#241;eras to our kids` sports victories
to graduation and treasured family vacations, Coke has always been there to
refresh dreams, bring people together and help create new family memories," said
Al Rondon, Senior Brand Manager, Hispanic Marketing, Coca-Cola North America. 

"We are thrilled to partner with Coca-Cola to give our fans a one-of-a-kind
experience with the stars of the hit novela `Por Ella Soy Eva,`" said Rick
Alessandri, executive vice president, Enterprise Development, Univision
Communications Inc. "This is a way to bring fans even closer to the stars they
come to love every day on Univision." 

"We are pleased to bring our novelas to Hispanic families with Coca-Cola, our
partner for many years. With Coke we can give fans the opportunity to make their
dreams come true through the magic world of novelas" said Maca Rotter, executive
director, Televisa Consumer Products. 

The winning families from San Antonio, TX, Merced, CA, San Jose, CA and
Wolverine, MI, received airfare, hotel accommodations and tickets to Universal
Studios Hollywood, the theme park known for its thrilling rides, including the
latest blockbuster attraction, "Transformers: The Ride-3D, and the world-famous
studio tour of the working movie studio. They were joined by local winners from
Bakersfield, CA and San Diego, CA and also received $500 in spending money plus
a personal meet-and-greet with telenovela superstars Camil and Navidad during a
gala hosted by Coca-Cola. 

"The Coca-Cola Telenovela Club provided us with the opportunity to meet with
some of our most loyal fans who not only enjoy our work, but also embrace the
telenovela world," said Camil.

cutter on the beet and apply pressure until the cutter reaches the table top
surface. Remove cylindrical cut beet from the cutter and submerge in chopped
cranberries. Marinate the beet overnight, allowing the cranberries to paint the
beets surface. Remove from the cranberries and rinse before slicing in &#188; inch
discs. Just before serving add a &#189; teaspoon of the marmalade. Serve on your
favorite crackers. 

Artisan Cheese Stuffed Mini Craisins Brioche

Ingredients:
2 (8-ounce) round packages Brie cheese, slightly softened, each cut into 8 pie
wedges; set aside 

Brioche
2 eggs, slightly beaten
&#189; cup milk, heated to about 120 F.
&#189; cup unsalted butter, melted
1/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon Kosher salt
3 cups high gluten flour (bread flour)
5 teaspoons dry active yeast
1 cup Ocean Spray Craisins 

Apple Chutney
1 cup peeled, cored, chopped tart apple (1 large)
&#188; cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 &#189; teaspoons fresh minced ginger root
1 &#189; teaspoons freshly grated orange zest
&#188; teaspoon ground allspice 

Directions:
In large mixing bowl, using dough hook, place eggs, milk, butter, sugar, and
salt; mix well. 

In separate large bowl stir together flour and yeast. Add flour mixture to egg
mixture and mix on low speed until well mixed (1 minute). Scrape bowl, turn to
medium high speed and continue mixing, scraping bowl occasionally, until dough
is slightly shiny and slightly sticky (about 5 minutes). 

Add Craisins; mix on low speed just until Craisins are mixed into dough (1
minute). 

Place dough in buttered large bowl; cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until
dough is double in size (about 1 &#189; to 2 hours). 

Punch down dough and divide into 16 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball. (If
desired, pull off about 1/3 of each ball and form into a smaller ball, then
pinch onto top of each larger ball.) 

Place each ball into greased muffin tin or brioche pan. 

Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until nearly double in size (about 45 to 60
minutes). 

Meanwhile, heat oven to 400 F. Place a cookie sheet in oven to heat while oven
is on. 

Once brioche balls have risen, place muffin tins or brioche pans on top of hot
cookie sheet. Bake for 13 to 17 minutes or until tops are golden brown. Remove
from oven; remove brioche from tins or pans; let cool. 

Meanwhile, in 2-quart saucepan, place all chutney ingredients. Cook over medium
heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture comes to a boil (2 to 3 minutes). 

Cover; continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until apples have softened (18
to 20 minutes). Remove cover; continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until
excess moisture has evaporated. Cool. 

Serve by cutting into each brioche &#190; way through. Place a 1-ounce wedge of Brie
in each Brioche and about 1 tablespoon chutney. 

Refrigerate leftovers. 

Makes 16 servings.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Walton Yellowhead Development Corporation to Borrow up to $1,000,000 
      from Walton Affiliate
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Yellowhead Development Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) 
      announced that its board of directors has approved the Corporation 
      entering into a loan agreement (the "Loan") with a company 
      affiliated with Walton Global Investments Ltd. ("Walton Global"), 
      to borrow funds to cover construction costs that are expected to be 
      incurred prior to entering into a Servicing Agreement with the City of 
      Edmonton.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation will borrow $1 million from an affiliate of Walton 
      Global at an annual interest rate of 8.0%, which the Corporation will 
      use to fund construction costs and other working capital needs until 
      March 31, 2013. At that time it is anticipated that the Corporation will 
      be able to draw on the construction loan that the Corporation currently 
      has in place for Phase 1 construction of the Yellowhead Property (the "Construction 
      Loan").
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Loan will be a demand loan secured by, among other things, a second 
      mortgage on the Corporation&#8217;s property, and is estimated to be fully 
      repaid from the proceeds of the first draw on the Construction Loan. If 
      for some reason it cannot be paid from the Construction Loan or from 
      third-party lot sales by September 2013, the maturity date of the Loan 
      is 36 months, with the ability of the Corporation, to extend the 
      maturity date by an additional 36 months. The Loan may be repaid by the 
      Corporation prior to the due date without bonus or penalty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The milestones for Phase 1 for the Yellowhead Project are behind the 
      timelines disclosed in the Prospectus. These delays resulted from an 
      unanticipated amendment in the Winterburn Industrial Area Master Plan 
      servicing design by the City of Edmonton (&#8220;City&#8221;), a longer than 
      anticipated time to obtain subdivision comments from the City, and 
      unfavourable weather conditions during 2012. These events resulted in 
      deferring the execution of the proposed Servicing Agreement with the 
      City, which is a condition to drawing on the Construction Loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Notwithstanding these delays, the Corporation anticipates that it will 
      be able to complete the overall project within the approximate 
      three-year time frame and achieve the net internal rate of return (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) 
      of 13% disclosed in the Prospectus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation&#8217;s development manager, Walton Development and Management 
      L.P. (&#8220;WDM&#8221;), proposed a servicing solution which has been 
      accepted by the City. WDM has also provided alternative designs for 
      offsite roadways to the City so that final subdivision comments can be 
      obtained. These actions will allow WDM to submit the detailed 
      engineering drawings to the City, and request preparation of the 
      Servicing Agreement which, when approved by the City, will allow the 
      Corporation to commence underground utility construction activities for 
      the Yellowhead Property.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation has signed letters of interest for 43 of the 100 acres 
      in Phase 1 of the development, which satisfies the pre-sale condition to 
      draw on the Construction Loan. Draws on the Construction Loan cannot 
      occur until the Servicing Agreement is in place. Once the Servicing 
      Agreement with the City is entered into, proceeds from the Construction 
      Loan will be used to repay the Loan. The Servicing Agreement is expected 
      to be entered into by March 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Loan is a "related-party transaction" under Canadian Securities 
      Regulators Multilateral Instrument 61-101 ("MI 61-101"). The 
      Corporation is exempt from the formal valuation requirements contained 
      in MI 61-101 pursuant to Section 5.5(b) thereof because its securities 
      are not listed on a stock exchange. The Corporation is exempt from the 
      minority approval requirements contained in MI 61-101 because the board 
      of directors of the Corporation has determined that, pursuant to Section 
      5.7(1)(f) of MI 61-101, the Loan is on reasonable commercial terms that 
      are not less advantageous to the Corporation than if the Loan were 
      obtained from a party dealing at arm's length with the Corporation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched in 2011, the Corporation owns a two-phase, 131.4 acres 
      industrial development in northwest Edmonton, Alberta, within the 
      Winterburn Industrial area.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P. and the 
      development of the property is managed by WDM, both of which are members 
      of the Walton Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walton Group is a multinational group of real estate investment and 
      development companies headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. 
      Walton&#8217;s expertise is the research, acquisition, management and 
      development of strategically located land in major North American growth 
      corridors. With more than 70,000 acres of land under management, the 
      Walton Group is one of North America&#8217;s premier land asset managers.

      Edmonton and Calgary.

&lt;p&gt;By Aruna Viswanatha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dec 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. credit union regulator sued
JPMorgan Securities and Bear Stearns &amp; Co on Monday over $3.6

&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group led by Marcelo Aguiar said in a
report on Monday that potential sales of non-core assets at
mining giant Vale SA expected for next year "would be
one of the key drivers to improve the company's returns."
Aguiar, who cited in his report a newspaper interview with Vale
Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira, said the world's
largest iron ore producer could announce the sale of two assets
in the oil and gas sector in the coming weeks and a strategic
partnership that could take a stake between 30 percent and 50
percent in the company's logistic business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We would view asset divestitures as a source of funds to
raise the company's dividend outlook," Aguiar said, adding that
$0.56 dividend per share excluding sales of non-core assets.
Goldman has a "buy" recommendation on Vale's U.S.-traded shares,

			Walton Big Lake Issues Second Cash Distribution to Investors and 
      Consolidates Units
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Big Lake Development L.P. (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;) and its 
      general partner, Walton Big Lake Development Corporation (the &#8220;General 
      Partner&#8220;), announce that the second cash distribution to investors 
      in the Partnership was issued on December 14, 2012, on the outstanding 
      limited partnership units of the Partnership (the &#8220;Units&#8221;) in the 
      amount of $2.29 per Unit. The distribution was made to Unitholders of 
      record as of the close of business on December 5, 2012. This 
      distribution follows a cash distribution of $1.00 per Unit made in 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The distribution amount of $2.29 per Unit includes $2.00 of capital and 
      $0.29 of income. The $0.29 amount does not represent the taxable 
      income per Unit because that will not be calculated until after the 
      Partnership&#8217;s year-end of December 31. The total $2.29 distribution will 
      reduce the adjusted cost base of each Unit for income tax purposes and 
      the taxable income, when it is known and calculated at the end of the 
      year, will increase the adjusted cost base of each Unit for income tax 
      purposes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pursuant to the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement of the 
      Partnership, immediately after the distribution, the Units were 
      consolidated automatically such that each Unit prior to the distribution 
      will become 0.8005 of a Unit after the distribution, resulting in a 
      total of 1,680,124 Units outstanding. Replacement certificates will not 
      be issued by the Partnership to reflect this consolidation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Overall, the Partnership anticipates that it will be able to complete 
      the project within the approximate five-year time frame and achieve an 
      internal rate of return of 13.5%, as disclosed in the Partnership&#8217;s 
      prospectus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each partner who is a Unitholder of record at the year-end of the 
      Partnership will receive by mail in March 2013 a T5013 from the 
      Partnership, the Partnership&#8217;s transfer agent or the Unitholder&#8217;s 
      brokerage firm. The T5013 will indicate the amount and nature of the 
      taxable income that the Unitholder is responsible to report.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership was established in September 2010 to allow limited 
      partners to participate in the development of the Big Lake Property 
      comprising 136.5 acres of land in Edmonton, Alberta. Marketed under the 
      name &#8220;Hawks Ridge at Big Lake,&#8221; the property is a three-phase 
      residential development located in northwest Edmonton.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P. and 
      development of the Property is managed by Walton Development and 
      Management L.P., both of which are members of the Walton Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walton Group is a multinational group of real estate investment and 
      development companies headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. 
      Walton&#8217;s expertise is the research, acquisition, management and 
      development of strategically located land in major North American growth 
      corridors. With more than 70,000 acres of land under management, the 
      Walton Group is one of North America&#8217;s premier land asset managers. 
      Walton manages and/or owns land assets in Phoenix, Austin, Dallas, 
      Atlanta, Charlotte, the Washington, D.C. region, Ottawa, Toronto, 
      Edmonton and Calgary.

			Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today that its affiliate, 
      ExxonMobil Exploration and Production South Africa Limited, will soon 
      begin exploration activities offshore South Africa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ExxonMobil affiliate signed an agreement with Impact Africa Limited 
      (Impact), a subsidiary of Impact Oil  Gas Limited, to acquire a 75 
      percent participating interest in the Tugela South Exploration Right and 
      will become operator. Under the agreement, the affiliate also has the 
      right to acquire 75 percent participating interests in future 
      exploration rights in three offshore areas covered by technical 
      cooperation permits currently held by Impact. These exploration rights 
      and the affiliate&#8217;s participating interest in them are subject to South 
      African government approval.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Tugela South Exploration Right covers approximately 2.8 million 
      acres offshore Durban on the east coast of South Africa with water 
      depths extending from the coastline to approximately 6,500 feet. The 
      future exploration rights cover an additional 16 million acres offshore 
      with water depths extending from the coastline to approximately 9,800 
      feet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Separately, the ExxonMobil affiliate also has executed a technical 
      cooperation permit with the South African government to study the 
      hydrocarbon potential of the Deepwater Durban Basin covering 
      approximately 12.4 million acres offshore Durban. A technical 
      cooperation permit is an exclusive right to study an area for one year. 
      The ExxonMobil affiliate can apply to the South African government for 
      an exploration right if it chooses to explore this area further.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We look forward to working with Impact and the South African government 
      to explore for oil and gas in this new area for ExxonMobil,&#8221; said 
      Stephen M. Greenlee, president of ExxonMobil Exploration Company. &#8220;We 
      believe South Africa has significant potential and we will continue to 
      look for additional opportunities there.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. regulators have finally approved JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's controversial plan to launch a copper exchange-traded fund backed by actual stockpiles of the metal, dealing a blow to end users who fear the product will wreak havoc on prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ruling ends a two-year effort by the U.S. bank to win regulatory support for its fund, which would effectively allow U.S. retail investors to trade physical copper easily for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also a defeat for consumers of the metal, which is used in plumbing and cooling systems. Since the fund will use physical copper cathode as collateral against shares of the fund, effectively removing a chunk of metal from the market, users fear it will affect supplies and inflate prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, also voiced his opposition to the plan. In July, Levin said the funds would cause a boom-and-bust cycle in the copper market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving its backing for the product, the commission said it did not believe the fund would disrupt the flow of copper for immediate delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission does not believe that the listing and trading of the shares is likely to disrupt the supply of copper available for immediate delivery, which is what (the copper fabricators) predict would increase the price of copper," it said in its ruling dated Friday and posted on its website on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luvata, which makes heat-transfer products such a coil used in air conditioning and refrigeration equipment, was one of five physical copper users that joined forces to fight the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a sad day for industrial users and consumers. The outcome of the report is a nonsense," said Luvata's senior vice president of sourcing Bob Kickham in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling will likely be seen as a benchmark for another ETF, the iShares Copper Trust proposed by BlackRock Inc. The SEC is due to rule on that fund by December 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JURY'S OUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A consortium of U.S. copper fabricators - SouthWire Co, Encore Wire Corp, Luvata and AmRod - as well as Red Kite, a large hedge fund and physical trader, have fought hard to get the SEC to block the JPMorgan and BlackRock funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say the removal of up to 183,000 tonnes of copper, which would be used as collateral against shares in the funds, would have a "devastating" effect on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that is only a tiny part of a 20-million-tonne annual global market, fabricators worry that it accounts for the majority of the metal available in exchange-bonded warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They argue there is not enough metal available outside the exchange networks for immediate delivery to prevent a squeeze in supply because it is tied up in long-term contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-running dispute has divided traditional industrial consumers, which use copper in everything from air-conditioning units to cars, from banks looking to attract investors seeking exposure to the potentially lucrative copper market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and BlackRock say such fears are unfounded because the funds would be miniscule compared with the global market. Emphasis on exchange stocks as a measure of spot metal availability has been overdone, they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ETF would sell investors shares in a fund backed by physical metal as collateral. JPMorgan and BlackRock have said that would make it easier for smaller investors to get exposure to copper prices, which have more than doubled in seven years, lifted by demand from China, the world's biggest copper consumer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's fund would store LME brand-approved copper valued at up to $499,761,150 - equivalent to about 62,000 tonnes based on a copper price of $8,000 per tonne. BlackRock's iShares Copper Trust would use up to 121,200 tonnes of copper as guarantee against shares in its fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two funds would equate to 70 percent of current copper stocks in LME-bonded warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have a quarter of a million tonnes of copper in LME and an ETF that looks as though it will take a sum almost equivalent to the entire LME stocks, you can't tell me it won't have an effect," Luvata's Kickham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some say concerns that the funds will remove a significant chunk of metal from the market may be exaggerated given that a similar fund in Britain has only had limited success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ETF Securities launched a copper fund in October 2010, but it has only amassed investments representing just about 1,950 tonnes of copper worth about $16 million at today's prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The jury's out. We have to see how many people buy this ETF and how much stock will be tied up. It just may flounder because people would rather buy a commodity basket rather than be tied into copper itself," said Ed Meir, metals analyst at brokerage INTL FCStone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Josephine Mason; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Nick Zieminski)&lt;/p&gt;

equivalent to the entire LME stocks, you can't tell me it won't
have an effect," Luvata's Kickham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some say concerns that the funds will remove a significant
chunk of metal from the market may be exaggerated given that a
similar fund in Britain has only had limited success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ETF Securities launched a copper fund in October 2010, but
it has only amassed investments representing just about 1,950
tonnes of copper worth about $16 million at today's prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The jury's out. We have to see how many people buy this ETF
and how much stock will be tied up. It just may flounder because
people would rather buy a commodity basket rather than be tied
into copper itself," said Ed Meir, metals analyst at brokerage
INTL FCStone.&lt;/p&gt;

      8-style applications, user and group accounts, security, networking, 
      client virtualization and advanced configuration. Introduced

      latest chapter in our ongoing success in providing the industry&#8217;s 
      leading learning assets for Microsoft solutions,&#8221; said Dan Young, 
      Director of Live Learning, Skillsoft. &#8220;Microsoft sees Windows 8 as a 
      major milestone in the evolution of Windows and computing on the whole. 
      Enterprises in particular recognize the importance of understanding how 
      Windows 8 should be integrated into their technology roadmaps. Our 
      course incorporates the student feedback from our award-winning 
      Microsoft-based Live Learning courses and applies that to deliver the 
      most thorough and engaging approach to learning how to get the most out 
      of Windows 8. When something as significant as Windows 8 is introduced, 
      organizations need both strategic guidance and expert tactical 
      instruction on how to tackle this opportunity. We&#8217;re confident that our 
      course will help them be successful in this endeavor.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
      MD Medical Group operates in the highly attractive Russian private 
      healthcare service market and has a leading position in high-quality 
      women&#8217;s health and pediatrics. The company manages ten modern healthcare

      bank for MD Medical Group&#8217;s GDR listing. Investors are optimistic about 
      the investment opportunities that exist in Russia due to the country&#8217;s 
      economic growth rate, abundance of natural resources, low debt levels 
      and healthy employment levels. Depositary receipt listings represent a 
      significant opportunity for growing companies to connect with potential 
      new investors.&#8221;

			Is this 1992 or 2013? Microsoft, IBM, RIM Reinvent Themselves for the 
      Social, Collaborative Enterprise
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			harmon.ie CEO sees social/mobile convergence triggering a renaissance 
      for traditional enterprise players
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			harmon.ie,&#174; 
      the social software company, today released 2013 predictions for the enterprise 
      social and mobile industry by CEO and co-founder Yaacov Cohen. Cohen 
      sees social and collaborative processes becoming fully integrated into 
      business workers&#8217; daily habits, as opposed to being individual silos 
      supported by a separate set of tools. Specifically, the proliferation 
      and adoption of Microsoft&#8217;s SharePoint and IBM&#8217;s Connections place these 
      traditional enterprise leaders back in the center of the business with 
      key social collaboration platforms. And RIM&#8217;s re-entry into the 
      enterprise mobile market with BlackBerry Enterprise Server 10 (BES 10) 
      and BlackBerry 10 devices will signal its renaissance as a secure mobile 
      player in the enterprise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Here&#8217;s Cohen&#8217;s rationale. Do you agree we are 
      &#8220;back to the future&#8221; and beyond?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Why RIM?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				The desire for secure mobile &#8211; The explosion of iPad usage is 
        driving an insatiable desire to use the iPad at work. However, data 
        stored on the iPad is at risk if the device is stolen or lost, and 
        Apple doesn&#8217;t have a native solution. But there&#8217;s hope&#8230;
      
			
				The release of BES 10 - With this release, RIM is going back to 
        its roots as the leading secure mobile enterprise solution. Initially 
        it was through secure proprietary devices; this time it is embracing 
        its rivals by securing all mobile devices: iOS, Android and the new 
        Blackberry 10. The strategy of supporting competing devices will not 
        only grow the iPad market, but it will also be the impetus for RIM&#8217;s 
        comeback.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Why Microsoft?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition of Yammer &#8211; &#8220;Microsoft&#8221; and &#8220;cool&#8221; 
        are two words which normally don&#8217;t go together. But with 
        Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition of Yammer, Microsoft is now in the driver&#8217;s 
        seat to deliver the social experience to the millions of Office 
        users. Yammer, combined with other Office products like SharePoint, 
        will make Office social and for the first time combine business 
        processes with social activities.
      
			
				The Microsoft Cloud &#8211; Microsoft&#8217;s entrenchment in the business 
        world will pole vault its new Office cloud to becoming a serious 
        player very quickly. All the advantages of a SaaS offering, attractive 
        pricing and a familiar set of tools will make it hard for competitors 
        to rival Microsoft in the enterprise cloud arena.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Why IBM?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Social business initiative &#8211; IBM continues to make a push and 
        significant investments into helping organizations build a social 
        business.
      
			
				Integration with entrenched products &#8211; IBM Connections version 
        4.0 presents an exciting new social and collaboration offering with 
        out-of-the-box integration with Microsoft Outlook. Like RIM, 
        integrating with entrenched competitive products like Microsoft&#8217;s will 
        pay off.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Social interactions and collaboration will become an integral part of 
      employees&#8217; daily workflow and business processes. Users will not be 
      relegated to an isolated set of productivity tools,&#8221; said Cohen. &#8220;The 
      integration between collaboration/social products and enterprise 
      business software will breathe new life into old behemoths. Most 
      notably, the emergence of meaningful activity streams in enterprise 
      applications will become mainstream.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;  SAN MATEO, CA, Dec 17 (Marketwire) -- 
IntelePeer, Inc., a leading provider of on-demand, cloud-based
communications, today announced a partnership with Chinook Communications
to integrate IntelePeer CoreCloud SIP Trunking with hosted Microsoft Lync
unified communications deployments offered by Chinook.

Microsoft-supported Lync Server 2010 Multitenant Pack for Partner
Hosting. This exciting service enables companies to achieve more
effective collaboration and communication, while taking advantage of
IntelePeer's SIP Trunking capabilities to deliver seamless,
carrier-quality connections. IntelePeer's SIP Trunking service is the
only secure SIP trunking offering in the United States that is qualified
for Microsoft Lync. 

    "We are seeing a paradigm shift among small and medium-sized businesses
from premise-based communications to hosted Microsoft Lync deployments
due to the tremendous advantages the cloud offers in terms of
flexibility, scale and advanced capabilities," said Steve Schwartz, CEO
of Chinook Communications. "IntelePeer has a proven track record of
supporting the full range of Microsoft Lync multimedia and collaboration
features, ensuring communications are delivered with the highest level of
quality and reliability."

Interoperability Program (UCOIP) requirements and provides turnkey SIP
trunking solutions for hosted Microsoft Lync deployments. IntelePeer's
easy-to-deploy, high-quality, cost-effective services help deliver a
connection to any Microsoft Lync deployment as well as to any public
switched telephone network (PSTN) communications device through its
CloudWorx(TM) platform. 

    "As a Microsoft Lync service provider, Chinook Communications provides
small businesses the same level of communications sophistication
associated with large corporations -- but at a cost an entrepreneur can
afford," said Margaret Norton, general manager, Enterprises for
IntelePeer. "The combination of our cloud-based SIP trunking connections
with hosted Microsoft Lync helps small businesses use their
communications system as a revenue-generating asset, instead of a cost
center."

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;(Fornebu, 17th December 2012) Telenor and Microsoft have signed a global syndication agreement which means that collaboration and office solutions for companies will merge into one in the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The agreement, between Microsoft and Telenor Group, gives Telenor the right to sell licenses for Office 365 as well as the company's other services. Telenor is, therefore, one of the first telecom operators in the world to offer a telephony service within Lync Online from Microsoft Office 365.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Telenor Norway will, in cooperation with Telenor Business Internet Services (Telenor's cloud services company), be the first to offer the solution to its business customers. The agreement means that they will receive two professional business solutions as a single integrated package: Telenor's mobile business network "Mobilt Bedriftsnett" and Microsoft Office 365, with voice included. Telenor will launch Office 365 in January 2013 and expects to have the solution for voice integration ready for the market during the fourth quarter of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"Through this agreement, we are expanding our provision of cloud computing services with a solution that covers the communication needs of companies in one single package. We think this will satisfy a market need that is currently not being met," says Telenor's manager of the business market Bj&#248;rn Ivar Moen. Considerable interest"We are delighted that Telenor is launching a service that brings together the best of both our worlds," says Dagfinn Ring&#229;s, director of business and partners at Microsoft Norway. "With Telenor's telephony services fully integrated into Lync Online and Office 365, companies will be able to optimise their telecomms, collaboration and IT infrastructure. We have already seen considerable interest amongst customers for this type of solution in the markets where Telenor will be launching the service," says Ring&#229;s.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;AccessibleThe use of cloud services makes it easier to establish and introduce new solutions in a business as they do not require large investments or extensive internal technical projects. The company will always have the latest updated version and will avoid having to worry about the security and operation of the service. This is taken care of in the cloud by the supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The two business solutions, Mobilt Bedriftsnett and Office 365, are accessible in the cloud and run by the Telenor and Microsoft data centres. This enables economies of scale and the solution will be equally accessible to all companies regardless of size.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"We have long experience of delivering both voice and data services over the internet. Examples include security solutions, messaging services, central switchboards and PABX solutions (Public Automatic Branch Exchange)," says Bj&#248;rn Ivar Moen. "Today, we have more than two million customers in Norway who use our cloud services on a daily basis. The fact that software and applications can now also be supplied as cloud services creates entirely new opportunities for integration with telecommunication services. Telenor's most important emphasis within cloud-based services is on adding value to our partners' applications alongside our own communication services, particularly within mobility and collaboration," says Moen.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Telenor and Microsoft go back a long way together and the development within Unified Communication in particular has brought the two companies even closer together. They now cooperate in a variety of areas and on many different levels. &lt;/p&gt;

company will keep generating robust cash flow and preserve its
strong key credit metrics and liquidity during the next two
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rating Action&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 18, 2012, Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services
affirmed its ratings on Coca-Cola Femsa S.A.B. de C.V. (KOF),
including the 'A-' global scale and 'mxAAA' national scale
corporate credit ratings. The outlook is stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rationale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 13, 2012, KOF announced that it signed a definitive
agreement with The Coca-Cola Co. (TCCC; AA-/Stable/A-1+) to
acquire 51% of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc. (CCBPI) for
$688.5 million. KOF expects to finance the transaction through
$700 million of short- and medium-term bilateral bank loans. We
believe this additional debt won't weaken KOF's credit metrics
and financial risk profile, given the company's current cash
flow generation and strong liquidity. We also consider this
transaction as part of KOF's strategy to continue pursuing
growth opportunities worldwide. The transaction is expected to
close during the first months of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The corporate credit rating on KOF is based on its
stand-alone credit profile (SACP) and the implicit support from
TCCC through its 29.4% stake in KOF. The SACP on KOF is based on
our assessment of its "satisfactory" business risk profile that
reflects KOF's strategic position in TCCC's Latin American
distribution system, its operations throughout the region, and
the historical and relatively stable cash flow characteristics
of the nonalcoholic beverage industry. The rating also reflects
our expectation that the company will maintain its "modest"
financial risk profile, as seen in its strong financial measures
and robust cash flow generation. Intense competition, volatile
raw material prices, and the country and macroeconomic risks in
certain regions where the company operates partly offset the
positive factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global-scale rating on KOF is above the sovereign rating
on Mexico (foreign currency: BBB/Stable/A-2; local currency:
A-/Stable/A-2). We stress tested KOF under a Mexican sovereign
default scenario. Under this scenario, we sensitized the company
for a decline in consumer spending and a sharp devaluation of
the Mexican peso, hurting the company's sale volumes, cost
structure, and financing costs, which translates into a
significant decline in revenues and EBITDA. Under this scenario,
we concluded that the company would still be able to generate
sufficient cash flow to service its debt obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our senior unsecured debt rating on KOF is the same as the
corporate credit rating, reflecting the upstream guarantee from
Propimex S.A. de C.V., KOF's main operating subsidiary in
Mexico, which mitigates KOF's structural subordination relative
to operating company liabilities. Following the acquisition of
CCBPI, we expect Propimex to continue accounting for about 50%
of KOF's total assets, as the CCBPI's assets will not be
consolidated in KOF's balance sheet given that this operation
will be accounted under the equity method. Moreover, KOF expects
to merge certain real estate companies in Mexico into Propimex
during 2013, which we estimate will increase this percentage to
more than 55%. We also expect KOF to transfer sales operations
from the recent mergers in Mexico--Administradora de Acciones
del Noreste S.A. de C.V., Corporacion de Los Angeles S.A. de
C.V., and Grupo Fomento Queretano--to Propimex, increasing this
subsidiary's EBITDA. If Propimex's assets do not continue to
exceed 50% of KOF's total assets, or this subsidiary's EBITDA as
a percentage of the company's EBITDA does not gradually
increase, we could lower the ratings on the holding company debt
issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2012, KOF's revenues
and EBITDA increased by 28% and 18%, respectively. This growth
reflected the integration of the recently acquired new
territories in Mexico, higher average price per unit case, and
volume growth mainly in Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina,
and Central America. For the same period, EBITDA margin was
18.7% compared with 20.5% for the same period in 2011,
reflecting the depreciation of certain currencies, higher labor
and freight costs in some countries, certain additional expenses
in connection to commercial models, and investments related to
new lines of business and categories. KOF's key financial
metrics also remained solid, as seen in an adjusted total debt
to EBITDA of 0.8x, EBITDA interest coverage of 13.3x, and funds
from operations (FFO) to total debt of 79.9% for the 12 months
ended Sept. 30, 2012, compared with 1.1x, 12.4x, and 67.1%,
respectively, for the same period in 2011. Following the
acquisition in the Philippines, we expect KOF's total debt to
EBITDA to increase to 1.2x. As part of the agreement, KOF will
have an option to acquire the remaining 49% of CCBPI during the
seven years following the closing and will have a put option to
sell its ownership to TCCC any time during the sixth year. Once
the transaction is completed we will closely monitor the
integration process, pro forma business position, and operating
challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We consider KOF's liquidity as "strong" under our criteria.
We expect the company will refinance part or all of the
bilateral bank loans used to fund the CCBPI acquisition. We also
expect that sources of liquidity will exceed uses by more than
1.5x during the next 12-18 months. KOF's stable cash flow
generation backs its strong liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect the company to keep generating solid free
operating cash flow through the next few years, while
maintaining similar levels of cash on hand. Instead of using
committed credit lines, KOF has a policy of maintaining a
minimum excess cash cushion of $300 million in available funds,
on top of the $130 million it requires to operate. KOF's
covenant headroom is ample, even considering the additional debt
to fund the aforementioned acquisition. Our liquidity analysis
also incorporates qualitative factors, including our view that
the company has the capacity to withstand high-impact,
low-probability events. It also has sound relationships with
banks and access to capital markets, and an overall prudent
financial risk management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stable outlook reflects our expectation that KOF will
keep generating robust cash flow and preserve its strong key
credit metrics and liquidity during the next two years, despite
the recently announced acquisition. We could lower the ratings
if KOF's total debt to EBITDA increases to more than 2.0x, its
cash flow generation slows, or its level of implicit support
declines. We could lower the debt ratings if the guarantor's
assets as a percentage of KOF's total assets do not remain above
50%. An upgrade is possible once we have a clearer view of the
integration of the Philippines' operation and we reevaluate the
company's business risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related Criteria And Research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Criteria Methodology: Business Risk/Financial Risk Matrix

&lt;p&gt;What do Rajat Gupta and Sergey Aleynikov have in common? Not much, on the surface. One is the patrician former McKinsey chief and Goldman Sachs director, the other a scruffy young computer programmer. But as you probably know, Gupta and Aleynikov both got on the wrong side of Goldman Sachs. Gupta was convicted this summer of leaking inside information about the bank to Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam. Aleynikov, a former Goldman computer programmer, was convicted in 2010 on federal charges of stealing the banks high-frequency trading code when he defected to a rival start-up but was&#160;set free&#160;last April by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. (He has&#160;since been charged&#160;by the Manhattan district attorney for state-law crimes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta and Aleynikov have also both learned the consequence of crossing Goldman Sachs: The bank will not willingly pay their legal fees. Goldman moved in October for restitution of some $7 million it laid out for Guptas defense in his criminal case in federal court in Manhattan. (Like&#160;Morgan Stanley in its pursuitof $5 million&#160;from inside trader Joseph Chip Skowron, Goldman also demanded the return of part of Guptas compensation as a director.) On Friday, Guptas counsel at&#160;Weil, Gotshal  Manges&#160;filed a brief before U.S. Senior District JudgeJed Rakoff, arguing that&#160;Goldman is not entitled to restitution&#160;because, among other things, Goldman wasnt a victim of the conspiracy at the heart of his conviction. Theres precious little precedent on this kind of claim, but last March Rakoffs Manhattan federal court colleague&#160;Denise Cote&#160;found that Morgan Stanley was, indeed, a victim of Skowrons trading, even though the only direct effect on the bank was the $32 million it paid to settle the Securities and Exchange Commissions case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikovs fee dispute with Goldman presents a different but equally novel question: Who exactly is indemnified under the banks protection for officers? Aleynikov, who had the title of vice president at Goldman, Sachs  Co, a subsidiary of the Goldman Sachs Group, says hes an officer and thus entitled to indemnification for his defense fees. Goldman argues that the programmers title was a meaningless courtesy thats understood in the industry to carry no actual officers duties. Indemnification, according to the banks lawyers at&#160;Boies, Schiller  Flexner, doesnt apply to lower-level employees like Aleynikov; Goldman offered an affidavit from Goldman Sachs Group general counsel&#160;Gregory Palm&#160;to support its assertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, U.S. District Judge&#160;Kevin McNulty&#160;of Newark, New Jersey,&#160;denied cross-motions for summary judgment&#160;by Goldman and Aleynikov, ruling that neither side had persuaded him that its definition of an officer should prevail. But McNulty also ordered discovery to answer the question of who is an officer. An entity may decide whom to designate as an officer, he wrote. But because GS Group points to no such written policy, because it is in possession of all the facts on this point, and because there has been no discovery, it would be unfair to conclude from a blanket statement in an affidavit that it is true. Aleynikov is entitled to probe these matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikovs lawyer,&#160;Kevin Marino&#160;of&#160;Marino, Tortorella  Boyle, said Goldman would not be able to dispute his clients indemnification if he had been a vice president at Goldman Sachs Group, rather than Goldman, Sachs  Co. He told me the same should be true of officers of the subsidiary. Ive never heard anyone say a vice president is not an officer, Marino said. I guess were going to take discovery now to get to the bottom of it. (If you doubt that Marino has expertise on the issue of banks and legal fee indemnity, consider this: He represents Morgan Stanley in its litigation against Chip Skowron.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whats so intriguing about Goldmans argument in the Aleynikov case is that Fabrice Tourre, the only individualfacing Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges&#160;in connection with Goldman Sachss infamous Abacus collateralized debt obligation, had the same title as the erstwhile computer programmer: vice president of Goldman, Sachs  Co. Similarly, Neil Morrison, who was named in September in&#160;an SEC complaint&#160;alleging a pay-to-play scheme to obtain municipal underwriting business, was a vice president of Goldman, Sachs  Co. Both Tourre and Morrison are contesting the SECs allegations, which is an expensive undertaking. But theres been no public indication that Goldman Sachs has balked at paying their legal fees. (I left a message with a bank representative and with Tourres lawyer,&#160;Pamela Chepiga&#160;of&#160;Allen  Overy. Neither called me back; I could not determine who is representing Morrison.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can bet that when Marino digs into discovery in Aleynikovs case  which could include a demand to depose Goldman GC Palm  hes going to ask some tough questions about whether the bank is funding the defense of Tourre and Morrison, and, if so, how it can justify refusing to indemnify someone with the same title. Of course, Tourre and Morrison, unlike Aleynikov, allegedly engaged in misconduct that benefited Goldman Sachs, at least in the short term. It will be very interesting to see if thats the banks real standard for indemnification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more of my posts, please go to&#160;Thomson Reuters News  Insight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dec 18 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co promoted
Kevin Watters to be chief of its home loan business, relieving
Co-Chief Operating Officer Frank Bisignano of the temporary
assignment to clean up the lender's mortgage issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watters, 44, had been responsible since 2010 for originating
mortgages and now will also oversee mortgage servicing and
problem loans and hold the title CEO of Mortgage Banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This role is a natural expansion of his successful
leadership of mortgage originations," Bisignano said in a
statement from the company on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2011, Bisignano was assigned by company CEO
Jamie Dimon to run the mortgage business and fix problems
stemming from bad loans made before housing prices collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has made more home loans this year than any other
U.S. lender except Wells Fargo &amp; Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year JPMorgan and other banks have been enjoying a
surge of revenue from refinancing mortgage loans at lower
interest rates engineered by the U.S. Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will continue to see the refinancing business stay
strong for the next couple of quarters as long as interest rates
stay low," Watters said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watters said he expects that refinancing will taper off by
the end of next year as demand builds for loans to purchase
homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watters will report to Gordon Smith, who at the end of this
month will become sole CEO of Consumer &amp; Community Banking over
the retail branches, credit cards and mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Watters was put in charge of mortgage originations,
he was head of business banking in the branch network for five
years, according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watters has been with the company for 13 years and worked
for Bank One, which JPMorgan acquired, on Internet banking
services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A native of Philadelphia, Watters said he got some of his

&lt;p&gt;OVERVIEW
     -- We placed our ratings on four classes from JPMorgan Chase Commercial 
Mortgage Securities Corp.'s series 2006-FL1, a U.S. CMBS transaction, on 
CreditWatch with negative implications.
     -- The CreditWatch placements reflect our expectations of additional 
interest shortfalls on these classes due to an appraisal reduction amount that 
we expect to be affected on the sole remaining collateral in the trust as 
early as the next reporting cycle. 
 
NEW YORK (Standard &amp; Poor's) Dec. 18, 2012--Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services 
today placed its ratings on four classes of commercial mortgage pass-through 
certificates from JPMorgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp.'s series 
2006-FL1, a U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) transaction, on 
CreditWatch with negative implications (see list). 

The negative CreditWatch placements reflect our expectations of additional 
interest shortfalls on these classes due to an appraisal reduction amount 
(ARA) that we expect to be affected on the sole remaining specially serviced 
collateral, the Independence Mall loan, in the trust as early as the next 
reporting cycle. According to the special servicer, C-III Asset Management LLC 
(C-III), an updated appraisal value has recently been finalized. C-III stated 
that it is currently working on the ARA calculation based on the recent 
appraisal value. Standard &amp; Poor's believes that there likely will be a 
significant decline in the value of the property, in view of the continued 
decline in occupancy and expected decrease in net cash flow (see below for 
details). 

As of the Dec. 17, 2012, trustee remittance report, the trust consisted of one 
remaining floating-rate amortizing loan indexed to one-month LIBOR, the 
Independence Mall loan. The one-month LIBOR rate was 0.208% according to the 
Dec. 2012 trustee remittance report. 

The Independence Mall loan has a trust and whole-loan balance of $71.2 million 
and a total reported trust exposure of $72.0 million. The loan was transferred 
to the special servicer on Aug. 27, 2012, due to its impending maturity. The 
loan matures on Feb. 9, 2013. The payment status of the loan is currently 
reported as 30 days delinquent. C-III indicated that it is currently waiting 
on the borrower's proposal for a loan modification. The loan is secured by 
679,705 sq. ft. of an 830,158-sq.-ft. regional mall in Kingston, Mass. The 
master servicer, Wells Fargo Bank N.A., reported a 0.96x debt service coverage 
for the three months ended March 31, 2012, and occupancy for the collateral 
dropped to 61.4%, according to the Sept. 30, 2012, rent roll, following H 
Group's vacancy (34,000 sq. ft.) in 2012, compared with 67.5% as of the Dec. 
31, 2011, rent roll. Anchor tenants in the collateral include Target Corp. 
(126,000 sq. ft.), Sears holding Corp. (79,441 sq. ft.), and Regal Cinema 
(58,115 sq. ft.), according to the September 2012 rent roll. The loan 
amortizes on a 20-year schedule. 

Standard &amp; Poor's will resolve the CreditWatch negative placements as more 
information regarding the potential workout of the loan becomes available and 
after we review the credit characteristics of the remaining collateral in the 
trust as well as available liquidity remaining in the trust. If we lower our 
rating on class G below AA- (sf), we will withdraw our 'AAA (sf)' rating on 
the class X-2 interest-only (IO) certificates in accordance with our IO 
criteria. 

STANDARD &amp; POOR'S 17G-7 DISCLOSURE REPORT

SEC Rule 17g-7 requires an NRSRO, for any report accompanying a credit rating 
relating to an asset-backed security as defined in the Rule, to include a 
description of the representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms 
available to investors and a description of how they differ from the 
representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms in issuances of similar 
securities. The Rule applies to in-scope securities initially rated (including 
preliminary ratings) on or after Sept. 26, 2011.

If applicable, the Standard &amp; Poor's 17g-7 Disclosure Reports included in this 
credit rating report are available at

&lt;p&gt;Dec 18 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co promoted
Kevin Watters to be chief of its home loan business, relieving
Co-Chief Operating Officer Frank Bisignano of a temporary second
assignment to clean up the lender's mortgage issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watters, 44, had been responsible since 2010 for originating
mortgages and will now also oversee mortgage servicing and
problem loans and hold the title CEO of Mortgage Banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This role is a natural expansion of his successful
leadership of mortgage originations," Bisignano said in a
statement from the company on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2011 Bisignano was assigned by company CEO Jamie
Dimon to run the mortgage business and fix problems stemming
from bad loans made before housing prices collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year JPMorgan and other banks have been enjoying a
surge of revenue from refinancing mortgage loans at lower
interest rates engineered by the U.S. Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watters will report to Gordon Smith, who at the end of this
month will become sole CEO of Consumer &amp; Community Banking over
the retail branches, credit cards and mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Watters was put in charge of mortgage originations,
he was head of business banking in the branch network for five
years, according to the statement. Watters has been with the
company for 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  KANSAS CITY, MO, Dec 18 (Marketwire) -- 
Burns &amp; McDonnell announced that it has promoted John Olander to serve as
Vice President and General Manager of its Transmission &amp; Distribution
(T) Division, replacing Walt Womack upon his retirement at year-end
2012. 

    "No one can really replace Wally Womack because of what he has meant to
Burns &amp; McDonnell," said Burns &amp; McDonnell Chairman and CEO Greg Graves.
"In his 42 years here, Wally has truly been the leader we have all looked
up to. His counsel and business sense have been just what we needed
during every stage of our growth and his mentorship to dozens of young
engineers, including me, means that the Burns &amp; McDonnell culture is
deeply rooted in everything we do. He has put the right foundation in
place and it will be exciting to see John Olander carry on his legacy."

    With more than 650 employee-owners working in Kansas City and in more
than 20 offices and project locations across the U.S. and Canada, Olander
will lead Burns &amp; McDonnell's largest division. Currently ranked as the
largest T engineering firm in the nation by Engineering News-Record
magazine, the Burns &amp; McDonnell T group is currently working on many of
the largest high-voltage electrical transmission projects in North
America. More than 400 employee-owners in the Construction Design/Build,
Environmental Studies &amp; Permitting and Business &amp; Technology Services
divisions also are assigned to Burns &amp; McDonnell's T projects and are
crucial to helping the firm achieve its Number 1 industry ranking. 

    Olander joined Burns &amp; McDonnell in 1991 as an electrical engineer
working in the firm's air pollution control group. He supported Burns &amp;
McDonnell's Energy group shortly afterward working on a variety of
electrical and infrastructure projects. When the T division was formed
in 1994, Olander joined the following year as a substation engineer. 

    By 1998, Olander had been promoted to a project manager role, leading a
challenging engineer-procure-construct (EPC) project for Brazos Electric
Power Cooperative in Texas. His success with that initial project lead
him to similar roles on larger EPC projects, including a 2005 project
award from Xcel Energy that was at that time the largest EPC project in
the transmission industry and the largest the firm had undertaken. In
2006, Olander became T's EPC project leader and in 2008, he was
promoted to his current role as vice president. Olander is a 1989
engineering graduate of North Dakota State University and received his
Masters of Business Administration (MBA) degree in 1996 from the
University of Kansas. He is a licensed professional engineer in Kansas
and New Jersey. 

    Womack joined Burns &amp; McDonnell in 1970 shortly after graduating from the
University of Kansas School of Engineering. He began in the firm's Energy
Division designing high-voltage substations, later supporting
interconnections of increasingly high profile power generation projects
to the transmission grid. After being promoted to serve as the Energy
Division's director of business development, Womack was instrumental in
landing several projects in the mid-1980s that were crucial during Burns
&amp; McDonnell's early years as an employee-owned firm. 

    In 1994, Womack was appointed to lead the new Burns &amp; McDonnell T
Division after it was split from the Energy Group and has overseen its
rapid growth since that time.

    "Our success and the industry recognition the T group has received is
more about what Burns &amp; McDonnell does as a whole than about what T has
done," Womack said. "Every employee-owner at Burns &amp; McDonnell has
contributed to our success because everyone is focused on doing whatever
it takes to serve our clients. I've had a great ride and now I'm excited
to turn the keys over to John because it's his time."

    Olander said: "The only way you can follow a leader like Wally is to
follow his example of humility and service and remember that the best way
to lead is to hire great people and get out of their way. Wally set the
standard and now we just have to carry on with what he started."

will lead Burns &amp; McDonnell's largest division. Currently ranked as the
largest T engineering firm in the nation by Engineering News-Record
magazine, the Burns &amp; McDonnell T group is currently working on many of
the largest high-voltage electrical transmission projects in North
America. More than 400 employee-owners in the Construction Design/Build,
Environmental Studies &amp; Permitting and Business &amp; Technology Services
divisions also are assigned to Burns &amp; McDonnell's T projects and are
crucial to helping the firm achieve its Number 1 industry ranking. 

    Olander joined Burns &amp; McDonnell in 1991 as an electrical engineer
working in the firm's air pollution control group. He supported Burns &amp;
McDonnell's Energy group shortly afterward working on a variety of
electrical and infrastructure projects. When the T division was formed
in 1994, Olander joined the following year as a substation engineer. 

    By 1998, Olander had been promoted to a project manager role, leading a
challenging engineer-procure-construct (EPC) project for Brazos Electric
Power Cooperative in Texas. His success with that initial project lead
him to similar roles on larger EPC projects, including a 2005 project
award from Xcel Energy that was at that time the largest EPC project in
the transmission industry and the largest the firm had undertaken. In
2006, Olander became T's EPC project leader and in 2008, he was
promoted to his current role as vice president. Olander is a 1989
engineering graduate of North Dakota State University and received his
Masters of Business Administration (MBA) degree in 1996 from the
University of Kansas. He is a licensed professional engineer in Kansas
and New Jersey. 

    Womack joined Burns &amp; McDonnell in 1970 shortly after graduating from the
University of Kansas School of Engineering. He began in the firm's Energy
Division designing high-voltage substations, later supporting
interconnections of increasingly high profile power generation projects
to the transmission grid. After being promoted to serve as the Energy
Division's director of business development, Womack was instrumental in
landing several projects in the mid-1980s that were crucial during Burns
&amp; McDonnell's early years as an employee-owned firm. 

    In 1994, Womack was appointed to lead the new Burns &amp; McDonnell T
Division after it was split from the Energy Group and has overseen its
rapid growth since that time.

    "Our success and the industry recognition the T group has received is
more about what Burns &amp; McDonnell does as a whole than about what T has
done," Womack said. "Every employee-owner at Burns &amp; McDonnell has
contributed to our success because everyone is focused on doing whatever
it takes to serve our clients. I've had a great ride and now I'm excited
to turn the keys over to John because it's his time."

    Olander said: "The only way you can follow a leader like Wally is to
follow his example of humility and service and remember that the best way
to lead is to hire great people and get out of their way. Wally set the
standard and now we just have to carry on with what he started."

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Google Inc's Motorola phone unit remain millions of dollars apart in their respective valuations of video and wi-fi patents at issue in a pivotal case before a federal judge in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome, expected sometime next year, could be a key development in the balance of power between Microsoft and Google - and the rest of the technology industry - in the running battle over ownership of the technology underlying increasingly popular smartphones, tablets and game consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trial, held November 13-20 in the Western District of Washington federal court, was designed to settle the matter of how much Microsoft must pay Motorola for use of two of its standard, essential patents used in its Xbox game console and other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In redacted post-trial filings made public on Monday - essentially its final arguments before the judge - Microsoft argued that it should pay no more than $502,000 per year for Motorola's H.264 video compression patent, and no more than $736,000 per year for Motorola's 802.11 wi-fi technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola - acquired by Google earlier this year, partly for its valuable patent portfolio - submitted a far larger valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its filing, also made public in redacted form on Monday, Motorola said it was due payment of 2.25 percent of the selling price of Microsoft products such as the Xbox and Windows 7 operating system that use the patents in question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola argued that a fair cross-licensing deal would result in net payments to Motorola which it would be willing to cap somewhere between $100 million and $125 million per year, solely for the H.264 patent portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 802.11 patents, it claimed a net payment of 1.15 percent to 1.73 percent of Microsoft end-product prices, which would mean millions of dollars more per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Robart is expected to rule on the case early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case in U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc., 10-cv-1823.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Bill Rigby; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani)&lt;/p&gt;

Chevron Condemns Intimidation Effort, Urges Others to Come Forward
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) today condemned actions taken by the Lago Agrio
plaintiffs` lawyers to intimidate, threaten, and harass whistleblower Fernando
Reyes who has provided a sworn declaration offering an insider`s account of the
plaintiffs` lawyers` fraud during the trial in Ecuador. Subsequent to the filing
of the Reyes Declaration, the plaintiffs` lawyers and publicist have issued
press statements attacking and disparaging Reyes and threatening him with
harassing litigation. In response, Chevron has issued the following statement: 

"Rather than address the substance of Reyes` testimony on the merits, the
plaintiffs` representatives hope to intimidate him. Chevron calls upon the
authorities to investigate these threats against Reyes. Chevron encourages other
whistleblowers who have information about the plaintiffs` lawyers` fraud to come
forward." 

Note to Editors:

Reyes is an Ecuadorian petroleum and environmental engineer who served as a
consultant to the plaintiffs` lawyers. Last Wednesday, Chevron submitted a sworn
declaration from Reyes in support of its fraud and racketeering lawsuit in New
York against the plaintiffs` lawyers and backers in which Reyes provides an
eyewitness account as to how the plaintiffs` lawyers have sought to manipulate
the trial since its infancy, deceived the court, corrupted the trial process,
and engaged in the development of a fraudulent "independent" report. Reyes`
testimony is corroborated not only by his own notes, but by documents produced
by Donziger in court-ordered discovery, deposition testimony, and outtakes (here
and here) from the movie "Crude." The plaintiffs` lead American lawyer, Steven
Donziger, once described Reyes as "one of the most qualified engineers and
academics in the field." 

The Reyes Declaration confirms the plaintiffs` lawyers` fraud on multiple
levels. Reyes had considerable involvement in the Lago Agrio case for the
plaintiffs, first serving as what was represented as an "independent" monitor of
court experts and then as a "shadow" advisor to Richard Cabrera, a
supposedly-independent court expert. In fact, Reyes introduced Cabrera to
Donziger and his co-counsel, and the plaintiffs` lawyers pressured the court in
Ecuador to appoint Cabrera to conduct a "global assessment" of environment
conditions in the Oriente region of Ecuador`s Amazon. Reyes was also present in
a meeting between the plaintiffs` lawyers and consultants and Cabrera before
Cabrera was appointed as an independent court expert (video from the meeting
here and here). Cabrera ultimately submitted a report to the court, described by
one of the plaintiffs` consultants as "the single most important technical
document for the case," assigning more than $27 billion in damages against
Chevron. 

Cabrera`s report has since been shown to be a fraud, written by the plaintiffs`
representatives and passed off as the work of a neutral and independent court
appointee. Reyes` declaration describes the process by which the plaintiffs`
lawyers sought out someone who, as Donziger put it, would "totally play ball
with us and let us take the lead while projecting the image that he is working
for the court." The plaintiffs` lawyers` were aware of the fraud they were
committing: as their scheme to deceive the court was unraveling, Donziger`s
co-counsel wrote, "all of us, your attorneys, might go to jail." 

While courts in Ecuador have ignored the evidence of the plaintiffs` lawyers`
fraud, even going as far as to include many of "Cabrera`s" claims in the
judgment issued last year, other courts have not. In an opinion issued in July,
a court in the Southern District of New York found that "uncontradicted evidence
demonstrates that the report and subsequent responses filed in Cabrera`s name
were tainted by fraud." 

More information on the plaintiffs` lawyers` fraud can be found here. Additional
background on the Ecuador litigation can be accessed here and here.

New "Expert Knowledge" Section to Address Key Market Issues, Including Fuel
Economy, Emissions and the Next Proposed Oil Category (PC-11)
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Products Company, a Chevron U.S.A. Inc. division, maker of the Delo&#174;
brand of technologically advanced engine oils, lubricants and coolants, today
announced the company has expanded its commitment to customer and market
education by introducing an upgraded portion of its ChevronDelo.com website. The
newly expanded "Expert Knowledge" section will offer video and written material
to address key market issues of interest to both its on- and off-highways
customers. Some of the topics to be addressed on the site include Fuel Economy,
Emissions Regulations and PC-11 - the new diesel engine oil category under
development, slated for introduction in 2016. 

"We currently hold over 250 customer-focused educational events per year," said
Jim Gambill, Delo commercial and industrial brand manager, Chevron Lubricants.
"While we will continue to meet with customers face-to-face, we see a clear
value in bringing some of this content online. At Chevron, we have always
believed that to be a true business partner, you must share your market
expertise as well as provide customers with exceptional products. The updated
ChevronDelo.com site is just one way we continue to help our customers be
successful in their businesses." 

The site will be updated on a regular basis and will include insight from
Chevron subject matter experts on best practices and important topics. Jim
McGeehan, Chevron`s global manager, heavy-duty diesel engine oil technology and
the chairman of the ASTM heavy-duty engine oil classification panel, which is
charged with setting limits and verifying testing for the development of API oil
classifications, will be a regular contributor to the site, providing updates on
the development of PC-11. 

A Legacy of Lubricant Education

Chevron has a long history of educating the lubrication industry, the markets it
serves and its customers about key technologies and issues. The now retired
Lubrication Magazine, which was first published by Texaco and then Chevron,
provided detailed technical insight, for over 95 years, into lubricant-related
topics ranging from oil category changes to bio-diesel to hydraulics and oil
analysis. 

Each year, the company works with its family of marketers to host Delo-branded
educational events around the country. These events tap into the market
expertise and product knowledge of both Chevron and its lubricant marketers to
help deliver bottom-line performance improvements to customers. Within the
agriculture community, Chevron has hosted countless educational events at
regional agriculture shows across the country to help these customers improve
their businesses, so they can continue to put food on plates around the country.


On July 29, 1999, Chevron introduced the Delo Truck, a rolling ambassador for
the Delo brand. Averaging over 40,000 miles a year, the truck has visited 49
states as well as Canada and Mexico. The current version of the Delo Truck has
19 learning stations - most with interactive displays. Visitors to the truck can
explore various topics, including maximizing drain intervals and interpreting
evolving OEM drain recommendations. 

In 2004, Chevron held its first Construction Symposium, which brings together
experts from top construction and mining companies to share their experiences
and perspectives on key trends, issues and products. The goal of the program is
to help develop creative practices for outstanding performance, profitability
and success in the challenging construction and mining markets. 

To further its educational efforts, in 2006, Chevron launched the Lubricants
University site, which provides its marketers with online access to a wealth of
training materials, courses and other lubricant-related educational content. 

"Sharing our knowledge with our customers is an integral part of the value
delivered by Chevron Lubricants and the Delo brand. Finding timely, new and
relevant ways to reach our audiences is a critical part of our ongoing success,"
said Gambill. 

Follow the Delo Brand

The Delo brand can be followed on various social media channels, including
Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Flickr. 

Extended Service Protection - Chevron`s Delo Product Family

Chevron`s Delo product family includes engine oils, premium lubricants and
extended life coolants that provide premium performance and bottom-line value
for diesel powered vehicles that may demand extended service protection and
drain capabilities. 

The exceptional performance of Delo lubricants is a result of Chevron`s
proprietary ISOSYN Technology which combines premium base oils, high performance
additives and Chevron formulating expertise to provide superb diesel engine
parts protection - all at an outstanding value. ISOSYN Technology helps
customers by providing extended service protection, maximizing engine
durability, and minimizing operating costs.

			New &#8220;Expert Knowledge&#8221; Section to Address Key Market Issues, 
      Including Fuel Economy, Emissions and the Next Proposed Oil Category 
      (PC-11)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Products Company, a Chevron U.S.A. Inc. division, maker of the 
      Delo&#174; brand of technologically advanced engine oils, 
      lubricants and coolants, today announced the company has expanded its 
      commitment to customer and market education by introducing an upgraded 
      portion of its ChevronDelo.com 
      website. The newly expanded &#8220;Expert Knowledge&#8221; section will offer video 
      and written material to address key market issues of interest to both 
      its on- and off-highways customers. Some of the topics to be addressed 
      on the site include Fuel Economy, Emissions Regulations and PC-11 &#8211; the 
      new diesel engine oil category under development, slated for 
      introduction in 2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We currently hold over 250 customer-focused educational events per 
      year,&#8221; said Jim Gambill, Delo commercial and industrial brand manager, 
      Chevron Lubricants. &#8220;While we will continue to meet with customers 
      face-to-face, we see a clear value in bringing some of this content 
      online. At Chevron, we have always believed that to be a true business 
      partner, you must share your market expertise as well as provide 
      customers with exceptional products. The updated ChevronDelo.com site is 
      just one way we continue to help our customers be successful in their 
      businesses.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The site will be updated on a regular basis and will include insight 
      from Chevron subject matter experts on best practices and important 
      topics. Jim McGeehan, Chevron&#8217;s global manager, heavy-duty diesel engine 
      oil technology and the chairman of the ASTM heavy-duty engine oil 
      classification panel, which is charged with setting limits and verifying 
      testing for the development of API oil classifications, will be a 
      regular contributor to the site, providing updates on the development of 
      PC-11.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			A Legacy of Lubricant Education
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron has a long history of educating the lubrication industry, the 
      markets it serves and its customers about key technologies and issues. 
      The now retired Lubrication Magazine, which was first published 
      by Texaco and then Chevron, provided detailed technical insight, for 
      over 95 years, into lubricant-related topics ranging from oil category 
      changes to bio-diesel to hydraulics and oil analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each year, the company works with its family of marketers to host 
      Delo-branded educational events around the country. These events tap 
      into the market expertise and product knowledge of both Chevron and its 
      lubricant marketers to help deliver bottom-line performance improvements 
      to customers. Within the agriculture community, Chevron has hosted 
      countless educational events at regional agriculture shows across the 
      country to help these customers improve their businesses, so they can 
      continue to put food on plates around the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On July 29, 1999, Chevron introduced the Delo Truck, a rolling 
      ambassador for the Delo brand. Averaging over 40,000 miles a year, the 
      truck has visited 49 states as well as Canada and Mexico. The current 
      version of the Delo Truck has 19 learning stations &#8211; most with 
      interactive displays. Visitors to the truck can explore various topics, 
      including maximizing drain intervals and interpreting evolving OEM drain 
      recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2004, Chevron held its first Construction Symposium, which brings 
      together experts from top construction and mining companies to share 
      their experiences and perspectives on key trends, issues and products. 
      The goal of the program is to help develop creative practices for 
      outstanding performance, profitability and success in the challenging 
      construction and mining markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To further its educational efforts, in 2006, Chevron launched the 
      Lubricants University site, which provides its marketers with online 
      access to a wealth of training materials, courses and other 
      lubricant-related educational content.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Sharing our knowledge with our customers is an integral part of the 
      value delivered by Chevron Lubricants and the Delo brand. Finding 
      timely, new and relevant ways to reach our audiences is a critical part 
      of our ongoing success,&#8221; said Gambill.

PRINCETON JUNCTION, N.J., Dec. 18, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The progress of U.S. EMV migration,
mobile payments, and open transit payments initiatives will fill the agenda when senior leaders
from American Express, Discover, Isis, MasterCard, Visa and the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) take
the stage for keynote presentations at the Smart
Card Alliance 2013 Payments Summit
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10016028=1=Smart%0ACard%20Alliance%202013%20Payments%20Summit=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scapayments.com%2F
.  The 6thannual Summit is being held February 5-7, 2013, with an optional ski event on February
3rd and pre-conference workshops on February 4th, in Salt Lake City, Utah at the Grand America
Hotel.

The complete details about the agenda, registration and exhibition sponsorship details can be
found at www.scapayments.com
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10016028=2=www.scapayments.com=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scapayments.com%2F
. Early registration discounts expire on December 20th. 

"What a difference a year makes - last year, more than 500 executives gathered at the Payments
Summit to learn about the brand-new announcements of EMV roadmaps, mobile payments initiatives,
and open transit deployments," said Randy Vanderhoof, executive director of the Smart Card
Alliance.  "Now, these initiatives are in full swing and a new payments ecosystem is a becoming
reality in the United States. This year we'll learn first-hand about the progress of the positive
changes happening in the U.S. payments industry from the experts that are leading them, and the
steps necessary to move all of these initiatives forward."

The three-day "all payments" event will feature senior experts from every leading transaction
platform: EMV card payments, mobile payments, and transit payments.  After the opening day keynote
presentations and discussion panels, the remainder of the conference agenda will be divided into
three concurrent tracks on these topics and answer these questions:

       -- EMV in the United States.  The U.S. is the world's largest payments ecosystem and the
migration to EMV - the global secure payments standard - has now begun in earnest. How can the
industry provide clarity for banks, credit unions, issuers and merchants on the steps they need to
take to make this migration successful?

       -- NFC and Mobile Payments.  Major Near Field Communication (NFC) programs are underway
with Google and Isis, and NFC-enabled handsets for consumers are on the shelves.  How will the
"wallet wars" evolve? Will virtual wallets in the cloud change the course ahead? Will consumers
and retailers be responsive to the technology?

       --Transit Open Loop Payments.  Transit operators from major cities nationwide have
announced ambitious plans to upgrade their fare collection systems to move beyond pilots and begin
roll-outs accepting open bank card payments that are expected to include contactless payment
cards, stickers, and NFC-enabled mobile devices. Can smaller transit operators participate too?
Which cities are going to be next? Which business strategy will shape the future for procurement
and operations?   How will mobile payments and EMV impact the transit industry?

Prior to the conference, the Smart Card Alliance is offering an educational workshop on February
4th, "How EMV Changes Payment: Impact on Transit, Retail, and Mobile Acceptance Infrastructure." 
The same day, the Alliance will host meetings of the members-only EMV Migration
Forum

			Peninsula Beverage Company Satisfies Thirst for Coca-Cola Products 
      with Logility Voyager Solutions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Enhanced Visibility and More Accurate Forecasts Strengthen South 
      African Bottler and Distributor&#8217;s Sales and Operations Planning Process
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Logility Inc., a leading supplier of collaborative solutions to optimize 
      the supply chain, today announced Peninsula Beverage Company (PenBev), 
      one of South Africa&#8217;s bottlers and distributors of Coca-Cola products, 
      has achieved impressive results following its implementation of Logility 
      Voyager Solutions&#8482;. Through the use of Logility&#8217;s advanced supply 
      chain management software, the company has increased forecast 
      accuracy by 20 percent at the item/plant level and is able to utilize 
      the enhanced visibility and more accurate data to strengthen its sales 
      and operations planning (SOP) process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a company which relies on exceptional customer service as a catalyst 
      for growth, PenBev realized it needed to better forecast demand and 
      align its commercial, sales, and distribution teams with these 
      forecasts. Since deploying Logility Voyager Solutions PenBev has 
      centralized its demand planning, improved service levels and reduced 
      inventory by 25 percent while increasing on-time, in-full order fill 
      rates from 94 percent to 99 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The supply chain is our backbone and is essential in our ability to 
      meet the growing demands for Coca-Cola products across the Western and 
      Northern Cape,&#8221; said Andre Cloete, supply chain director, PenBev. &#8220;The 
      past supply chain processes hindered our ability to cost-effectively 
      scale operations. Since implementing Logility Voyager Solutions we have 
      seen a significant improvement in forecast accuracy, the ability to 
      classify and prioritize A, B and C items, and an increase in service 
      levels. With these improvements we are now able to focus on improving 
      our collaboration to share forecasts across a broader business group.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Voyager Solutions enables companies like PenBev to quickly generate and 
      track forecasts for multiple business needs, including sales, marketing, 
      logistics, and financials, to produce an accurate picture of the market 
      and its impact on operations. The solution helps improve margins by 
      keeping detailed product forecasts aligned with high-level business 
      plans. Additionally users are automatically alerted to changes in the 
      market through exception management and can readjust the forecast ahead 
      of changes in demand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

Enhanced Visibility and More Accurate Forecasts Strengthen South African Bottler
and Distributor`s Sales and Operations Planning Process
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Logility Inc., a leading supplier of collaborative solutions to optimize the
supply chain, today announced Peninsula Beverage Company (PenBev), one of South
Africa`s bottlers and distributors of Coca-Cola products, has achieved
impressive results following its implementation of Logility Voyager Solutions.
Through the use of Logility`s advanced supply chain management software, the
company has increased forecast accuracy by 20 percent at the item/plant level
and is able to utilize the enhanced visibility and more accurate data to
strengthen its sales and operations planning (S) process. 

As a company which relies on exceptional customer service as a catalyst for
growth, PenBev realized it needed to better forecast demand and align its
commercial, sales, and distribution teams with these forecasts. Since deploying
Logility Voyager Solutions PenBev has centralized its demand planning, improved
service levels and reduced inventory by 25 percent while increasing on-time,
in-full order fill rates from 94 percent to 99 percent. 

"The supply chain is our backbone and is essential in our ability to meet the
growing demands for Coca-Cola products across the Western and Northern Cape,"
said Andre Cloete, supply chain director, PenBev. "The past supply chain
processes hindered our ability to cost-effectively scale operations. Since
implementing Logility Voyager Solutions we have seen a significant improvement
in forecast accuracy, the ability to classify and prioritize A, B and C items,
and an increase in service levels. With these improvements we are now able to
focus on improving our collaboration to share forecasts across a broader
business group." 

Voyager Solutions enables companies like PenBev to quickly generate and track
forecasts for multiple business needs, including sales, marketing, logistics,
and financials, to produce an accurate picture of the market and its impact on
operations. The solution helps improve margins by keeping detailed product
forecasts aligned with high-level business plans. Additionally users are
automatically alerted to changes in the market through exception management and
can readjust the forecast ahead of changes in demand. 

"PenBev saw an opportunity to improve its operations and create a more efficient
supply chain through deploying Logility Voyager Solutions," said Mike Edenfield,
president and CEO, Logility. "We are helping PenBev build a strong and flexible
S process that is capable of boosting visibility and supporting their
long-term business strategy. PenBev`s 25 percent inventory reduction combined
with the ability to better serve its customers demonstrates how the right
combination of people, process and technology can significantly impact
operations and the bottom line."

ease-of-use, Logility Voyager Solutions is a comprehensive supply chain
management solution suite which features performance monitoring capabilities to
increase supply chain visibility and operational efficiency in key areas

      Update and 2013 Guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Regulatory News:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE/Euronext Paris: CCE) today affirmed diluted 
      earnings per share guidance for full-year 2012 in a range of $2.20 to 
      $2.24, with results expected at the high end of the range. Also, the 
      company expects to achieve 2013 earnings per diluted share growth of 
      approximately 10 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our 2012 results will reflect our ability to deliver solid earnings 
      growth by closely managing each aspect of our business and continuing 
      world class marketplace execution in difficult operating conditions,&#8221; 
      said John F. Brock, chairman and chief executive officer. &#8220;Going 
      forward, we will rely on our global operating framework, our successful 
      brands, increased effectiveness through our business transformation 
      effort, and the skill and dedication of our employees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These elements of our work are essential to our success, and ultimately 
      will enable us to continue to achieve our most important goal &#8211; creating 
      increased value for our shareowners.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2012 OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For 2012, CCE expects comparable earnings per diluted share in a range 
      of $2.20 to $2.24, with results expected at the high end of the range, 
      including the negative impact of currency translation. Currency 
      translation will decrease full-year comparable earnings per diluted 
      share approximately 7&#189; percent. Net sales and operating income are 
      expected to grow in a low to mid-single-digit range. Our outlook for 
      earnings per diluted share, net sales, and operating income is 
      comparable and includes the impact of the French excise tax increase. 
      Net sales and operating income guidance is also currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on recent currency rates, the company now expects 2012 free cash 
      flow of approximately $500 million, with capital expenditures of 
      approximately $375 million. Weighted average cost of debt is expected to 
      be approximately 3 percent and the comparable effective tax rate for 
      2012 is expected to be in a range of 26 percent to 27 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SHARE REPURCHASE AND DIVIDENDS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company has completed its most recent share repurchase program by 
      reaching the cumulative 65 million maximum number of repurchased shares 
      authorized by the Board of Directors. During 2012, this resulted in 27 
      million shares or $780 million in shares repurchased.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, the Board of Directors has approved a new $1.5 billion 
      share repurchase program &#8211; the third program since the 2010 completion 
      of the transaction that created the new CCE. At least $500 million in 
      repurchases are expected under this program in 2013. These plans may be 
      adjusted depending on economic, operating, or other factors, including 
      acquisition opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE also expects to increase its 2013 dividend payout to a range of 30 
      percent to 35 percent of 2013 comparable and currency neutral earnings 
      per share. This would be the sixth straight year of dividend increases 
      and represents an expected annualized 2013 dividend increase of at least 
      15 percent above 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			LONG-TERM OUTLOOK AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company affirms its long-term growth targets, with net sales growth 
      of 4 percent to 6 percent, operating income growth of 6 percent to 8 
      percent, high single-digit earnings per share growth, and an annual 
      increase of at least 20 basis points for return on invested capital. 
      Each target is comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term outlook for capital spending has been revised to a range 
      of 4 percent to 4&#189; percent of net sales, down from approximately 5 
      percent, driven primarily by a continued focus on prudent capital 
      management and the impact of the French excise tax increase adding to 
      net sales. The company also affirmed its long-term capital structure 
      operating target in a range of 2.5 times to 3.0 times net debt to EBITDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Looking ahead to 2013, CCE expects to end the year with a net debt to 
      EBITDA ratio of no less than 2.5 times, reflecting the impact of 
      potential MA activity, strategies for returning cash to shareowners, or 
      a combination of both. The company expects to end 2012 with just over 2 
      times net debt to EBITDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As our actions over the last several years and our outlook demonstrate, 
      we remain clearly focused on generating value. We are managing our 
      business, income statement, and balance sheet to continue to generate 
      strong free cash flow, drive consistent, long-term profitable growth, 
      and ultimately to create shareowner value,&#8221; said Bill Douglas, executive 
      vice president and chief financial officer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2013 OPERATING OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For 2013, CCE expects earnings per diluted share to grow approximately 
      10 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Although it is 
      too early to predict the 2013 currency impact, based on recent rates, 
      currency translation would have a slightly positive impact on full-year 
      earnings per share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net sales and operating income are expected to grow in a 
      mid-single-digit range. This guidance reflects declining gross margins 
      with expected net pricing per case growth less than an above-average 
      cost of sales per case growth in 2013. While CCE remains committed to 
      preserving or expanding margins over time, in light of sustained 
      macroeconomic weakness and marketplace conditions we will have a more 
      modest approach in 2013. As a result, operating income margins are 
      expected to be down modestly. This outlook is comparable and currency 
      neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company also expects 2013 free cash flow in a range of $450 million 
      to $500 million after including a year-over-year increase in cash 
      restructuring expenses of approximately $125 million. Capital 
      expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million. Weighted 
      average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 percent and the 
      comparable effective tax rate for 2013 is expected to be in a range of 
      26 percent to 28 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We look forward to building on the marketplace opportunities we see in 
      2013 through enhancements of our product and package portfolio, solid 
      marketing efforts, and excellent programs with our customers,&#8221; said 
      Hubert Patricot, executive vice president and president, European Group. 
      &#8220;These initiatives will allow us to build on the popularity of our Red, 
      Black, and Silver portfolio, continue to provide superior levels of 
      customer service, and match our products and packages with evolving 
      consumer preferences.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These elements of our work are essential to our success, and ultimately 
      will enable us to continue to achieve our most important goal &#8211; creating 
      increased value for our shareowners.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2012 OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For 2012, CCE expects comparable earnings per diluted share in a range 
      of $2.20 to $2.24, with results expected at the high end of the range, 
      including the negative impact of currency translation. Currency 
      translation will decrease full-year comparable earnings per diluted 
      share approximately 7&#189; percent. Net sales and operating income are 
      expected to grow in a low to mid-single-digit range. Our outlook for 
      earnings per diluted share, net sales, and operating income is 
      comparable and includes the impact of the French excise tax increase. 
      Net sales and operating income guidance is also currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on recent currency rates, the company now expects 2012 free cash 
      flow of approximately $500 million, with capital expenditures of 
      approximately $375 million. Weighted average cost of debt is expected to 
      be approximately 3 percent and the comparable effective tax rate for 
      2012 is expected to be in a range of 26 percent to 27 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SHARE REPURCHASE AND DIVIDENDS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company has completed its most recent share repurchase program by 
      reaching the cumulative 65 million maximum number of repurchased shares 
      authorized by the Board of Directors. During 2012, this resulted in 27 
      million shares or $780 million in shares repurchased.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, the Board of Directors has approved a new $1.5 billion 
      share repurchase program &#8211; the third program since the 2010 completion 
      of the transaction that created the new CCE. At least $500 million in 
      repurchases are expected under this program in 2013. These plans may be 
      adjusted depending on economic, operating, or other factors, including 
      acquisition opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE also expects to increase its 2013 dividend payout to a range of 30 
      percent to 35 percent of 2013 comparable and currency neutral earnings 
      per share. This would be the sixth straight year of dividend increases 
      and represents an expected annualized 2013 dividend increase of at least 
      15 percent above 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			LONG-TERM OUTLOOK AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company affirms its long-term growth targets, with net sales growth 
      of 4 percent to 6 percent, operating income growth of 6 percent to 8 
      percent, high single-digit earnings per share growth, and an annual 
      increase of at least 20 basis points for return on invested capital. 
      Each target is comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term outlook for capital spending has been revised to a range 
      of 4 percent to 4&#189; percent of net sales, down from approximately 5 
      percent, driven primarily by a continued focus on prudent capital 
      management and the impact of the French excise tax increase adding to 
      net sales. The company also affirmed its long-term capital structure 
      operating target in a range of 2.5 times to 3.0 times net debt to EBITDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Looking ahead to 2013, CCE expects to end the year with a net debt to 
      EBITDA ratio of no less than 2.5 times, reflecting the impact of 
      potential MA activity, strategies for returning cash to shareowners, or 
      a combination of both. The company expects to end 2012 with just over 2 
      times net debt to EBITDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As our actions over the last several years and our outlook demonstrate, 
      we remain clearly focused on generating value. We are managing our 
      business, income statement, and balance sheet to continue to generate 
      strong free cash flow, drive consistent, long-term profitable growth, 
      and ultimately to create shareowner value,&#8221; said Bill Douglas, executive 
      vice president and chief financial officer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2013 OPERATING OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For 2013, CCE expects earnings per diluted share to grow approximately 
      10 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Although it is 
      too early to predict the 2013 currency impact, based on recent rates, 
      currency translation would have a slightly positive impact on full-year 
      earnings per share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net sales and operating income are expected to grow in a 
      mid-single-digit range. This guidance reflects declining gross margins 
      with expected net pricing per case growth less than an above-average 
      cost of sales per case growth in 2013. While CCE remains committed to 
      preserving or expanding margins over time, in light of sustained 
      macroeconomic weakness and marketplace conditions we will have a more 
      modest approach in 2013. As a result, operating income margins are 
      expected to be down modestly. This outlook is comparable and currency 
      neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company also expects 2013 free cash flow in a range of $450 million 
      to $500 million after including a year-over-year increase in cash 
      restructuring expenses of approximately $125 million. Capital 
      expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million. Weighted 
      average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 percent and the 
      comparable effective tax rate for 2013 is expected to be in a range of 
      26 percent to 28 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We look forward to building on the marketplace opportunities we see in 
      2013 through enhancements of our product and package portfolio, solid 
      marketing efforts, and excellent programs with our customers,&#8221; said 
      Hubert Patricot, executive vice president and president, European Group. 
      &#8220;These initiatives will allow us to build on the popularity of our Red, 
      Black, and Silver portfolio, continue to provide superior levels of 
      customer service, and match our products and packages with evolving 
      consumer preferences.&#8221;

* Full-year 2012 comparable earnings per diluted share are expected at the high
end of our previously disclosed range of $2.20 to $2.24.
* CCE has completed the most recent share repurchase program in 2012, with
full-year purchases totaling 27 million shares or $780 million.
* Board of Directors has authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program,
with at least $500 million of planned purchases in 2013.
* 2013 comparable and currency neutral earnings per diluted share are expected

ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Regulatory News: 

Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE/Euronext Paris: CCE) today affirmed diluted earnings
per share guidance for full-year 2012 in a range of $2.20 to $2.24, with results
expected at the high end of the range. Also, the company expects to achieve 2013
earnings per diluted share growth of approximately 10 percent on a comparable
and currency neutral basis. 

"Our 2012 results will reflect our ability to deliver solid earnings growth by
closely managing each aspect of our business and continuing world class
marketplace execution in difficult operating conditions," said John F. Brock,
chairman and chief executive officer. "Going forward, we will rely on our global
operating framework, our successful brands, increased effectiveness through our
business transformation effort, and the skill and dedication of our employees. 

"These elements of our work are essential to our success, and ultimately will
enable us to continue to achieve our most important goal - creating increased
value for our shareowners." 

2012 OUTLOOK

For 2012, CCE expects comparable earnings per diluted share in a range of $2.20
to $2.24, with results expected at the high end of the range, including the
negative impact of currency translation. Currency translation will decrease
full-year comparable earnings per diluted share approximately 7&#189; percent. Net
sales and operating income are expected to grow in a low to mid-single-digit
range. Our outlook for earnings per diluted share, net sales, and operating
income is comparable and includes the impact of the French excise tax increase.
Net sales and operating income guidance is also currency neutral. 

Based on recent currency rates, the company now expects 2012 free cash flow of
approximately $500 million, with capital expenditures of approximately $375
million. Weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 percent
and the comparable effective tax rate for 2012 is expected to be in a range of
26 percent to 27 percent. 

SHARE REPURCHASE AND DIVIDENDS

The company has completed its most recent share repurchase program by reaching
the cumulative 65 million maximum number of repurchased shares authorized by the
Board of Directors. During 2012, this resulted in 27 million shares or $780
million in shares repurchased. 

In addition, the Board of Directors has approved a new $1.5 billion share
repurchase program - the third program since the 2010 completion of the
transaction that created the new CCE. At least $500 million in repurchases are
expected under this program in 2013. These plans may be adjusted depending on
economic, operating, or other factors, including acquisition opportunities. 

CCE also expects to increase its 2013 dividend payout to a range of 30 percent
to 35 percent of 2013 comparable and currency neutral earnings per share. This
would be the sixth straight year of dividend increases and represents an
expected annualized 2013 dividend increase of at least 15 percent above 2012. 

LONG-TERM OUTLOOK AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE

The company affirms its long-term growth targets, with net sales growth of 4
percent to 6 percent, operating income growth of 6 percent to 8 percent, high
single-digit earnings per share growth, and an annual increase of at least 20
basis points for return on invested capital. Each target is comparable and
currency neutral. 

The long-term outlook for capital spending has been revised to a range of 4
percent to 4&#189; percent of net sales, down from approximately 5 percent, driven
primarily by a continued focus on prudent capital management and the impact of
the French excise tax increase adding to net sales. The company also affirmed
its long-term capital structure operating target in a range of 2.5 times to 3.0
times net debt to EBITDA. 

Looking ahead to 2013, CCE expects to end the year with a net debt to EBITDA
ratio of no less than 2.5 times, reflecting the impact of potential M
activity, strategies for returning cash to shareowners, or a combination of
both. The company expects to end 2012 with just over 2 times net debt to EBITDA.


"As our actions over the last several years and our outlook demonstrate, we
remain clearly focused on generating value. We are managing our business, income
statement, and balance sheet to continue to generate strong free cash flow,
drive consistent, long-term profitable growth, and ultimately to create
shareowner value," said Bill Douglas, executive vice president and chief
financial officer. 

2013 OPERATING OUTLOOK

For 2013, CCE expects earnings per diluted share to grow approximately 10
percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Although it is too early to
predict the 2013 currency impact, based on recent rates, currency translation
would have a slightly positive impact on full-year earnings per share. 

Net sales and operating income are expected to grow in a mid-single-digit range.
This guidance reflects declining gross margins with expected net pricing per
case growth less than an above-average cost of sales per case growth in 2013.
While CCE remains committed to preserving or expanding margins over time, in
light of sustained macroeconomic weakness and marketplace conditions we will
have a more modest approach in 2013. As a result, operating income margins are
expected to be down modestly. This outlook is comparable and currency neutral. 

The company also expects 2013 free cash flow in a range of $450 million to $500
million after including a year-over-year increase in cash restructuring expenses
of approximately $125 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be
approximately $350 million. Weighted average cost of debt is expected to be
approximately 3 percent and the comparable effective tax rate for 2013 is
expected to be in a range of 26 percent to 28 percent.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades 18 classes of JP Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage
Securities Corp., series 2006-LDP9. A detailed listing of rating actions follows
at the end of this release. 

The downgrades reflect an increase in Fitch modeled losses across the pool. This
includes an increase in expected losses including many loans in special
servicing with lower appraisal values and increasing fees and expenses. Many of
the loans with modeled losses are in weaker markets, which may prolong workouts.
Additionally, Fitch is concerned with several large malls with weaker anchors
which may be susceptible to future occupancy declines. 

Fitch modeled losses of 17.5% of the remaining pool. Expected losses of the
original pool balance are at 18.2%, including losses already incurred to date.
Fitch has identified 77 loans as Fitch Loans of Concern (51.3%), including 25
loans (24.1%) in special servicing. As of the December 2012 distribution date,
the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 11.3% to $4.31
billion from $4.85 billion at issuance. Interest shortfalls are affecting up
through A-JS in loan group S and up through D in loan group R Loan. Group S
represent loans with initial terms to maturity of five to seven years. Loans in
Group R contained terms of 10 or more years. Cumulative unpaid interest totals
$21.1 million. 

The largest contributor to losses (8.7% of the pool balance) is secured by a
215-unit residential rental property located in the Upper West Side neighborhood
of New York City. In addition to the residential rentals, the property also
includes 60,514 square feet (sf) of retail space. The property consists of both
rent controlled/stabilized and market rent units. At issuance, the borrower
estimated that units would be converted from rent controlled/stabilized to
market rents benefiting from the upside in revenue. 

The loan transferred to the special servicer in June 2011 for imminent default.
The servicer reported occupancy rate was 94.5% as of Oct. 2012. The servicer
reported debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 0.65x as of Aug. 31, 2012,
compared to 98% and 1.35 underwritten at issuance. The 1.35x DSCR represents the
underwritten pro forma cash flows. At issuance, the loan had a $50 million
reserve for debt service shortfalls. The reserve has been depleted. 

The second largest contributor to losses (4.5%) is secured by a portfolio of
four cold storage warehouse/distribution facilities totaling 3,328,621 sf
(51,654,912 cubic feet) located across four states. The properties are located
in Carthage, MO (66% of portfolio NRA); Fort Worth, TX (14.3% of portfolio NRA);
West Point, MS (10.3% of portfolio NRA) and Garden City, KS (9.5% of portfolio
NRA). The servicer reported DSCR for YE 2011 and issuance was 0.60x and 1.85x,
respectively. The drop in DSCR is attributed to the loss of a major tenant,
Sarah Lee, which has ceased renting space in the Fort Worth property. This Fort
Worth property has since been closed in an effort to reduce operating expenses.
As of second quarter-2012 (2Q'12), the weighted average portfolio occupancy was
59%. 

The third largest contributor to losses (2.3%) is secured by a 1,253,499 sf
class A office property in Atlanta, GA. The loan transferred to the special
servicer in February 2011 due to imminent default. The property has been a Real
Estate Owned (REO) asset since Feb. 2012. The property is currently 50%
occupied, compared to 100% at issuance primarily due to the vacancy of Ernest &amp;
Young in 2007 and Bank of America downsizing. 

Fitch has downgraded the following classes as indicated: 

--$86.4 million class A-2 to 'AAsf' from 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$291.8 million class A-2S to 'AAsf' from 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

--$50 million class D to 'Csf' from 'CCsf'; RE 0%; 

--$16.7 million class D-S to 'Csf' from 'CCsf'; RE 0%; 

Additionally, Fitch downgraded, removed from Rating Watch Negative and assigned
a Negative Outlook to the following classes: 

--$364 million class A-M to 'Bsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook Negative; 

--$121.4 million class A-MS to 'Bsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook Negative. 

Fitch has also affirmed the following classes as indicated: 

--$40.9 million class E at 'Csf'; RE to 0%; 

--$13.7 million class E- Sat 'Csf'; RE to 0%; 

--$40.9 million class F at 'Csf'; RE to 0%;

--$36.4 million class G at 'Csf'; RE to 0%; 

--$12.1 million class G-S at 'Csf'; RE to 0%; 

--$33.7 million class H at 'Dsf'; RE to 0%; 

--$11.2 million class H-S at 'Dsf'; RE to 0%. 

Classes J through P have been depleted due to realized losses and remain at
'Dsf' RE 0%. Classes A-1 and A-1S have paid in full. Class NR is not rated by
Fitch. Fitch has previously withdrawn the ratings of the interest only class X.

is available in its Dec. 18 report ('U.S. Fixed-Rate Multiborrower CMBS
Surveillance and Re-REMIC Criteria'), available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 

Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. The ratings above
were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore, Fitch has been
compensated for the provision of the ratings.

About Synageva`s Lead Program

Sebelipase alfa is a recombinant form of the human LAL enzyme under development
by Synageva as an enzyme replacement therapy for LAL Deficiency, a lysosomal
storage disorder (LSD). Synageva is currently evaluating sebelipase alfa in

patients, the buildup of fatty material in the liver, spleen and blood vessel
walls leads to complications resulting in significant morbidity and mortality.
Early onset LAL Deficiency, sometimes called Wolman disease, affects infants and
is characterized by severe malabsorption, growth failure, and liver failure and
is usually fatal within the first six months of life.

Forward-Looking Statements

This news release contains "forward-looking statements" under the provisions of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements can be
identified by introductory words such as "expects," "plans," "intends,"
"believes," "will," "estimates," "forecasts," "projects," or words of similar
meaning and by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or
current facts. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from
forward-looking statements, including inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety
of risks and uncertainties, some of which are known, including those identified
under the heading "Risk Factors" in the Company`s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on November 6,
2012, and other filings Synageva periodically makes with the SEC and others of
which are not. Synageva cannot be sure when or if it will be permitted by
regulatory agencies to undertake additional clinical trials or to commence any
particular phase of clinical trials or how quickly patient enrollment in
clinical trials will occur. In addition, early clinical results are not
necessarily predictive of results that may be achieved from subsequent clinical
trials. Because of this, statements regarding the expected timing of clinical
trials or ultimate regulatory approval cannot be regarded as actual predictions
of when Synageva will obtain regulatory approval for any phase of clinical
trials or when it will obtain ultimate regulatory approval by a particular
regulatory agency or when any of its drug product candidates might be
commercialized. Synageva`s future financial results may differ from those
currently anticipated due to a number of factors, including unanticipated costs
in its research and development programs, fluctuations in royalty revenues and
unplanned costs associated with maintaining and enforcing patents and other
patent-related costs. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future
results or events, and investors should avoid placing undue reliance on such
statements. Synageva undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

HUNTINGDON VALLEY, Pa., Dec. 19, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - Luxury Life Icons has
finalized a formal partnership with the MLB Players Alumni Association, MGM Grand Las Vegas and
Walters Golf to develop and produce an invitation-only series of unique experiences with Baseball
Hall of Fame sports icons to be hosted at MGM Grand in Las Vegas May 16-19, 2013. The goals of
these events are to provide customized and personalized experiences that are both pleasing for the
fans and the icons. Participating icon and Baseball Hall of Famer, Wade Boggs, shared that "other
events rarely provide Hall of Famers the opportunity to relax with small groups of fans at a
luxury resort." He added that he "looks forward to sharing stories from the 1986 &amp; 1996 World
Series with guests."

One of the unique components of the experience is that a significant portion of the weekend can be
customized according to guest preferences. Each guest will be assigned a personal concierge to
specifically cater to his or her needs.

As part of the experience, guests will have numerous opportunities to interact with icons in
intimate settings. This includes private group dinners and roundtables with Hall of Fame sports
icons, a Dream Sports Day Experience and a Dream Golf Experience.

Rollie Fingers, Baseball Hall of Famer, explained his experience working with many fantasy camps,
golf tournaments and dinners but, "really looks forward to participating in this exclusive next
level experience packed with personalized events for guests with different Icons all in one
extended weekend."

This four-day event with an unprecedented 1:8 guest to icon ratio provides the most personal
interaction with sports icons than any other in the industry.

This allows each guest to have the experience of a personal interaction with the Baseball Hall of
Famer. A sentiment shared by Baseball Hall of Famer, Bob Gibson, "I am excited to be participating
in this unique event with my fellow Hall of Famers that will allow us to spend quality time
getting to know and talk baseball with every guest." The roster of confirmed Baseball Hall of Fame
icons thus far includes Joe Morgan, Rollie Fingers, Robin Young, Steve Carlton, Wade Boggs and Bob
Gibson.

The event will cater to elite sports fans, therefore the experience will be sensitive to the needs
of this VIP fan base. As such, upon registration they will be assigned their personal concierge
specialist to ensure their needs are fully met. They will also receive VIP ground transportation
to events, access to a team of private sports medicine providers, luxury SWAG and generous resort
credit from MGM Grand. Guests will also take home official, personalized uniforms and apparel and
authenticated, highly valued collectibles personally signed by sports icons at the event.

Chris Torgusen, VP of Marketing, Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association, said, "We are
excited to be part of this prestigious event with Luxury Life Icons to allow the elite sports fan
the exclusive opportunity to interact with some of the greatest baseball players on a personal
basis."

&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine energy company YPF (YPFD.BA) (YPF.N) signed a partnership deal with U.S. oil major Chevron Corp (CVX.N) on Wednesday that aims to pave the way for major investment in the South American country's vast shale oil resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF's chief executive, Miguel Galuccio, said earlier this month he expected his company to finalize a joint venture agreement with Chevron -- Argentina's fourth-largest oil producer -- before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galuccio and Ali Moshiri, Chevron's head of operations for Latin America and Africa, said Wednesday's letter of intent established a pilot program to drill 100 non-conventional oil wells at a cost of about $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of a deal for YPF to transfer a 50 percent interest in the Loma de la Lata Norte and Loma Campana fields, which cover an area of nearly 300 square kilometers , will be negotiated over the next four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The question is going to be how big the investment will be beyond the pilot," Moshiri told reporters in Buenos Aires via video conference. "Our goal is to start as soon as possible. What we need is to push our teams to put a definitive agreement together as soon as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galuccio, who was appointed soon after President Cristina Fernandez nationalized YPF in May, called the preliminary accord "a very important day for YPF."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YPF has said that to boost output it needs to invest more than $30 billion in the next five years, $4.5 billion of which is to come from strategic partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pilot drilling program should be completed over the next year and both companies will help fund the cost, although they declined to say whether it would be split equally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HUGE RESOURCES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argentina sits on huge resources of shale natural gas and oil, but large amounts of capital would be needed to bring them into production. The country remains virtually shut out of global credit markets a decade after staging the biggest sovereign debt default in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, YPF announced the discovery of the mammoth Vaca Muerta ("Dead Cow") formation in southern Argentina, which contains an estimated 23 billion barrels of oil equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galuccio said fully developing the two Vaca Muerta areas where the pilot project is based would require an investment of up to $15 billion and the drilling of as many as 2,000 wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Fernandez seized control of YPF, she accused former parent Repsol (REP.MC) of under-investing at a time of growing Argentine energy demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Argentina seized control of Repsol's majority stake in YPF, the Spanish oil company threatened to file legal action against any company that partnered with the Argentine company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making good on its threat, Repsol filed a U.S. lawsuit to block Chevron's partnership with YPF, adding to Chevron's legal challenges in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate case, a judge ordered an embargo on up to $19 billion worth of Chevron's assets in Argentina last month in connection with an environmental lawsuit by Ecuadorean villagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Helen Popper, Hilary Burke and Alejandro Lifschitz in Buenos Aires and Anna Driver in Houston; Writing by Helen Popper; Editing by Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;

year and both companies will help fund the cost, although they
declined to say whether it would be split equally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HUGE RESOURCES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argentina sits on huge resources of shale natural gas and
oil, but large amounts of capital would be needed to bring them
into production. The country remains virtually shut out of
global credit markets a decade after staging the biggest
sovereign debt default in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, YPF announced the discovery of the mammoth Vaca
Muerta ("Dead Cow") formation in southern Argentina, which
contains an estimated 23 billion barrels of oil equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galuccio said fully developing the two Vaca Muerta areas
where the pilot project is based would require an investment of
up to $15 billion and the drilling of as many as 2,000 wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Fernandez seized control of YPF, she accused former
parent Repsol of under-investing at a time of growing
Argentine energy demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Argentina seized control of Repsol's majority stake in
YPF, the Spanish oil company threatened to file legal action
against any company that partnered with the Argentine
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making good on its threat, Repsol filed a U.S. lawsuit to
block Chevron's partnership with YPF, adding to Chevron's legal
challenges in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate case, a judge ordered an embargo on up to $19
billion worth of Chevron's assets in Argentina last month in
connection with an environmental lawsuit by Ecuadorean
villagers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/8knews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20121219:nBw196420a

MINNEAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
Businesses often must follow strict accounting practices to safeguard their
customers and maintain compliance with industry regulations, even when a third
party provides essential services. To answer this need for network partners and
participants, Syncada successfully completed the requirements of the Statements
on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 (SSAE 16), as established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. This marks the ninth
successful completion of an external audit on the technology platform that
supports the Syncada network, the first seven being Statement on Auditing
Standards No. 70 (SAS 70) Type II certifications. 

Many organizations use outside service providers to manage processes that affect
the organization`s financial reporting, yet the organization is legally
responsible throughout. For example, in the United States, section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) requires an annual assessment of internal controls to
ensure financial reporting accuracy. Therefore, the organization must either
conduct an evaluation or obtain a successful report from the service provider. 

The SSAE 16 is substantially equivalent to International Standard on Assurance
Engagements 3402 (ISAE 3402), "Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service
Organization." Independent auditors conducted comprehensive tests and reviews of
multiple systems at Syncada. By maintaining this certification, Syncada
continues to meet the needs of its partner banks and their customers located
around the world. 

"Our partners require secure, stable systems and process controls to protect
their data and their businesses," states Kurt Schneiber, Chief Executive Officer
at Syncada. "We attain this attestation as part of our commitment to operational
excellence, ensuring our customers can meet global standards for financial
reporting and comply with their local regulations."

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Microsoft Corp.'s (Microsoft) ratings as follows: 

--Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA+'; 

--Senior unsecured debt at 'AA+'; 

--Short-Term IDR at 'F1+'; 

--Commercial paper (CP) program at 'F1+'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. Approximately $14 billion of debt is affected by
Fitch's action, including Microsoft's issuance of $2.25 billion of senior notes
on Nov. 7, 2012. 

Microsoft's ratings and Outlook reflect the following: 

--Fitch anticipates mid-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal year 2013 ending
June 30, primarily supported by several new major software product
introductions, including Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 and Office 2013, which
is expected to be released near the end of calendar year 2012. 

Consumer demand for Windows 8 will also be facilitated by the greater
availability and broader selection of touch-enabled PCs in a variety of form
factors from original equipment manufacturers. Continued macroeconomic
challenges led by Europe and enterprise delays in adopting new PC operating
systems will temper near-term growth of Windows 8. 

--Surface will contribute minimally to free cash flow (FCF) in 2013, given the
initial lack of scale and highly competitive landscape for tablets. Microsoft's
Surface Pro tablet, expected in early calendar 2013, is likely to be a
commercial success given its compatibility with Microsoft Office applications,
enhanced security and easier manageability. Critical success factors for Surface
Pro will be battery life, cost and availability of key apps. 

--Fitch believes Microsoft has strengthened its position in the mobile phone
market in the past year as a result of licensing agreements with the vast
majority of Android device manufacturers and the launch of Windows phone 8 in
late October 2012. 

--The company's Online and Entertainment &amp; Devices segments (Bing, Xbox, Skype,
Windows Phone, etc.) will continue to be a drag on profitability over the
intermediate term. These segments remain a critical component of Microsoft's
longer-term strategy in the consumer market; however, competition remains fierce
and Fitch does not expect these segments to contribute materially to FCF for the
foreseeable future. 

--Fitch expects Microsoft to continue to produce strong FCF, in excess of $15
billion per year, which the company uses to fund its share repurchase and
dividend programs. Fitch expects cash generation from operations to be strong
enough to pay for modest annual increases in both dividends and share
repurchases over the next several years excluding potential for meaningful
acquisitions. Fitch expects all repurchases will be done within the context of
FCF. 

--The company's sizable liquidity and superior credit profile provide a
significant degree of financial flexibility within the current ratings. Going
forward, Fitch believes Microsoft will become more active with acquisitions and
share buybacks over time but continue to maintain a significant net cash
position. 

--Absent broader corporate tax reform, Fitch does not expect any negative
outcome from Microsoft's recent tax hearings with the Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. 

Credit Strengths: 

--Leading market positioning in its core software businesses, including over 90%
in PC operating systems (OS) and 75% in servers. 

--Very strong balance sheet with $66 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Microsoft generates nearly $1 billion in pretax income from interest and
dividends alone. 

--Diversification of end market with consumers and enterprise demand as well as
strong geographic diversification. No customer is larger than 10% of revenue. 

Credit Concerns: 

--Reliance on Windows and Office for the vast majority of FCF. In aggregate,
these products accounted for nearly 80% of total operating income, excluding
unallocated corporate level expenses. However, strong growth and margin
expansion in the Server and Tools business has reduced the contribution of
Windows and Office from a four-year high of nearly 89%. 

--Growing popularity of other operating systems outside of the core PC space,
principally Apple's iOS as well as Google's Android and Chrome platforms. Fitch
believes both platforms will continue to grow as competitive threats to Windows.


--Extension of PC replacement cycle due to the popularity of tablets and
smartphones. 

--Minimal historical success in developing profitable consumer businesses
outside of Microsoft's core Windows and Office ecosystem despite significant
investment over a decade-plus in other consumer markets. Fitch believes this is
indicative of the challenging competitive environment. 

--Significant dividend and share repurchase programs, though funded entirely
today by FCF, could pressure the company to issue increasing amounts of debt to
avoid repatriation of foreign earnings, which represent the majority of total
annual FCF. 

WHAT COULD TRIGGER A RATING ACTION 

Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to
negative rating action include: 

--Penetration of alternative operating system's such as Chrome OS in the PC
market and/or greater market share gains by Apple; 

--Greater than expected extensions of PC replacement cycles because of tablets,
without a commensurate gain from Microsoft Surface. Fitch currently expects PC
replacement cycles to extend on average up to 12 months. 

--Greater acceptance of cheaper software applications that compete with
Microsoft Office such as Google Docs. 

Positive: Upside movement on the ratings is unlikely.

&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES Dec 19 (Reuters) - Argentine energy company
YPF  and U.S. oil major Chevron Corp 
will sign a partnership deal to develop the South American
country's vast shale energy resources, a YPF source said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source spoke just before a news conference in the United
States at which YPF Chief Executive Miguel Galuccio and
Chevron's head of operations for Latin America and Africa, Ali
Moshiri, were due to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 19 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Argentine energy
company YPF  is in the United States to discuss
the final details of a deal with Chevron Corp to jointly
develop the South American country's huge shale resources,
industry sources said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF CEO Miguel Galuccio said earlier this month he expected
his company to finalize a deal with Chevron, and another deal
with Argentine company Bridas Holding, before the end of the
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two industry sources in Buenos Aires, who asked not to be
named, said Galuccio was in Houston on Wednesday with Chevron
executives. YPF declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YPF, nationalized in May, says that to boost output it needs
to invest more than $30 billion in the next five years, $4.5
billion of which is to come from strategic partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signing commercial terms between YPF and Chevron would build
on an accord the two signed in September. Spanish oil company
Repsol has filed a U.S. lawsuit to block that initial
pact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Argentina seized control of Repsol's majority stake in
YPF in April, Repsol threatened to file legal action against any
company that partnered with the Argentine company.&lt;/p&gt;

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/d3t2g4/global_big_data) has
announced the addition of the "Global Big Data Market in the Healthcare Sector
2011-2015" report to their offering. 

TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Big Data market in the Healthcare
sector to grow at a CAGR of 32.96 percent over the period 2011-2015. One of the
key factors contributing to this market growth is the growing data explosion.
The Global Big Data market in the Healthcare sector has also been witnessing the
emergence of epidemiology. However, the issues with data quality could pose a
challenge to the growth of this market. 

The other vendors mentioned in the report are: Cloudera Inc., MapR Technologies
Inc., DNAnexus Inc., GNS Healthcare Inc., NextBio Inc., Appistry Inc., Health
Fidelity Inc., Predixion Software Inc. 100plus, Welldoc Inc., Humedica Inc.,
Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., Explorys Inc., and Sproxil Inc. 

Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Enterprise Computing team
said: ''Usage of big data for epidemiology, which is study of health-related
issues across a wide network of geography, is one of the major trends of the
Global Big Data market in the Healthcare sector. Big data solutions help in the
assessment, monitoring, and analysis of the spread of a disease among the
inhabitants. This technology also helps in determining the reason behind global
or local disease outbreaks. The increasing number of epidemics, significantly in
the developing countries, and technological advancements of healthcare
organizations to control such epidemics has increased the popularity of
epidemiology. Therefore, the emergence of epidemiology is a major trend in the
Healthcare sector which might drive the Big Data market in future years.'' 

According to the report, one of the major drivers for big data solutions in the
Healthcare sector is the need to improve the availability and transparency of
vast amounts of data stored across enterprises. Mostly, the healthcare
enterprises are not aware of the potential benefits of data stored in their
databases. Big data solutions help such enterprises in leveraging this vast pool
of data for better and improved patient care. The big data technology provides
actionable insights to healthcare providers based on the understanding of the
entire population. Patients can also have a better view of their health.
Therefore, efficiency in data analysis can result in better decision-making both
by decision-makers as well as by patients.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 19 - Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following offshore money market
funds managed by JP Morgan Asset Management (UK) Limited (JPMAM) and JPMorgan
Investment Management Inc (JPMIM), subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
(JPM), as follows:

JPMorgan Liquidity Funds - Euro Government Liquidity Fund affirmed at 'AAAmmf'
JPMorgan Liquidity Funds - Sterling Gilt Liquidity Fund affirmed at 'AAAmmf'
JPMorgan Liquidity Funds - US Dollar Treasury Liquidity Fund affirmed at
'AAAmmf'
JPMorgan Liquidity Funds - US Dollar Government Liquidity Fund affirmed at
'AAAmmf'

KEY RATING DRIVERS:

The main drivers for the affirmations are:

--The funds' overall credit quality, liquidity and diversification;
--The funds' minimal exposure to interest rate and spread risks;
--Maturity profile and available liquidity in line with the rating criteria;
--The capabilities and resources of JPMAM and JPMIM as investment advisor.

The money market funds' 'AAAmmf' rating reflects the extremely strong capacity
to achieve the investment objectives of preserving principal and providing
shareholder liquidity through limiting credit, market and liquidity risk.

FUND CREDIT QUALITY/DIVERSIFICATION
Consistent with Fitch's 'AAAmmf' rating criteria, the funds seek to maintain a
high credit quality by investing exclusively in securities rated at least 'F1'
or equivalent and by entering into repurchase agreements with counterparties
rated at least 'F1' with appropriate collateral and margining policies. In line
with the funds' investment policies, they only invest in government, government
agency and supranational securities and repurchase agreements collateralised by
such securities.

MATURITY PROFILE
The funds seek to limit interest rate and spread risk consistent with Fitch's
ratings criteria for funds rated 'AAAmmf'. The funds limit weighted average
maturity (WAM) and weighted average life (WAL) to 60 days and 120 days,
respectively. As of end-November 2012 the funds complied with Fitch's WAM and
WAL guidelines.

LIQUIDITY PROFILE
The funds' additional investment restrictions are aimed at maintaining
sufficient levels of daily and weekly liquidity to meet investors' redemption
requests. In line with Fitch's rating criteria applicable to money market funds
globally, the funds invest at least 10% of total assets in securities maturing
overnight or other qualifying assets such as government securities and at least
25% of total assets in securities maturing within seven days or other qualified
assets. As these are government funds investing primarily in 'eligible'
securities, Fitch considers liquidity levels in these funds exceptionally high.

FUND OBJECTIVES
The funds seek to achieve a return in line with prevailing money market rates
whilst aiming to preserve capital consistent with such rates and to maintain a
high degree of liquidity. The funds invest only in short-term eurozone, UK
government debt and US Treasuries respectively, along with related government
agencies and supranationals and in repurchase agreements with highly rated
counterparties, backed by eurozone governments, UK government, US Treasury and
government agency collateral.

As of end November 2012 the funds had approximately EUR2.2bn, GBP750m, USD1.8bn
(Government) and USD38.5bn (Treasuries) in assets under management respectively.

INVESTMENT ADVISOR
JPMAM is investment advisor to the euro and sterling denominated funds and JPMIM
is the investment advisor to the US dollar denominated funds. Both are wholly
owned subsidiaries of JPM ('A+'/Stable/'F1'). JPM is a major global provider of
custody, clearing and other securities services and one of the world's largest
cash managers. Fitch views JPM, JPMAM and JPMIM's investment advisory
capabilities, financial and resource commitments, operational controls,
corporate governance, and compliance procedures as consistent with the 'AAAmmf'
rating assigned to the funds.

RATING SENSITIVITY AND SURVEILLANCE
The ratings may be sensitive to material changes in the credit quality or market
risk profiles of the fund. A material and sustained adverse deviation from Fitch
guidelines for any key rating driver could cause the ratings to be downgraded by
Fitch. Furthermore, given the funds' primary investment focus on government and
government agency securities, the ratings may be sensitive to material adverse
changes in sovereign credit quality.

Fitch receives weekly fund holdings information and other pertinent fund data
from the funds' administrator to conduct surveillance against ratings guidelines
and maintain its money market fund ratings.

Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.

The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore,
Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.

The sources of information used to assess this rating were the public domain,
JPMAM, JPMIM and JP Morgan Bank Luxembourg S.A. (the fund's custodian).

Applicable criteria, 'Global Money Market Fund Rating Criteria', dated 29 March
2012 are available at www.fitchratings.com.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'AAAmmf' rating assigned to JPMorgan Prime Money
Market Fund managed by JP Morgan Investment Management, Inc. (JPMIM), a wholly
owned indirect subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM). 

KEY RATING DRIVERS: 

--The fund's overall credit quality and diversification; 

--Minimal exposure to interest rate and spread risks; 

--Maturity profile and available liquidity in line with the rating criteria; 

--The capabilities and resources of JPMIM as investment advisor. 

The 'AAAmmf' money market fund rating reflect the fund's extremely strong
capacities to achieve the investment objectives of preserving principal and
providing shareholder liquidity through limiting credit, market and liquidity
risk. 

FUND CREDIT QUALITY/DIVERSIFICATION 

The fund maintains a high credit quality portfolio by investing exclusively in
securities rated at least 'F1' or equivalent. The fund seeks to mitigate
counterparty risk arising from investments in repurchase agreements by
transacting with counterparties rated at least 'F1' or equivalent. The fund has
the ability to enter into overnight and term repurchase agreements backed by a
variety of collateral. In line with the fund's investment policy, the value of
collateral exceeds the value of the repurchase agreement by a specified
overcollateralization rate. Fitch views these policies as consistent with the
assigned rating. 

At the time of the affirmation the fund's Portfolio Credit Factor (PCF) met
Fitch's 'AAAmmf' rating criterion of 1.50 or less. The PCF is a risk-weighted
measure of the fund's assets that accounts for the credit quality and maturity
profile of the fund's securities. 

MATURITY PROFILE 

The fund limits its weighted average maturity (WAM) and weighted average life
(WAL) to 60 days and 120 days, respectively. As of Nov. 30, 2012, the fund had a
WAM of 56 days and a WAL of 75 days. These parameters are consistent with
Fitch's ratings criteria for funds rated 'AAAmmf'. 

LIQUIDITY PROFILE 

The fund's additional investment restrictions are aimed at maintaining
sufficient levels of daily and weekly liquidity to meet investors' redemption
requests. In line with amended Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of
1940, which governs the investment activities and operations of U.S. money
market funds, the fund must invest at least 10% of total assets in daily liquid
assets and at least 30% of total assets in weekly liquid assets. As of Nov. 30,
2012, the fund met the liquidity requirements mandated by Rule 2a-7 and was also
in line with the liquidity guidelines outlined in Fitch's rating criteria. 

FUND OBJECTIVES 

The fund aims to provide the highest possible level of current income while
still maintaining liquidity and preserving capital. The fund pursues its
investment objectives by investing in a diversified, high-credit quality
portfolio of short-term debt securities including U.S. government and government
agency securities, commercial paper, asset-back commercial paper and other debt
obligations of U.S. and foreign corporations, certificates of deposits, time
deposits and repurchase agreements. As of Nov. 30, 2012, the fund had
approximately $109.6 billion in assets under management. 

INVESTMENT ADVISOR 

JPMIM is a wholly owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Asset Management Holdings Inc.,
which is a wholly owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ('A+/F1'), a bank
holding company. Fitch views JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.'s and JPMIM's investment
advisory capabilities, financial and resource commitments, operational controls,
corporate governance, and compliance procedures as consistent with 'AAAmmf'
rating assigned to the fund. As of Sept. 30, 2012, JPMIM, together with other
asset management divisions of JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co., had approximately $1.4
trillion in assets under management worldwide. 

RATING SENSITIVITY AND SURVEILLANCE: 

The rating may be sensitive to material changes in the credit quality or market
risk profiles of the fund. A material adverse deviation from Fitch guidelines
for any key rating driver could cause the rating to be lowered by Fitch. Given
the fund's primary investment focus on domestic and foreign issuers in the
financial sector, the ratings may be sensitive to material adverse changes in
the financial sector globally. 

Fitch receives weekly fund holdings information and other pertinent fund data
from the fund's administrator to conduct surveillance against ratings guidelines
and maintain its money market fund rating.

&lt;p&gt;LOS GATOS, CA, Dec 19 (Marketwire) -- 
Wanderful Media(TM), a new digital local discovery shopping company based
in Silicon Valley, today announced it has added two accomplished Silicon
Valley veterans to its growing management team. Steve Trefethen will
serve as chief technology officer, while Grace Chan has been appointed as
vice president of product management. Both formerly worked at
MerchantCircle (acquired by Reply!), and have previous experience at
leading Silicon Valley technology companies.

    Trefethen brings Wanderful Media 20 years of high tech experience, with a
strong focus in the digital media industry. He previously held roles as
vice president of technology at Reply!, and as senior member of technical
staff at MerchantCircle. Trefethen also held senior engineering roles at
Borland, CodeGear, Microsoft and Falafel Software.

    Chan too is an accomplished veteran of Silicon Valley's dynamic digital
media industry. Prior to Wanderful Media, she was director of merchant
monetization at MerchantCircle where she was responsible for all
activities related to merchant revenue growth including direct sales,
ecommerce and paid product launches. Prior to MerchantCircle, Chan held
various posts at Yahoo! and Intel.

    These, and other recent leadership additions, position Wanderful Media
strongly within the digital media industry. Backed by a powerful group of
media publishers to reinvent discovery shopping from web to mobile,
Wanderful Media helps retail advertisers reach millions of consumers in
more than 80 percent of U.S. markets. Wanderful Media already owns and
operates the Find n Save(R) brand of over 284 local online discovery
shopping sites covering 47 of the 50 top designated market areas (DMAs).

    Founded in November 2011, Wanderful Media is headquartered in Los Gatos,
Calif., with a development and operations office in Chico, Calif. 

    Supporting Quotes
 "I am thrilled to play a role with Wanderful Media as
the company is moving in an exciting direction. Having worked closely
with much of the Wanderful Media management team before, I've witnessed
first-hand what they can accomplish. There is a ton of buzz already about
Wanderful as the industry has been waiting for a version of discovery
shopping similar to what we are building."
 - Steve Trefethen, CTO of
Wanderful Media

    "Wanderful Media is entering the market at a perfect time. I am delighted
to be chosen to work alongside such an outstanding team and help the
company continue to grow. There's no one-stop shop for finding ways to
save locally -- or for discovering locally-available products.
Additionally, the process of finding, collecting, remembering and
redeeming discounts, coupons and sale events is cumbersome and
time-consuming. We're attacking that problem head on, using web, tablet
and mobile platforms." 
 - Grace Chan, VP of product management of
Wanderful Media

The Coca-Cola Company Introduces (THRED), A New Mobile Game that Aims to Help
End Mother to Child Transmission of HIV by 2015
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company today announced the launch of a free-to-play mobile game,
(THRED), available now on the App Store for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. (THRED)
is a joint project between The Coca-Cola Company and (RED) developed to raise
awareness and funds for the fight to end mother-to-child transmission of HIV by
2015. 

The (THRED) App will help raise money for The Global Fund to fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria - the world's leading financer of programs to fight
these three diseases. Throughout the game, users will have the opportunity to
purchase power-ups and select items via In-App Purchase. All proceeds (excluding
taxes) will be donated to the Global Fund to invest in HIV/AIDS programs in
Africa, including treatment for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of
HIV. 

Developed by BitMonster with an Unreal Engine 3 license donated by Epic Games,
(THRED) is designed to engage consumers in captivating gameplay, through:

* Content: This endless runner genre game takes place in an abstract 3D world of
technological walls, ever-shifting obelisks, living dragon-like gateways and
powerful collectibles. As players progress through the game, they`ll find
amazing colors and shifting walls while the entire soundscape changes with them.

* Visuals: (THRED) delivers an endless flight using Epic Games` Unreal Engine to
push the visuals even further with features including lens flares, blooming
highlights, Fresnel shaders and extensive particle effects. 
* Soundtrack: As part of World AIDS Day, Ti&#235;sto teamed up with (RED) to create
an exclusive compilation album, DANCE (RED), SAVE LIVES, to fight AIDS in
Africa. From the same album, Ti&#235;sto generously donated the Skidka remix of the
Ti&#235;sto &amp; Swanky Tunes track, `Make Some Noise`, for (THRED). Along with
additional music by DJ Poet and TOKiMONSTA, the gorgeous abstract soundscape
creates a phenomenal music experience. 
* Compete with Friends: Dodge obstacles, collect power-ups and improve your
avatar as you compete for high scores with your Game Center friends.

Deborah Dugan, CEO, (RED), said; "(RED) aims to give people as many ways as
possible to join the fight against AIDS. With the launch of (THRED), people can
make an impact with the touch of a button while playing a game they`ll love." 

"Collectively, we have the power to help deliver an AIDS-Free Generation," said
Wendy Clark, Senior Vice President of Integrated Marketing Communications, The
Coca-Cola Company. "We feel that (THRED) is a great way to capture attention and
one that gives everyone the opportunity to contribute their time, money and
networks to help end the transmission of HIV from mothers to their babies by
2015." 

The (THRED) App is available for free on the App Store for iPhone, iPad and iPod
touch or at www.itunes.com/appstore and www.coke.com/THRED. 

To help celebrate the launch of the new game, Actress Emma Roberts is partnering
with The Coca-Cola Company and (RED) to raise awareness around the powerful
impact people can make by playing (THRED) Roberts will lead an online discussion
via a Twitter chat about the mobile game from her @RobertsEmma handle on
Thursday, Dec. 20 at 1:30 pm PST. 

The Coca-Cola Company also will launch a film for television and digital premier
in late December called "Making the Game for (RED)," which chronicles the
behind-the-scenes development of (THRED). 

About The Coca-Cola Company and (RED)

The Coca-Cola Company has committed more than $5 million over the term of the
partnership with (RED) to fund awareness building campaigns and activation
through global Coca-Cola marketing initiatives. As part of this contribution, a
minimum of $3 million will be donated directly to the Global Fund for
distribution of anti-retroviral medicine and educational literature. 

This partnership complements the work The Coca-Cola Company and The Global Fund
are already partnering on in Africa. The two organizations are leveraging
insights from the Coca-Cola supply chain and route-to-market system to help
improve access to critical medicines.

Leading workspace computing company enables organizations and IT solutions
providers to deliver faster, lower-cost Windows migrations and desktop
transformations
NEWBURY, England--(Business Wire)--
Centrix Software, a leading provider of workspace computing solutions, today
announced it has been accredited as a Microsoft Desktop Enablement Partner. In
this role, Centrix Software will enable customers and IT solutions providers to
optimize Windows 7 and Windows 8 migrations, and the use of
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), virtualized and cloud applications. 

Centrix Software has been named as a Microsoft Desktop Enablement partner, for
its ability to simplify enterprise desktop transformations. 

"Windows migrations are a catalyst, driving many enterprises to evaluate new
options for sourcing and provisioning applications and desktop services," said
Dave Gully, Alliance Director at Centrix Software. "Understanding technology
usage and user behavior is the cornerstone to developing a smart,
business-driven IT strategy. The rich insight we provide organizations gives
them ability to achieve this. By automating the matching of users, applications
and devices customers can accelerate their migration projects, minimize
expenditure and get the maximum business value from their technology decisions."


With Centrix WorkSpace iQ, organizations planning or in progress with their
Windows XP migrations can gain real-time insight into the many ways
applications, devices and content are used. Matching this data to users is a
huge challenge in any transformation project and often a manual, time-consuming
and costly exercise. WorkSpace iQ automates this and enables IT to realize
significant benefits:

* Reduce application compatibility issues by up to 95% and Windows migration
time by up to 50% by identifying unused applications &amp; removing them from the
project 
* Identify those users who can be migrated quickly and easily, delivering quick
wins to the business 
* Make the best application delivery choices based on business requirements and
user work styles. Organizations can optimize the use of mobile, virtualized,
SaaS, on-premise or cloud-based applications, further reducing OS migration and
ongoing client computing costs.

"Deploying a new desktop operating system can seem like a daunting task. In
addition, sorting through the wealth of information about deployment can be
overwhelming. Microsoft can provide a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to each
step in a Windows 7 deployment process from application compatibility testing
and volume activation to image creation and data migration," said David Rodger,
Windows Client Commercial Lead at Microsoft UK. "Our Desktop partners can help
guide you through this process and our Enablement partners can also help assist
in many of these tasks through the use of their tools." 

About Centrix Software

The Fallon Company attracts another prestigious tenant to Boston waterfront
development, as award-winning national law firm moves to occupy approximately
360,000 square feet of commercial space in 17-story tower
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
The Fallon Company`s Fan Pier, one of the country`s largest mixed-use waterfront
developments, took another significant step forward today with the announcement
that leading national law firm Goodwin Procter has signed a letter of intent to
move its Boston offices to a new high rise on the site. 

The company will occupy all of the commercial space in the built-to-suit,
half-million-square-foot tower, bringing more than 860 attorneys and
professional staff to Fan Pier. 

The building will also offer ground-floor retail and cultural space, as well as
a 135-room boutique Fan Pier-branded hotel, managed by The Fallon Company.
Located adjacent to Boston`s prestigious Institute of Contemporary Art and
overlooking Fan Pier Park, the building will offer access to the neighborhood`s
walking paths, marina, and myriad dining and shopping options. 

Goodwin Procter LLP is a leading Global 100 law firm, with offices in Boston,
Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, Silicon
Valley and Washington, D.C. The firm provides corporate law and litigation
services, with a focus on matters involving real estate, REITs and real estate
capital markets; private equity; technology and life sciences companies;
financial services; intellectual property; products liability and mass torts;
and securities litigation and white collar defense. The firm, which was founded
in Boston, recently celebrated its 100th anniversary. 

"With five of eight buildings in various stages of development, Fan Pier
embodies the spirit of innovation and progress that is underway on the
waterfront. This is another major step forward for a project that has celebrated
significant progress all year long," said Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino. "The
Fallon Company has done a tremendous job of attracting premier companies to this
emerging neighborhood. Goodwin Procter, with its prestigious global reputation,
forward-thinking business approach and expertise across all sectors of the law,
including technology and intellectual property, is a welcome and fitting
addition." 

"As Goodwin Procter`s 100th year draws to a close, it is only fitting that we
begin our next century working in `a home to call our own` in the firm`s
founding city," said firm Chairman Regina M. Pisa. "Our talented and dedicated
staff looks forward to joining current and prospective clients in the City`s
premier waterfront location." 

"After closely examining a range of options, we believe that Goodwin`s move to
the `Innovation District` will bring significant benefits to our employees, the
City of Boston and the firm," added Alex Randall, head of Goodwin`s real estate
leasing practice and lead partner on the project. "We look forward to working
closely with The Fallon Company in the period ahead to bring this exciting
project to fruition." 

Fan Pier is one of the country`s largest mixed-use development sites, spanning
21 acres and nine city blocks on the Boston waterfront. The announcement of this
new customized structure brings the number of Fan Pier high rises either
completed or currently under development to five. In addition to the Goodwin
Procter building, one office tower is complete, two are under construction and
ground breaking is planned for the site`s first residential structure in 2013. 

When complete, the Fan Pier neighborhood will feature a total of eight
contemporary commercial and residential luxury high rises, offering sweeping
views of Boston Harbor and the best in dining, shopping and recreation on
Boston`s historic harbor. 

Joe Fallon, President and CEO of the Fallon Company, said the agreement with
Goodwin Procter represents another major milestone for the development. 

"Our vision for Fan Pier was to attract a broad mix of best-in-class businesses
from recognized industry leaders to innovative start-ups," said Fallon. "As an
established, leading law firm with a rich history in Boston and forward-looking
approach to business, Goodwin Procter is exactly the type of company we hoped to
welcome to Fan Pier when we conceived this project and we look forward having
them join us on Boston`s waterfront." 

In addition to waterfront offices, residences, retail space, the dynamic Fan
Pier neighborhood will also feature hotel rooms with front-door access to a
park, marina and the 38-mile Harborwalk Trail. Already home to some of the
city`s best restaurants - including Empire, Sam`s and Strega Waterfront, as well
as renowned clothier LouisBoston - The Fallon Company plans to add more
prestigious dining and retail locations to the site.

Interviewed Thought Leaders Believe that Humira`s Superior Efficacy Over Enbrel
on Skin Symptoms Will Drive its Uptake, According to Findings from Decision
Resources
BURLINGTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Decision Resources, one of the world`s leading research and advisory firms for
pharmaceutical and healthcare issues, finds that, in 2011, tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors dominated sales in the psoriatic arthritis
(PsA) drug market, contributing to 89 percent of the nearly $1.7 billion PsA
market in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom
and Japan. 

The upcoming Pharmacor advisory service entitled Psoriatic Arthritis, which will
be published soon, finds that the TNF-alpha inhibitor etanercept
(Amgen/Pfizer/Takeda`s Enbrel) was the 2011 market leader, leading by a small
margin over adalimumab (Abbott/Eisai`s Humira). Decision Resources expects
Humira to displace Enbrel as the sales leader in 2012, with its patient share
surpassing that of Enbrel in 2013. 

"Interviewed thought leaders believe that Humira`s superior efficacy on skin
symptoms over Enbrel, its excellent efficacy on joint symptoms, twice-monthly
dosing and years of physician experience for treating PsA will continue to drive
its uptake in this market," said Decision Resources Analyst Bingnan Kang, Ph.D. 

The findings also reveal that methotrexate (Dava Pharmaceuticals` Rheumatrex,
generics) was the patient-share leader in 2011 but comprised only 4 percent of
total PsA sales, owing to the availability of inexpensive generics. Other
conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are also highly genericized
and represented only a small percentage (less than 6 percent) of market sales in
2011. 

Over the next decade, four branded therapies will enter the market and will
represent over one-third of the total PsA market in 2021. Of these agents, three
emerging therapies offer novel mechanisms of action-the interleukin-12/23
inhibitor ustekinumab (Janssen`s Stelara), the selective costimulation inhibitor
abatacept (Bristol-Myers Squibb/Ono Pharmaceutical`s Orencia) and the
phosphadiesterase-4 inhibitor apremilast (Celgene). During this time, the
TNF-alpha inhibitor certolizumab pegol (UCB/Astellas`s Cimzia) will also enter
the PsA market.

&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) is closing its retail banking operations in Malaysia as part of a global strategy to focus that business in the home market, a bank spokesman said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move will not impact the bank's overall business or strategy in the Southeast Asian nation as it made up a small portion of its total operations, Chris Cockerill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It (Malaysia) remains a very important market for us," said Cockerill. "We continue to invest in our treasury services operations, our global corporate bank activities as well as investment banking - for example, in our equity capital markets business, we are the No.2 foreign bank in the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could not be immediately ascertained how many branches or customers JPMorgan's retail banking operations has in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's headcount in the country will continue to increase in order to support its growth, Cockerill added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaysia's equity capital raising activity has been robust in 2012. Kuala Lumpur ranked fourth globally this year in terms of amounts raised from initial public offerings, bolstered by a flurry of offerings such as Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGVH.KL), according to Thomson Reuters' investment banking scorecard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been involved in some of the deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Yantoultra Ngui; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 20 (Reuters) - The board overseeing mutual funds run by
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has elected as its new chairman
Matthew Goldstein, chancellor of the City University of New
York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldstein will take over the chairmanship at the start of
the year from the long-serving prior chair Fergus Reid, who is
retiring, said board attorney Carl Frischling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board oversees 169 funds with $380 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid, 80, drew praise from fund research firm Morningstar
Inc. as an effective voice on the body charged with looking out
for shareholder interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morningstar lowered its governance rating on the board to
"C" from "A" when news of Reid's pending retirement was
disclosed in a filing last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment. Goldstein did
not immediately return a message left at his CUNY office.
Frischling said he knows of no change to Goldstein's CUNY role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldstein has been a JPMorgan funds trustee since 2003. He
has served in various academic positions including president of
Baruch College, president of the Research Foundation and
president of Adelphi University, according to his official
biography on the CUNY website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other fund boards include academic leaders. University of
Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann sits on the board of 
Vanguard Group Inc, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fund board members are well-paid. A securities filing shows
Reid received $500,000 in compensation from the JPMorgan funds
complex in 2011, including $100,000 in deferred compensation,
while Goldstein received $325,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securities filings also show several other JPMorgan fund
board trustees are set to retire. New trustees to replace them
include Mary Martinez, a Christie's executive; Mitchell Merin, a
former Morgan Stanley executive; and Marian Pardo, founder of
Virtual Capital Management LLC, an investment consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid is also chair of a plastics manufacturer. He will
remain on a separate post he holds as a trustee of funds run by
Morgan Stanley, Frischling said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/8knews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20121220:nBw206255a

CALGARY, Alberta--(Business Wire)--
Walton Yellowhead Development Corporation (the "Corporation") announces that it
has issued effective December 20, 2012, interest debentures (the "Interest
Debentures") to holders of the 8% unsecured subordinated convertible extendable
debentures ("Offering Debentures"). 

The Corporation elected to pay its first interest payment on the Offering
Debentures by issuing to holders thereof on a pro rata basis, that principal
amount of Interest Debentures equal to the amount of interest owing under the
Offering Debentures. The Interest Debentures are 8% unsecured, subordinated,
convertible, extendable debentures of the Corporation and have substantially the
same terms as the Offering Debentures. The issuance of the Interest Debentures
is in accordance with the terms of the Trust Indenture governing the Offering
Debentures which was disclosed in the Corporation's October 2011 prospectus (the
"Prospectus"). 

The Offering Debentures were issued as part of the Corporation`s Prospectus
offering. The Offering Debentures are unsecured and bear interest at a rate of
8% per annum. Interest on the debentures is calculated each September 30, and is
payable annually on or before December 31. For this payment, interest is
calculated from the date of issuance up to September 30, 2012, for total
interest of $1,496,021.18 due on or before December 31, 2012. 

The decision to pay the interest with the issuance of Interest Debentures is
primarily a result of an approval delay on the Servicing Agreement from the City
of Edmonton which has caused project delays and thus cash flow deviations from
the original business model. Notwithstanding these delays, the Corporation
anticipates that it will be able to complete the project within the approximate
three-year time frame and achieve the net internal rate of return of 13%
disclosed in the Prospectus.

In March of 2013, each investor will receive, by mail, a T5 from the
Corporation`s transfer agent or the shareholder`s brokerage firm. The T5 will
indicate the amount of interest that the Offering Debenture holder is required
to report as a result of the issuance of the Interest Debentures. 

Launched in 2011, the Corporation owns a two-phase, 131.4 acres industrial
development in northwest Edmonton, Alberta, within the Winterburn Industrial
area. 

The Corporation is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P. and the development
of the property is managed by Walton Development and Management L.P., both of
which are members of the Walton Group. 

The Walton Group is a multinational group of real estate investment and
development companies headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Walton`s
expertise is the research, acquisition, management and development of
strategically located land in major North American growth corridors. With more
than 70,000 acres of land under management, the Walton Group is one of North
America`s premier land asset managers. Walton manages and/or owns land assets in
Phoenix, Austin, Dallas, Atlanta, Charlotte, the Washington, D.C. region,
Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton and Calgary.

&lt;p&gt;http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/8knews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20121220:nBw206096a

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: J.P. Morgan Tax-Exempt Pass-Through Trust, Series
2012-5 -- Appendix
http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=697747

Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to one class of certificates
issued by J.P. Morgan Tax-Exempt Pass-Through Trust, Series 2012-5 (the issuer):


--$54,555,871 class A certificates 'AAAsf'; Outlook Negative. 

The transaction represents a pass-through of all proceeds received in respect of
one underlying mortgage revenue bond (MRB) owned by the trust. The rating is
based on the credit quality of the MRB. 

Proceeds from the certificate issuance were used to purchase one MRB issued by
the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency (MHFA). The MRB is collateralized by
participation interests in four underlying securities issued by Fannie Mae
(FNMA; rated 'AAA/F1+' with a Negative Outlook by Fitch). The MRB is rated 'AAA'
with a Negative Outlook based on the FNMA guarantee of full and timely payment
of principal and interest on its securities. Although the FNMA guarantee is not
explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America,
FNMA continues to benefit from financial support by the U.S. treasury. 

Payments on the certificates will be made monthly and will consist of all
interest and principal payments received from the underlying MRB. The
certificates will receive interest equal to 2.5% per annum less extraordinary
expenses. The underlying MRB pays a coupon of 2.527% and the transaction is
structured to pass-through all interest and principal proceeds after paying a
0.027% (p.a.) trustee fee and any extraordinary expenses that are incurred.
Extraordinary expenses incurred by the trustee are capped at $150,000 per year,
and any excess extraordinary expense amount incurred by the trustee is to be
paid the following year. 

The transaction relies, to a lesser extent, on a series of counterparties to
perform particular roles, including the trustee (Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.; rated
'AA-/F1+', Outlook Stable) and the bank at which the certificate account is
established (also Wells Fargo Bank). All distributions from the underlying MRB
are deposited into the certificate account where they are held uninvested, and
are subsequently withdrawn by the trustee prior to each payment date. The
certificate account is a segregated trust account, separated from the assets of
the bank in the event of its insolvency. In its role as both issuer account bank
and trustee, Wells Fargo Bank satisfies the eligibility criteria described in
Fitch's 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance Transactions'. 

The transaction is established as a grantor trust for federal income tax
purposes. Each beneficial owner of the certificates will be treated for federal
income tax purposes as owning an undivided interest in each asset held in the
trust. To the extent interest on the underlying MRBs is exempt from federal
income taxation, the portion thereof received by each beneficial owner of a
certificate will also be exempt from federal income taxation. Fitch has received
and reviewed legal opinions addressing the true sale of the underlying MRBs to
the trust, the classification of the trust as a grantor trust for federal income
tax purposes, and the enforceability of the transaction documents. 

The CUSIP for the underlying MHFA MRB is 57586NQQ7. Fitch's rating commentary
for the MHFA MRB on Dec. 13, 2012 titled 'Fitch Rates Mass Housing Agency's
$54.6MM 2012 Ser B RMRBs 'AAA'; Outlook Negative' is available at
'www.fitchratings.com'. 

Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. The ratings above
were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore, Fitch has been
compensated for the provision of the ratings. 

The sources of information used to assess this rating were the transaction
documents provided by the arranger, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and the public
domain.

&lt;p&gt;U.S. oil major Exxon (XOM.N) is giving up its stake in the giant southern oilfield after clashing with the central government in Baghdad over exploration contracts it had signed with the autonomous Kurdistan region in the north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi and Chinese sources said CNPC unit Petrochina (0857.HK) (601857.SS) is negotiating for Exxon's 60 percent in the $50 billion West Qurna-1 project and that there are rival bidders. Royal Dutch Shell is a minority partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CNPC has shown interest; they are there. And from our side, there is no problem with them taking on a bigger position. We are not sensitive about this," a senior Iraqi official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are service contracts, not production-sharing contracts (which give companies an ownership stake), so it doesn't matter if they have 10 fields or one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For energy-hungry China, a major buyer of Iraqi crude, access to reserves is a strategic imperative, and Beijing is prepared to accept tougher terms and lower profits than Western oil majors and even Russian firms such as Lukoil (LKOH.MM), which have to answer to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq has the world's fourth-largest oil reserves and wants to at least double its production in the next few years and ultimately challenge Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's biggest oil nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's stealthy advance in Iraq, supported by piles of cash, has already given it a formidable position in prized southern oilfields, and through Chinese oil company Sinopec (0386.HK), its reach has extended into the northern Kurdish region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By taking on West Qurna-1, Chinese companies would come to dominate Iraq's oilfields with roughly 32 percent of the reserves found in service contracts awarded to foreign companies, up from 21 percent now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"PetroChina is in talks to buy the stake from ExxonMobil. There are rival bidders," a source familiar with the Chinese company said. "A decision is expected from ExxonMobil soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq has already signaled it would favor bids by CNPC and Lukoil if they decided to buy Exxon's stake and that it had received "positive signals" from both companies they would consider making an offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Russia's Lukoil (LKOH.MM) has made no commitment so far. Russia's second-largest crude producer is already developing West Qurna-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEAR OF WAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Control of oil resources is at the heart of a dispute between Iraq's Arab-led central government and the autonomous region run by ethnic Kurds in the north, which Baghdad accuses of usurping its constitutional right over oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurdistan has upset Baghdad by signing deals directly with oil majors such as Exxon and Chevron (CVX.N), providing lucrative service contracts and better operating conditions than in Iraq's south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By turning its focus to Chinese and Russian companies, Baghdad would be extending a push for a more independent foreign policy, which Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki initiated after the last U.S. troops left the country a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's departure would all but wipe out the American presence in Iraq's southern oilfields. Occidental Petroleum (OXY.N) has a small stake in the Zubair oilfield development project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With oil majors now shifting their focus northward to sign deals with Kurdistan and away from Iraq's southern oilfields, leaders on both sides are warning of the risks that the dispute could slide into an ethnic war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As tensions rise, industry sources suggest Exxon might have a change of heart and decide to stay in southern Iraq. Earlier this year, Baghdad said it had called on U.S. President Barack Obama to persuade Exxon not to invest in Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would be surprised if Exxon actually exits. I'm betting on some twists and turns ahead," said a Western oil executive, who works for a rival. "They might get nervous in the north."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the dispute is the oil wealth under the swathe of land know as the "Disputed Territories" along the vague internal border that includes the ethnically mixed city of Kirkuk, known to some as the "Jerusalem of the Kurds".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad has warned Exxon and other companies that deals struck with Kurdistan are illegal. The Kurds say the constitution's federalism guarantees their right to develop their region's oil resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government will take all necessary measures to stop Exxon working, especially in the disputed areas. They should know this is a red line they can't cross," one Iraqi oil official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they think they can do that, then they will face dire consequences. They should expect everything including confiscation of their equipment and face the results of violating the constitution," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials and Iraqi President Jalal Talabani have mediated to prevent a confrontation across the line dividing the two regions. Neither Baghdad nor Kurdistan appear to have the appetite for an open conflict that would risk oil exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately cooler heads have prevailed for now," said a senior oil industry source. "Unfortunately President Talabani may not be around to mediate in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talabani suffered a stroke earlier this week, and may be unable to return to work for a prolonged period, at a time when tensions between Baghdad and Kurdistan are rising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(additional reporting and writing by Patrick Markey; Editing by Jane Baird and Alison Birrane)&lt;/p&gt;

their used games have an intrinsic monetary worth that can be used to trade for
other games. This has traditionally has been done in retail venues like Gamestop
where gamers receive very low trade in values. The Goozex trading model allows
users to receive a much higher trading currency for their used games that they
can use to acquire other games of much higher value. I believe this premise
provides Goozex with an unparalleled opportunity at a piece of this
multi-billion dollar industry. I look forward to building Goozex into a world
class games trading organization."

Four New ETFs Launched Based on Goldman Sachs Proprietary Indices 
DENVER--(Business Wire)--
ALPS, A DST Company, announced today the launch of four new exchange-traded
funds (ETFs) each of which seeks to track a Goldman Sachs proprietary index. 

Three of the new ETFs seek to track Goldman Sachs indices based on the "GS
Momentum Builder&#174;" framework which seeks to capture momentum exposure to select
asset classes or markets with a risk control mechanism. The fourth ETF seeks to
track a Goldman Sachs index that reflects a hypothetical portfolio of U.S.
stocks that are anticipated to have the highest risk-adjusted returns based on
volatility adjusted target prices of a consensus of industry analysts for the
stocks in the Russell 1000&#174; Index. 

The three Momentum Builder Index ETFs are the ALPS/GS Momentum Builder&#174; Growth
Markets Equities and U.S. Treasuries Index ETF (GSGO), the ALPS/GS Momentum
Builder&#174; Multi-Asset Index ETF (GSMA) and the ALPS/GS Momentum Builder&#174; Asia
ex-Japan Equities and U.S. Treasuries Index ETF (GSAX). The fourth product is
the ALPS/GS Risk-Adjusted Return U.S. Large Cap Index ETF (GSRA). 

"ALPS is excited to introduce ETFs based on the Goldman Sachs indices to our
suite of ETFs," said Tom Carter, Executive Vice President of ALPS Holdings. 

"This collaboration helps us achieve our shared goal of providing ETF investors
with thoughtful index-based investment alternatives with various types of market
exposures," said Federico Gilly, managing director and head of the Equity Sales
Strats and Structuring Group at Goldman Sachs. 

Goldman Sachs` New York-based Exchange Traded Product Structuring team, which is
part of the firm`s Securities Division, specializes in creating indices for a
wide range of investor classes.

Equities and U.S. Treasuries Index ETF are new products with a limited operating
history.

The Momentum Builder ETFs seek to track a momentum strategy index and, as a
result, may experience more volatility than funds that track more broadly based
conventional indexes.

The Index Methodology for the ALPS/GS Risk-Adjusted Return U.S. Large Cap Index
ETF uses I/B/E/S consensus 12-month target prices adjusted by their historic
six-month realized volatility to select stocks for inclusion in the Index. Such
consensus target prices are subject to revision and may not be reliable
predictors of future stock prices. If I/B/E/S consensus target prices are
unreliable or cease to be available, the stocks selected by the Methodology may
not be the optimal selection of stocks for the Index, which may cause the value
of the Index and/or the Fund to be less than it would be if another input were
used for stock selection.

The ETFs are subject to the additional risks associated with concentrating its
investments in companies in the market sector.

An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and
expenses carefully before investing.To obtain a prospectus which contain this

&lt;p&gt;FRESNO, CA and VISALIA, CA, Dec 20 (Marketwire) -- 
Central Valley Community Bancorp (NASDAQ: CVCY), a bank holding company
headquartered in Fresno, California, and Visalia Community Bank (OTCBB:
VSMU), headquartered in Visalia, California, jointly announced today that
a definitive merger agreement has been signed by both parties. Under the
terms of the agreement, Visalia Community Bank, with four branches in
Visalia and one branch in Exeter, will merge with Central Valley
Community Bancorp's subsidiary, Central Valley Community Bank. The
transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including
regulatory approvals and approval by Visalia Community Bank's
shareholders. The Central Valley Community Bancorp and Visalia Community
Bank boards of directors have unanimously approved the transaction, which
is expected to close in the second quarter of 2013. 

    The transaction is initially valued at approximately $22.1 million or
$52.00 per share to Visalia Community Bank shareholders. The purchase
price is to be paid half in cash and half in Central Valley Community
Bancorp common stock. Based on a value of $8.75 per share of Central
Valley Community Bancorp common stock, using the 30-day volume weighted
average trading price at the time when the principal terms of the
agreement were being established, in the aggregate approximately 1.263
million shares of Central Valley Community Bancorp common stock would be
issued and $11,050,000 would be paid in cash. As a result, Visalia
Community Bank shareholders would be entitled to receive approximately
$26.00 and 2.97 shares of Central Valley Community Bancorp common stock
per share. The total purchase price is subject to adjustments and closing
conditions, including potential adjustments if the volume weighted
average trading price of Central Valley Community Bancorp common shares
rises or falls beyond certain levels prior to closing. 

    The Central Valley Community Bancorp and Central Valley Community Bank
directors and management team, led by Daniel J. Doyle, president and CEO,
will continue to lead the combined team of professional bankers. F. T.
"Tommy" Elliott IV, chairman of the board of directors of Visalia
Community Bank, will join Central Valley Community Bancorp's board of
directors upon completion of the acquisition. This merger with Visalia
Community Bank will become the third acquisition for Central Valley
Community Bancorp, which acquired Service 1st Bancorp and its subsidiary
Service 1st Bank on November 12, 2008, and Bank of Madera County on
January 1, 2005.

    As of September 30, 2012, on a pro forma consolidated basis with Visalia
Community Bank, Central Valley Community Bancorp would have had
approximately $1.078 billion in total assets, with 23 branches throughout
California's San Joaquin Valley. 

    "Both banking institutions are well known for their excellent customer
service and community advocacy, which will not change as a result of the
merger. Once approved, the merger will complete another step in our
long-term strategy to increase our presence throughout California's San
Joaquin Valley by adding offices in Tulare County, complementing our 17
existing offices in the northern Valley counties of Fresno, Madera,
Merced, Stanislaus, Sacramento and San Joaquin. This growth allows
Central Valley Community Bank to further accommodate an increasing
customer base in the communities of Visalia and Exeter. We believe that
the expansion into Tulare County will provide long-term opportunities for
businesses, customers, employees, the community, and our Bank," stated
Daniel J. Doyle, president and CEO of Central Valley Community Bancorp
and Central Valley Community Bank. 

    "Additionally, the merger will provide Visalia Community Bank customers
with more convenient locations throughout the San Joaquin Valley, as well
as offer new advancement and geographic opportunities for their
employees. We are pleased to have Visalia Community Bank employees join
our team of professional community bankers who are focused on providing a
full array of competitive financial services to meet the needs of
businesses, professionals, agribusiness and consumers for the communities
we serve," concluded Doyle.

    "Visalia Community Bank's quality service standards, philosophies and
corporate culture are consistent with those of Central Valley Community
Bank. While the nation has seen a continuing trend in bank consolidations
through mergers and acquisitions in recent years, few of these 'bank
marriages' promise a better fit than the marriage between Visalia
Community Bank and Central Valley Community Bancorp," stated Tom Beene,
president and CEO of Visalia Community Bank.

    "Over the past 35 years, Visalia Community Bank has provided exceptional
community banking service of the highest caliber to residents and
businesses, allowing successful growth in Tulare County. Central Valley
Community Bank has likewise effectively and profitably grown throughout
the San Joaquin Valley through branch expansion and the enhancement of
banking products and services to fulfill customer demands," Beene said.

&lt;p&gt;VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Dec 20 (MARKET WIRE) --
CBM Asia Development Corp. ("CBM Asia" or the "Company") (TSX
VENTURE:TCF)(US:CBMDF)(FRANKFURT:IY2) announces that it has signed a
joint venture agreement with ExxonMobil to farm into four existing
coalbed methane production sharing contracts (PSC) in the Barito Basin,
South Kalimantan, Indonesia and acquire rights to farm into certain
additional PSCs in the Kutai Basin, East Kalimantan. CBM Asia and
ExxonMobil would hold equal ownership interest in each PSC.

    The final terms and conditions of the proposed farm-in remain subject to
the negotiation and execution of formal agreements between ExxonMobil and
CBM Asia, as well as, among other conditions, government approvals.

    Barito Basin. CBMA will acquire a 35% to 37.5% participating interests in
four existing PSCs in the Barito Basin, South Kalimantan, Indonesia. CBM
Asia and ExxonMobil plan to carry out certain pilot well test programs,
and CBM Asia will fund certain operating costs associated with the PSCs. 

    Kutai Basin. In addition, CBM Asia will acquire the right to farm into
50% of ExxonMobil's future participating interest in certain coalbed
methane PSCs in which ExxonMobil may acquire an interest located in the
Kutai Basin, East Kalimantan. Subject to, among other things, government
approval, upon ExxonMobil acquiring its participating interest in one or
more of such existing and potential PSCs, ExxonMobil will farm out/assign
50% of its participating interest to CBM Asia.

    "The Barito Basin holds approximately 100 Tcf of in-place(1) CBM
resources based on industry estimates," states CBM Asia Chairman Scott
Stevens. "Deep coal deposits there are exceptionally thick, laterally
continuous, gas-charged and have very simple structural conditions.
Regional urban centers and the extensive coal mining industry provide
near term gas monetization opportunities, while the coastal location near
Banjarmasin and the Bontang LNG facility offers access to north Asian
markets. CBM Asia considers the Barito Basin to be one of the world's
best undeveloped CBM basins."

    "CBM Asia's management and technical teams have developed excellent
working relationships with ExxonMobil during the past several months,"
notes CBM Asia President and CEO Alan T. Charuk. "We believe ExxonMobil
and CBMA will combine technical and financial strength with efficient
operations to effectively develop these Barito and Kutai Basin CBM
opportunities. The Barito Basin PSC's farm-ins and the potential Kutai
Basin PSCs will result in a material increase in our Indonesian acreage
position and potential recoverable resource. We now look forward to
executing the operational phase of our strategy while farming out
interests in certain majority owned PSCs to reduce our forward capex
requirements."

    BPMigas. On November 13, 2012, Indonesia's Constitutional Court disbanded
Indonesia's upstream oil &amp; gas regulator BPMigas. Immediately following
the Constitutional Court's ruling, Indonesian's President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono issued a Presidential regulation and two ministerial decrees
establishing SKSPMigas under the supervision of the Ministry of Energy
and Mineral Resources (MEMR) to assume the functions of a regulator until
a new, permanent body is formed under a planned revision of the 2001 Oil
and Gas Law or until the formulation of a new law. In public statements
the President assured foreign investors that all existing production
sharing contracts (PSCs) will be honored. CBM Asia's operations in
Indonesia continue as normally.

opportunities in Indonesia. The Company holds various participating
interests in five production sharing contracts (each a "PSC") for CBM in

&lt;p&gt;VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Dec 20 (MARKET WIRE) --
CBM Asia Development Corp. ("CBM Asia" or the "Company") (TSX
VENTURE:TCF)(US:CBMDF)(FRANKFURT:IY2) announces that it has signed a
joint venture agreement with ExxonMobil to farm into four existing
coalbed methane production sharing contracts (PSC) in the Barito Basin,
South Kalimantan, Indonesia and acquire rights to farm into certain
additional PSCs in the Kutai Basin, East Kalimantan. CBM Asia and
ExxonMobil would hold equal ownership interest in each PSC.

    The final terms and conditions of the proposed farm-in remain subject to
the negotiation and execution of formal agreements between ExxonMobil and
CBM Asia, as well as, among other conditions, government approvals.

    Barito Basin. CBMA will acquire a 35% to 37.5% participating interests in
four existing PSCs in the Barito Basin, South Kalimantan, Indonesia. CBM
Asia and ExxonMobil plan to carry out certain pilot well test programs,
and CBM Asia will fund certain operating costs associated with the PSCs. 

    Kutai Basin. In addition, CBM Asia will acquire the right to farm into
50% of ExxonMobil's future participating interest in certain coalbed
methane PSCs in which ExxonMobil may acquire an interest located in the
Kutai Basin, East Kalimantan. Subject to, among other things, government
approval, upon ExxonMobil acquiring its participating interest in one or
more of such existing and potential PSCs, ExxonMobil will farm out/assign
50% of its participating interest to CBM Asia.

    "The Barito Basin holds approximately 100 Tcf of in-place(1) CBM
resources based on industry estimates," states CBM Asia Chairman Scott
Stevens. "Deep coal deposits there are exceptionally thick, laterally
continuous, gas-charged and have very simple structural conditions.
Regional urban centers and the extensive coal mining industry provide
near term gas monetization opportunities, while the coastal location near
Banjarmasin and the Bontang LNG facility offers access to north Asian
markets. CBM Asia considers the Barito Basin to be one of the world's
best undeveloped CBM basins."

    "CBM Asia's management and technical teams have developed excellent
working relationships with ExxonMobil during the past several months,"
notes CBM Asia President and CEO Alan T. Charuk. "We believe ExxonMobil
and CBMA will combine technical and financial strength with efficient
operations to effectively develop these Barito and Kutai Basin CBM
opportunities. The Barito Basin PSC's farm-ins and the potential Kutai
Basin PSCs will result in a material increase in our Indonesian acreage
position and potential recoverable resource. We now look forward to
executing the operational phase of our strategy while farming out
interests in certain majority owned PSCs to reduce our forward capex
requirements."

and Mineral Resources (MEMR) to assume the functions of a regulator until
a new, permanent body is formed under a planned revision of the 2001 Oil
and Gas Law or until the formulation of a new law. In public statements
the President assured foreign investors that all existing production
sharing contracts (PSCs) will be honored. CBM Asia's operations in
Indonesia continue as normally.

&lt;p&gt;http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/8knews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20121221:nBw215675a

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded six classes and affirmed 16 classes of J.P. Morgan
Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust, Series 2007-LDP12 due to a greater
certainty of loss expectations associated with loans currently in special
servicing. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press
release. 

Fitch modeled losses of 15.1% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the
original pool balance total 17.1%, including losses already incurred. The pool
has experienced $119.9 million (4.8% of the original pool balance) in realized
losses to date. Fitch has designated 22 loans (20.9%) as Fitch Loans of Concern,
which includes 13 specially serviced assets (14.3%). 

As of the December 2012 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal
balance has been reduced by 18.5% to $2.04 billion from $2.5 billion at
issuance. No loans have defeased since issuance. Interest shortfalls are
currently affecting classes L through NR. 

The largest contributor to expected losses is a 21 story, Class A office
building located in the Vinings area of Atlanta, GA (3.3% of the pool). The loan
was transferred to special servicing in October 2012. The property consists of
438,709 square feet (sf) of office space and amenities include a full-service
athletic and dining club (8% of total SF). Per the special servicer, a lease
renewal is out for signature. The borrower has indicated to the special servicer
that they are unwilling to fund the Tenant Improvements and Leasing Commissions
related to the renewal. As of June 2012, the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR)
is 0.87x. The property is 74% occupied as of October 2012. 

The next largest contributor to expected losses is a 415,324 sf, class A,
multi-tenant, 18-story office building also located in Atlanta, GA (3.2%). The
loan transferred to special servicing in June 2012 for imminent default. The
loan matured in July 2012 and the borrower has requested an extension of the
loan's maturity and a principal reduction. The property is unable to meet its
debt service payments. The loan is cash managed via a hard lock box. The
borrower has made a discounted payoff (DPO) offer which is currently under
review. The property was 85% occupied as of May 2012, with average asking rent
of $21.75 psf. 

The third largest contributor to expected losses is the Plaza El Segundo loan
(7.9% and largest loan in the pool), which is secured by a 380,902 sf class A
power center located in El Segundo, CA. The center is anchored by Whole Foods
Market (17%), Dick's Sporting Goods (12%), Best Buy (12%), Home Goods (7%),
PetSmart (5%), Cost Plus World Market (5%). Major tenants include Anthropologie
(3%), Salt Creek Grille (2%), Active Ride (2%), Banana Republic (2%). As of
Sept. 2012, the property was 99% occupied. Leases for tenants representing 24%
of the NRA are schedule to expire in 2017, the same year as the loan maturity.
The most recent reported comparable sales information as of trailing 12 month
(TTM) September 2011 is $427.84 psf up from $416.19 as of TTM September 2010. 

Fitch downgrades the following classes and assigns or revises Rating Outlooks
and Recovery Estimates (REs) as indicated: 

--$250.5 million class A-M to 'BBB-sf' from 'Asf'; Outlook to Negative from
Stable;

--$12.5 million class E to 'CCsf' from 'CCCsf'; RE 0%;

--$28.2 million class G to 'Csf' from 'CCsf'; RE 0%;
--$28.2 million class H to 'Csf' from 'CCsf'; RE 0%.

Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:

--$346.2 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
--$601.7 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

--$21.9 million class B at 'CCCsf'; RE 0%;
--$28.2 million class C at 'CCCsf'; RE 0%;

previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only class X certificates.

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/mjsh39/global_data) has announced
the addition of the "Global Data Processing and Outsourcing Services Market
2011-2015" report to their offering. 

TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Data Processing and Outsourcing
Services market to grow at a CAGR of 5.2 percent over the period 2011-2015. One
of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the emerging
outsourcing destinations. The Global Data Processing and Outsourcing Services
market has also been witnessing an increasing adoption of cloud services.
Moreover, unstable global economic recovery could pose a challenge to the growth
of this market. 

The other vendors mentioned in the report are Computer Sciences Corp., Accenture
plc, Convergys Corp., AON Corp., NCO Financial, Capgemini S.A., Genpact Ltd.,
TCS Ltd., Stream Global Services Inc., Wipro Ltd., WNS Ltd., Aegis, and Infosys
Ltd. 

Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's IT Services team said:
'One of the major trends in the market is the increasing adoption of cloud
services. This has been the buzzword for some time now in the IT sector, with
the majority of large organizations viewing cloud computing as a priority and
having already adopted it or having funding in place for its adoption. As a
result of the increasing awareness among customers about its advantages, service
providers are increasingly looking at developing their capabilities in cloud
computing.' 

According to the report, one of the major drivers is the emerging outsourcing
destinations. While considering a location for outsourcing business processes,
client organizations reflect on certain indicators such as labor costs and
political, economic and social risks. The APAC region is considered to be an
outsourcing hub because of the presence of key outsourcing countries in the
region. Countries such as India, China, Australia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
and Vietnam are considered to be among the most important and most sought-after
outsourcing destinations. 

Further, the report reveals that the shortage of talent and the increasing
attrition rate are other major concerns for the growth of this market.

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/lnkksh/global_enterprise) has
announced the addition of the "Global Enterprise Platform as a Service Market
2011-2015" report to their offering. 

TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Enterprise PaaS market to grow at a
CAGR of 56.65 percent over the period 2011-2015. One of the key factors
contributing to this market growth is the need to reduce total cost of
ownership. The Global Enterprise PaaS market has also been witnessing the
increasing adoption of PaaS during the economic downturn. However, the
increasing concern about data security could pose a challenge to the growth of
this market. 

The other vendors mentioned in the report are Amazon.com, Intuit Inc., Longjump
Inc., Red Hat Corp., Appirio Inc., VMware Inc., CloudBees Inc., Engine Yard
Inc., Rackspace Inc., Oracle Corp., BMC Software Inc., and Bungee Connect Inc. 

Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Enterprise Computing team
said: 'The organizational infrastructure is becoming more complex with the use
of multiple application platforms and complex equipment. Hence, organizations
are forced to invest more resources and money into the management of
applications infrastructure. With Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), organizations
are able to dynamically manage and maintain enterprise applications through
third-party vendors. Since PaaS vendors are able to provide complete
infrastructure management solutions, organizations are able to focus on their
core business activities rather than deal with the common issues of application
infrastructure management. Hence, the increasing need of organizations to focus
on core business activities is one of the major trends in the Global Enterprise
PaaS market.' 

According to the report, one of the major drivers is the need to reduce total
cost of ownership. The less-complex interfaces and self-service provisions of
cloud computing are also helping many enterprises manage application
infrastructure with limited resources. 

Further, the report reveals that the increasing concern about data security is
one of the major challenges confronting this market.

&lt;p&gt;* Statoil makes third gas discovery in country this year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* New resource estimate to be released next year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSLO Dec 21 (Reuters) - Norwegian energy firm Statoil
 found more gas offshore Tanzania, its third discovery
in the country this year, putting it closer to having the
resource needed to make commercial development viable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statoil and partner ExxonMobil found more gas in the
Lavani prospect when work to deepen a well encountered a
separate and "significant" gas reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statoil would not release an estimate for the find but said
it was "promising" and new figures would be revealed in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statoil earlier said it already found around 9 trillion
cubic feet (tcf) of gas in the area and would need roughly
another 3 tcf to make commercial development viable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Lavani-2 is the third well in an ambitious drilling
campaign of four wells within one year," Nick Maden, Statoil's
senior vice president for international exploration said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The next well will be the appraisal of the Zafarani
discovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts earlier predicted that the development could cost
the license roughly $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery confirms East Africa's status as one of the
world's fastest growing gas hubs, with the U.S. Geological
Survey estimating that 441 tcf of gas may lie off Kenya,
Tanzania, Mozambique, Madagascar and the Seychelles, relatively
close to Asia's lucrative LNG markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanzania recently raised its estimate of recoverable natural
gas reserves to 33 trillion cubic feet from 28.74 tcf thanks to
big finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statoil will now start acquiring new 3D seismic data to
identify additional targets in the prospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said on Monday it will enter the Canadian liquefied natural gas business with the acquisition of the 50 percent stake in the Kitimat LNG project held by Encana Corp and EOG Resources Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will take Encana's and EOG's 30 percent stakes in the LNG-export project for an undisclosed price as the No.2 U.S. oil company looks to jumpstart North American natural gas exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will also buy the two companies' interest in a pipeline serving the project, at Kitimat, 650 kilometers (400 miles) north of Vancouver, and will pay $550 million for a half stake in 644,000 acres of exploration lands in the Horn River and Liard shale-gas fields owned by Apache Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apache will then pay Chevron $150 million to raise its stake in the British Columbia project and associated lands to 50 percent, netting the U.S. independent oil and gas producer $400 million from the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the addition of a deep-pocketed partner increases the likelihood that the multi-billion dollar Kitimat LNG -- the most advanced of a handful of gas-export facilities slated for British Columbia's northern coast -- will be completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With Chevron involved it will happen sooner than it otherwise would have," said Michael Dunn, an analyst with FirstEnergy Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though no price was given, Robert Morris, an analyst with Citi Research, estimates that Encana and EOG each received about $450 million for their stakes and the exploration lands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitimat LNG was last year awarded Canada's first LNG export license by the National Energy Board, allowing it to export 10 million tons of LNG per year. The project is slated to begin shipping gas to Asian markets by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Canadian LNG facilities are planned by Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Malaysia's Petronas, BG Group Plc and others, making British Columbia a rival to the U.S. Gulf coast, where nine projects have been announced and one, Cheniere Energy Inc's, Sabine Pass project, is already under construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has existing LNG projects in Australia, Africa and South America. Adding the Canadian operation will let it tap high-priced export markets and escape a domestic gas market that remains depressed because of burgeoning production from shale gas fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This investment grows our global LNG portfolio and builds upon our LNG construction, operations and marketing capabilities," George Kirkland, Chevron's vice chairman, said in a statement. "It is ideally situated to meet rapidly growing demand for reliable, secure, and cleaner-burning fuels in Asia, which are projected to approximately double from current levels by 2025."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encana said the sale of its stake was consistent with its plan to focus on its core natural gas business and that the deal will reduce its future capital commitments while EOG will now focus on U.S. crude oil production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition is expected to close it the first quarter of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares fell $1.00 to $108.71 by early afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange while Apache fell $1.35 to $78.65 and EOG dropped 72 cents to $122.83&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encana shares were down 51 Canadian cents at C$19.62 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=$0.99 Canadian)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Thyagaraju Adinarayan; editing by Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

$450 million for their stakes and the exploration lands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitimat LNG was last year awarded Canada's first LNG export
license by the National Energy Board, allowing it to export 10
million tons of LNG per year. The project is slated to begin
shipping gas to Asian markets by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Canadian LNG facilities are planned by Royal Dutch
Shell Plc, Malaysia's Petronas, BG Group Plc
 and others, making British Columbia a rival to the U.S.
Gulf coast, where nine projects have been announced and one,
Cheniere Energy Inc's, Sabine Pass project, is already
under construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has existing LNG projects in Australia, Africa and
South America. Adding the Canadian operation will let it tap
high-priced export markets and escape a domestic gas market that
remains depressed because of burgeoning production from shale
gas fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This investment grows our global LNG portfolio and builds
upon our LNG construction, operations and marketing
capabilities," George Kirkland, Chevron's vice chairman, said in
a statement. "It is ideally situated to meet rapidly growing
demand for reliable, secure, and cleaner-burning fuels in Asia,
which are projected to approximately double from current levels
by 2025."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encana said the sale of its stake was consistent with its
plan to focus on its core natural gas business and that the deal
will reduce its future capital commitments while EOG will now
focus on U.S. crude oil production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition is expected to close it the first quarter of
2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares fell $1.00 to $108.71 by early afternoon on
the New York Stock Exchange while Apache fell $1.35 to $78.65
and EOG dropped 72 cents to $122.83&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encana shares were down 51 Canadian cents at C$19.62 on the
Toronto Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Proposed two-train project ideally located to meet rapidly growing Asia-Pacific
demand
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced that its indirect Canadian
subsidiary, Chevron Canada Limited, will acquire a 50 percent operating interest
in the Kitimat liquefied natural gas (LNG) project and proposed Pacific Trail
Pipeline (PTP), and a 50 percent interest in approximately 644,000 acres of
petroleum and natural gas rights in the Horn River and Liard Basins in British
Columbia, Canada. 

"The Kitimat LNG development is an attractive opportunity that is aligned with
existing strategies and will drive additional long-term production growth and
shareholder returns," said George Kirkland, vice chairman, Chevron Corporation. 

"This investment grows our global LNG portfolio and builds upon our LNG
construction, operations and marketing capabilities. It is ideally situated to
meet rapidly growing demand for reliable, secure, and cleaner-burning fuels in
Asia, which are projected to approximately double from current levels by 2025." 

Under the terms of the agreements, Chevron Canada Limited will acquire all of
the interests currently owned by affiliates of EOG Resources Canada Inc. and
Encana Corporation in the proposed Kitimat LNG Project and PTP. Thereafter,
Chevron Canada Limited will equalize interests with an Apache Corporation
subsidiary, resulting in Chevron Canada Limited and Apache each holding a 50
percent interest in both the Kitimat LNG Project and PTP. Operatorship of both
facilities will transfer to Chevron Canada Limited. 

The proposed two-train Kitimat LNG Project, currently progressing through the
Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) phase, has a Canadian National Energy
Board license to export 10 million tons per annum of LNG. 

Additionally, Chevron Canada Limited will acquire approximately 110,000 net
acres in the established Horn River Basin from Encana, EOG and Apache, and
approximately 212,000 net acres in the Liard Basin from Apache. Chevron Canada
Limited and Apache will each hold a 50 percent interest and Apache will operate
these two natural gas resource developments. 

The agreements are subject to regulatory reviews. 

Gary Luquette, president, Chevron North America Exploration and Production,
said, "This investment by Chevron Canada Limited captures significant resource
and acreage in proven and emerging natural gas basins in Canada, and is a key
opportunity to expand our overall North America exploration and production
portfolio. It will enable our North America operations to play an increasingly
important role in Chevron`s global growth." 

Jeff Lehrmann, president, Chevron Canada Limited, said, "We look forward to
working with the Governments of British Columbia and Canada, First Nations, and
local communities to grow this development, realize the project`s long-term
economic potential, and open new markets for Canadian natural gas."

RAMAT GAN, Israel--(Business Wire)--
Alony Hetz ("the company") (TASE:ALHE), a leading Israeli real estate investment
company, announced that on December 21, 2012, it signed a Term Sheet with the
Special Situation Property Fund ofJP Morgan Chase Bank ("SSPF") and others to
invest in Carr Properties ("CARR"), currently controlled by SSPF. 

CARR is a real estate investment company focused on acquisitions, development
and property management of commercial office properties in the greater
Washington area. 

CARR`s management team has many years of experience in the Washington D.C. real
estate market, and has been led over the last decade by its President and Chief
Operating Officer, Mr. Oliver T. Carr III. 

CARR has whole or partial interests in 20 buildings covering 3.5 million sq ft.,
with CARR`s share at 2.3 million sq ft., leased to hundreds of tenants, in
addition to four office building projects in various stages of development. 

In accordance with the Term Sheet, a new company will be formed ("NEWCO"), which
the current team will manage and to which will be transferred CARR`s properties,
as mentioned above. In parallel, the company will invest $300 million in NEWCO.
In return for the company`s investment described above, they will be allocated
45% rights in NEWCO, an identical percentage to SSPF holdings in NEWCO at the
time. 

Based on CARR`s presentation, the parties estimate that NEWCO`s IFRS NAV at the
end of 2012 (pro forma) will be $370 million, such that, if and when, the
transaction is completed, NEWCO`s equity immediately following the company`s
investment, will stand at $670 million, its property value will be $730 million
and its annual dividend distribution to parties on their investment in NEWCO
will be 6%. 

Based on CARR`s business plan and in accordance with their corporate strategy
and NEWCO`s equity (pro forma) following the described investment in the
company, the parties anticipate that the NEWCO transaction will lead to in the
upcoming years, via acquisition and development of additional real estate, to a
property value at $1.5 billion, without raising any additional funds from
shareholders, by focusing on investing in the office sector in the greater
Washington D.C. metropolitan area. 

The Term Sheet states that the parties intent is to sign binding definitive
agreements ("agreements"), following completion of due diligence and property
appraisals to be carried out by the company. The agreements will determine,
among others, and as agreed upon by the parties, procedures for the transfer of
shareholders rights, as well as of the shared control in NEWCO between the
company and SSPF. 

It is the company`s intent to complete its due diligence during the first
quarter of 2013. If the due diligence is completed to the satisfaction of the
company, then it is the parties intentions to sign the agreements no later than
March 2013 and to close no later than June 2013. 

The company intends to finance the $300 million (approx. NIS 1.2 million)
anticipated investment in NEWCO from its own independent sources, via partial
utilization of its long term bank credit line and from raising debt/equity, as
needed. 

Signing of the Term Sheet described above does not obligate the parties, except
under the NO-SHOP period in effect until the end of March 2013, such that there
is no certainty that at the end of the due diligence period a binding contract
will be signed. 

The company will continue to report on the development of the above mentioned
transaction, upon completion of the due diligence.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on Wednesday announced charges against a research analyst for trading and tipping others ahead of a 2009 acquisition by computer giant IBM, expanding a related insider trading case filed last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors charged Trent Martin, who worked at a Connecticut brokerage firm, for purchasing shares of SPSS before IBM agreed to the $1.2 billion deal. He was also charged with passing the information to others, including his roommate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 29 the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two former stockbrokers, including Martin's roommate, for their roles in the alleged insider trading scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three and others made more than $1 million by trading ahead of the acquisition, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin was specifically named as the source of the information in instant messages between the two brokers, Thomas Conradt and David Weishaus, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a July 2009 message, referring to Martin by name, Conradt wrote: "holy f*** . . . god trent told me not to tell anyone . . . big mistake," according to the indictment unsealed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weishaus responded, "eh, we'll get rich."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin, an Australian citizen, was arrested on December 22 in Hong Kong, the Justice Department said. Martin could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed related civil charges against Martin on Wednesday, said he fled the United States to Australia soon after learning about the SEC's investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM agreed to pay $50 per share for SPSS, a 42 percent premium to SPSS' closing price on the day before the purchase was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Aruna Viswanatha; Editing by Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Dec. 26, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Conceptus, Inc. (Nasdaq:CPTS), developer
of the Essure&#174; procedure, the leading surgery-free permanent birth control method, announced today
that Company management is planning to present at the J.P. Morgan 31st Annual Healthcare
Conference on Thursday, January 10, 2013 at 7:30 a.m. Pacific time at the Westin St. Francis in
San Francisco, CA.

A live webcast of the presentation will be available on the company's website at www.conceptus.com

About the Essure&#174; Procedure

The Essure procedure, FDA approved since 2002, is the only surgery-free and hormone-free permanent
birth control method that can be performed in the comfort of a physician's office in less than 10
minutes (average hysteroscopic time) without the risks associated with general anesthesia or tubal
ligation. Soft, flexible inserts are placed in a woman's fallopian tubes through the cervix
without incisions. Over the next three months, the body works with the inserts to form a natural
barrier in the fallopian tubes to prevent sperm from reaching the egg. Three months after the
Essure procedure, an Essure Confirmation Test is given to confirm that the inserts are in place
and that the fallopian tubes are blocked, verifying that the patient can rely on Essure for
permanent birth control.

The Essure procedure is 99.83% effective based on five years of follow up with zero pregnancies
reported in clinical trials, making it the most effective permanent birth control available.
Essure's 10-year commercial data tracks closely with its five-year clinical results, and Essure
has been proven and trusted by physicians since 2002. The Essure procedure is covered in the U.S.
by most public and private insurance plans and approximately 690,000 women worldwide have
undergone the procedure.  

About Conceptus&#174;, Inc.

Conceptus, Inc. is the global leader in the development and commercialization of innovative
device-based solutions in permanent birth control. The Company manufactures and markets the Essure
Permanent Birth Control System.

reported two new gas discoveries off the coast of west
Australia, expanding its gas portfolio in the country to 19

Pinhoe-1 and Arnhem-1 discoveries expand natural gas resource potential in the
Carnarvon Basin
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced further drilling success by its
Australian subsidiary in the Exmouth Plateau area of the Carnarvon Basin, a
premier hydrocarbon basin. 

The Pinhoe-1 exploration discovery well encountered approximately 197 feet (60
meters) of net gas pay in the Barrow and Mungaroo Sands. Pinhoe-1 is located in
the WA-383-P permit area, located approximately 124 miles (200 kilometers) north
of Exmouth off the Western Australia coast. The well was drilled in 3,048 feet
(929 meters) of water to a total depth of 13,396 feet (4,083 meters). 

The Arnhem-1 exploration discovery well confirmed approximately 149 feet (45.5
meters) of net gas pay in the upper Mungaroo Sands. Arnhem-1 is in the WA-364-P
permit area, located approximately 180 miles (290 kilometres) north of Exmouth
off the Western Australia coast. The well was drilled in 3,963 feet (1,208
meters) of water to a total depth of 9,557 feet (2913 meters). 

"Chevron Australia`s ongoing success offshore of Western Australia is a result
of our long-term commitment to exploring and developing the region. The
Carnarvon Basin is a world-class hydrocarbon basin, and these discoveries
underscore the quality of our Australian portfolio and our technical
competence," said George Kirkland, vice chairman, Chevron Corporation. 

Melody Meyer, president, Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production
Company, said the two discoveries expand Chevron`s discovered gas portfolio in
Australia. Chevron has now announced a total of 19 discoveries in Australia
since mid-2009. 

"These discoveries in the Exmouth area are significant as they are located
farther out from other discoveries in the greater Gorgon and Wheatstone
development in the Carnarvon basin and indicates development potential in the
broader region," said Meyer. 

Chevron Australia is the operator of both the WA-383-P and WA-364-P permit areas
and has a 50 percent interest with Shell Development (Australia) Pty Ltd holding
the remaining 50 percent. 

Chevron is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies, with
subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company is involved in
virtually every facet of the energy industry. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and lubricants; manufactures and sells petrochemical
products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy
efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future, including
biofuels. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron

&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, Dec 27 (Marketwire) -- 
Hansen Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: HNSN), a global leader in intravascular
robotics, today announced that President and CEO Bruce Barclay is
scheduled to present at the 31st Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare
Conference. The conference is being held January 7-10, 2013 at the Westin
St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, California. Hansen Medical is
scheduled to present on Thursday, January 10, 2013 at 11:30 a.m. Pacific
Time. 

    Hansen Medical will provide a live webcast of the audio presentation.

A replay of the webcast will be available at the site after the

    About Hansen Medical, Inc. 
 Hansen Medical, Inc., based in Mountain
View, California, is the global leader in intravascular robotics,
developing products and technology designed to enable the accurate
positioning, manipulation and control of catheters and catheter-based
technologies. The Company's Magellan(TM) Robotic System, NorthStar(TM)
Robotic Catheter and related accessories, which are intended to
facilitate navigation to anatomical targets in the peripheral vasculature
and subsequently provide a conduit for manual placement of therapeutic
devices, have undergone both CE marking and 510(k) clearance and are
commercially available in the European Union, and the U.S. In the
European Union, the Company's Sensei(R) X Robotic Catheter System and
Artisan Control Catheter are cleared for use during electrophysiology
(EP) procedures, such as guiding catheters in the treatment of atrial
fibrillation (AF), and the Lynx(R) Robotic Ablation Catheter is cleared
for the treatment of AF. This robotic catheter system is compatible with
fluoroscopy, ultrasound, 3D surface map and patient electrocardiogram
data. In the U.S. the Company's Sensei X Robotic Catheter System and
Artisan Control Catheter were cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for manipulation and control of certain mapping catheters
in EP procedures. In the United States, the Sensei System is not approved
for use in guiding ablation procedures; this use remains experimental.
The U.S. product labeling therefore provides that the safety and
effectiveness of the Sensei X System and Artisan Control Catheter for use
with cardiac ablation catheters in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias,
including AF, have not been established. Additional information can be
found at www.hansenmedical.com.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators approved clot prevention drug Eliquis, developed by Bristol Myers-Squibb Co and Pfizer Inc, for treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation, or irregular heartbeats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug, also known as apixaban, was approved by European health regulators last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliquis belongs to a new class of medicines designed to replace decades-old warfarin for preventing blood clots in heart patients, or after a hip- or knee-replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliquis would compete against approved blood clot preventers such as Xarelto from Johnson &amp; Johnson and Bayer, and Pradaxa from Boehringer Ingelheim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating atrial fibrillation, which greatly raises the risk of strokes, is considered by far the largest and most important use for these new drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oral tablet Eliquis, like Xarelto, works by inhibiting a protein called Factor Xa that plays a critical role in blood clotting. Pradaxa has a slightly different mechanism of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Eliquis should not be taken by patients with prosthetic heart valves or those with atrial fibrillation caused by a heart valve problem, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 5.8 million people in the United States suffer from atrial fibrillation, the most common form of heart arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers shares were up 2 percent at $32.48 and Pfizer shares were up 10 cents at $24.99 in extended trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Prateek Kumar; Editing by Sreejiraj Eluvangal)&lt;/p&gt;

* Adds 2.6 million tonnes per year of new finished product capacity 
* World-scale facility increases jobs in Singapore 
* ExxonMobil begins producing specialty grade metallocene polymers in Asia

SINGAPORE--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil has commenced startup operations at one of the world`s largest
ethylene steam crackers, the centerpiece of the company`s multi-billion dollar
expansion project at its Singapore petrochemical complex.

A new 220-megawatt cogeneration plant joins with the existing 140-megawatt
cogeneration facility to power ExxonMobil's expanded Singapore petrochemical
complex. Cogeneration is significantly more efficient than producing steam and
power separately and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. (Photo: Business Wire)

The expansion, powered by a new 220-megawatt cogeneration plant, adds 2.6
million tonnes per year of new finished product capacity. It includes two new
polyethylene plants, a polypropylene plant, a metallocene elastomers unit, an
oxo-alcohol unit and an aromatics expansion, all of which are completed and
beginning operation. Ethylene production is expected to start in the next few
months. 

"We have doubled the size of our finished product capacity at Singapore, making
this the largest chemical expansion project in ExxonMobil history," said Steve
Pryor, president, ExxonMobil Chemical Company. "This is among the most
technically advanced and competitive manufacturing sites in Singapore and the
Asia Pacific region." 

The new cogeneration plant allows for the efficient generation of electricity to
run pumps, compressors and other equipment, while at the same time producing
additional steam needed in the production processes. Cogeneration is
significantly more efficient than traditional methods of producing steam and
power separately, resulting in lower operating costs and reduced greenhouse gas
emissions. 

The petrochemical expansion is significant to ExxonMobil. It makes the Singapore
facility ExxonMobil`s largest refining and petrochemical complex. It also marks
the first production by ExxonMobil of its proprietary specialty elastomers and
metallocene-based polyethylene in the Asia Pacific region. 

The expansion will increase the chemical plant workforce by 50 percent, bringing
total employment at ExxonMobil`s Singapore integrated refining and chemical
complex to 1,800. During peak construction, the project employed on site 22,000
workers who achieved more than 80 million work hours with no lost-time injuries
in construction activities. 

ExxonMobil has operated in Singapore for more than 100 years and is one of
Singapore`s largest foreign manufacturing investors. The company has expanded
refining and petrochemical production in Singapore to meet expected demand for
transportation fuels and the chemicals used for plastics and other manufacturing
across the Asia Pacific region.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Dec 28 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp has
started up its 1 million tonnes per year steam cracker in
Singapore, and ethylene and other hydrocarbon production is
expected within a few months, a company executive said on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cracker, initially slated to start a year ago, and
associated downstream production makes the Jurong Island
facility the company's largest refining and petrochemical
complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project also includes the production of at least 1.4
million tonnes per year (tpy) of derivative polyolefins and
elastomers, all of which have started commercial operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our strategy was to commission the downstream units in 2012
and be ready before we start up the cracker. Once it runs, we
want to ensure that we can consume all the molecules," Georges
Grosliere, the venture executive and manufacturing director of
the Singapore plant, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that depending on economics, Exxon has the
capability to sell its excess ethylene to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He  expects long-term demand growth in the region to be
healthy, although he said the market will feel a short-term
impact as a number of new crackers start up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've seen that with our first investment 12 years ago. We
are optimistic about the mid- to long-term demand growth."&lt;/p&gt;

Signs Agreement to Acquire Hydraulic Thrust Reverser Actuation Systems ("TRAS") Business from General Electric&lt;WWD.O&gt;</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;FORT COLLINS, CO, Dec 28 (Marketwire) -- 
Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ: WWD) today announced that on December 27, 2012,
it signed a purchase agreement with GE Aviation Systems to acquire the
assets of its hydraulic thrust reverser actuation systems business
located in Duarte, California (the "Duarte Business") for $200 million in
cash, and the parties have entered into a preferred supplier agreement
for thrust reverser actuation systems. The transaction is expected to
close later today. 

    "The acquisition of the Duarte Business by Woodward's Aerospace segment
provides us with expanded motion control technologies and platforms, more
specifically Thrust Reverser Actuation Systems," said Thomas A. Gendron,
Woodward Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 

    The Duarte Business, which employs approximately 350 people, serves
customers such as Boeing, GE, Safran and the U.S. government. Its
products are used primarily on commercial aircraft such as the Boeing
737, 747 and 777, and Airbus A320.

    The Duarte Business' sales for fiscal year 2013 are anticipated to be
approximately $150 million. The Duarte Business will be integrated into
Woodward's Aerospace business segment. Woodward believes there will be
operating synergies and significant opportunities for both organizations
to share technologies and leverage the customer base.

    Woodward has committed financing and available cash sufficient to fund
the payment of the purchase price and also provide short-term liquidity
after closing. Woodward currently has a $400 million revolving credit
facility in place, substantially all of which is currently available. 

    The addition of the Duarte Business is expected to be slightly accretive
to Woodward's earnings per share for fiscal year 2013.

About Acorda Therapeutics

Acorda Therapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on developing therapies
that restore function and improve the lives of people with MS, spinal cord
injury and other neurological conditions. 

Acorda markets AMPYRA&#174; (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg, in the
United States as a treatment to improve walking in patients with multiple
sclerosis (MS). This was demonstrated by an improvement in walking speed. AMPYRA
is marketed outside the United States as FAMPYRA&#174; (prolonged-release fampridine
tablets) by Biogen Idec under a licensing agreement from Acorda. AMPYRA and
FAMPYRA are manufactured under license from Alkermes Pharma Ireland Limited. 

The Company also markets ZANAFLEX CAPSULES&#174; (tizanidine hydrochloride) and
Zanaflex tablets, a short-acting drug for the management of spasticity. Acorda
also receives sales royalties on tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, an
authorized generic version of ZANAFLEX CAPSULES distributed by Watson
Pharmaceutics, Inc. under its agreement with Acorda. 

Acorda has an industry-leading pipeline of novel neurological therapies. The
Company is developing Diazepam Nasal Spray for treatment of certain epileptic
seizures. It is also studying AMPYRA to improve a range of functional
impairments caused by MS, as well as its use in other neurological conditions,
including cerebral palsy and post-stroke deficits. In addition, Acorda is
developing clinical stage compounds AC105 for acute treatment of spinal cord
injury and GGF2 for treatment of heart failure. GGF2 is also being investigated
in preclinical studies as a treatment for neurological conditions such as stroke
and spinal cord injury. Additional development programs include rHIgM22, a
remyelinating monoclonal antibody for the treatment of MS, and chondroitinase,
an enzyme that encourages nerve plasticity in spinal cord injury.

This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than
statements of historical facts, regarding management's expectations, beliefs,
goals, plans or prospects should be considered forward-looking. These statements
are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially, including our ability to successfully market and sell Ampyra in the

complete development of, obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully market
DZNS or other products under development; the occurrence of adverse safety
events with our products; delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory
approval of or to successfully market Fampyra outside of the U.S. and our
dependence on our collaboration partner Biogen Idec in connection therewith;
competition, including the impact of generic competition on Zanaflex Capsules
revenues; failure to protect our intellectual property, to defend against the
intellectual property claims of others or to obtain third party intellectual
property licenses needed for the commercialization of our products; failure to

agencies; and the ability to obtain additional financing to support our
operations. These and other risks are described in greater detail in Acorda
Therapeutics' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Acorda
Therapeutics may not actually achieve the goals or plans described in its

&lt;p&gt;According to a client note by Goldman Sachs Group analyst Irma
Sgarz, early feedback from retailers and trade associations
suggests that this year's year-end holiday sales "came broadly
in line with the already upwardly-revised expectations, with
average sales growth of around 5 percent in real terms." Yet,
while sluggish traffic in the first two weeks of December seemed
to suggest consumers were putting off Christmas purchases until
after being paid the second installment of their year-end
bonuses on Dec. 20, "the big push in the final days did not
materialize," she said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sgarz, apparel retailers including Marisa Lojas
SA and Lojas Renner SA led gains in sales,
pointing to double-digit sales growth at stores open for more
than 12 months. In the case of Grupo P&#227;o de A&#231;&#250;car SA
, Brazil's largest retailer, management at the company
"expressed a certain disappointment with traffic in its durables
stores, where same-store sales (growth) momentum remained below
the year-to-date trend of 8 percent, which may reflect the
unrelenting online migration in the space," the analyst noted.
E-commerce remains aggressive, with strong momentum for B2W Cia
Global de Varejo SA, the note said.&lt;/p&gt;
