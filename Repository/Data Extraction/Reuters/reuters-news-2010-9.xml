&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DC, Sep 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
NBA Legend and sports broadcaster Bill Walton will host two Capitol Hill
briefings on September 14, 2010 as part of San Diego-based CONNECT's
opening of its new Washington, D.C. office. 

    The briefing, titled "Innovation 101: Technology and Innovation in the
Action &amp; Sport Industry," will focus on Mr. Walton's work as Executive
Chairman of the San Diego Sport Innovators (SDSI) and the new innovations
and technologies being developed in the action and sports industry. 

    The House briefing will take place in the Rayburn House Office Building
at 10:00 a.m. in Room 2168, while the Senate briefing will take place in
the afternoon at 2:00 p.m. in the Russell Senate Office Building, Room
428.

    "CONNECT's new D.C. Office and our Innovation 101 series will bring the
innovation community's top policy priorities to the forefront of the
national agenda," said CONNECT Public Policy Director Timothy Tardibono.
"Even in a tough economy, we are seeing extraordinary inventions coming
out of our start-up businesses in fields ranging from action and sport
technologies to life science-diagnostics, clean technology, and wireless
health. The goal of the series is to keep Congress aware of these
inventions and help them understand the impact Congressional decisions
have on a start-up's ability to bring these new inventions to market.
Bill's Hall of Fame sports background makes him the perfect spokesman for
the industry and its federal policy opportunities and concerns."

    Mr. Walton is hopeful that briefing attendees will learn more about the
action and sports industry and how federal policy can accelerate emerging
sports-technologies. "The action and sport industry is an increasingly
innovative sector that touches many lives. We are discovering that what
happens in D.C. impacts whether a San Diego innovator can succeed. I'm
excited about sharing the story of sports innovation with Congressmen,
Senators and their staffs."

(NYSE: DIS).

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

What to Expect from Apple Wednesday

Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) has sent out invitations to the media and analysts to
its technology event scheduled to be held in San Francisco tomorrow, September
1st. The company has traditionally used this platform to unveil new products and
revamp or refresh its existing products -- particularly the iPod and iTunes
lines -- for the holiday season. 

Although the company has remained silent regarding the products to be announced,
it is widely believed that Apple will use the event to announce major upgrades
to its products, which is making the stock price volatile. Following the event,
Apple`s shares could move in either direction. 

We believe the event will be considerably important as Apple`s new product
launches will be a thing to watch out for. The products speculated to be
available are summarized below: 

Refreshed iPod Line?

New products and services could include an updated or refreshed iPod Touch
multimedia device with digital front- and rear-facing cameras and a
higher-resolution screen. The refreshed iPod Touch could also include certain
iPhone 4 technologies, such as FaceTime video chats over Wi-Fi networks, and may
also come with a 3G data connection and prepaid Internet access for video
recording capability, according to analysts. Apple could also add new features
to its iPod Nano. 

Apple`s iPod line (iPod Touch, Classic, Shuffle and Nano) consists of portable
digital music players. Although the iPod constitutes a very small portion of its
revenues, Apple`s resurgence has been driven by the tremendous success of its
iPod portable music and video players and iTunes online store. 

Apple's share of MP3 players in the U.S. was over 70% in June 2010 and it
continues to gain share in most international markets, including the U.K.,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and Australia. 

Apple`s iPod remains popular and the company plans to compete fiercely with
Cisco Systems` (Nasdaq: CSCO) Flip Mino, and Microsoft Corp.'s(Nasdaq: MSFT) new
Zune HD player through its refreshed and new and cost effective iPod line. The
continued mix shift toward iPod Touch is expected to result in an overall iPod
ASP increase in 2010 and beyond. 

Updated Apple TV?

At the event, Apple could also unveil a new redesigned Apple TV set top box
(called iTV by some analysts), priced at $99 (original price $299) and built
around its new iOS and the app store. The addition of the iTunes App Store is
expected to expand its market share. 

Apple TV growth has been sluggish so far, mainly on account of the increasing
competition from cable and satellite providers, which began offering DVR
services with digital cable in one set-top box for free or at monthly
subscription rates that were heavily subsidized and at no upfront costs. 

Apple could launch an all-in-one portable model (TV, set top box and
connectivity) with a free subscription, offering several TV shows and other
programs. According to analysts, the long-term potential of this product is very
strong, given that with connected TVs gaining traction software will be a key
driver of sales. Moreover, Apple will be able to compete against Google (Nasdaq:
GOOG), which is pushing Google TV and its own operating system for getting web
content into televisions. 

Apple may also update its line of entertainment products and offer a new service
of television episodes for 99 cents in rentals from Disney`s (NYSE: DIS) ABC
network, among others.

&lt;p&gt;Worldwide leader in software, services, and solutions to use Hiperos as platform
for global supplier risk and relationship management 
SOUTHBOROUGH, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Hiperos, LLC, a provider of on-demand solutions for extended enterprise
management, announced today that Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) will use Hiperos
to manage all critical aspects of the supplier lifecycle - from initial supplier
registration and assessment of risk to active measurement of performance,
monitoring of compliance, and maintenance of supplier information. It will also
be used for governance and control of strategic relationships. 

As Microsoft continues to build a world class procurement organization, this is
an important milestone. During the past few years, under the leadership of Tim
McBride, general manager and chief procurement officer, Microsoft has improved
its strategic sourcing, enhanced its business and stakeholder relationship
management, focused on relentless execution, and introduced a robust program
infrastructure. 

"In order to maintain a world-class procurement organization, it is critical to
meet the changing requirements of internal stakeholders and external regulatory
bodies," said Tim McBride, general manager and chief procurement officer at
Microsoft. "Hiperos will play an important role in our achieving this goal.
Hiperos delivers a truly unique and integrated supplier relationship management
offering - one that will deliver a benefit to our suppliers and internal
stakeholders alike. " 

"We are proud of the confidence that Microsoft has in Hiperos," said Greg
Dickinson, CEO of Hiperos. "After a comprehensive evaluation of our
functionality, architecture, and security infrastructure, Microsoft trusted our
cloud-based solution to replace important, off-the-shelf and homegrown, SRM
applications. The result is that Microsoft will have access and visibility
across a global supply base of more than 65,000 trading partners." 

Dickinson added "Our use of Microsoft`s development platform has absolutely
contributed to our overall success. By using Microsoft technology, Hiperos has
been able to deliver a cost-effective, secure, highly scalable, and flexible
cloud-based solution." 

Microsoft will initially use Hiperos to register suppliers, streamline AP
processing, monitor data privacy risk, evaluate performance, track diversity
status, and nominate companies to be part of the Microsoft Vendor Program
(MSVP). The result will be a comprehensive, end to end solution for managing
supplier risk, performance, information, and compliance.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) and Visa Inc (V.N) plan to begin a test program that lets customers use smartphones to pay for purchases in stores, a Visa executive told Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program is another step in efforts by Visa, the world's largest transaction processing network, and major U.S. banks to create a "digital wallet," with a host of financial capabilities built into the latest, most sophisticated mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo is the third large U.S. bank to work with Visa on the tests, which will run through the end of this year. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and US Bancorp (USB.N) told Reuters in August that they would test technology that would allow customers to make in-store payments using smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major U.S. banks, technology companies and cellphone providers are jockeying for the lead in the technology, which some say could become a primary means of everyday purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa is also working with other banks to test the technology, Bill Gajda, Visa's head of global mobile products, said in an interview on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to be commercially ready early in 2011" to let consumers use their cellphones to make purchases in stores, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gajda would not discuss details of the timing or location of the Wells Fargo pilot but said the bank would be testing the same technology that Bank of America and US Bancorp are using in their pilots with Visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo spokeswoman Lisa Westermann confirmed via email that the company was running a test program with Visa. She declined to provide details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa shares were up 2 percent at $70.35. Wells Fargo shares rose 3.7 percent to $24.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Maria Aspan; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   * Well plugged on Thursday after nearly 4 months&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Not releasing results for up to two years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Subject to more scrutiny in light of BP spill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CALGARY, Alberta, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
has finished drilling Canada's deepest-ever offshore well, a
project that became the target of heightened scrutiny after the
BP Plc (BP.L) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, a company
spokesman said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron plugged the Lona 0-55 exploration well in the
Orphan Basin in the North Atlantic off Newfoundland last
Thursday, nearly four months after it began drilling, Leif
Sollid, spokesman for Chevron Canada, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is not releasing results from the well, located
430 km (267 miles) northeast of St. John's, Newfoundland. It
can keep them under wraps for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also declined to disclose the cost of the well. Drilling
in the region, known for rough conditions, normally runs in the
tens of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What happens next is we analyze all the data that we
gathered through the drilling program and that will help guide
future decisions," Sollid said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are no current plans for another well in the region,
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Lona O-55 well was drilled in water depth of 2.6 km
(1.6 miles), 1 km (0.6 of a mile) deeper than BP's ill-fated
Gulf of Mexico well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As drilling began, the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador
Offshore Petroleum Board required Chevron to provide test
results for the drilling rig's blowout preventer and activation
systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such systems failed on Transocean Ltd's (RIG.N) Deepwater
Horizon rig, triggering the April 20 explosion that killed 11
workers in the Gulf and caused the oil spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Canadian regulator also subjected the drill ship to
more frequent audits and inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the well. Its partners
are Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) with 20 percent and Exxon
Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO), with 15
percent each.

&lt;p&gt;First in a New Series of Industry-Focused CEBP Applications or GapTools
APPLE VALLEY, Minn.--(Business Wire)--
Convergent, a technology solutions provider recognized nationally for its
expertise in Microsoft Unified Communications (UC) and voice technology, today
announced TimeSweeper, the first in a series of UC-based CEBP applications or
GapTools, also announced today. Designed to enhance existing time and billing
applications for professional service organizations, TimeSweeper automates the
capture of all client communication activity and simplifies the process of
creating work reports and invoices. 

"In response to a growing customer demand for sophisticated, yet simple and
easy-to-use tools for business productivity, we recently expanded our solution
set to include packaged software," explained Khai Tran, CEO of Convergent. "Time
Sweeper is the first example in a series of applications that we`ve designed to
fill critical 'gaps' or needs within the industries we serve." 

Enhances Existing Time Tracking and Billing Software
Designed for service providers such as attorneys, architects, engineers,
marketers and other billable contractors, TimeSweeper integrates with existing
systems to streamline the time tracking process. Multitasking across several
communication channels - phone, email, instant messaging, online meetings and
more - while juggling multiple client projects and dealing with interruptions
can make the time tracking process very difficult. Staff members are often
forced to retrace a week or more of project work and due to the lapse in time
and other priorities, billable time will inevitably overlooked and omitted. 

"As opposed to focusing only on cost, Convergent`s new TimeSweeper application
enables the capture of untapped revenue," said Steve Erickson, Regional Sales
Manager for Microsoft`s Emerging Technologies Unit. "Every email, instant
message, online meeting and conference call is automatically swept into the
system. Built upon Microsoft`s Communication Server platform (OCS 2007 R2),
organizations are able to leverage out-of-the-box applications, at an affordable
cost, to reap the benefits of Unified Communications platform and impact their
bottom line." 

In addition to automating time capture, TimeSweeper makes it easy for
professional service providers such as attorneys, architects, engineers,
marketers and consultants to access an accurate and complete view of all
billable time. At-a-glance data reports make it easy for management to evaluate
and analyze patterns, identify issues and business opportunities. Creating
monthly or quarterly work reports and invoices is greatly simplified, reducing
staff administrative time while avoiding human errors, delays and missed
revenue. 

"In considering today`s pace and the multitude of communication vehicles, it`s
no wonder service organizations struggle with capturing billable time," said
Doug Splinter, CTO of Convergent. "TimeSweeper is the first UC application of
its kind to automate this process and alleviate the burden of time tracking.
With an accurate and simplified process, everyone wins - your staff, management
team and, of course, the client."

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, Sep 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SOA Software, a leading SOA and Cloud Services Governance vendor, today
announced SOLA for IMS, a legacy modernization solution that transforms
IMS applications into high-quality, high-performance enterprise services,
allowing the mainframe to be a full participant in an Service Oriented
Architecture enabled environment.

    SOLA is a comprehensive mainframe Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
solution that cost effectively turns the mainframe into a seamless part
of an SOA enabled environment. SOLA provides customers with a fast and
easy way to expose mainframe applications as secure, high-performance
enterprise services and allows mainframe applications to consume Web
Services. Using SOLA, customers can leverage millions of dollars of
existing mainframe investments as part of their enterprise SOA
environment. The SOLA runtime environment resides entirely on the
mainframe, eliminating the need for expensive, unreliable and unnecessary
middleware. Coupled with SOLA's Development Studio, this vastly increases
developer productivity, providing faster time to market and lower
application development cost. 

    "Many Fortune 1000 companies use IMS," said Jim Crew, Vice President of
SOA Software. "This product extends existing investments and provides
growth opportunities for IMS applications that can be reused in new
business initiatives." 

    SOLA for IMS runs independently of any transaction management software,
making it ideal for IMS-only environments. SOLA for IMS handles IMS
transactions written in COBOL, PL/I or Natural, with multiple input and
output segments. SOLA for IMS also allows any mainframe program to easily
consume services. SOLA's orchestration capabilities allow multiple IMS
transactions to be executed on a single trip to the mainframe, vastly
reducing latency. SOLA for IMS can also service-enable DB2 stored
procedures and SQL statements.

    SOLA is highly optimized, making it the most efficient option for
service-enabling mainframe transactions. Much of SOLA is written in
assembler language, so the SOLA runtime offers lower MSU consumption and
higher throughput than alternatives that use Java and rely on zAAP
specialty engines.

    Unlike alternative solutions that only offer one or two components of
mainframe SOA, SOLA offers a comprehensive SOA solution, further reducing
TCO. SOLA eliminates the need to integrate multiple mainframe and
distributed products/platforms to create enterprise-class services. SOLA
is a Governed Service Platform, making it fully governable by SOA
Software products like Policy Manager and Service Manager.

    Innovative SOLA features such as One-Click service creation and an easy
to use drag-and-drop interface deliver the only secure, standards-based
and governable SOA product in the mainframe industry. SOLA provides
end-to-end SOA governance for the mainframe with WS-Security, WS-Policy,
optimized registry, integrated monitoring, logging, auditing and near
limitless scalability, all implemented on the mainframe. This makes SOLA
the only solution for companies seeking secure, high-volume,
mission-critical mainframe SOA. SOLA is the only product proven in
enterprise implementations to handle high volume (10 million+)
transactions per day in mission-critical mainframe SOA environments.

    About SOA Software 
 SOA Software is a leading provider of unified SOA
and Cloud Services Governance products that enable organizations to plan,
build, and run Cloud and enterprise services. Our SOA Software Atmosphere
Products are built using our Portfolio Manager(TM), Repository
Manager(TM), Policy Manager(TM), and Service Manager(TM). They form a

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON/NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc
(RDSa.L) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) plan to sell their
interest in the Corvette field and platform in the North Sea,
Shell said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The field, which has an ultimate recovery of around 200
billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent, came on-stream in
1999 and has produced through two wells drilled from a single
platform, according to data on a Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N)

oil and gas assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The data room for the asset sale will be open Sept. 6 until

&lt;p&gt;Market-Leading Solution Manages Infrastructure Performance, Availability and
Capacity Across Virtual and Cloud Environments


SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Quest Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: QSFT) today announced that vFoglight&#174;, its
market-leading solution for virtualization monitoring and capacity planning,
will support Microsoft Hyper-V and provide increased automation of virtual
infrastructures with vFoglight 6.5, currently planned for release in Q4 2010.
vFoglight now also supports Microsoft Active Directory and Microsoft Exchange.
Quest will demonstrate all these capabilities in booth 1113 at VMworld, held at
the Moscone Center, San Francisco, Aug. 30 through Sept 2. 

As infrastructures become increasingly complex, and critical applications are
run on virtual and cloud infrastructure, IT teams are increasingly challenged to
manage and control their environment. vFoglight answers a critical need for a
single tool to manage the virtual layer and provide visibility "up the stack"
into the infrastructure and applications running in that environment. With these
enhancements, Quest customers can better deliver on virtualization`s promise of
reducing costs and increasing efficiency while simplifying management. 

Quest is working to set a new standard for analyzing and monitoring performance
and capacity across physical, virtual and cloud infrastructures while easing
administration through automation. "More than 20,000 customers use Quest daily
to manage their virtual infrastructures. By giving organizations greater
application visibility, added administrative control, and support across
multiple hypervisor platforms, we are helping to simplify virtualization
management and reduce operational costs," said Carl Eberling, vice president and
general manager, Virtualization and Monitoring at Quest Software. 

Features and enhancements included in vFoglight 6.5 include:

* Extended Hypervisor Support - Manage multiple hypervisor platforms, including
VMware and Microsoft Hyper-V, more consistently and effectively. 
* Administration - Reduce time and costs of empowering administrators to start,
stop and pause VMs, in the context of daily activities. 
* Event Remediation - Administrators can view alarms then speed
mean-time-to-resolution for problems by launching workflows to automate
resolution. 
* User Perspectives - Designed to provide administrators tailored views for
understanding performance monitoring, capacity planning, chargeback, and more. 
* Enhanced FAQts - First introduced with vFoglight 6.0, the enhanced FAQts in
vFoglight 6.5 provide factual information about the dynamic infrastructure,
displayed clearly for administrators.

Asia
 (Adds industry comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jennifer Tan and and Florence Tan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SINGAPORE, Sept 1 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
has appointed a new head of its commodities business in Asia to
drive growth in the region, even as it closes its U.S. and UK
proprietary trading desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ray Eyles, formerly head of Global Commodities Strategic
Trading in London and the closed proprietary trading desk, will
replace current chief executive Oral Dawe, who is retiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Oral and Ray will work closely on a transition plan which
will ensure the continued acceleration in our long-term growth
in the region," Blythe Masters, the head of JPMorgan's Global
Commodities Group, told Reuters in an emailed response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One industry source said JPMorgan might add more headcount
in Asia, as banks expand in the region's commodity and energy
sectors, drawn by fast growth and more lightly regulated
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysis on banks building up in Asia:     [ID:nSGE66C03P]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Factbox on banks' Asia expansion plans     [ID:nSGE6670GM]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase shut its proprietary trading desk in the
United States and United Kingdom, as the investment bank looks
to comply with new U.S. banking laws, a person briefed on the
matter told Reuters on Tuesday. [ID:nN31255240]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its commodities revenue in Asia has more than tripled over
the past two years, and Eyles is well-positioned to build on
what has been achieved under Dawe, banking sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike Eyles, a trading specialist, Dawe was more focused
on sales and marketing, they said. Eyles has a strong
connection to the region, having worked in Singapore twice
before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has also been CEO of the bank's commodities business in
Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and headed the global
metals operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ASIA EXPANSIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks such as Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX), Citigroup (C.N),
Japan's Nomura (8604.T), Standard Chartered (STAN.L), Societe
Generale (SOGN.PA) and Macquarie (MQG.AX) are beefing up in
Asia, attracted by relatively benign financial market rules
compared with tightening regulation in the United States and
Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan joins a long list of banks that are changing their
trading businesses to comply with the Volcker rule, part of a
broader financial reform law that limits the extent to which
banks can bet with their own money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You can continue under the Volcker rule for several years.
You can also continue to trade if you are involved in physical
material or logistics," an independent commodities trader in
Singapore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The prop desks will go, but they will just be absorbed by
the main bank."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry sources said most banks expected to increase their
volumes from risk-management services to end users such as
refiners, airlines and shippers, versus purely speculative
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The new regulation allows the banks to do as much
proprietary volumes as they have flow volumes," said a
Singapore-based trader with a Western bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This would mean that for the bigger guys, they would have
to increase their flows if they want to be able to sustain the
prop volumes that they currently do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, JPMorgan reduced its global commodity sales and
trading team by up to 50 people as it removed overlap created
after the takeover of RBS Sempra Commodities. [ID:nLDE66L0WL]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, the bank hired Colin Fenton to fill a newly
created role of global head of commodities strategy.

&lt;p&gt;The agreement, struck more than half a day after a Thursday midnight deadline passed, will provide expanded access to Disney-owned content, including the new Disney Junior basic cable channel and ESPN Networks, via the Web for Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also features more video-on-demand on cable, including ABC On Demand and Disney-branded programing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sides said in a statement they were pleased to have reached a deal without disrupting service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fee dispute has primarily been about how much the cable operator would pay Disney for the right to carry its TV networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While fee negotiations are always about how much the cable operator pays, the talks between Time Warner Cable and Disney were complicated by the increased competition from online video services such as Netflix Inc's streaming service and Amazon.com Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives at Time Warner Cable had also been concerned new services such as Apple Inc's 99-cent TV show rental service launched on Wednesday would compete with cable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executives had also been reluctant to pay a carriage fee for ESPN3.com, a Disney website that features some live sports that is only available to subscribers of its programing partners' Internet service provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a bid to assuage such concerns, Disney expanded its Web offering to include new subscriber authenticated access to watch ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNU online, as well as through mobile connected devices such as the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable will also be rolling out two sports highlights channels called ESPN Goal Line and ESPN Buzzer Beater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key features of Web TV has been the ability of users to watch shows when it suits them.

ABC On Demand and Disney-branded programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both sides said in a statement they were pleased to have
reached a deal without disrupting service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fee dispute has primarily been about how much the cable
operator would pay Disney for the right to carry its TV
networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While fee negotiations are always about how much the cable
operator pays, the talks between Time Warner Cable and Disney
were complicated by the increased competition from online video
services such as Netflix Inc's (NFLX.O) streaming service and
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Executives at Time Warner Cable had also been concerned new
services such as Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) 99-cent TV show rental
service launched on Wednesday would compete with cable.
[ID:nN31268065].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The executives had also been reluctant to pay a carriage
fee for ESPN3.com, a Disney website that features some live
sports that is only available to subscribers of its programming
partners' Internet service provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a bid to assuage such concerns, Disney expanded its Web
offering to include new subscriber authenticated access to
watch ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNU online, as well as through mobile
connected devices such as the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time Warner Cable will also be rolling out two sports
highlights channels called ESPN Goal Line and ESPN Buzzer
Beater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the key features of Web TV has been the ability of
users to watch shows when it suits them. To this end, Time
Warner Cable and Disney also expanded the range of on-demand
programming to include ABC On Demand, which feature prime-time
shows such as Grey's Anatomy and Desperate Housewives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal has also expanded on-demand Disney-branded shows
and locally relevant sports from ESPN in markets that include
Los Angeles, New York, North and South Carolina, Tampa,
Orlando, Texas and Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two sides also clashed over Time Warner Cable paying
cash for a retransmission fee to carry free-to-air ABC
broadcast signals on their cable systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But retransmission had become almost a secondary issue as
cable operators worry the cable programming business model
could be unraveled by the increasing availability of current TV
shows sold individually on the Web.

&lt;p&gt;  TAMPA, FL, Sep 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT), a leading U.S. producer and exporter of
premium hard coking coal for the global steel industry, announced today
that it is modifying its full-year 2010 coking coal sales expectations.
The Company now expects to sell between 7.2 and 7.5 million tons for the
full-year 2010, compared to a previously expected range of between 7.7
and 7.9 million tons, primarily driven by lower expected coking coal
production volumes. 

    "Since moving to a new longwall panel at Mine No. 4 early in the quarter,
we have experienced, and continue to see difficult mining conditions in
the panel, significantly slowing down longwall production," said Joe
Leonard, interim chief executive officer of Walter Energy. "These
conditions have contributed to a production shortfall of approximately
200,000 tons through August. However, based on section development work
further in the panel, we expect production to improve, but not enough for
us to maintain previously expected production volumes." 

    "Continuous miner production in the second longwall panel of our Mine No.
7 East expansion has improved over the last several weeks compared to the
advance rates we saw in the second quarter," he said. "If these rates
continue, production in the new longwall panel could start earlier in
December than previously expected, increasing coking coal inventory
available for sale in early 2011."

    Coking coal production volumes are now expected to total approximately
1.8 million tons in the third quarter at a cost of approximately $60 per
ton. The Company is maintaining coking coal sales volume expectations of
1.8 to 2.0 million tons for the quarter. However, the higher cost per ton
is expected to lead to lower operating income margins, with operating
income now expected to average between $107 and $110 per ton, compared to
the previously expected range of $110 - $115 per ton.

    Walter Energy is a leading U.S. producer and exporter of premium hard
coking coal for the global steel industry and also produces steam coal
and industrial coal, metallurgical coke and coal bed methane gas. The

&lt;p&gt; * Departure follows decision to shut proprietary desks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Tim Jones, former director RBS Sempra Commods, led team
 (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By David Sheppard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Up to five JPMorgan (JPM.N)
proprietary metals traders in London left the company this
week, including former Sempra trader Tim Jones, industry
sources said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier in the week, the bank told proprietary commodity
traders -- who bet on commodities with the bank's own money --
that their desk would shut down to comply with new U.S. banking
laws. [ID:nN31255240]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim Jones, who headed the proprietary metals trading team
according to sources, was a former managing director at RBS
Sempra Commodities that was bought by JPMorgan in February of
this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources said the other four traders worked on Jones'
trading team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan joins a long line of banks that are changing their
trading businesses to comply with the Volcker rule, part of a
broader financial reform law that limits the extent to which
banks can bet with their own capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), for example, is looking at
turning its proprietary equity trading unit into a hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest move may increase concerns within banks that
they could lose traders to hedge funds and trading houses that
are not bound by the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks have time to comply with the law, but many are eager
to figure out how to deal with the business soon, before
traders jump ship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources did not say where Jones' trading team was headed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman at JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOVING ON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The departures are the latest following the takeover by
JPMorgan of RBS Sempra Commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In July, JPMorgan cut between 40 and 50 commodity trading
jobs to remove overlap at the firm. They were primarily from
its energy trading arm with the majority of the cuts in London.
[ID:nLDE66L0WL]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's commodity team is believed to have lost well
over $100 million in a disastrous coal deal during the second
quarter, traders dealing with JPMorgan said in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank raised its commodity trading risk in the second
quarter for the first time in nine months, but earned less from
the sector as prices fell, the company's results showed earlier
this year. [ID:nN15224842]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan agreed to buy RBS Sempra Commodities' non-U.S.
businesses in February, including global oil, metals, coal and
European power and gas businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition was completed at the start of July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $1.6 billion takeover gave JPMorgan physical access to
new markets around the world, with 26 locations in more than 10
countries and more than 130 storage and warehousing
facilities.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

FDIC List Slows, More Banks Go Bust

According to a government report released on Tuesday, the number of banks on the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation`s (FDIC) list of problem institutions in
the second quarter grew to 829 from 775 in the previous quarter and 416 in the
year-ago quarter. This is the highest since the savings and loan crisis in the
early 1990s. 

Banks that feature on the problem list are most likely to fail, though some may
still scrape through. As of now, only about 13% of banks on the FDIC's problem
list have actually failed so far. What is interesting is that this percentage is
likely to change; though the problem list is growing at a slower pace, bank
failures are accelerating. 

The How and Why of Bank Failures

There have been 118 bank failures so far this year, compared to 140 in 2009, 25
in 2008 and just 3 in 2007. Increasing loan losses on commercial real estate are
expected to cause hundreds more bank failures in the next few years. 

While the bigger banks benefited greatly from the various programs launched by
the government, many smaller banks are still weak. Tumbling home prices, soaring
loan defaults and a high unemployment rate continue to take their toll on such
institutions. 

As the industry absorbs bad loans made during the credit boom, the trouble in
the banking system goes even deeper, increasing the possibility of more bank
failures. Economic threats emanating from the European debt crisis, the impact
of tighter regulations of the new financial reform law and weak economic growth
data released by the U.S. government last Friday further add to the concerns. 

FDIC: Mentor Tormented?

The FDIC insures deposits in 7,932 banks and savings associations in the country
and promotes the safety and soundness of these institutions. When a bank fails,
the FDIC reimburses customers for deposits of up to $250,000 per account. Though
the FDIC managed to shore up its deposit insurance fund during the last couple
of quarters, the outbreak of bank failures has tested its limits. As of June 30,
2010, the fund remained in the red with a deficit of $15.2 billion. 

To further stretch the dwindling FDIC reserves, the amount of assets from the
failed banks is expected to be lower as banks have been cleaning up their
balance sheets. 

On the positive side, the consolidated earnings of the FDIC-insured banks came
in at approximately $21.6 billion during the second quarter compared to a loss
of $4.4 billion a year ago. This marks the highest in nearly three years. 

Increasing loan losses on commercial real estate are expected to precipitate
hundreds more bank failures in the next few years. The FDIC expects bank
failures to cost about $60 billion over the next four years. 

Loans and Margins: The Vicious Cycle

Government efforts in restoring the lending activity at the banks have not
succeeded either. Lower lending will continue to hurt margins and the overall
economy, though the low interest rate environment should be beneficial to banks
with a liability-sensitive balance sheet. 

On the other hand, even with near-zero interest rates, many banks have failed to
encourage investment. Moreover, the Congress remains reluctant to provide more
bailout funds to the banks as the government`s deficit is significantly
increasing. 

What Price Consolidation?

The failure of Washington Mutual in 2008 was the largest in U.S. banking
history. It was acquired by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM). Other major
acquirers of failed institutions since 2008 include SunTrust Banks Inc. (NYSE:
STI), PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (NYSE: PNC), BB Corporation (NYSE:
BBT) and Regions Financial Corp. (NYSE: RF). 

If the current pace of consolidation remains intact, we will see only a few
large banks survive, exposing the industry to an oligopolistic market, which is
not desirable. Does the Obama administration have a solution for this?

&lt;p&gt;OLDWICK, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
A.M. Best Co. has affirmed the financial strength rating of A- (Excellent) and
issuer credit ratings of "a-" of Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company
(Commonwealth) and its subsidiary, First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance
Company (FAFLIC) (both domiciled in Southborough, MA), and Columbia Capital Life
Reinsurance Company (Columbia) and its subsidiary, Charleston Capital
Reinsurance LLC (Charleston) (both domiciled in Washington, DC). The outlook for
all ratings is stable. Commonwealth and its affiliates are ultimately wholly
owned subsidiaries of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Goldman Sachs). 

Commonwealth reinsures universal life, variable universal life and other types
of policies, while FAFLIC reinsures traditional life, payout annuities and other
types of policies. The entire book of business at Columbia and Charleston is
currently comprised of blocks retroceded from Commonwealth. 

The ratings recognize the consolidated solid risk-adjusted capitalization of the
Goldman Sachs life reinsurance companies, the history of GAAP earnings (despite
fluctuating statutory results) and strong liquidity. The ratings also consider
A.M. Best`s expectation that the reinsurance group has access to capital,
hedging expertise, deal flow and other Goldman Sachs resources, as needed.
Commonwealth also has improved its risk profile by ceding its variable annuity
business to a Bermuda affiliate. 

Despite these positive attributes, A.M. Best believes the reinsurance group may
encounter challenges in achieving meaningful scale efficiencies given the highly
competitive nature of the life reinsurance market, which is dominated by
companies with well established life reinsurance franchises. If additional
blocks cannot be acquired at the expected pace, Commonwealth may not grow into
the scale required to generate consistent and strong statutory profits. An
additional challenge includes achieving favorable market investment portfolio
performance in the current difficult economic climate. 

The principal methodology used in determining these ratings is Best`s Credit
Rating Methodology -- Global Life and Non-Life Insurance Edition, which provides
a comprehensive explanation of A.M. Best`s rating process and highlights the
different rating criteria employed. Additional key criteria utilized include:
"Risk Management and the Rating Process for Insurance Companies"; "Update to
BCAR for Life &amp; Health Insurers"; "Rating Members of Insurance Groups"; and
"Assessing Country Risk." Methodologies can be found at
www.ambest.com/ratings/methodology. 

Founded in 1899, A.M. Best Company is a global full-service credit rating
organization dedicated to serving the financial and health care service
industries, including insurance companies, banks, hospitals and health care
system providers. For more information, visit www.ambest.com.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Sep 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
J.P. Morgan captures a record-smashing 55 positions in the 2010
All-America Fixed-Income Research Team survey, Institutional Investor's
annual ranking of the nation's top fixed-income analysts.

    The firm picks up 13 more positions than it won last year -- including
seven additional analysts or teams ranked No. 1 in their respective
sectors, for a total of 26 first-place finishes -- and bumps down to
second place the research department that had ruled the roost for the
past decade, last year as part of Barclays Capital and for the nine years
before that as part of Lehman Brothers. 

    Lehman held the previous record for most positions won: 47, in 2008. That
year's survey was completed just weeks before Lehman Brothers Holdings
collapsed into bankruptcy, plunging the world into the worst financial
crisis in decades. Barclays subsequently acquired Lehman's North American
operations.

    BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research holds steady in third place even
though it picks up six more positions, for a total of 40. Returning in
fourth and fifth place, respectively, are Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., with 24
positions (two more than in 2009), and Wells Fargo Securities, with 15
(one more than last year). 

    Results are based on responses from more than 1,100 buy-side analysts and
investment officers at nearly 440 firms managing an estimated $8.9
trillion in U.S. fixed-income assets.

    The complete list of winners can be found on our Web site,

&lt;p&gt;PARIS--(Business Wire)--
Less than a year after its inception, Allmyapps, vendor of allmyapps.com, the
first application store for Windows, today announces the completion of a &#8364; 1
millions Series A round of financing led by Elaia Partners. 

In addition to the Series A funding, Allmyapps will receive support from the
Microsoft IDEES program, an initiative dedicated to nurturing innovation in
high-potential technology startups. 

Created in June 2009 by Thibauld Favre and Arnaud Coulondre, Allmyapps offers PC
users hasslefree software management solutions. Totally free, the allmyapps.com
website enables end-users to discover new applications and to install and manage
them in a single click. Over 30.000 registered users and more than a million
applications installed via the website testify to its success and popularity. 

By using this investment to accelerate the continued development of the
application store and to fund its international expansion, Allmyapps will
position its application store for Windows to become undisputed leader
worldwide. 

A video is available here: http://bit.ly/9Vt2MA

Allmyapps chose Elaia Partners based on their business experience and previous
track record with technology startups. "With Elaia Partners on our board, we're
confident that we will achieve our vision of an outstanding mass marketservice
with the best VC of the market," explainsThibauld Favre, co-founder and CEO of
Allmyapps.

Arnaud Coulondre, co-founder of Allmyapps adds, 'This Series A round will enable
us to accelerate the development of our platform into the premiere application
store for Windows.With the release of truly innovative new services, the next
few months promise to be exciting for Allmyapps and its users."

Marie Ekeland, Partner at Elaia Partners comments, "Allmyapps' positioning is
unique and meets a user need that has been unaddressed so far. The nineties saw
fully-featured desktop applications that were disk and memory intensive and
complicated to install. As time progressed, users gained access to lightweight,
web-based applications.Looking to the future, we must provide both feature-rich
applications and ease of installation to users.The Windows market is the world's
largest, and Allmyapps will bring PC users together with two key services -the
ability to discover new applications through social recommendations, and the
flexibility of application configurations stored on the Allmyapps servers."
Allmyapps is Elaria Partners twenty-first investment. 

Microsoft IDEES membership 

Concurrent to the Series A round, Allmyapps announces its membership inthe
Microsoft IDEES program, confirming the mutual commitment of both companies to
deploy the best application store for Windows. 

Blaise Vignon, Microsoft IDEES program Manager, says, "Allmyapps entered
Microsoft's innovative companies support program (IDEES) through Bizspark, a
global network of investors and startups.We've working closely with Allmyapps
since the very beginning of their adventure and it's a real pleasure to expand
our partnership with IDEES. We look forward to announcing shared events and the
forthcoming developments of the application store for Windows."

Favre adds, "We're delighted to be able to work more closely with Microsoft.
With the IDEES program we'll gain access to invaluable resources that will boost
the development of our new products. On top of hosting our download platform on
Azure, our upcoming versions of the application store will heavily leverage the
.NET framework and more specifically WPF. We're thanking Microsoft for its
support !"

The Microsoft IDEES program 

The IDEES (Initiative pour le D&#233;veloppement &#201;conomique des &#201;diteurs de logiciels
et des Start-up) program waslaunched by Microsoft France in October 2005 in
order to support the development of French innovating startups on an annual
basis. 

The IDEES program allowsMicrosoft France to work closely with French VCs to
provide a support framework to French software startups.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable (TWC.N) and
Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) ensured millions of U.S. cable customers
can still watch some of their favorite TV programs while the
companies kept working on a new programming deal after a
midnight deadline passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The programming fee dispute between the two sides is over
how much the cable operator would pay Disney for the right to
carry TV networks including ABC, various ESPN channels and other
Disney-owned channels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It affects several million homes across New York, Los
Angeles, Houston, and other cities in Ohio, North Carolina and
Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time Warner Cable spokeswoman Maureen Huff said both sides
were still working on a deal and would have an update later in
the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both sides had agreed on Sunday to cool off on a barrage of
hard-hitting adverts aimed at customers and said they had made
"significant progress" in what had become increasingly
contentious talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While programming fee negotiations are always about how much
the cable operator pays for carriage, the talks between Time
Warner Cable and Disney were further complicated by issue such
as competition from online video services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Executives at Time Warner Cable had been concerned that
reports of new services such as Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) 99-cent TV
show rental service launched on Wednesday would compete with
cable's offering. [ID:nN31268065]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two sides also clashed over Time Warner Cable paying
cash for a retransmission fee to carry free-to-air broadcast
systems on their cable systems.

 (Adds detail)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sumeet Chatterjee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MUMBAI, Sept 2 (Reuters) - State-run Steel Authority of
India Ltd (SAIL.BO) has shortlisted Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE),
JP Morgan (JPM.N) and four others to manage a share issue that
may raise up to $1.7 billion, sources with direct knowledge
said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other bankers shortlisted by the largest domestic producer
of the alloy are HSBC (HSBA.L), SBI Capital, Enam Securities
and Kotak Mahindra Capital, the sources, who could not be named
as they were not authorised to speak to the media, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials at SAIL in New Delhi and the shortlisted banks
were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government plans to sell 5 percent in the company,
while SAIL will issue new shares equal to 5 percent of its
existing share capital. The government owns about 86 percent in
the firm, which can produce 15 million tonnes of steel a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale is likely to be launched in January, the sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A 10 percent share sale would fetch about $1.7 billion,
according to Reuters calculation based on the current market
price. In April, India's cabinet approved a 20 percent stake
sale in the company in two tranches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in SAIL, with a market value of $16.5 billion, were
trading up 1.8 percent at 191.20 rupees at 11:44 a.m. (0614
GMT), while the main Mumbai index .BSESN was up 0.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock is down about 21 percent in the year to date
against a 5 percent rise in the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANKS GET NOTHING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A large number of foreign and domestic banks in India vie
for equity underwritings of state-run firms for league table
credits, even as the fees on the government deals are usually
very low and in some cases lead managers make a loss.
 The lowest financial bid for managing the SAIL issue was at
about one-hundredth of a rupee, two sources with direct
knowledge said. This translates to almost no fees for the banks
that will manage the offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, state miner NMDC Ltd (NMDC.BO) had
raised $2.2 billion in a follow-on share sale that made
virtually no money for the banks involved, sources with direct
knowledge of the deal had said. [ID:nSGE63S0FS]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides gaining league table standing and brand
recognition, banks justify doing cheap or loss-making deals in
the hope they will lead to flow-based trading business in
future and open doors for follow-on deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government plans to raise $8.6 billion through stake
sales in the fiscal year that ends next March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indian companies have raised more than $14 billion through
share sales so far this year, compared with $16 billion raised
in 2009, according to Thomson Reuters Data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total equity offerings in 2010 are expected to reach $30
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SAIL sale is part of a government plan to sell stakes
in about 60 state-run firms over the next few years, as India
moves to cut a stubbornly high fiscal deficit and garner funds
to spend on schemes for the poor. [ID:nSGE64R0BK]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State-owned Coal India will launch its initial public
offering, which aims to raise as much as $3 billion, on Oct.
18, the chairman of the world's largest coal miner said last
month. [ID:nSGE67Q036]

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday dismissed part of a criminal case accusing a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc computer programer of stealing proprietary computer code from the bank's lucrative high-frequency trading platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defendant, Sergey Aleynikov, won the dismissal of one count, alleging unauthorized computer access, in a three-count indictment, in a ruling by U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cote rejected Aleynikov's request to dismiss the other two counts, which concerned the alleged theft of trade secrets and transportation of stolen property in interstate commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government had alleged that on June 5, 2009, his last day working at Goldman, Aleynikov downloaded the code to an outside server and transferred it over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov sent code files to his personal email, a laptop and other places for storage, and on July 2 took the laptop and another storage device to his new employer, Teza Technologies LLC, a high-frequency trading start-up based in Chicago, prosecutors charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI arrested Aleynikov a day later at Newark Liberty International Airport. Teza later suspended him. The arrest has been credited with drawing attention to the fast-growing business of high-frequency trading in U.S. stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cote said in dismissing the one count that Aleynikov could not have violated one provision of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as prosecutors said, because the government conceded he had been authorized to access the relevant source code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was 40 at the time of his February indictment, and could have faced up to 25 years in prison if convicted on all charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on our preliminary review, we are very gratified that the judge found no basis for charging Mr. Aleynikov with violating the computer fraud and abuse act," said Kevin Marino, the defendant's lawyer, in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marino said he may appeal the decision to let the remaining counts stand to the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment. Goldman did not immediately return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months after Aleynikov's indictment, prosecutors charged former Societe Generale trader Samarth Agrawal with stealing computer code used in high-frequency proprietary trading in the French bank's New York office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agrawal was indicted in May, and has pleaded not guilty, his lawyer Ivan Fisher said. A trial in that case is set for November 8, court records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v.

 (Adds lawyers' comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday
dismissed part of a criminal case accusing a former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) computer programmer of stealing
proprietary computer code from the bank's lucrative
high-frequency trading platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The defendant, Sergey Aleynikov, won the dismissal of one
count, alleging unauthorized computer access, in a three-count
indictment, in a ruling by U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in
Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cote rejected Aleynikov's request to dismiss the other two
counts, which concerned the alleged theft of trade secrets and
transportation of stolen property in interstate commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government had alleged that on June 5, 2009, his last
day working at Goldman, Aleynikov downloaded the code to an
outside server and transferred it over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov sent code files to his personal email, a laptop
and other places for storage, and on July 2 took the laptop and
another storage device to his new employer, Teza Technologies
LLC, a high-frequency trading start-up based in Chicago,
prosecutors charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FBI arrested Aleynikov a day later at Newark Liberty
International Airport. Teza later suspended him. The arrest has
been credited with drawing attention to the fast-growing
business of high-frequency trading in U.S. stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cote said in dismissing the one count that Aleynikov could
not have violated one provision of the Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act, as prosecutors said, because the government conceded he
had been authorized to access the relevant source code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov was 40 at the time of his February indictment,
and could have faced up to 25 years in prison if convicted on
all charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Based on our preliminary review, we are very gratified
that the judge found no basis for charging Mr. Aleynikov with
violating the computer fraud and abuse act," said Kevin Marino,
the defendant's lawyer, in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marino said he may appeal the decision to let the remaining
counts stand to the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan
declined to comment. Goldman did not immediately return a call
seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two months after Aleynikov's indictment, prosecutors
charged former Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) trader Samarth
Agrawal with stealing computer code used in high-frequency
proprietary trading in the French bank's New York office.
[ID:nN19221433].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agrawal was indicted in May, and has pleaded not guilty,
his lawyer Ivan Fisher said. A trial in that case is set for
Nov. 8, court records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York, No. 10-cr-00096.

&lt;p&gt; * Moving to comply with 'Volcker rule' - Bloomberg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman Sachs declines to comment on report&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Other Wall Street banks changing trading units
 (Adds further details on Sze in final paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
is closing its principal strategies desk as U.S. regulators try
to limit trading risk that major banks take with their money,
Bloomberg News reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report, citing two people with knowledge of the
decision, said Goldman would delay announcing the move as 65 to
70 members of the unit sought new jobs. Some traders and
support staff could be reassigned within the firm, and a team
in Asia could look to start a new hedge fund, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs spokesman Ed Canaday declined to comment on
the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman would be the latest Wall Street bank to change its
trading business to try to comply with the "Volcker rule,"
which limits the extent to which banks can bet with their own
capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source said on Tuesday that JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
had told commodities traders who bet with the bank's money that
their desk would be shut down as the bank moved to comply with
new laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over time, other groups at the bank are also expected to
shut down their proprietary trading desks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But many outside investors and analysts wonder if these
banks' changes are simply cosmetic steps designed to appease
regulators and the broader public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "How do you define what is proprietary trading and what is
not?" said Anton Schutz, president of Mendon Capital Advisors,
which specializes in financial stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As banks have started restructuring to comply with the
Dodd-Frank financial reform law signed in July, Goldman's
trading plans have drawn particular attention, because the firm
generates so much of its revenue from trading its own money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has said that as much as 10 percent of its revenue
comes from proprietary trading, but some analysts believe that
figure is based on a narrow definition of "proprietary
trading."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks typically have traders on proprietary desks that
trade with multiple banks using the firm's money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they also have traders who trade with customers and
other banks to make markets. It is not often clear whether a
customer trader is buying a security to help a client complete
a trade, or to take on a particular risk for the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shutting down proprietary trading desks alone may not mean
Goldman as a whole reduces its risk-taking or stops making bets
with its own money, a head of equities at a rival bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That's really the question -- is the firm just taking more
risk in its customer business after shutting down its prop
desk?" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's shares rose $7.51, or 5.37 percent, to close at
$147.29 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MULTIPLE OPTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has explored multiple options for the desk in the
aftermath of the new U.S. financial reform law, sources
familiar with the matter told Reuters last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One option Goldman considered was spinning off the desk
into a separate fund that would raise its own capital from
investors, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another option was to shift the unit's employees into
Goldman's asset management business, where they would become
part of a $7 billion internal hedge fund that manages money for
the firm's wealthy customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The equity head at a rival bank said he was sure Goldman
would not simply move its prop traders to customer desks,
because prop traders typically do not want to work with
clients, and regulators would likely frown on the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's Principal Strategies group is housed within the
equities division, and is led by Hong Kong-based Morgan Sze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bloomberg reported that Morgan Sze may set up a fund with a
smaller team focused on Asia. It also said that employees in
London and new York were considering different options.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Buffett Bids $500M for Wesco Stake

Following up on his intention of buying 19.9% of Wesco Financial Corp.`s (NYSE:
WSC) holding, Warren Buffett -- Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
(NYSE: BRK-B) -- yesterday formally announced a bid to that effect. 

The offer laid down by Buffet to buy the rest of Wesco includes a combination of
Class-B shares (Buffet uses Class-B shares for acquisitions) and cash. The total
value reserved for the acquisition is approximately $500 million, when measured
in terms of the acquiring company`s book value per share, which stood at $353 at
the end of June 30, 2010. 

Pasadena, California-based Wesco has been 80.1% owned by Blue Chip Stamps, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire since 1973. Thus, Wesco and its
subsidiaries are controlled by Blue Chip and therefore, indirectly, by
Berkshire. All of these companies may also be deemed to be under the control of
Buffett, who owns of 24.3% of Wesco`s stock. 

Wesco is run by Charles T. Munger, who is also the vice chairman of Berkshire
Hathaway. Munger also consults with Buffett on Wesco`s investment decisions,
major capital allocations and the selection of chief executives to head each of
its operating businesses. 

Though different in size, Berkshire and Wesco are similar in terms of business
operations. Wesco is also a conglomerate housing businesses such as insurance,
furniture rental and industrial products. Its Insurance segment consists of the
operations of Wesco Financial Insurance Co. and Kansas Bankers Surety Co. The
Furniture Rental segment consists of the operations of CORT Business Services
Corp. The Industrial segment comprises Precision Steel`s service center and
industrial supply operations. 

Wesco also holds shares in some of the same companies as Berkshire, including
Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) and Wells Fargo &amp; Co.
(NYSE: WFC). 

Wesco continues to have a strong consolidated balance sheet, with high liquidity
and relatively low debt with equity investments in strong, well-known companies.
Wesco reported a 1.8% year over year increase in 2009 revenues to reach $813.3
million. 

Buffett intends to convert Wesco into a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire,
utilize approximately $28 billion of cash from Berkshire and simplify
operations. Besides, Munger is already 86 and would not carry on with the role
of its chairman for long. Moreover, with 80% of interest and a lot of
involvement with Wesco, it just makes good business sense to own it completely.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features: Citigroup (NYSE: C),
Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) and JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:
JPM). 

Bank Stocks are Lagging: Is It a Sign?

Are the Bank Stocks Sending a Signal?

These large banks led stocks out of the dark times in 2009. Obviously, the
massive gains weren't going to last for forever as the stocks bounced off of
what was extremely low valuations to more normalized trading. 

The easy trading revenue that had boosted the banks in the last year has turned
out to be difficult to maintain which has led to a slowing in revenue gains. 

The other divisions, such as investment banking, are still a shadow of their
former selves. There are still many issues regarding housing and foreclosures to
work through which will likely lead to further loan losses. 

A lot of the banks' issues are similar to what is going on in the overall
economy. Some areas look okay and others, like housing, do not. 

The recent sharp sell-off could be a signal that investors expect more stress in
the financial industry, and, conversely, also in the overall economy. 

All investors should be paying close attention to the big cap financials for the
rest of 2011. 

Where The Banks Stand Today

Citigroup (NYSE: C) remains the weakest of the big banks and its stock price
reflects that. It has a forward P/E of 10.1. It has surprised on the Zacks
Consensus Estimate 2 out of the last 4 quarters by an average of 20.6%. 

3 estimates have moved higher on 2010 in the last 30 days. The 2010 Zacks
Consensus climbed 5 cents to 38 cents in the last 2 months. That is earnings
growth of 128% as Citigroup lost $1.34 per share in 2009. 

Citigroup is a Zacks #3 Rank (hold) stock. Its shares are, once again, back
below $5. 

Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) trades with a forward P/E of 14. This Zacks #3 Rank
(hold) stock has surprised on the Zacks Consensus 2 out of the last 4 quarters
by an average of 14.4%. 

Estimates are mixed, with 1 moving higher and 1 going lower for 2010 over the
last month. The 2010 consensus has fallen a penny in that time to 94 cents. 

Analysts expect earnings growth of over 500% in 2010 as the company lost 22
cents per share in 2009. 

Shares bounced off new 52-week lows this week. 

Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) has much more stable fundamentals than some of the
others. It was profitable in 2009 as the bank made $1.81 per share, and will be
profitable again this year. Analysts expect 16.9% earnings growth in 2010. 

1 estimate has moved higher and 1 has moved lower for 2010 in the last month.
The 2010 Zacks Consensus has risen 16 cents to $2.12 per share in the last 60
days. 

Wells Fargo trades with a forward P/E of 11.7. It is a Zacks #3 Rank (hold)
stock. 

The stock has been weak in recent sessions, coming close to new 52-week lows
before rebounding. 

JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) is the only one of the four to surprise on the Zacks
Consensus each of the last 4 quarters. 

3 estimates are higher for 2010 in the last 30 days with one also moving lower.
The 2010 Zacks Consensus rose 2 cents to $3.64 in that time. 

This is earnings growth of 62.5% over 2009, where earnings came in at $2.24 per
share. 

JP Morgan is also a Zacks #3 Rank (hold) stock. It has a forward P/E of 10.4. 

The stock also traded near its 52-week low in the last few sessions.

&lt;p&gt;   * Says cancer vaccine not strategic priority for Pfizer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says will conduct late-stage studies on its own&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Worldwide rights to vaccine revert to Celldex on Nov. 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Celldex shares tank 39 pct to lifetime low
 (Adds analyst comments; updates stock movement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Shravya Jain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANGALORE, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Celldex Therapeutics Inc
(CLDX.O) said it would go it alone on the development of its
lead cancer vaccine, after partner Pfizer (PFE.N) pulled out
saying the program was no longer a strategic priority for the
drug giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though Pfizer's pull out sent Celldex's stock crashing to a
life low, analysts said they were confident the company could
advance the vaccine into late-stage trials without a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As much as people are saying that Pfizer didn't believe in
the drug, (Pfizer) didn't really say that. It just has
different priorities," WBB Securities analyst Steve Brozak
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Needham  Co analyst Mark Monane said despite a higher
financial risk, the execution risk for the drug's development
has not increased as Celldex has the experience and the
resources to take it forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Celldex can bring the drug into Phase 3 in the first half
of 2011," Monane said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In May, the company said data from a mid-stage trial of the
vaccine, called CDX-110, showed progression-free survival for
70 percent of the patients afflicted with a type of brain
tumor, and claimed the results were 40 percent better than the
current standard of care. [ID:nN20241460]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Celldex's CDX-110 is an immunotherapy vaccine -- the drug
targets a molecule that is present only in tumor cells. The
vaccine is similar to Dendreon's (DNDN.O) Provenge -- the only
FDA approved cancer vaccine, which treats advanced prostate
cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We don't need a partner going forward. We plan on pushing
(the vaccine rindopepimut) into Phase 3 ourselves," Celldex
Chief Executive Anthony Marucci said, adding that the company
would need to raise money at "some point" to complete the
study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brean Murray, Carret  Co analyst Jonathan Aschoff expects
the trial to cost less than $50 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Celldex, with a market value of about $146.7 million, had
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $65.8
million as of June 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a conference call with analysts, CEO Marucci said the
company will now need to hire more people on the clinical side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Needham, Massachusetts-based Celldex said it would also
focus on the four other product candidates that are in ongoing
early to mid-stage studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has two other cancer vaccines in early and mid stage
development, an antibody therapy for breast cancer and melanoma
in mid stage trials, and a renal disease therapy in early
development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DOOMED DEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April 2008, Celldex and Pfizer Vaccines LLC had entered
into the deal for the cancer vaccine as a treatment for
patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme, a kind of brain tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer had made an upfront payment of $40 million in 2008
and had also made an equity investment of $10 million in the
biopharmaceutical firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Celldex was also eligible to receive milestone payments of
over $390 million for the successful development and
commercialization of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Celldex Chief Financial Officer Avery Catlin said there was
no termination fee defined in the license agreement and the
companies would decide on a future course of action within the
next 60 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worldwide rights to develop and market the vaccine return
to Celldex effective Nov. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Celldex shares, which have fallen 27 percent over the past
three months, dropped 39 percent to a lifetime low of $2.91
before recouping some of their early losses. They were trading
down at $3.53 late afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 5 million shares changed hands Friday, more than
14-times their 10-day average daily volume.

SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Former U.S. Astronaut Bernard Harris gave students and teachers in San Francisco
a first-hand experience with the wonders of science, technology, engineering and
mathematics when "The Dream Tour, presented by ExxonMobil" made its sixth stop
of 2010 on September 3 speaking to 950 Marina Middle School students. 

The tour is designed to encourage today`s middle school students to realize
their potential and strive to acquire strong math and science skills. The
program included an interactive and inspirational program by Dr. Harris, a
demonstration on space and engaging dialogue about achieving goals. 

"It is critical that American students are prepared with the problem-solving
skills and tools to tackle challenges they may face in the future. Providing
them with a strong foundation in math and science education is imperative, and
with The Dream Tour, I hope to inspire students to pursue studies and careers in
these fields," Dr. Harris said. 

From humble beginnings in San Antonio, Texas to making history as the first
African American to walk in space, Dr. Harris is a living example of achieving
high aspirations. His story provides a powerful backdrop to bring his message to
students in cities across America. Since 2008, Dr. Harris has encouraged almost
35,000 middle school students in more than 20 cities nationwide. This year, The
Dream Tour will visit Anchorage, Baton Rouge, Billings, Cleveland, Denver,
Nashville, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego and San Francisco as Dr. Harris
continues to motivate and inspire students to pursue math and science. 

"ExxonMobil Foundation is proud to partner with Dr. Harris in getting the
message out to thousands of young adults about the importance of careers in
science, technology, engineering and math," said Suzanne McCarron, president,
ExxonMobil Foundation. "The Dream Tour inspires students to investigate the
unlimited possibilities available to them when they choose math and science as a
means to realize their dreams."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 6  (Reuters) - ABC News President David
Westin said on Monday he was resigning after 13 years,
according to a memo he sent to employees that was released on
the network's website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "I've always admired those few who know when it's time to
move on. This is the right time for me," said Westin, who added
he would remain in his post through the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York Times quoted an ABC staff member as saying the
decision was tied partly to a long-standing conflict between
Westin and ABC management, including parent Walt Disney Co
(DIS.N), over the news division's financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The staff member was quoted as saying that managers at ABC
and Disney had pressed Westin to increase profits at the news
division and were unhappy with his efforts to reach that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A senior ABC executive quoted by the Times said financial
issues relating to news costs did not figure in Westin's
resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, ABC News revamped its operations and
said it would offer voluntary separation packages to all
full-time, U.S.-based, non-union, non-contract employees. A
source familiar with the situation said ABC News hoped to
reduce staff by 300 to 400 people, out of a total staff of
about 1,500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Competitors CBS Corp (CBS.N) and General Electric's (GE.N)
NBC have also cut their news divisions amid weak demand for
advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his statement, Westin said, "Over the last nine months,
we've put in place new anchors on all of our programs. At the
same time, we went through a very difficult transformation made
necessary by changes in our business and its economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am confident ABC News is better positioned for the
future than it has been at any time since I came here in March
of 1997."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Peter Cooney; Editing by Eric Beech)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
plans to enter a partnership this week with securities firm
Incapital LLC to sell bonds issued by U.S. states, cities and
towns to individual investors, the Wall Street Journal reported
on its Website on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The report, which cites a person familiar with the
situation, said the move will make billions of dollars of
municipal bonds underwritten by Goldman available for sale by
at least 85,000 brokers in Incapital's distribution network of
broker-dealer firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Goldman isn't known for selling financial products to
retail investors, it has pushed deeper into that area since
becoming a bank-holding company in 2008, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to calls placed
outside of regular business hours.

&lt;p&gt; * Samsung, Daewoo also picked for 57 pct govt stake sale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds government confirmation, details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Brett Cole&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEOUL, Sept 8 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) and two South
Korean brokerages will manage the sale of a stake worth an
estimated $6 billion in Woori Finance Holdings (053000.KS), the
government said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samsung Securities (016360.KS) and Daewoo Securities
(006800.KS) have been picked along with JPMorgan to manage the
sale of the 57 percent stake in South Korea's third biggest
banking group by market value, the state-owned Korea Deposit
Insurance Corp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By winning the sale mandate JPMorgan, Samsung and Daewoo
will share as much as $240 million in fees with lawyers and
accountants and the experience of managing South Korea's
biggest ever banking deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment bankers have said fees for the deal were not
expected to exceed 4 percent of the sale's total value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The most important thing is to maximise money from this
sale," Financial Services Commission chairman Chin Dong-soo
told Reuters in an interview before the investment banks were
chosen to manage the Woori sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  JPMorgan beat Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and UBS (UBSN.VX) for
the sale. South Korea picked the three foreign investment banks
and five local firms last week before selecting the final
three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chin and other South Korean officials have stressed they
are open to bids for the bank from foreign and domestic
companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there is a sense that a local bank is more likely to
acquire Woori, given that foreign banks already have a large
stake in the financial sector: Standard Chartered Plc (STAN.L)
(2888.HK) has bought Korea First Bank and Citigroup Inc. (C.N)
acquired Koram Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One potential acquirer of Woori is Hana Financial Group
(086790.KS), in which Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) has a
stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Public Fund Oversight Committee is also selling two
regional banks as part of the Woori sale in an effort to secure
a profit after injecting public funds into companies during the
late 1990s Asian financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; South Korea wants the Woori sale completed next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Woori Finance were down 1.5 percent at 0218 GMT,
versus a 0.8 percent drop in the broader market .KS11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Jonathan Hopfner and Dhara Ranasinghe)

&lt;p&gt;  COLORADO SPRINGS, CO, Sep 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Compassion International, the world's largest Christian child development
and sponsorship organization, and the Walt Disney Company have come
together to host Disney World's "Night of Joy," a two-night music
festival showcasing some of the country's top Christian artists who will
be advocating on behalf of the world's poorest children.

    The concert will take place at the forecourt stage of Cinderella Castle
at Disney World located near Orlando, Fla. Some of the artists performing
at the event are also Compassion advocates and include Mercy Me, Tenth
Avenue North and Thousand Foot Krutch.

    During the event, those in attendance will have the opportunity to change
a life by sponsoring a child through Compassion International.

    "We are very excited to include Compassion International in Disney's
Night of Joy," said Jay Zavada, Director, Global Special Events for
Disney Parks. "Walt Disney World is the place 'Where Dreams Come True'
and Compassion International supports the dreams of children around the
world." 

    Compassion works effectively through local churches to release children
from poverty in 26 of the world's poorest countries. As the world's
largest one-to-one child development and sponsorship organization serving
more than one million children worldwide, Compassion takes an
individualized, holistic approach to meet the personal needs of each
child. 

    "The opportunity for Compassion and our talented advocates to speak up
for children around the world at a place like Disney World's Magic
Kingdom is simply monumental for an organization like ours," said Mark
Hanlon, senior vice president of Compassion International, USA. "The fact
that Disney's core purpose is to engage and entertain children
complements Compassion's commitment to bring children the hope and love
they so desperately deserve."

    Compassion International is the world's largest Christian child
development organization that permanently releases children from poverty.
Founded in 1952, Compassion successfully tackles global poverty one child
at a time, serving more than 1 million children in 26 of the world's
poorest countries. Recognizing that poverty is more than a lack of money,
Compassion works holistically through local churches to address the
individual physical, economic, educational and spiritual needs of
children -- enabling them to thrive, not just survive. Charity Navigator,
America's largest charity evaluator, has awarded Compassion its highest
rating -- four stars -- for nine consecutive years, placing Compassion in
the top one percent of all charities.

&lt;p&gt;Houston`s Hometown Anchor Has Full-Time Commitment to Food Allergy Management
FAIRFAX, Va.--(Business Wire)--
FAAN (The Food Allergy &amp; Anaphylaxis Network) is pleased to announce that
Emmy-nominated news anchor Dominique Sachse has teamed up with FAAN to help
advocate for the millions of Americans with food allergies and help raise the
profile of this potentially life-threatening medical condition by becoming one
of its Ambassadors Who Care. 

Sachse, an award-winning journalist for Houston`s KPRC Local 2, has a personal
connection to food allergies - her 5-year-old son recently outgrew his a milk
allergy, which he was diagnosed with as an infant. She knows firsthand about the
lifestyle changes and the challenges of raising a child with food allergies. She
also realizes this medical condition is something that many Americans don`t
understand. 

"I find some people to be acutely aware and others to be completely in the dark
on this subject," Sachse said. "It just reminds me that the message needs to get
out there with frequency, and as a journalist, I'm thrilled to have the platform
to do that." 

This Saturday, Sept. 11, Sachse will serve as the Local Honorary Chair of the
FAAN Walk for Food Allergy in Houston, and will work with FAAN to raise
awareness and educate others. 

"Dominique has connected with millions of Texans as `Houston`s Hometown Anchor`
and we are thrilled that she has joined us in our daily fight to increase
awareness about this serious medical condition," said FAAN CEO Julia Bradsher.
"Until there is a cure, we need to continue with our efforts to protect those
with food allergies." 

As a mother of a child who grew up with a food allergy, Sachse has an intimate
familiarity with the adjustments that come with a food allergy diagnosis, such
as the meticulous reading of ingredient labels and packing a safe treat for her
son when he attends birthday parties. 

"If my story helps another mom or family in the same situation, then I've given
support to someone who might have felt they were dealing with this alone," she
said. "There's comfort in numbers." 

ABOUT FAAN

Founded in 1991, FAAN (The Food Allergy &amp; Anaphylaxis Network) is the world
leader in information, programs, and resources about food allergy, a potentially

solutions, T-VIPS now announces the market`s first mathematically lossless
JPEG2000 video gateway for the most demanding contribution applications.
Delivering pristine HD video and at the same time enabling savings of over 60%
in bandwidth, T-VIPS` enhanced TVG450 video gateway delivers exceptional
performance at optimal operating cost.
OSLO, Norway--(Business Wire)--
The main advantage of the T-VIPS video gateway`s utilization of JPEG2000
compression is the significant bandwidth savings compared to un-compressed video
transport. The highly efficient compression of the TVG product line makes
possible the backhaul of HD and 3D video over cost-effective and widely
available one gigabit ethernet connections, all without a loss of visual
quality. 

Highly attractive bandwidth savings that can be achieved when deploying JPEG2000
video compression: for instance, HD-SDI Un-compressed required 1.5 Gb/s, whereas
the same content in HD-SDI Mathematically lossless JPEG2000 mode would typically
require 600 Mb/s and just 120 - 150 Mb/s in HD-SDI Visually lossless JPEG2000
mode. 

"The arguments in favor of deploying JPEG2000 lossless video transport as an
alternative to uncompressed SDI video in the backhaul chain are now
overwhelming," says Johnny Dolvik, CEO, T-VIPS. "By providing two compression
options, visually lossless and mathematically lossless, T-VIPS can meet present
service and quality requirements for all HD contribution applications. This
provides broadcasters and content providers with the opportunity to save
bandwidth costs without sacrificing quality." 

The advantages of lossless video compression follow naturally from the wavelet
nature of JPEG2000 and are enabled through the following alternatives:

* Mathematically lossless: which uses reversible integer wavelet filtering to
ensure that the compressed data has all the information of uncompressed SDI
video and therefore provides video transport of equal quality, but with a
typical bandwidth saving of at least 60% 
* Visually lossless: which employs floating point filtering and quantisation
techniques to provide greater compression with no perceived loss of video
quality. Typically, visually lossless JPEG2000 uses from 120 - 150 Mb/s, while
the backhaul of un-compressed SDI needs a 1.5 Gb/s pipe.

"The T-VIPS video gateway`s utilisation of JPEG2000 mathematically lossless
compression, means that for the very first time, video with the quality of
un-compressed SDI can be transported over a gigabit Ethernet link, which has
enormous advantages both in terms of both cost and flexibility," says Dr. Helge
Stephansen, CTO, T-VIPS. "T-VIPS has been a pioneer in JPEG2000 for broadcast
and we are pleased to notch up another first through adding mathematically
lossless HD compression to the functionality of our video transport solutions."

Chevron has acquired a 100 percent interest in blocks 53-30 and 64-18, and a
59.18 percent interest in block 42-05, from Devon subsidiary Devon Energy China,
Ltd. The blocks cover an exploratory acreage of approximately 8,100 square miles
(21,000 square km). Chevron will be operator during the exploration phase under
the amendment agreements to the production sharing contract with China National
Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). 

"Participating in the exploration of this prospective deepwater basin furthers
our strategy to grow our business in China and the Asia Pacific region," said
Chevron Vice Chairman George Kirkland. 

Jim Blackwell, president, Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production, said,
"We welcome the opportunity to partner with CNOOC and apply our industry-leading
drilling technology, expertise, and safety practices to explore the South China
Sea`s deepwater areas." 

BP will acquire the remaining interest in block 42-05. 

Chevron has a presence in China that dates back nearly 100 years. The company is
a partner with CNOOC in producing assets in the Bohai Bay and in the South China
Sea. Chevron is also a partner with China National Petroleum Corporation in an
onshore gas development in the Sichuan Province.

&lt;p&gt;Former Head of Discovery Translational Medicine at Wyeth Research and Pfizer
Joins Intellect Neurosciences, Inc. as Key Consultant

Intellect Neurosciences, Inc. (OTCBB:ILNS) a biopharmaceutical company with an
internal preclinical and clinical-stage pipeline and licenses with major
pharmaceutical companies covering products in late-stage clinical trials,
announced that it has engaged Dr. Giora Feuerstein as a key consultant to advise
the Company regarding its technology programs and pipeline. Until earlier this
year, Dr. Feuerstein was Assistant Vice President &amp; Head, Discovery
Translational Medicine at Pfizer, having previously held these positions at
Wyeth Research. Dr. Feuerstein resigned his position at Pfizer to focus on
applying his expertise to assist smaller biopharmaceutical companies in meeting
their drug development objectives via effective translational medicine
strategies.

Dr. Daniel Chain, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Intellect, commented:
"We are privileged and absolutely delighted that Dr. Feuerstein has taken an
active interest in Intellect Neurosciences. Dr. Feuerstein's breadth and scope
of experience in guiding biopharmaceutical research and translational medicine
is simply unparalleled in the industry. Dr. Feuerstein is widely credited in
relation to the extraordinary cardiovascular and neuroscience pipeline at Wyeth
that drove the acquisition by Pfizer last year. His agreement to provide
consulting services to Intellect brings a phenomenal set of skills to help the
Company in its endeavors to develop innovative and safe disease-modifying drugs
for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other serious conditions."

Dr. Feuerstein commented: "I am pleased to be able to contribute my knowledge
and expertise to help Intellect Neurosciences, which has an exciting pipeline
and abundance of innovative ideas to develop new biopharmaceutical products. Dr.
Chain impressed me by his critical, objective and balanced scientific
assessments that I personally appreciate and like. I am confident that, under
this type of leadership, the Company will meet its important objectives focused
on the development of innovative drugs that will provide meaningful medical
benefits via disease-modifying mechanisms along with maximum safety."

About Alzheimer's Disease

Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is characterized by
progressive loss of memory and cognition, ultimately leading to complete
debilitation and death. A hallmark feature of Alzheimer's pathology is the
presence of insoluble protein deposits, known as amyloid beta, on the surface of
nerve cells, which results from the accumulation of soluble neurotoxic amyloid
beta in the brain. The effects of the disease are devastating to patients as
well as their caregivers, with significant associated health care costs. It is
estimated that there are more than five million Americans and about 30 million
people worldwide suffering from Alzheimer's disease, with the number expected to
increase dramatically as the global population ages. Currently-marketed drugs
transiently affect some symptoms of the disease, but there are no drugs on the
market today that slow or arrest the progression of the disease. These
symptomatic drugs are projected to generate more than US $6 billion in sales
this year, indicating both the size of the market and the demand for effective
treatment beyond symptomatic improvements.

About Intellect Neurosciences, Inc.

Intellect Neurosciences, Inc. is a Manhattan-based biopharmaceutical company
engaged in the discovery and development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents
for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease and other disorders. The
Company's drug product pipeline includes OX1, which has been tested in Phase 1
clinical trials; IN-N01, a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to promote the
clearance of soluble amyloid beta; and RECALL-VAX, a vaccine technology that has
the potential to delay or prevent Alzheimer's disease in people who are at risk.

The Company has significant intellectual property assets, which include several
patent families underlying the Company's internal programs, and a pivotal patent
estate regarding passive AD immunotherapy.

The Company's ANTISENILIN(R) patent estate claims monoclonal antibodies that
bind either end of amyloid beta but do not interact with the amyloid precursor
protein from which amyloid beta is produced in the body. This high degree of
specificity is an important safety feature reducing the potential for adverse
affects.  Examples of monoclonal antibodies exhibiting this property are
Bapineuzumab and Ponezumab in Alzheimer's Phase 3 and Phase 2 clinical trials,
respectively
(http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00574132?term=bapineuzumab=1;
http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=PF-04360365).

Patents have been granted in Europe, Japan, China and elsewhere, and are pending
in the United States. Intellect has granted royalty-bearing licenses to its
ANTISENILIN(R) patent estate to several top tier global pharmaceutical companies
developing monoclonal antibodies for Alzheimer's disease. For further

Commission, including Forms 8-K filed on:

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE: CCE) today announced long-term financial objectives
for new CCE and said it expects the pending transaction with The Coca-Cola
Company to close in the fourth quarter. 

In addition, the company increased its full-year 2010 earnings per share
guidance for the existing company to a range of $1.78 to $1.82 including a
negative currency impact of approximately 7 cents at current levels. 

This information is provided in advance of an analyst presentation at the
Barclays Back-To-School Consumer Conference in Boston. The public can access the
presentation by Mr. Brock live via the company`s website, www.cokecce.com, on
Wednesday, September 8 at 12:45 p.m. EDT. 

NEW CCE GROWTH OBJECTIVES

On a long-term basis, new CCE`s objectives are to achieve these comparable and
currency neutral growth rates:

* Revenue growth of 4 percent to 6 percent; 
* Operating income growth of 6 percent to 8 percent; 
* Earnings per share growth in a high single-digit range; 
* Return on invested capital improvement of 20 basis points or more per year.

"These metrics reflect the solid growth opportunity that lies ahead in Europe,"
said John F. Brock, chairman and chief executive officer. "They exceed our
current long-term objectives. We are committed to these financial objectives,
and in turn, to creating real value for our shareowners, our customers, and our
employees." 

For 2011, earnings per share will likely exceed long-term objectives as a result
of share repurchase activity. 

TRANSACTION UPDATE

The company said that the pending transaction with The Coca-Cola Company is on
track to close in the fourth quarter. Key remaining steps include antitrust
approval in the U.S. and Canada and shareowner approval. A special shareowner
meeting has been scheduled for October 1 to consider the transaction. 

New CCE now expects to have approximately $2 billion in net debt, $2.4 billion
in gross debt, and $400 million in cash at close. Initially, new CCE expects
approximately 350 million fully diluted shares outstanding and an initial tax
rate of 28 to 30 percent in 2011. 

After completing the transaction, new CCE expects to repurchase approximately $1
billion of its shares within the following 18 months, and to pay an expected
annual dividend of $0.50 per share, all subject to the approval of new CCE's
Board of Directors. These plans may be adjusted depending on economic,
operating, or other factors. 

FULL-YEAR 2010 CURRENT CCE GUIDANCE INCREASED

The company said full-year 2010 earnings per share for the current structure of
CCE will now reach a range of $1.78 to $1.82, on a comparable basis. This
guidance includes an expected negative currency impact of approximately 7 cents
based on current rates. On a comparable and currency neutral basis, the company
now expects Europe to achieve high single-digit to low double-digit operating
income growth, while operating income in North America is expected to grow at a
mid to high single-digit rate. Also, on a comparable and currency neutral basis,
the company now expects Europe to achieve mid single-digit revenue growth, while
in North America revenue is expected to be approximately flat.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - ABC News President David Westin said on Monday he was resigning after 13 years, according to a memo he sent to employees that was released on the network's website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I've always admired those few who know when it's time to move on. This is the right time for me," said Westin, who added he would remain in his post through the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times quoted an ABC staff member as saying the decision was tied partly to a long-standing conflict between Westin and ABC management, including parent Walt Disney Co, over the news division's financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The staff member was quoted as saying that managers at ABC and Disney had pressed Westin to increase profits at the news division and were unhappy with his efforts to reach that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior ABC executive quoted by the Times said financial issues relating to news costs did not figure in Westin's resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, ABC News revamped its operations and said it would offer voluntary separation packages to all full-time, U.S.-based, non-union, non-contract employees. A source familiar with the situation said ABC News hoped to reduce staff by 300 to 400 people, out of a total staff of about 1,500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitors CBS Corp and General Electric's NBC have also cut their news divisions amid weak demand for advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his statement, Westin said, "Over the last nine months, we've put in place new anchors on all of our programs. At the same time, we went through a very difficult transformation made necessary by changes in our business and its economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am confident ABC News is better positioned for the future than it has been at any time since I came here in March of 1997."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Peter Cooney; Editing by Eric Beech)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  MANCHESTER, UNITED KINGDOM, Sep 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Mickey Mouse and friends are inviting families to say 'BOO!' to the
bogeyman this autumn on Disney World Florida holidays with Florida4Less. 

    Halloween is that time of year when adults and children bring out the
broomsticks and throw those old sheets over their heads for a night of
ghoulish fun and games. Walt Disney World Florida is going a few steps
further in 2010, with a series of thrilling parties to get families with
children of all ages into the Halloween spirit. 

    Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party is kicking off on 24 spook-filled
evenings, from 7pm to 12am, between 14th September and 1st November. The
events promise to be a family-friendly way to enjoy Halloween,
transforming the Magic Kingdom into a warren of happy haunted hollows. 

    Visitors enjoying Disney World Florida holidays are encouraged to dress
up in their very best wicked witch, diabolical devil, or strange, spooky
costume and join in the fun, which includes the chance to go
trick-or-treating around Disney World's most famous locations on the hunt
for sweets and goodies. 

    As anyone who has been on a Disney World holiday knows, the Haunted
Mansion is one of the resort's biggest and best attractions, and will be
at the heart of the Halloween goings-on. The stars and spooks of the
Haunted Mansion will be rising from the grave to haunt the rest of the
Magic Kingdom and bring the fun of Halloween to all the family's
favourite Disney characters. 

    There will be spooky storytelling and on-the-spot Halloween shows across
the Magic Kingdom, plus face-painting, gypsy fortune-telling and fun
'Mouse-Ka-Rade' parties for children to show off their costumes. 

    This being a Disney World holiday, the Magic Kingdom is pulling out all
the stops, with atmospheric lighting, sound and special effects to
complement the Halloween feel. Families can also enjoy all the usual
Magic Kingdom attractions, as well as enjoy complimentary photos to mark
the occasion. At the same time, the events are suitable for children of
all ages, so - as the name suggests - Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween
Party is all in good fun. 

    The centrepiece of the celebration is Mickey's 'Boo-to-You' parade, which
proceeds down Main Street at 8:15pm and 10:30pm, led by the ghostly
Headless Horseman. At 9:30pm, 'Happy HalloWishes' fires up a
pyrotechnical spectacle: an unforgettable fireworks display in which the
world's favourite Disney villains wreak havoc on a trick-or-treating trip
across the sky. 

    As a special event, Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party requires a
separate ticket, beyond standard Magic Kingdom admission. These should be
booked well in advance of venturing on a Disney World Florida holiday, as
many nights may be sold-out a few weeks before the event. 

    More information is available at http://www.disneyworld.com/halloween, or

    In any case, it's likely that the only things going 'bump' in the night
will be children too excited to sleep, looking forward to a not-so-scary
Halloween on a Disney World Florida holiday.

&lt;p&gt;HSINCHU, Taiwan--(Business Wire)--
SpringSoft, Inc. (TAIEX: 2473), a global supplier of specialized IC design
software, today announced that the development teams behind the key processors
in Microsoft Corp.`s Xbox product line have used its Verdi Automated Debug
System to significantly reduce design time and manage new levels of complexity
in the latest generation of chips. The powerful debug platform enabled the
Microsoft team to quickly comprehend intended design behavior, find design
errors and manage design revisions, eliminating what had once been tedious and
time-consuming manual steps and reducing debug time by as much as half in
certain areas over previous projects. 

The Xbox team used the Verdi system on the latest versions of its graphics (GPU)
and microprocessor (CPU) chip designs, which presented unprecedented
verification challenges due to the size and complexity of the ICs being
developed. The verification engineers responsible for validating functional
correctness of the design relied on the Verdi tool to automate important
error-finding tasks and efficiently compare design revisions. 

"The Verdi tool probably cut our debug time in half on the complex portions of
our most recent designs. Its automated features to trace through and compare
designs were invaluable, in one case eliminating an entire ECO loop for us,"
said Nguyen Le, a senior verification engineer in the XBOX Group at Microsoft.
"The process of tracking down problems such as event ordering issues used to be
open-ended, but with Verdi we are able to quickly pinpoint errors and correct
them." 

The Microsoft Xbox team especially benefited from the Verdi system`s automated
design tracing and compare features. The SpringSoft tool provides automatic
tracing of signal activityto quickly trace activity across many clock cycles
with powerful behavior analysis technology. The Verdi system allowed the team to
trace designs hierarchically through the RTL description. Even when working with
unfamiliar design elements developed by other parts of the team, the
verification engineers could quickly comprehend complex relationships and
interactions within the design code and find sources of errors. 

"The designs Microsoft is working on for its Xbox product line are some of the
most demanding and complex in the IC design industry, so we are pleased to see
the results they have achieved using our automated debug solutions. The
multitude of challenges in locating, isolating and correcting design errors are
precisely the issues Verdi was developed to address. The time savings Microsoft
is realizing as a result are incredibly valuable in the fast-paced consumer
markets they serve," said Thomas Li, director of product marketing for Verdi at
SpringSoft.

&lt;p&gt;http://www.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Research Equity Strategist, Dirk Van Dijk says that S 500 earnings are
continuing to show red ink. He tracks companies on the Zacks.com web site,
naming names, while forecasting trends for the months ahead. 

Very Few Changes

The S 500 is selling for 18.9x 2009 earnings, but just 13.4x 2010 and 11.6x
2011 earnings. By historical standards, that is quite cheap. Normally, when
interest rates and inflation are low, P/E ratios are higher than average. Well
we currently have some of the lowest rates of inflation in decades, and interest
rates are at near record lows. 

It only costs the government 2.46% to borrow for 10 years. (These numbers are
based on Thursday 9/2; stocks moved higher on 9/2 as did t-note yields.) It is
not hard to find good, solid blue-chip companies that are providing dividend
yields of more than that, and not just a bunch of electric utilities either. 

One thing is certain, the coupon on a 10 year t-note will not increase over the
next 10 years. The odds of the likes of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) 3.70%,
Chevron (NYSE: CVX) 3.70% or DuPont (NYSE: DD) 3.90% increasing their dividend
in the next 10 years is pretty high. Currently 132 S 500 stocks yield over
2.48%, and 84 of those have payout ratios of less than 60%. Earnings that are
not paid out in dividends are reinvested for future growth, or are used to buy
back stock, which also lifts earnings per share. Based on this year`s earnings,
the earnings yield is 7.46%, and based on next year it is 8.62%. 

Wall of Worry Remains

There is still substantial uncertainty about the strength of the economy. The
inventory rebuild cycle is just about over, and the effects of the stimulus are
wearing off. State and local governments are facing massive budget shortfalls,
and will be forced to lay off many municipal workers like teachers and police.
This has kept investor sentiment very muted, but provides a big wall of worry
for the market to climb. 

The time to buy is when others are despondently selling, and the time to sell is
when others are greedily buying. This is particularly true when the actual
fundamentals are solid and when the market is simply depressed. There is nothing
more fundamental than earnings (OK, perhaps the balance sheets, but those look
better than they have in decades as well, with about $1.8 trillion in cash
sitting on them) and earnings look pretty good, or at least the expectations for
them do.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights: Ryder System (NYSE: R) as the Bull of the Day
and McDermott International (NYSE: MDR) as the Bear of the Day. In addition,
Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM),
Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE: WFC) and Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We are upgrading our rating to Outperform on Ryder System (NYSE: R) following
its second-quarter earnings. Second-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks
Consensus Estimate on stronger automotive volume, improved commercial rental
demand and strong used vehicle sales. 

Ryder is planning for a better relative freight pricing market and more freight
opportunities in 2010. With an improvement in market conditions, the company has
ample balance sheet strength to support its capital spending. Ryder is
aggressively evaluating its pipeline of acquisition candidates along with fleet
expansion and spending on equipment. 

Further, the company remains committed to its shareholders via dividends and
share repurchase. However, Ryder faces a prolonged freight recession on its
lease business, which may impact near-term earnings. 

Bear of the Day: 

We are downgrading McDermott International (NYSE: MDR) shares to Underperform
from Neutral due to the tentative commodity price scenario and the company's
clouded post-split outlook. 

Near-term bookings remain lumpy at McDermott, as the current uncertain
environment has adversely affected the economics of building new oil and gas
infrastructure. Additionally, the transfer of the power generation and
government operations has left McDermott with a less diversified business,
thereby heightening its risk profile. 

Partially offsetting these negatives are the company's solid margins, clean
execution skills and expectations of accelerated activity levels later this
year. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Next Stop, Infrastructure?

In an effort to rev up the sluggish economic recovery, President Obama has
proposed $50 billion in spending to improve the nation`s roads, airports and
railways. The President`s speech at a Labor Day event yesterday in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin called it a long-term investment intended to create jobs. Could this
really spur the economy, or is it being irresponsible for the federal government
to further extend deficit spending in this way? 

Though government efforts so far have succeeded in stabilizing the economy to a
great extent, economists and policymakers are seeking alternatives to boost the
pace of recovery. 

Infrastructure Investment

A major infrastructure investment could be one of the solutions. The latest
infrastructure spending proposal of the President indicates that the government
is also thinking on these lines. Also, the stimulus passed last year contained
more than $100 billion in funding for infrastructural projects. According to the
administration, this has helped create about 3 million jobs during the latest
recession. However, there is a huge scope for further investments. 

Objectives of the Latest Plan

The plan calls for investments over six years starting 2010. The fund will be
partially used through an infrastructure bank to invest in transportation
projects critical to the economy while also enhancing job growth. The current
goals include rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, constructing and maintaining
4,000 miles of railways -- enough to go coast-to-coast -- and rehabilitating or
reconstructing 150 miles of airport runways while also installing a new air
navigation system designed to reduce travel times and delays. 

Though the total planned cost of the infrastructure investments was not
disclosed, the government officials said that the initial $50 billion investment
represents a significant percentage of the total. 

A Pre-Poll Agenda?

As expected, the Republicans have promptly opposed Obama`s proposal, saying that
an infrastructure investment would do nothing but increase the already excessive
federal spending. Many congressional Democrats are also against raising
expenditures and increasing federal deficits just before the elections.
Infrastructure programs, they allege, always make for good press, but are often
disappointing in practice. 

Though the latest employment report showed that private jobs surpassed the
forecast to reach 67,000 in August, overall employment fell by 54,000 and the
unemployment rate rose to 9.6% mostly due to layoffs of more than 500,000
temporary U.S. Census workers. This adds to the growing concerns for Democrats
just before the November's mid-term elections. 

Small-Business Lending

Tax cuts for small businesses or of payroll taxes is one of the popular
proposals currently. Democrats in Congress have been pushing hard a small
business stimulus bill to boost lending to smaller scale operations to create
more jobs. Of course, lending to small businesses primarily to create jobs may
not the first-line problem with the economy. If businesses have fewer customers
as a result of lower consumer spending and shrunken demand, they won`t take out
loans to expand in the first place. 

Several large financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:
JPM), Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE: WFC) and Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC)
have continued to contribute to the economic recovery by lending to small
businesses. 

Conclusion

As infrastructure spending is relatively capital-intensive, it doesn't
necessarily maximize new job creation per dollar spent. In economic terms, an
equivalent employment subsidy would probably create more jobs than would
infrastructure spending. Moreover, considering the proportion of the economic
dent, the $50 billion investment sounds like little more than loose change. 

However, the biggest economic advantage of spending on infrastructure is that
there are bound to be positive returns irrespective of the economic condition. 

Though we support the idea of government spending on infrastructure, we are
concerned about how quickly -- and how far -- the infrastructure spending would
make a difference.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Goldman to End Proprietary Trading

Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. (NYSE: GS) has decided to close down its principal
strategies desk, a unit that is in proprietary trading, according to a report by
Bloomberg News. The decision to spin off the proprietary trading businesses
followed the regulatory reform bill that became law in July 2010. 

The Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, which was signed into law by President
Obama in July, has a number of provisions that would affect the business model
of the financial institutions significantly. A provision in the law -- the
"Volcker Rule," named after Paul A. Volcker, former Federal Reserve chairman --
restricts banks from utilizing their own capital to speculate in order to
prevent huge risky bets. 

According to the regulatory reform, banks will be restrained from proprietary
trading and investing more than 3% of their capital in private equity or hedge
fund investments in the long term. Proprietary trading has been a pivotal source
of investment bank profits and the step is an attempt to curb speculation by
banks, which has been cited as one of the main reasons behind the recent
financial crisis. 

Around 65 to 70 members of the Goldman Sachs' unit are exploring new job
opportunities. While some may be given new roles within the organization, a team
in Asia may commence a new hedge fund business. 

Apart from Goldman Sachs, many other U.S. banks including Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:
C), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM)
and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) are trying to reduce their investments in hedge
funds and private equity. Though the regulation will take several years before
its provisions and impacts become clearer, these banks are considering a number
of options to comply with it. 

The act is not welcome news for Goldman Sachs, which derives a significant
amount of its revenues from its proprietary trading activities. Therefore, any
measure to curb proprietary trading activities would severely impact the
company`s top-line results. 

However, Goldman maintains a well managed global franchise with a strong capital
base and a leading position in investment banking, capital markets, trading and
asset management business. We also believe that with the recovery of the U.S.
economy, the company should experience improvements in credit spreads. 

Goldman Sachs currently carries a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold), implying no clear
directional pressure on the stocks over the next one to three months.

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects name of firm in headline to Bessemer, not Bessmer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Bessemer Trust, adviser to
ultra-wealthy families, on Wednesday said it lured away Goldman
Sachs private wealth manager Michael Okun to lead its expansion
efforts along Florida's ritzy Gulf Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Okun is a 25-year veteran who for the past five years was
an adviser to multimillionaires in Goldman's Palm Beach office,
who previously worked for Bessemer in Palm Beach and began his
career with Merrill Lynch in Chicago. Okun, moving to Naples,
Florida, will be responsible for account management and
business development in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hire comes a day after New York-based Bessemer said it
added Christopher Poch as a managing director to head its
Washington, D.C., office. He will oversee account managers and
business development in Maryland, Virginia and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poch was founder and chief executive of Purpose Advisors
LLC and previously CEO of the Private Trust Co, a $60 billion
trust company affiliated with Boston-based LPL Financial
[LPLFS.UL].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier, Poch founded and was global head of Smith Barney
Private Wealth Management, then a unit of Citigroup (C.N) .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bessemer is the one of the largest U.S. wealth managers and
a top adviser to utra-rich families, overseeing $55.4 billion
in client assets. The average client has more than $26
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Joseph A. Giannone; Editing by Bernard Orr)

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney has taken the unusual step of bringing in a consultant to handle the marketing of its fourth "Pirates of the Caribbean" film, a move bound to raise questions about the marketing boss hired by the studio five months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valerie Van Galder, who formerly headed marketing at Sony Pictures and Fox Searchlight, will oversee the campaign for "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," due in theaters next May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the film's importance, the move is likely to be perceived in the industry -- fairly or not -- as a sign that Disney lacks full confidence in Hollywood newcomer M.T. Carney, a brand strategist who came aboard as head of worldwide marketing in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has had a tough summer with live-action films, with two of its disappointments -- "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" and "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" -- produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She came to the party late," Bruckheimer told The Hollywood Reporter, referring to Carney. "I had two movies that got caught between two regimes, and the movies suffered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked for comment, Disney issued a statement from Carney: "Val was one of the first people I met when I arrived, and in subsequent conversations, I've been impressed with her business savvy and diverse background. I'm thrilled she accepted my invitation to lend her talents on this important franchise. I'm committed to working with her and other innovative professionals as we continue to build out our world-class marketing organization."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studio declined further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Galder ended a 10-year stint at Sony Pictures in 2009, after working on such hit films as "Superbad" and "Spider-Man 3." Before that, she ran marketing at art-house studio Fox Searchlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transaction Includes Fuel Supply Rights at 31 Additional Mobil Locations;

Partnership`s Acquisition of 42 ExxonMobil Company-Operated Stations Expected to
Close by End of Third Quarter
WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Global Partners LP (NYSE: GLP), one of the largest wholesale distributors of
gasoline, distillates and residual oil in the New England states and New York,
today announced the closing of the initial phase of its purchase of
Mobil-branded retail gas stations and supply rights in Massachusetts, New
Hampshire and Rhode Island. 

The Partnership has today completed the purchase from Exxon Mobil Corporation of
148 dealer-operated Mobil stations included in the transaction, as well as
gasoline and diesel supply rights for an additional 31 Mobil stations owned and
operated by independent Mobil dealers in the same states. By the end of
September, Global Partners expects to close on its purchase of the remaining
assets in the agreement - 42 Mobil-branded stations directly operated by
ExxonMobil. 

All of the stations will continue to operate under the Mobil brand as part of a
long-term branding agreement between ExxonMobil and Global Partners. 

"The acquisition of these strategic assets contributes significant new
year-round income for Global Partners," said Eric Slifka, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Global Partners. "We believe that the combination of our
wholesale supply expertise, outstanding terminal portfolio and unique system
capabilities will enable us to generate strong returns from this transaction,
which adds vertical integration to our transportation fuel supply business." 

Of the 221 stations covered under the transaction, 179 are located in
Massachusetts, 22 in Rhode Island and 20 in New Hampshire. The stations sold
approximately 370 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel in 2009. 

"ExxonMobil has built the premier brand and a superb dealer network in these
states, and we look forward to continuing the long tradition of providing
high-quality Mobil transportation fuels in these markets," Slifka said. 

Global Partners is financing the acquisition with borrowings under its new
four-year, $1.15 billion senior secured credit facility.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is facing a
massive fine from the UK's City watchdog following an
investigation into the U.S. investment bank's international
business, the Financial Times said on its website on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A formal announcement by the Financial Services Authority
(FSA) could be made as early as Thursday morning, the newspaper
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FSA launched an investigation into the bank in April
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged
Goldman misleading investors in a mortgage-backed security
known as Abacus, according to the FT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citing people familiar with the FSA's fine, the FT said it
is not based  on the Abacus transaction, but is the result of
its investigation into the bank's business practices in London
sparked by the SEC allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FSA was not immediately reachable for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Karolina Tagaris; editing by Bernard Orr)

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) hired Philip
Shelley, co-head of corporate broking at UBS (UBSN.VX), to
bolster its team advising UK blue-chips on relations with big
investors, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; UBS is the second-biggest corporate broker by market value
of the clients it serves, according to Hemscott, behind
JPMorgan's (JPM.N) JPMorgan Cazenove arm. Its FTSE 100 .FTSE
clients include Anglo American Plc, BP Plc, GlaxoSmithKline Plc
and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman ranks fourth, behind Morgan Stanley (MS.N), and
counts AstraZeneca Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc among its biggest
broking clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Corporate broking roles are hotly contested because they
bring prestige and can serve as a gateway for more lucrative
mandates such as advising on share sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shelley, who was co-head with John Woolland, will join
Goldman as a managing director (MD), working with existing
broking MDs Phil Raper and Jim Wight, one of the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS retains a seven-MD broking team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier on Wednesday Glaxo named Goldman's head of European
mergers and acquisitions, Simon Dingemans, as its next chief
financial officer. [ID:nLDE6871KJ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and UBS declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Quentin Webb; Editing by Erica Billingham)

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) insisted there would be no change to its cautious stance on deal-making after hiring one of Europe's top MA bankers as its finance chief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS.N) investment banker Simon Dingemans, 47, will succeed Chief Financial Officer Julian Heslop, 57, when he retires next March, GlaxoSmithKline said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Andrew Witty said the appointment reflected a need for Glaxo to operate with both creativity and continued financial discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Simon will bring valuable experience and capability to support us in our strategy to grow and diversify GSK's business through organic means and bolt-on acquisitions," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witty wants to diversify Britain's biggest drugmaker by expanding further into areas such as consumer healthcare and emerging markets in a bid to reduce reliance on sales of conventional prescription medicines in Western markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy requires smart acquisitions but Witty has said consistently he does not see a role for mega-mergers, and the company emphasized this was unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The strategy remains exactly the same," said spokeswoman Alex Harrison. "We're not interested in the old-style MA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that Chief Strategy Officer David Redfern, rather than the group's CFO, had primary responsibility for mergers and acquisitions (MA), with a direct reporting line to Witty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CREATIVE APPROACH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dominic Valder, an analyst at Evolution Securities, said Dingemans' appointment could lead to more unconventional deal-making by the London-based group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Appointing a MA banker will not change Glaxo's opposition to mega-mergers, however it could herald a more creative approach to other financial structures, like partnerships, spin-offs or financing methods," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glaxo shares ended up 0.5 percent, broadly in line with a 0.8 percent advance in the European drugs sector .SXDP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dingemans is the second senior executive to move from Goldman to head the finance department of a major European drugmaker recently, following the appointment of Jon Symonds as CFO at Novartis (NOVN.VX) from February 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dingemans has more than 25 years experience in investment banking and most recently led Goldman Sachs' European MA business, where he has worked with Glaxo for many years. He helped establish its ViiV Healthcare joint venture in HIV medicine with Pfizer (PFE.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokeswoman said the bank had no immediate plans to name a direct replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dingemans, who said he had been keen to join a global company as CFO for some time, was one of three key partner managing directors at Goldman in London advising companies on corporate finance and mergers. The others are Karen Cook, who serves as a non-executive director at Tesco (TSCO.L), and natural-resources specialist Julian Metherell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His other big healthcare deals include advising Alliance Boots AB.UL, Britain's biggest pharmacy chain, on its 2007 takeover by KKR (KKR.N). The deal, worth 12.4 billion pounds ($19 billion) including debt, was Europe's largest leveraged buyout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman ranks top for global announced MA this year, with $384 billion of deals, and fifth for deals targeting European companies, with $51.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Victoria Howley and Quentin Webb; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and David Holmes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.6469 Pound)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds CFO not directly responsible for MA, Dingemans comment,
closing shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ben Hirschler and Paul Sandle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc
(GSK.L) insisted there would be no change to its cautious stance
on deal-making after hiring one of Europe's top MA bankers as
its finance chief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs (GS.N) investment banker Simon Dingemans, 47,
will succeed Chief Financial Officer Julian Heslop, 57, when he
retires next March, GlaxoSmithKline said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Andrew Witty said the appointment reflected
a need for Glaxo to operate with both creativity and continued
financial discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Simon will bring valuable experience and capability to
support us in our strategy to grow and diversify GSK's business
through organic means and bolt-on acquisitions," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Witty wants to diversify Britain's biggest drugmaker by
expanding further into areas such as consumer healthcare and
emerging markets in a bid to reduce reliance on sales of
conventional prescription medicines in Western markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strategy requires smart acquisitions but Witty has said
consistently he does not see a role for mega-mergers, and the
company emphasised this was unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The strategy remains exactly the same," said spokeswoman
Alex Harrison. "We're not interested in the old-style MA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She added that Chief Strategy Officer David Redfern, rather
than the group's CFO, had primary responsibility for mergers and
acquisitions (MA), with a direct reporting line to Witty.

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CREATIVE APPROACH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dominic Valder, an analyst at Evolution Securities, said
Dingemans' appointment could lead to more unconventional
deal-making by the London-based group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Appointing a MA banker will not change Glaxo's opposition
to mega-mergers, however it could herald a more creative
approach to other financial structures, like partnerships,
spin-offs or financing methods," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glaxo shares ended up 0.5 percent, broadly in line with a
0.8 percent advance in the European drugs sector .SXDP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dingemans is the second senior executive to move from
Goldman to head the finance department of a major European
drugmaker recently, following the appointment of Jon Symonds as
CFO at Novartis (NOVN.VX) from February 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dingemans has more than 25 years experience in investment
banking and most recently led Goldman Sachs' European MA
business, where he has worked with Glaxo for many years. He
helped establish its ViiV Healthcare joint venture in HIV
medicine with Pfizer (PFE.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokeswoman said the bank had no immediate plans
to name a direct replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dingemans, who said he had been keen to join a global
company as CFO for some time, was one of three key partner
managing directors at Goldman in London advising companies on

that PowerBroker has met or exceeded the requirements set by IBM.

&lt;p&gt;Global Corporate Initiative Results in Dramatic, Sustained Project Management
Success Worldwide
GLEN MILLS, Pa. &amp; ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
PM Solutions and the Project Management Institute`s Program Management Office
Specific Interest Group (PMOSIG)announce that IBM`s Project Management Center of
Excellence (PM/COE) has been selected as the 2010 PMO of the Year. The award,
which distinguishes a project management office (PMO) for its success in
developing and maturing an organizational structure that supports the effective
management of projects, recognizes IBM`s PM/COE specifically for creating global
project management standards and enterprise-wide consistency among its 26,000
project managers worldwide; establishing a dedicated project management
knowledge repository and communications network; increasing project
accountability; improving time-to-market by 65%; and decreasing the number of
troubled projects by 25%.

Now that`s worth an award.

IBM`s Center of Excellence was selected from a field of more than 40 applicants
from nearly every continent and including state and federal agencies, major
nonprofit organizations and Fortune 1000 companies. The finalists include:

* Finalist #1 The Doe Run Company`s Enterprise Program Management Office (St.
Louis, Missouri)
* Finalist #2 Auckland City Council`s Program Office (Auckland, New Zealand)
* Finalist #3 T-Mobile USA`s Enterprise Program Office (Bellevue, Washington)

"All of this year`s award applicants are excellent examples of the incredible
impact a mature PMO can make on an organization and of how far the PMO has come
over the last decade," said J. Kent Crawford, PMP, CEO of PM Solutions. "The
vast measures that IBM has taken in this area and its outstanding
accomplishments reveal a telling story on how to create a successful PMO that
sets the course for the entire enterprise."

Inside IBM`s Program Management Center of Excellence (COE)
During the early 1990s, industry dynamics such as global competition, resource
pressures, rapid change in customer segments, and new technology drove IBM to
rethink its organizational structure, business model, and management approach.
IBM identified project management as key to reliably delivering complex business
solutions to its global customers. Studies supported that the lack of good
project management was a major contributor to project failure, customer
satisfaction issues, and the erosion of revenue and profit. So the company
initiated a corporate strategy to transform IBM into a project-based enterprise
by raising project management to a core competency. An Executive Steering
Committee (ESC) of senior executives from all major business units was
established and remains in place today.

IBM`s ESC chartered the Project Management Center of Excellence (PM/COE), a
formal global PMO, as the change agent for this transformation. Its mission is
to develop and implement a corporate strategy to achieve global organizational
competence in project management. Then and now, IBM`s PMO establishes and drives
a consistent career infrastructure, a common methodology based on industry
standards and the PMBOK Guide, a community of knowledgeable practitioners, and
supportive enablers including processes and systems. It also develops and
maintains a professional project management community within IBM and is the
interface between this community and other internal and external professional
communities.

"Being honored with this award is a coming of age for our team," said Deborah
Dell, PMP, IBM`s PM/COE Manager. "We`ve been working toward this level of
maturity for years and will continue to do so simply because it is a business
model that works. It keeps our enterprise operating efficiently, productively,
intelligently...and profitably."

According to one judge, "IBM set the stage for other organizations to follow
with the creation of its Center for Excellence back in 1996. IBM has continued
with its maturity initiatives, career progression, emphasis on portfolio
management, its return on investment in knowledge management, and its continuous
emphasis on business benefits."

PM Solutions and the PMOSIG will jointly present the award to IBM at the
PMOSIG`s PMO Symposium (http://www.pmosymposium.org/), being held November 7-10,
2010 in Dallas, Texas.

"IBM has unquestionably demonstrated the ability to integrate project and
program management into the infrastructure, organization, and processes used to
execute its business," said Rommy Musch, Executive Chair of the PMOSIG. "All
PMOs, including the ones represented by our 4,000+ members around the world, can
benefit from hearing how IBM`s PM/COE was able to accomplish such significant
business impact."

&lt;p&gt;Organizations partner to advance water footprint methodology and
analyze the impacts of water use as part of their commitment to
global water stewardship
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company and The Nature Conservancy announced today the release of
a water footprint report in conjunction with World Water Week in Stockholm,
Sweden. The report, entitled "Product Water Footprint Assessments: Practical
Application in Corporate Water Stewardship," examines three pilot studies that
were conducted on Coca-Cola products and ingredients. 

A product water footprint is the total volume of freshwater consumed, directly
and indirectly, to produce a product. A full water footprint assessment
considers the impacts of this water consumption on local watersheds, as well as
appropriate response strategies to minimize those impacts. 

Water footprint assessments can be helpful in supporting corporate water
stewardship efforts by providing a tool to measure and understand water use
throughout the supply chain. They provide valuable insight into the largest
components and locations of water consumption, the potential effects on local
watersheds, and future water availability to serve the collective needs of
communities, nature, producers, suppliers and companies. 

Through their research and analysis, the Company and the Conservancy have gained
important knowledge about the water footprint process and how the findings can
inform and improve the Company`s water stewardship strategies. 

Research found that the value of a product water footprint is its ability to
disaggregate water use by component, allowing both direct and indirect water use
to be examined, as well as the different types of water that are used. The types
of water are green water, which is rainwater stored in the soil as moisture;
blue water, which is surface and ground water; and grey water, which is the
volume of freshwater required to assimilate pollutants based on existing ambient
water quality standards. Keeping the components of a water footprint separate
allows impacts to be assessed in the context of local watersheds where the water
is being sourced. 

The Company and the Conservancy found that the largest portion of the product
water footprints assessed in the pilot studies comes from the field, not the
factory. 

"We see significant opportunity to engage more directly with our agricultural
suppliers to advance sustainable water use for the cultivation of ingredients in
our supply chain," said Denise Knight, Water and Sustainable Agriculture
Director, The Coca-Cola Company. "Our initial efforts will focus on the
sustainable sourcing of sugarcane, oranges and corn." 

Although the operational water footprint was found to be a very small percentage
of the total water footprint, both organizations say it remains important for
businesses to manage their direct impacts on local water resources, particularly
with regard to wastewater treatment. 

To analyze the impacts of water use, the report indicates the volume of water
consumption must be placed in the context of a local watershed, where the
cumulative effect of all uses of the shared water resource can be considered. To
this end, the report stresses the importance of conducting an impacts assessment
that examines the Company`s water use and its relationship to the communities
where it operates. 

In partnership with third-party researchers, the Company and the Conservancy
calculated the water footprints of Coca-Cola in a 0.5 liter PET bottle produced
by Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE) in the Netherlands; beet sugar supplied to
Coca-Cola bottling plants in Europe; and Minute Maid orange juice and Simply
Orange produced for the North American market. 

Estimates are that the green water footprint of the 0.5 liter Coca-Cola beverage
is 15 liters; the blue water footprint is 1 liter; and the grey water footprint
is 12 liters. 

The average green water footprint for sugar from sugar beets across all regions
of Europe is estimated to be 375 liters/kg sugar; the average blue water
footprint is 54 liters/kg sugar; and the average grey water footprint is 128
liters/kg sugar. The size and color composition of the water footprint varies
depending on the region from which the beets are sourced. 

For Simply Orange sourced from Florida, the green water footprint is 386 liters
per liter of product; the blue water footprint is 154 liters per liter of
product; and the grey water footprint is 100 liters per liter of product. For
Simply Orange sourced from both Florida and Brazil, the green water footprint is
407 liters per liter of product; the blue water footprint is 127 liters per
liter of product; and the grey water footprint is 117 liters per liter of
product. For Minute Maid sourced in Florida and Costa Rica, the green water
footprint is 319 liters per liter of product; the blue water footprint is 115
liters per liter of product; and the grey water footprint is 84 liters per liter
of product. 

"More important than the numbers associated with a water footprint are the
impacts of water use," said Brian Richter, Freshwater Program Co-Director, The
Nature Conservancy. "When properly managed, even large volumes of water use can
be sustainable in locations where the resource is sufficient to support the use
and sustain ecological health. The number associated with a water footprint is
not the end game, but rather a starting point to addressing the sustainability
of the water source." 

Water footprints are helping to inform The Coca-Cola Company`s approach to
global water stewardship. The Company has a goal to safely return to communities
and nature an amount of water equivalent to what is used in all of its beverages
and their production. Measurable, time-bound targets have been set by the
Company to reduce, recycle and replenish water used in the manufacturing of its
beverages. 

Likewise, The Nature Conservancy is interested in advancing the methodology and
application of water footprints as part of its mission, which is to preserve the
plants, animals and natural communities that represent the diversity of life on
Earth by protecting the lands and waters they need to survive.

Water footprints are helping to inform The Coca-Cola Company`s approach to
global water stewardship. The Company has a goal to safely return to communities
and nature an amount of water equivalent to what is used in all of its beverages
and their production. Measurable, time-bound targets have been set by the
Company to reduce, recycle and replenish water used in the manufacturing of its
beverages. 

Likewise, The Nature Conservancy is interested in advancing the methodology and
application of water footprints as part of its mission, which is to preserve the
plants, animals and natural communities that represent the diversity of life on
Earth by protecting the lands and waters they need to survive.

Zacks.com Analyst Blog features: Airgas Inc. (NYSE: ARG), Air Products &amp;

Inc. (NYSE: GS) and NCI Building Systems Inc. (NYSE: NCS).

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

APD`s Fourth Bid for Airgas

Airgas Inc. (NYSE: ARG) has received yet another revised offer from Air Products
&amp; Chemicals Inc. (NYSE: APD) for the former`s acquisition in an all-cash
transaction. Air Products has now raised the bid offer to $65.50 a share valuing
the company at $5.5 billion, from $63.50 a share offered in early July. The
board of directors of Airgas will review the tender offer. 

At $65.50 per share, the offer represents a premium of more than 50% over the
closing price of Airgas' shares on February 4, 2010, the day before Air Products
announced its proposal to acquire Airgas. 

However, the offer price is at a discount of 0.4% to the closing price of Airgas
shares on September 7, 2010. The share price of Airgas fell approximately 1.4%
on Tuesday to close at $65.75. 

The current offer price comes on the back of three offer bids proposed by Air
Products earlier, all of which were rejected by the Airgas` board of directors. 

Air Products admitted that if the shareholders of Airgas do not approve the
transaction, the acquisition deal will fall flat leaving no space for further
consideration. 

The acquisition story dates back to October 2009 when Air Products proposed to
acquire Airgas in an all-cash transaction of $60 per share. However, the board
of directors of Airgas rejected the offer as it believed that the offer was not
in the best of interest of its shareholders. Following rejection, Air Products
upped its offer to a cash and stock proposal with an implied value of $62 per
share in December 2009. 

On February 5, 2010, Air Products &amp; Chemicals retracted the December bid,
offering to acquire Airgas at an unsolicited cash price of $60 per share. The
offer represented a premium of 38% on the closing price of $43.53 as of February
4, 2010. The total transaction was valued at approximately $7 billion, including
$5.1 billion of equity and $1.9 billion of assumed debt. However, on February 22
the Airgas board once again rejected the offer. 

On July 8, Air Products proposed a revised price of $63.50 to Airgas. After
reviewing the offer, on July 21, the board rejected it. 

The board has continuously rejected the offers made by Air Products on the
ground that it highly undervalues the company. 

NYSE, APX JV Forms NYSE Blue

In an attempt to enhance its global environmental energy business, NYSE Euronext
Inc.`s (NYSE: NYX) Paris-based carbon credits spot market BlueNext entered into
a joint venture (JV) with a U.S.-based private entity, APX Inc. to build NYSE
Blue. The deal is anticipated to culminate by the end of 2010, subject to
regulatory and shareholders` approval. 

APX provides infrastructure for environmental commodities and energy markets. It
has a strong presence in the U.S. renewable energy certificate market and the
global voluntary carbon market. Hence, it blends well with the operations of
NYSE`s BlueNext in Europe. 

There is an increasing need for innovative tools and trading instruments to deal
with new types of business risks including those around energy, carbon,
renewable energy, water and other environmental factors. Given the recent
developments in the environmental space, there appears to be significant scope
for growth in energy and environmental markets, particularly that of North
America and Asia. As such, the NYSE Blue JV will primarily focus on
environmental and sustainable energy markets. 

Thus, NYSE Blue JV will offer a huge variety of services and solutions such as
integrated pre-trade and post-trade platforms including the BlueNext trading
platform along with a front-end market access and environmental portfolio
management. Besides, the NYSE Blue JV will also provide services that include
environmental registry and environmental markets reference data. 

This is expected to boost NYSE`s competitive leverage in the energy and
environmental markets. Moreover, a successful blending of an environmental
commodities infrastructure provider like APX with a global exchange like NYSE is
expected to offer a unique entry point into these rapidly developing markets. 

NYSE will be the major stakeholder in NYSE Blue with about 60% of ownership,
whereas, APX will provide its business in return for a minority share. The
shareholders of APX that include Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS),
MissionPoint Capital Partners and Onset Ventures will be among the minority
stakeholders in the JV. 

While NYSE`s European carbon trading unit (BlueNext) and APX aim to optimally
utilize its resources in order to create valuable synergies in the energy and
environmental market, the JV also projects to expand globally with a primary
focus on North America and Asia. Through this JV, NYSE attempts to make an
effort to augment its presence in environmental markets globally while drawing
new partners and customers into the venture. 

Mixed Bag for NCI Buildings

Metal products manufacturer NCI Building Systems Inc. (NYSE: NCS) reported
third-quarter fiscal 2010 operating loss of 64 cents per share compared to
operating earnings of 95 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The results of
the company were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. 

GAAP net loss of NCI Buildings, for the quarter under review, was 90 cents a
share versus earnings of 65 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. The
difference between operating and GAAP loss, during the third quarter, was owing
to the following one-time items: an impact of 25 cents relating to the
conversion of the preference shares of the company and 1 cent for restructuring
charges. 

Total Revenue

NCI Buildings reported total revenue of $245.3 million in the third quarter 2010
versus $237.9 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting a growth of 3.1%. The
results of the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $230 million. 

The year-over-year increase in total revenue was driven by healthy contributions
from all the three revenue segments - Metal coil coating, Metal components and
Engineered building systems. However, Inter-segment sales marginally diluted the
results. 

Operational Update

During the reported quarter, the gross profit decreased to $50.4 million from
the year-ago level of $61.3 million owing to higher input costs. The cost of
goods sold during the quarter increased by 522 basis points year over year. 

Selling, general and administrative (SG) expenses of the company, as a
percentage of total revenue, decreased 100 basis points over the year-ago
quarter. The decline in SG reflects benefits from cost savings. 

Interest expense of the company at the end of the third quarter was $4.4
million, down from $6.6 million a year ago. 

Backlog during the third quarter decreased $36 million from the sequentially
preceding quarter to $223 million. This decline in backlog was due to slower
bookings in the quarter resulting from the recent economic pullback combined
with improved pricing discipline on incoming orders and re-pricing of the
existing projects to accommodate an increase in steel costs.

&lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans across the country proved the power of social media and
the strength of their voice through this summer`s "America Is Your Park"
campaign
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
When Coca-Cola issued a call for American families to vote for their favorite
park, millions answered. The "America Is Your Park" campaign ignited a fierce
competition online, across the airwaves and in newspapers across the country,
with Bear Head Lake State Park in Ely, Minnesota emerging as "America`s Favorite
Park" thanks to more than 1.6 million votes. People across the United States
cast over 5.7 million votes during this unique online campaign that encouraged
families to be active outdoors this summer and visit LivePositively.com to help
their favorite park win funding. In addition to winning the title of "America`s
Favorite Park," Bear Head Lake State Park was awarded a $100,000 recreation
grant made possible by Coca-Cola`s Live Positively initiative. 

"It`s clear that our nation`s parks hold a special place in the hearts of
Americans. This outpouring of support shows the power we each have to change our
communities with the click of a button," said Celeste Bottorff, Vice President
of Living Well, Coca-Cola North America. "Coca-Cola has always been a part of
fun with friends and families and our parks play a critical role, delivering
active environments for those good times." 

Through its partnership with the National Park Foundation and the National Park
Service, and in collaboration with America`s State Parks and the America`s State
Parks Foundation, Coca-Cola donated more than $500,000 in grants to national,
state and local parks across the country this summer for new activity equipment
such as bikes and kayaks, and the restoration and construction of activity
areas. In addition to millions of online voters, many others came out to local
health and wellness events hosted by Coca-Cola that featured Women`s National
Basketball Association FIT Clinics at parks in select cities across the country.
The quest to recognize "America`s Favorite Park" sparked efforts in many
communities where passionate park advocates organized voting drives, passed out
flyers, mobilized "park friends" networks and used various social media channels
to drive people to vote for their park to win the grant. 

"I run and exercise in the park regularly and really got behind the `America Is
Your Park` campaign because it`s a phenomenal way for people like me to help
their favorite park win money for restorations and new equipment," said Ryan
Seacrest, host of the syndicated radio show, "On-Air with Ryan Seacrest," and
television personality. "I know first-hand how spending time in the park can
change your mood and outlook, so I congratulate Bear Head Lake State Park for
being crowned `America`s Favorite Park` and winning the grant from Coca-Cola." 

Bear Head Lake State Park, one of 73 parks and recreation areas in the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources (DNR) state parks and trails system, plans to
use the $100,000 recreation grant to promote outdoor recreation and enhance
places in the park for people of all ages to play. Specifically, the park plans
to build a much-needed trail center where hikers, paddlers, snowshoers and
others can gather before heading outdoors to explore. 

"I am honored that people from around the country mobilized to get out the vote
for Bear Head Lake State Park as `America`s Favorite Park`," said DNR
Commissioner Mark Holsten. "We very much appreciate the generous grant the park
will receive from Coca-Cola and the support from the America`s State Parks
Foundation. It was unexpected, and we are grateful. The grant will ensure that
the 100,000-plus people who visit this park each year will have more options for
being active outdoors and creating lasting family memories." 

About the "America Is Your Park" Campaign

For over 40 years, Coca-Cola has supported America's national parks through
programs like "America Is Your Park". Through its support of individual parks
and the National Park Foundation, the official charity of America`s national
parks, Coca-Cola has helped maintain and rebuild 260 miles of trails so families
can be active together while enjoying the great outdoors. In the last four
years, Coca-Cola has donated over four million dollars to national parks for
restoration and renovation. 

In addition to donating more than $500,000 in grants to national, local and
state parks this summer, Coca-Cola also gave away many fun prizes, annual passes
and family vacations to numerous national parks through programs on
MyCokeRewards. Additionally, 370 people submitted entries into the Summer
Snapshot Contest through the Coca-Cola page on Facebook, and consumers donated
nearly 500,000 MyCokeReward points to the National Park Foundation. Consumers
are also encouraged to continue visiting MyCoke.com to upload their laugh to the
Smile-izer. For every laugh submitted, a dollar will be donated to the National
Park Foundation, up to $50,000. 

About Bear Head Lake State Park

Bear Head Lake State Park provides the opportunity to experience first hand the
beautiful Northwoods for which Minnesota is so well known. A popular place to
camp, canoe, and fish, the park has more than 100,000 visitors a year. Park
highlights include 23 miles of pristine lakeshore and abundant wildlife, with
stands of white and red pine trees that tower over birch, aspen and fir trees.
Located just south of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA), it shares a similar
wilderness quality, but amenities such as camper cabins, drive-in campsites and
running water make it more accessible than the BWCA. As its name implies, Bear
Head Lake State Park is home to black bears, as well as nesting eagles, wolves
and moose. More information about the park, including a virtual tour with
360-degree panoramic photos of the park`s pristine forests and shoreline, can be

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/0d846f/biofuels_productio) has
announced the addition of the "Biofuels Production" report to their offering. 

The biofuels industry in the US is dominated by ethanol production, which
includes about 300 companies with combined annual revenue of more than $20
billion. Major ethanol producers include Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill, BP,
and Chevron. 

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

Demand is driven by federal legislation and regulations that establish a
government-mandated market for biofuels. The profitability of biofuel production
facilities depends on prices of gasoline and diesel, which fluctuate based on
world petroleum demand and domestic refinery utilization. Economies of scale in
ethanol production are limited due to the transportation costs associated with
gathering feedstocks (corn and other biomasses) and transporting the ethanol to
blending sites. As a result, large companies operate multiple production
facilities. Small companies can compete effectively by developing business
relations with distributors and by delivering consistently. The industry is
capital-intensive: average annual revenue per employee in ethanol production
facilities is about $2 million per year. 

Biofuels is a young industry that has grown rapidly. New entrants join the field
constantly and new technology breakthroughs are frequent. Federal and state
government subsidies and loan guarantees keep barriers to entry relatively low. 

PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS &amp; TECHNOLOGY 

The major products of the biofuels industry are ethanol and biodiesel. Ethanol
makes up more than 90 percent of current US biofuels production of about 11
billion gallons per year, meaning that about 10 billion gallons of ethanol is
produced annually.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog fined Goldman Sachs Group Inc 17.5 million pounds ($27 million) for failing to tell the regulator that it was the subject of a U.S. probe, reviving disclosure headaches for the Wall Street powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fine -- one of the biggest ever imposed in Britain -- stemmed from Goldman's troubled Abacus mortgage-security product, which was the focus of an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was not the Abacus product itself that put Goldman at odds with Britain's Financial Services Authority. Instead, it was the firm's failure to inform the FSA that it was facing an SEC probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman Sachs International did not set out to hide anything, but its defective systems and controls meant that the level and quality of its communications with the FSA fell far below what we expect of an authorized firm," FSA director Margaret Cole said in a statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a terse response to the FSA fine, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said, "We're pleased the matter is resolved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Goldman agreed to pay $550 million to settle civil fraud charges over how it marketed the Abacus subprime mortgage product, ending months of negotiations with the SEC that rattled the bank's clients and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had known for several months that charges from the SEC were possible, but it did not report it to shareholders, regulators or clients. Its shares fell 12 percent on April 16, the day the SEC sued. That was seven months after the bank received a Wells Notice alerting it to potential charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISCLOSURE CONCERNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of disclosure has prompted lawsuits and investigations -- and even caused the bank to lose business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacob Zamansky, an attorney who is representing shareholders in a class-action lawsuit against Goldman, said such suits will be bolstered by the FSA fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not going away," said Zamansky. "I believe these regulatory actions strengthen the case of shareholders against Goldman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 16, the largest U.S. public pension fund, Calpers, notified Goldman that it would not use the firm in its pool of real estate investment consultants, according to a document obtained by Reuters. Calpers's decision came after fund officials said they planned to question Goldman about its failure to disclose, when it bidding for a Calpers contract, that it was facing an investigation from the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority also was investigating Goldman's failure to report the Wells Notice that it received in September regarding trader Fabrice Tourre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre, a French banker, was involved in marketing the Abacus product.

&lt;p&gt;Electronic Payment Transaction and Card Management Software Tested Under Real
Life Production Scenarios
ST. LOUIS--(Business Wire)--
Compass Plus, an international provider of electronic payment solutions and
retail banking technology to financial institutions, today announced that its
TranzWare Card Management System (CMS) and TranzWare Online products
successfully completed performance tests on the IBM System z enterprise server
at the IBM Products and Solutions Services Centre in Montpellier, France. 

TranzWare CMS provides financial institutions with automated management of the
issuance and circulation of payment cards, as well as bank and merchant
acquiring. The testing, which simulated six months worth of live transaction
data and associated batch procedures, demonstrated that TranzWare CMS is capable
of running all end-of-month procedures in less than eight hours for at least 10
million active credit cards. The system was tested using a variety of data sets,
such as overdue and non-overdue accounts, as well as active and blocked cards. 

Compass Plus` TranzWare Online manages electronic payment transactions and ATM
networks. The system underwent stress testing in a processing scenario
containing a database of 100 million customers, accounts and cards and
simulating up to 54,000 terminals comprised of 15,000 ATMs and 39,000 POS
devices. The testing included ATM transactions, of which 85 percent were cash
withdrawal and 15 percent were balance inquiry, and POS purchase transactions. 

All terminals functioned with limit checks, commission calculations, performance
of full authorization in stand-in mode and authentication of cardholders, among
other parameters. The ATMs were monitored by the system in full online mode.
During the tests, TranzWare Online achieved 460 business transactions per second
(TPS), with a peak of 6,000 logical TPS. For instance, a cash withdrawal
represents one business transaction, but is comprised of multiple logical
transactions, such as validating the card and checking account balances. 

"The payments landscape is continuously evolving, especially when considering
consumers` growing expectation for impeccable and secure service around the
clock," said Doug Varble, North American vice president of Compass Plus. "By
aligning with leading vendors in the market to test new products, Compass Plus
plays a significant role in the development and improvement of enterprise
solutions that are deployed across the financial industry." 

IBM System z acts as the management hub for the enterprise computing
environment, efficiently and securely handling complex application and
processing requirements. System z delivers large-scale consolidation
capabilities for savings of up to 80 percent in total cost of ownership compared
to distributed platforms. 

Built by an in-house team of software developers, the highly flexible
architecture and single-integration structure of TranzWare products enable
effective use of applications in a broad spectrum of business environments, as
well as easy deployment and management. All TranzWare products are PCI DSS and
PA DSS compliant.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO--(Business Wire)--
Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. today announced that it has developed a photomask
manufacturing process at its facility in Asaka, Japan, to support 22nm and 20nm
semiconductor device production. This process was developed through Toppan`s
ongoing joint development project with IBM. Toppan is ready to support 22nm and
20nm photomask prototyping as well as production for leading-edge semiconductor
manufacturing customers. 

Semiconductors have become increasingly sophisticated due to growing demand for
telecommunication devices and highly complex and multifunctional digital
consumer electronic products. Such advanced semiconductors are expected to have
better performance, lower power consumption, and lower cost. Photomasks play a
critical role in producing semiconductors that meet those requirements. The new
photomask process from Toppan will help accelerate the production of
semiconductors for next-generation technologies. 

Although photomasks are becoming more complex, the IBM-Toppan Photomask Joint
Development Project collaborated with IBM wafer-technology teams in East
Fishkill and Albany, N.Y., to enhance photomask technology while also achieving
significant development-cost savings. The latest photomask technology solution
accommodates wafer requirements for advanced double patterning and source mask
optimization (SMO)1 solutions to extend the capabilities of 193nm wavelength
argon fluoride (ArF) immersion optical lithography. Despite the attention
focused on EUV and other next-generation lithography technologies, these
alternatives present significant challenges to delivery of manufacturing-ready
solutions for the 22nm and 20nm nodes. 

To support the global semiconductor ecosystem, photomask technologies must
remain ahead of wafer schedules and provide better capability. One method of
accomplishing this is to enhance wafer performance through development of novel
mask material and associated photomask process integration. A new, thinner
opaque MoSi on glass (OMOG) material for improved photomask and wafer
performance has been developed. The photomask advantages realized are improved
flatness, less process-induced pattern placement change, increased cleaning
durability, better resolution, and superior image uniformity. 

The improvements enabled by thin OMOG for wafer printing are even more
revolutionary. The reduced topography associated with thin OMOG allows for
smaller electromagnetic field bias2, improved wafer manufacturability and
reduced mask pattern constraints. Relaxed mask pattern constraints increase
optical proximity correction flexibility on key features such as sub-resolution
assists and corner-to-corner gaps. Superior overall lithography performance can
be obtained through a combination of mask improvements and wafer printing
benefits. 

Details of this new photomask technology will be presented at the 2010 SPIE
Photomask Technology conference, Sept. 13-16 in Monterey, Calif. 

"This announcement marks a significant milestone in the successful, multi-year
joint development collaboration between Toppan and IBM," said Gary Patton, Vice
President of IBM Semiconductor Research &amp; Development Center. "Photomasks are
critical to enabling technology for semiconductor manufacturing, and together
our two companies have delivered an advanced mask manufacturing technology that
can help speed the development, volume production and time-to-market of 22nm and
smaller devices." 

"The collaborative work between Toppan and IBM achieved another photomask
technology innovation today," said Toshiro Masuda, Deputy Head of Electronics
Division and Managing Director of Toppan Printing. "Toppan will continue to
support our semiconductor manufacturing customers by leveraging this newly
developed photomask process to contribute to the evolution of the semiconductor
industry." 

Toppan-IBM Joint Development Project in Advanced Photomasks

Toppan`s collaboration with IBM began in 2005 at the 45nm node, and expanded to
cover 32nm/28nm and 22nm/20nm nodes in 2008. The Toppan-IBM Joint Development
Project completed 32nm and 28nm logic photomask process development in 2009,
resulting in the introduction of OMOG, an innovative binary-type mask material.
OMOG has now been widely adopted by the industry. Today, a new thinner OMOG is
being deployed to meet 22nm and 20nm lithography requirements.

SMO is the co-optimization of the illumination source and mask pattern. SMO
results in a lithographic solution for producing more advanced semiconductor
devices than would be possible with conventional lithographic techniques, and is
expected to extend immersion lithography through the 22nm node and beyond. 

2 EMF Bias (Electromagnetic Field Bias)
When on-mask features are approximately equal to or smaller than the exposure
wavelength, Electro-Magnetic Fields (EMF) interact with the mask features. As a
result, simple OPC models are no longer accurate. Applying an EMF bias makes
clear features smaller and opaque features bigger, extending the use of fast OPC
models to more advanced nodes.

&lt;p&gt;SRS 5.1 Empowers Content Creators to Enhance Multimedia with Surround Sound
Encoding That`s Playable Across TVs, PCs and Mobile Devices
SANTA ANA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
SRS Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRSL), the industry leader in surround sound, audio and
voice technologies, announced today that it is making available complete SRS
surround sound encoding and decoding technology to users of Microsoft
Silverlight, a powerful development platform for creating rich media and
business applications for the Web, desktop and mobile devices. 

"This is an exciting moment for SRS and we`re thrilled to expand this
collaboration with Microsoft to now bring surround sound capability to
Silverlight and its millions of users," said Allen H. Gharapetian, Vice
President of Marketing for SRS Labs. "Every day, more and more consumers are
streaming TV shows and movies over the Web to their PCs, TVs, and mobile phones,
and now, with the availability of SRS 5.1 surround for Silverlight, the
collective online multimedia experience will become more vivid and immersive." 

Microsoft and SRS` collaboration dates back to May 2000 when SRS WOW became a
standard feature within Windows Media Player. Today, as part of a larger effort
to deliver immersive surround sound to the rapidly growing number of consumers
streaming content to their PCs, TVs and mobile phones, SRS has advanced the
streaming multimedia experience to the next level by coupling its SRS 5.1
technology with a complete Microsoft-centric toolkit that effortlessly adds bit
efficient, exceptional quality surround sound to content created in Silverlight.


SRS 5.1 is designed to provide content creators with the tools to create and
deliver true, high-quality streamed surround sound encoded content across the
three-screens, TVs, PCs and mobile devices. SRS 5.1 is the only surround format
available now in Microsoft Silverlight that is coupled with a complete toolkit.
This SRS package functions as a managed code add-on for content creators and
developers making surround sound decoding in Silverlight applications easy and
seamless. Because millions of TVs, A/V receivers, PCs and mobile phones today
feature one or more SRS audio solutions such as Circle Surround, TheaterSound,
StudioSound HD, and TruSurround, every one of these CE devices are natively
equipped with the capability to decode SRS 5.1 surround encoded content,
resulting in a "surround everywhere" entertainment experience. 

Some of the other major benefits of these encoding and decoding solutions
include:

* Multichannel and front-rendered surround sound 
* Smooth steering and full bandwidth for a seamless and immersive surround
environment 
* Backwards compatibility with legacy matrix decoders and stereo 
* Surround streaming over bit rates as low as 96kbps

Since the release of Silverlight in 2007, its adoption has continued at a rapid
pace with installations approaching 60 percent on all Internet-connected devices
worldwide, an increase of nearly 15 percentage points in just four months. Now
with inclusion of SRS 5.1 surround for content created in Silverlight, any PC or
connected flat panel TV can decode SRS 5.1 audio for true multi-channel or
front-rendered surround.SRS 5.1 effectively provides a top-quality, format
agnostic, easy to deploy and manage end-to-end surround sound technology for
content creation, transmission and consumption. 

"Multichannel audio takes the premium media experiences offered by Silverlight
to the next level," said Brad Becker, director of Rich Client Platforms at
Microsoft Corp. "Microsoft is pleased to see SRS bring its surround sound
technology to Silverlight`s hundreds of millions of users by taking advantage of
the powerful extensibility and interoperability that Silverlight and IIS Smooth
Streaming provide." 

The tools and white paper for SRS 5.1 content creation with Silverlight are
available now at www.srslabs.com/Silverlight. Meanwhile, a demonstration of SRS
5.1 will be available at IBC in Amsterdam, The Netherlands from September 10th
to 14th at the Microsoft stand located in the Topaz Lounge.

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman fined for inadequate systems and controls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman failed to notify FSA of Wells Notice to Tourre&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds further detail, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog
slapped a 17.5 million pounds ($27 million) fine on Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) on Thursday for inadequate disclosure of a U.S.
probe into the Wall Street powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fine -- one of the biggest ever imposed in Britain --
was related to Goldman's troubled Abacus mortgage-security
product, which resulted in the investment bank being
investigated by the U.S. Securities  Exchange Commission (SEC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In July, Goldman agreed to pay $550 million to settle civil
fraud charges over how it marketed the Abacus subprime mortgage
product, ending months of negotiations that rattled the bank's
clients and investors. [ID:nN15236037]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Abacus product was marketed by French banker Fabrice
Tourre. Tourre, who had dubbed himself as "Fabulous Fab", denied
allegations that he or the bank had misled investors over the
high-risk Abacus product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain's Financial Services Authority said on Thursday that
Goldman had not adequately informed it of the American
investigation into the Abacus affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman Sachs International did not set out to hide
anything, but its defective systems and controls meant that the
level and quality of its communications with the FSA fell far
below what we expect of an authorised firm," FSA director
Margaret Cole said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a seven-word response to the FSA fine, a Goldman Sachs
spokeswoman said: "We're pleased the matter is resolved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEWSMAKER on Fabrice Tourre on  [ID:nLDE63Q10K]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters Breakingviews column on [ID:nLDE6880I0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tourre had marketed the Abacus product back in 2007 --
towards the height of a bull market run and just before the
onset of the credit crisis which rattled markets and caused a
huge slump in the value of many mortgage-related debt products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FSA said Goldman Sachs had failed to notify it of the
fact that the SEC had issued so-called "Wells Notices" to the
bank and to Tourre himself containing allegations of violations
of U.S. securities laws relating to the Abacus product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Wells Notice is an indication from the SEC staff that they
intend to recommend that the SEC should file an enforcement
action against the person or entity to whom the notice is
addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs shares closed at $147.54 on Wednesday, giving
the bank a market capitalisation of roughly $80 billion.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - The world's largest software maker may have developed a problem of holding onto top executives with ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Elop's decision to jump from the top flight of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), quitting as business division president, to run mobile phone company Nokia (NOK1V.HE) makes him the latest in a clutch of top managers moving to cap their careers elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may reflect the fact that Microsoft is no longer the most exciting place to work in technology, or perhaps that 56-year-old Chief Executive Steve Ballmer is not expected to give up his office any time soon, effectively putting a glass ceiling on his top lieutenants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone who has ambitions of being CEO and running a company, it's probably going to be quite some time before they get that opportunity at Microsoft," said Toan Tran, an analyst at Morningstar. "If that's something they want to do in their career, then there's going to be better opportunities elsewhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell stepped down to look for a bigger job, eventually ending up as CFO of carmaker General Motors Co GM.UL. The year before, platforms and services unit chief Kevin Johnson left to become CEO of network gear firm Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's top ranks were thinned again in May this year when Robbie Bach, head of the entertainment and devices unit, decided to retire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The departure of 46-year-old Elop, who was viewed as a good leader of the company's Office unit -- its largest division by sales -- may signal a worrying trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is concerning when you see some high level executives leaving and you see a pattern like this emerging," said Todd Lowenstein, portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management, which holds Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You would prefer continuity, especially at a company that is trying to change hearts and minds and perceptions out there," said Lowenstein. "It may just be circumstantial, but it doesn't bolster investor confidence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXCITEMENT, OPTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The turnover of top managers at Microsoft, while not dramatic, has been noticeably higher than at rivals such as Google Inc (GOOG.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) or International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N). Only Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), which went through a drastic shake-up after the departure of co-founder and CEO Jerry Yang early last year, seems to have a worse problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Apple, which have gripped consumers' and investors' imagination with their products over the past few years, now seem to be more exciting and potentially lucrative places to work than Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rewards for employees owning stock and options in those companies look much more attractive, which may be part of Microsoft's problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company stopped issuing stock options as part of compensation in 2003, and now grants shares to employees. But with a stock price essentially unchanged for the last seven years, that has not proved to be as financially rewarding as it would have been in the 1990s, when Microsoft shares grew almost one hundred-fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe (Elop) felt he wasn't going to get upside on compensation at Microsoft any longer, given that maybe its go-go growth days are largely behind it," said Lowenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he defended Microsoft's ability to interest top managers. "They can still attract talent: it's a big company but still growing at decent rates. They've got some interesting things going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is perhaps a mark of approval that Microsoft executives have been chosen to run other companies. One insider points out that the situation could be compared to General Electric Co (GE.N) under Jack Welch, which generated future leaders of companies like Boeing Co (BA.N) and Home Depot Inc (HD.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot of really talented individuals at Microsoft so we think they'll be fine," said Kevin Walkush, an analyst at Oregon-based Jensen Investment Management, which holds Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft should be able to fill the vacant post with an insider or a new hire, Walkush said. "They've got so much deep talent, either scenario -- internal or external -- is plausible and good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Ballmer gave no indications of who the next head of Elop's former unit would be, but said existing executives Chris Capossela, Kurt DelBene, Amy Hood and Kirill Tatarinov would report directly to him in the meantime, perhaps suggesting the successor will come from that group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   * Chevron had won trial on suit brought by villagers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * US torture law doesn't apply to companies-appeals court
 (Adds comment from parties)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
successfully beat back an attempt by Nigerian villagers to hold
it liable for a deadly clash on an oil platform in Nigeria, a
federal appeals court ruled on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2008 a Northern California jury decided Chevron did not
have to pay compensation to a group of plaintiffs for a clash a
decade earlier between Nigerian state forces and protesters on
Chevron's Parabe oil platform, 9 miles (14 km) off Nigeria's
coast. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals refused on Friday
to disturb that verdict, according to its ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the villagers claimed they launched a peaceful
protest on the platform that turned bloody, at trial Chevron
characterized the action as a hostage-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the plaintiff attorneys, Bert Voorhees, said on
Friday that they were disappointed in the appellate ruling, and
that they had not yet decided whether to seek further judicial
review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's very, very rare any court of appeal is going to
second-guess evidentiary rulings by an experienced judge,"
Voorhees said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron spokesman said the appellate court ruling
"further exonerates" the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron Nigeria Limited remains committed to its
operations, the communities where Chevron Nigeria operates, and
being a force for positive development in the region," company
spokesman Kent Robertson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The appeals court also found that the Torture Victim
Protection Act, passed by Congress in 1992, does not apply to
corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case in the 9th Circuit is Bowoto v. Chevron Corp,
09-15641.

&lt;p&gt;  DANA POINT, CA, Sep 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
InformationWeek 500 Conference -- Organizations considering or
implementing unified communications have a rare opportunity to gain
insights into successful deployments and trends in UC adoption at The
InformationWeek 500 Conference. Jeremy Littlejohn, chief analyst for
Cisco and IBM analytics provider RISC Networks, will present "State of UC
2010," Tuesday, September 14, 2010, at 1:30 P.M. in the Monarch Ballroom,
as part of the event's InformationWeek Analytics Workshops.

    The hands-on session is based on the InformationWeek Analytics 2010
Unified Communications Survey and Report, "Unified Communications: Big
Promise, Modest Movement," and a recent InformationWeek UC article, both
authored by Littlejohn.

    The presentation also draws from new IT infrastructure analytics research
by RISC Networks, extracted from its upcoming "State of IT 2010 Report."
The research analyzes data from more than 260 different IT environments
and one million Ethernet connections. Attendees will receive a
complimentary hand out preview of the new report that will be published
later this month and available at www.riscnetworks.com. 

    Many see unified communications as a strategic technology that positions
the enterprise to innovate and be more efficient in processes and
interactions with customers and team members. But many organizations have
learned the hard way that getting an ROI on UC is elusive.

    In keeping with this year's theme, Navigating the Boardroom: The Growth
Imperative, this session will examine the reality of UC implementations
as they exist today to give IT executives and networking managers
practical advice for deciding if UC is a good investment for not, and
then getting the most out of it.

    "We have conducted thousands of analytics engagements, which has given us
tremendous insight into what IT managers need to be successful with
unified communications," said Jeremy Littlejohn, chief analyst at RISC
Networks, Inc. "In addition, InformationWeek analytics surveyed more than
400 organizations on the subject of UC. Taken together, these analytics
resources provide a wealth of hard-to-find practical and real world
information about UC that will make this a must-attend session for anyone
involved in or considering a UC implementation."

    RISC Networks, an analytics provider for Cisco Systems, IBM and others,
does not sell network monitoring software or hardware. Instead, the
company provides technology analytics services. Its consulting engineers

software to correlate and analyze information gathered from clients'
entire IT environments, including data, voice and video traffic,

than 250 of the country's top CIOs and IT executives. The InformationWeek
500 Conference is September 12-15, 2010 at the St. Regis Monarch Beach
Resort, Dana Point, California.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Will Basel III be a Needle-Mover?

With aftershocks of the recession still reverberating and a very real double-dip
threat on the horizon, regulatory officials from more than two dozen countries
have come up with a new set of capital standards known as Basel III for the
global banking community on Tuesday. The convention is to adopt tougher
measures, helping prevent a recurrence of global financial crises and restoring
public confidence. 

The formal approval of the Basel III proposal is expected on September 12, 2010.
The entry point of capital requirements will be different until the introductory
period ends in 2018. Will this be perilous to the U.S. banks, or is this what
the doctor ordered? 

The Basel norms focus on regulatory capital requirements that the banks should
maintain. Though the average U.S. banks may fall short of these criteria in the
near term with lower capital levels following the recession, they have been
raising billions of dollars through the issuance of equity and trying to deploy
capital much more cautiously than before. However, major large-cap U.S. banks
appear to comfortably maintain the extra capital norms that the Basel Committee
advocates. 

So what does Basel III mandate? And how comfortable will the U.S. banks be?
Here`s a quick look: 

Tier 1 Capital Requirements

Banks will have to maintain a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio as high as 12.0%.
This will comprise a minimum buffer of 6.0%, a conservation buffer of 3.0% and
an additional 3.0% anti-cyclical buffer. The anti-cyclical buffer will help
increase the Tier 1 capital requirements to 12% during boom times. 

Do U.S. banks comply? As of June 30, 2010, the major banks in the country
maintained Tier 1 capital ratios above the proposed minimum level. Bank of
America (NYSE: BAC), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC)
and Citigroup (NYSE: C) had Tier 1 capital ratios of 10.7%, 12.1%, 10.5% and
12.0%, respectively. The capital ratios are expected to somewhat reduce
following the repayment of bailout money by some banks. Still, the Tier 1
capital ratios of these banks are not expected to fall below the new minimum
capital level requirement. 

Tier 1 Common Capital/Core Capital Requirements

The Tier 1 common capital ratio requirement would increase to a minimum of 5.0%
along with a conservation buffer of 2.5%. Also, there will be an additional
anti-cyclical buffer of 2.5%. 

The major U.S. banks swim through these requirements as well. As of June 30,
2010, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup had Tier 1
common capital ratios of 8.0%, 9.6%, 7.6% and 9.7%, respectively. Like Tier 1
capital ratios, the most shock-absorbent Tier 1 common capital ratios are also
not expected to decrease below the minimum required level following the
repayment of government money by most of the relevant U.S. banks. 

Will Dividend Growth be Challenged?

According to the proposals under Basel III, only if a bank operating in a steady
economic environment maintains a Tier 1 capital ratio of 12% would it be allowed
to pay or increase common dividends. As a result, the pace of dividend increase
could be slow as banks will first use earnings to meet the additional capital
requirements. However, if the banks can fulfill other regulatory requirements,
the dividend increase would follow in due course. Increasing profitability may
also help increase dividends. 

Though some of the major banks with strong capital ratios would have been able
to increase dividends if the proposed capital requirements were immediately
implemented, banks with weak capital ratios, including U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB),
would have to avoid paying dividends. 

Financial Reform Law, the Basel III Harbinger?

The recently passed U.S. financial reform law has already rung in what Basel III
is contemplating. Tighter regulations of the recently enacted financial reform
law for companies that had threatened the economy are in place. The sweeping
financial reform law also imposes stricter capital requirements on banks. 

This law would partially restrict the proprietary trading of commercial banks.
Also, derivatives trading, used to hedge risks or speculate the future value of
assets, would be restricted. Banks will be banned from proprietary trading and
will be able to invest only up to 3% of their Tier 1 capital in private equity
and hedge funds. 

Conclusion

The economic benefits of standards like Basel III are indisputable, as these
would somewhat reconstruct the weak capital level that threaten the economy. The
norms could ultimately translate to fewer bank failures and less involvement of
taxpayers` money for bailing out troubled financial institutions. However, with
the financial reforms already in action, the Basel III would be akin to
preaching to the converted. The new standards will probably not be able to add
to the nation`s gains. 

Regulators and bankers are bound to disagree over the magnitude of positive
impact of the new rules as there remain other lingering concerns, including the
high unemployment rate, continuation of residential and commercial real estate
loan defaults and liquidity challenges. However, over a longer period of time,
small U.S. banks, which run with lower capital ratios, will be forced to
maintain required capital standards, providing buoyancy to the economy. 

On the other hand, the double bind of the Basel III capital standards along with
the financial reform law will compel the financial system to go through a
massive de-leveraging, and banks in particular will have lower leverage. The
implication for banks is that the profitability metrics (like returns on equity
and return on assets) will be lower than in recent years. 

Above all, the lower leverage due to these restrictions will be a throwback in a
sense, leaving banks to perform only their basic functions, including lending
and taking deposits. Would Basel III end up curbing the socio-economic functions
of banks and de-weave the financial fabric?

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI/LONDON (Reuters) - Nokia has hired Stephen Elop, a Canadian Microsoft executive with Silicon Valley credentials, to replace its embattled chief executive and renew its drive to compete with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's top cellphone maker said Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, who presided over a halving in Nokia's market value to about $37 billion during his four years in charge, would hand over to Elop on September 21. Nokia shares rose as much as 6.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop, 46, has risen rapidly over the past five years from chief executive of San Francisco Web software maker Macromedia to chief operating officer of Juniper Networks to head of Microsoft's Business Division, which makes Office software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chairman Jorma Ollila, who led Nokia's transformation from a rubber boots-to-TVs conglomerate into a mobile-phone giant in the 1990s, said he would also resign as soon as possible after the transition, underlining the scale of change at the Finnish company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Kallasvuo, who will get a severance payment of 4.6 million euros ($5.8 million), Nokia has struggled to keep up with rivals such as Apple and Google in smartphones, the most profitable and fastest-growing part of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a Helsinki news conference, Elop said it was too early to say what he planned to change. He said: "My job is ... to ensure that we are meeting the needs of our customers, while delivering superior financial results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference was broadcast live on Finland's main television and radio channels, demonstrating the strength of national interest in the 145-year-old company, which dominates the Nordic nation's economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop's appointment is a major shift for Nokia; he will be the first non-Finn to run the company, and eight of the current 10 executive board members are Finns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and pundits had urged Nokia to bring in an outsider, ideally an American, to help the company regain a reputation for "cool" it has largely lost to Apple's iPhone and a host of other phones built around Google's Android software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Finnish company has lacked a hit smartphone model since its N95 model launched in 2006, has failed to ignite much excitement around its new Web services and has performed particularly weakly in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAUNTING TASK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop told the news conference North America was a critically important market and would be "an area of emphasis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ollila said of Elop: "His strong software background and proven record in change management will be valuable assets as we press harder to complete the transformation of the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia shares rose almost 7 percent but later lost most of their gains to trade up 1.9 percent at 7.89 euros by 1405 GMT (10:05 a.m. EDT). The European technology index was flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have had problems for a long time and have been behind the curve on trends for the past few years. I think it could be good to get new influences, thoughts and ideas," said Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Elop faces a daunting task. Nokia has lost its leadership in high-tier phones and has struggled with the rise of Internet-led services," said Ben Wood, head of research at UK-based telecoms analyst firm CCS Insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DESIGN PRINCIPLES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop should bring to Nokia an understanding of the design principles that have driven Apple's success, as well as of the telecoms network industry in which Nokia's troubled Nokia Siemens Networks plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before joining Microsoft, he spent several years in Silicon Valley, rising to become chief executive during seven years at Macromedia, a San Francisco software maker whose graphics and Web development tools were favored by Apple developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macromedia made the Flash video and Dreamweaver software, which were retained by Adobe as key products when it bought Macromedia for $3.4 billion in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Microsoft, Elop helped steer the company toward online versions of programs such as Word, Outlook and Excel that users could access from anywhere and even use on mobile devices, a major step for a company founded on installed software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was also credited with successfully managing the launch of Microsoft's Office 2010 suite earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Nokia are long-time collaborators, and in August last year formed an alliance to bring Office applications such as Outlook e-mail to Nokia devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Business Division has traditionally been one of its two biggest and most profitable units, along with the Windows division. Last fiscal year it made $18.6 billion in sales, almost 30 percent of the company's total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop will now find himself in charge of a company with sales of 41 billion euros and 124,000 employees worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Olaf Swahnberg in Stockholm, Bill Rigby in Seattle and Terhi Kinnunen in Helsinki; Editing by Dan Lalor, Hans Peters and Will Waterman)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7882 euro)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extends 20 Year Relationship in the United States

* ExxonMobil will continue as the GM supplier for the U.S. GM dealer network for
the next five years.

FAIRFAX, Va.--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil signed an agreement to continue as the lubricants supplier for the
U.S. General Motors` dealer network for the next five years. In addition,
ExxonMobil announced that a number of its key products, including Mobil 1, are
now officially dexosTM licensed worldwide. 

The new dexosTM licensed ExxonMobil products will meet the GM global engine oil
specifications and will be designated by displaying dexos1 or dexos2 logos on
the product labels. These engine oils are designed to meet the specific
requirements of gasoline and diesel engines used in GM vehicles worldwide. 

"We`ve been working with GM for a long time, and we look forward to continued
growth with this important alliance," said Ken MacGibbon, sales director
strategic global alliances for ExxonMobil Lubricants &amp; Petroleum Specialties
Company. "ExxonMobil has been the supplier for the U.S. GM dealer network since
1990, and during the last 20 years, the GM service fill program has become one
of the best original engine manufacturer lubricants programs in the industry.
With strong efforts between both companies, we have grown sales, including Mobil
1, every year within the GM dealership network." 

"Our track record with ExxonMobil has been very strong, and we select our
lubricant supplier based on their quality, reliability and their ability to help
us grow our business," said Jeff Quigley, general director, GM Customer Care and
Aftersales. "We can count on ExxonMobil to support our dealer network and train
them on the use of quality lubricants." 

ExxonMobil`s dexosTM licensed products will provide consumers with a strong
product offer giving GM drivers more options when it comes to their motor oil.
Part of the offer will be Mobil 1, the world`s leading synthetic motor oil
brand, with Mobil 1 5W-30 for dexos1 and Mobil 1 ESP 0W-40 for dexos2. 

As part of the agreement, ExxonMobil will also market General Motors` new
semi-synthetic engine oil, ACDelco dexos1 5W30, to be launched later this year
in the U.S. and Canada. 

About Mobil 1

The world's leading synthetic motor oil brand, Mobil 1 features anti-wear
technology that provides performance beyond conventional motor oils. This
technology allows Mobil 1 to meet the toughest standards of car builders and to
provide exceptional protection against engine wear under normal or even some of
the most extreme conditions. Mobil 1 flows quickly in extreme temperatures to
protect critical engine parts and is designed to maximize engine performance and
help extend engine life.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/b19d45/professional_servi) has
announced the addition of the "Professional Services" report to their offering. 

The US professional services industry includes about 700,000 firms with combined
annual revenue of about $1 trillion. Major firms include Accenture, Computer
Sciences Corporation (CSC), Gensler, IBM, Jacobs Engineering Group, Omnicom,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. The industry
is highly fragmented: the 50 largest firms account for less than 25 percent of
revenue. 

The professional services industry includes accounting, advertising and
marketing, architectural, consulting, engineering, IT, legal, and scientific
research services. The industry does not include insurance, securities, or real
estate brokerage services. 

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

Demand is driven by corporate profits and the overall health of the US economy.
Although some professional services are necessary for the normal functioning of
most companies, many services can be postponed during economic downturns. The
profitability of individual firms depends on having a regular flow of projects.
Large firms have advantages in marketing and in being able to offer wider ranges
of services to meet the needs of major clients. Small firms can compete
successfully by offering special expertise or focusing on particular regions.
Revenue per employee varies among the different types of professional services. 

PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS &amp; TECHNOLOGY 

The three largest industry segments are IT services, legal services, and
architectural and engineering services, each of which accounts for about 20
percent of revenue. Consulting and accounting services generate about 15 percent
and 10 percent of revenue, respectively.

 (Updates with background on unit, adds byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) named Jim O'Neill, a company veteran, chairman of its
asset management business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Neill, who headed global economics, commodities and
strategy research, will work from London in a newly created
role. His responsibilities will help direct the asset
management unit and play a major role in setting global
investment direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's asset management arm has experienced rapid growth
over the past decade, managing $802 billion as of June 30,
nearly double the assets it managed in 2004. But the unit has
reported outflows in recent quarters, in line with broader
industry trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During an earnings call with analysts earlier this year,
Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said the company is
investing in and building its asset management business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, Goldman announced a management shuffle atop
its investment management division, which includes Goldman
Sachs Asset Management. Marc Spilker, a 20-year Goldman
veteran, retired and was replaced by Edward Forst as co-head of
the company's investment management division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forst now co-heads the investment management division with
Tim O'Neill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his new post, Jim O'Neill will report to Forst and Tim
O'Neill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jim O'Neill is known for creating the acronym BRICs --
shorthand for emerging markets Brazil, Russia, India and
China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He joined Goldman in 1995 as a partner. As head of global
economics, commodities and strategy research, he managed the
company's economics, strategy and commodity research teams.

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia, the world's top cellphone maker, said Stephen Elop, the head of Microsoft's Business Division, was to be its new chief executive, leading a renewed effort to compete in the smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elop will take over from Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo on September 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following are immediate comments from investors and analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GREGER JOHANSSON, REDEYE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that this is going to be seen as marginally positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that perhaps (Nokia chairman) Jorma (Ollila) could also need to be replaced as he is just as responsible (for the fall in shares) as Olli-Pekka. But maybe it isn't sensible to do that at the same time (as changing the CEO)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAN STEINBOCK, INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS RSEARCH DIRECTOR,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INDIA, CHINA AND AMERICA INSTITUTE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The short-term impact of Mr Elop's appointment may well be positive. With a strong industry background, global mindset, and intimate understanding of the North American marketplace, he could bring to Nokia the very assets and capabilities the company needs to appropriately respond to new challenges."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite a globally dominant market share, Nokia has not been as strong in the smartphone category. It remains strong globally, but weak in the United States; its toughest rivals are strong in the U.S., but weaker globally. In the next few months, the company hopes to deliver strong hit products and services. Global leadership in its business requires winning in the advanced and emerging markets; both are necessary for truly global leadership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEN WOOD, HEAD OF RESEARCH AT CCS INSIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This brings to an end the ongoing speculation about OPK's position. The appointment of a non-Finn marks a step change in Nokia's leadership&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The announcement comes on the eve of Nokia World, the company's most important annual event. This will undoubtedly be the biggest talking point at that event at a time when Nokia needed people to be focusing on its new products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOHN STRAND, CEO OF STRAND CONSULT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nokia has a communication problem. Theres is no doubt that Stephen Elop is a better communicator than Kallasvuo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is obvious that Nokia board, after a long and hard pressure have realized that Kallasvuo was a disaster regarding the way the world was looking at Nokia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HANNU RAUHALA, POHJOLA BANK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These kind of announcements are always a surprise, but there has been speculation on the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do not know Elop. He has been developing services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;concepts and if mobile phone business is moving into more services as Apple and Google are showing -- his background looks good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INGE HEYDORN, FUND MANAGER AT SENTAT ASSET MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is good that something is happening. They have had problems for a long time and have been behind the curve on trends for the past few years. I think it could be good to get new influences, thoughts and ideas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAMI SARKAMIES, NORDEA ANALYST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was not a total surprise, because in the latter half of July there were news stories in the international media about it. It was proved again, that these rumors were accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He (Elop) is not very well known in this part of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My first impression is positive, his background&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;will help Nokia with its current challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He has a long background from software companies and software is where Nokia is going, but it needs more knowledge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The challenges Nokia has faced in the last couple of years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;are related to software and Elop will bring his experience and contacts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tarmo Virki; Compiled by Hans Peters.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WARSAW, Sept 10 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) said it was to
invest $1 billion to build and expand data centres around the
world as as part of a wider effort to boost revenue from
emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; IBM, the world's largest IT services company, wants emerging
markets to make up a quarter of its revenue by 2015 and has
announced a string of new investments in places such as Egypt,
Argentina and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This  $1 billion plus multi-year campaign is twofold --
improve the design and technology used in client data centers
and expand geographic reach," IBM said on Friday when opening a
new centre in Wroclaw, southwestern Poland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM has been moving steadily away from its hardware
business, expanding its services arm, including providing
technology outsourcing, automation and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company did not provide a timeframe for the investment
target.

&lt;p&gt;* Names former IPO adviser James Wood-Collins as CEO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Founder Neil Record to remain as chairman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * CFO Sheriff formally named chief operating officer
LONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - UK currency management house
Record PLC (RECL.L) has appointed James Wood-Collins, a former
JP Morgan banker who advised on Record's flotation, as chief
executive to replace founder Neil Record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said on on Friday Wood-Collins would take over
from Record, who will remain as chairman, on Oct. 1. Record has 
held both roles since the company's initial public offering in
2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Record, an expert in UK public pension liabilities, will
continue to play an "active role" with clients, investment
consultants as well as maintaining his involvement with the
company's products and product development, it said.
[ID:nLDE64G2BC]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wood-Collins joined the company from J.P. Morgan Cazenove in
2008 and has led Record's client team since last December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In June, Record reported a 38 percent fall in full-year
pretax profit following a steep drop in performance fees as
clients left and its absolute return products struggled.
[ID:nLDE65E07W]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also said Chief Financial Officer Paul Sheriff
will officially take the position of chief operating officer, a
job he has been doing unofficially since August 2009 and Leslie
Hill will assume responsibility for leadership of the client
team, both starting Oct. 1.

&lt;p&gt;IBM Exclusive Reseller for Mojix STAR System in Japan
TOKYO--(Business Wire)--
IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Mojix today announced an exclusive distributorship agreement
and the launch of the Mojix STAR system in Japan. The Mojix product offering
coupled with software and support systems from IBM Japan unleashes this
breakthrough technology to deliver transformational RFID solutions to supply and
asset management across multiple industries in Japan. Under the arrangement IBM
will provide system integration services and customer support for Mojix product
offerings in the Japanese market. IBM Japan will distribute the Mojix STAR
system both directly to its customers as well as through qualified IBM resellers
in Japan. 

"The Mojix STAR system is enabling large enterprises to transform supply and
logistics management. This singular technology delivers the benefits of Real
Time Location Systems (RTLS) with the economics of pervasive low cost passive
RFID," said Mr. Kazutaka Kubota, Manager of Value Network Development, IBM
Japan. "When coupled with IBM Japan solution offerings, the system is poised to
deliver new levels of visibility, control and automation to supply chain
management across multiple industries in Japan, from consumer packaged goods,
third party logistics, and manufacturing, to finished goods, transportation and
many other sectors." 

"Mojix and IBM Japan share a common vision for ubiquitous visibility of good and
assets across the supply chain," said Dr. Ramin Sadr, CEO and Founder, Mojix
Inc. "We look forward to collaboration with IBM Japan enabling our mutual
customers to realize economically viable modernization of their supply chain." 

RFID Solutions for Business Visibility

Together IBM WebSphere Sensor Events and the Mojix STAR system enable the
deployment of end-to-end RFID solutions that deliver on-demand access to
business information in supply chains, optimally manage inventory, and keep
track of valuable assets in real time. The Mojix STAR system is certified for
IBM`s Ready for IBM WebSphere Sensor Events program delivering business
visibility for RFID Solutions by combining the power of IBM enterprise software
and the Mojix STAR system for large-scale, high-volume and economical RFID data
collection. IBM WebSphere Sensor Events integration enables a simple,
standards-based path for exploiting the Mojix STAR system`s revolutionary
functionality with enterprise class business visibility solutions. For example,
the Mojix STAR system supports IBM WebSphere Sensor Events Location Aware
Services (LAS) to visualize location events using passive RFID tag data
including both tag reads and location data on goods and assets. 

Mojix STAR System

The Mojix STAR system breaks through the economic and technical barriers to
ubiquitous RFID deployment, enabling organizations to deploy a single, cost
effective, EPC/ETSI/ISO standards based system to address the full spectrum of
supply chain management and real-time location and asset tracking needs. The
STAR system enables organizations to realize greater benefits from passive RFID,
and opens the door to ubiquitous visibility of goods and assets across the
supply chain.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The Amazon Defense Coalition issued the following response today to an article
that appeared today on Fortune.com about the oil contamination lawsuit against
Chevron, filed by Ecuadorians living in the contaminated area: 

Roger Parloff`s legal analysis in Fortune (Evidence of fraud mounts in
Ecuadorian suit against Chevron, September 13) is one-sided and fails to
adequately capture the enormous financial risk faced by Chevron in Ecuador, even
if one accepts his erroneous theory about fraud regarding an expert damage
assessment. Importantly, Parloff has never been to Ecuador, never examined the
200,000-page trial record, never seen an original lab report from the 64,000
sampling results at trial, never talked to any witnesses who have testified in
the case, and utterly fails to understand either the enormous quantum of
evidence or the procedural rules that govern trials in Chevron`s preferred forum
of Ecuador. 

Chevron Attacks Court, Not Content of Report

Parloff`s theory (and one adopted by several U.S. judges without expertise in
Ecuadorian law and procedure) is that ex parte contacts with or party
submissions to a court-appointed expert are improper and that therefore the
Ecuador damages assessment of $27 billion, prepared by court expert Richard
Cabrera, is somehow invalid. This is incorrect as a matter of fact and law.
Moreover, neither Parloff nor Chevron can point to even one aspect of the
Cabrera report that is not reasonable, scientifically sound, and based on the
evidence before the court. Given what we know from the BP disaster in the Gulf
and other large environmental clean-ups, the damages number in Ecuador is
actually modest when one considers the half-century of time that the extensive
contamination has been harming the rainforest and its tens of thousands of
inhabitants. 

Chevron Met Ex Parte &amp; Its Work Used in Court Reports

Parloff failed to fully explain that both parties before the Ecuador court have
cooperated with court-appointed experts throughout the case. Cabrera invited the
parties to give him information; this is memorialized in various court orders.
Chevron, for tactical reasons (apparently because it wanted to discredit the
court), chose to boycott the Cabrera process. But throughout the trial both
parties had ex parte contact with a variety of experts on various occasions and
often prepared materials for experts in whole or in part for adoption. This
includes Chevron`s contacts with court-appointed experts such as Gerardo Barros
and Jorge Bermeo, who did independent reports on various aspects of the damages.
Some of the independent court experts who prepared reports at Chevron`s request
either used or adopted materials that Chevron`s legal team (including U.S.
counsel and U.S. consulting experts) drafted - exactly the supposed "fraud" that
Chevron`s public relations machine falsely claims taints the trial. 

Manufactured Controversy Is a Sideshow

Much of the evidence that Parloff breathlessly reports that Chevron`s outside
counsel "discovered" has been known to the court in Ecuador and Chevron itself
for more than two years. This includes the fact that Cabrera was given (under
court order) thousands of pages from the plaintiffs for use in his report. The
manufactured controversy over the Cabrera report is a sideshow designed by
Chevron to fog up the issue of its own enormous liability in the face of
questions from several of its large institutional shareholders and analysts who
cover the oil industry. There are now more than 100 expert reports in evidence
before the Ecuador court, totaling tens of thousands of pages. An additional
damage assessment from each party is due September 16th; Chevron, which has
never been interested in the truth, has announced that it will boycott that
process and forego the submission of its own report. 

Plaintiffs In Strong Enforcement Position

The idea that Ecuador`s court must base damages only on the Cabrera report is
ludicrous. Under Ecuadorian law, the judge is not required to adopt any portion
of any expert report. Thus, for Chevron to focus its million-dollar U.S.
discovery strategy on the Cabrera report is increasingly futile. Parloff fails
to realize that even if an enforcement court in the U.S. or some other country
were to find contacts between a party and court experts to be improper, it would
not nullify a finding of liability and damages given the voluminous evidence
against Chevron and the numerous independent bases to impose liability and
damages -- including Chevron`s own technical reports, which prove the case of
the plaintiffs. Contrary to Parloff`s conclusion, that puts the Amazonian
plaintiffs in a very strong litigation position in an enforcement context. 

Chevron`s Abusive Litigation Causes More Suffering

Chevron faces an enormous liability in Ecuador because it deliberately and
indisputably discharged billions of gallons of toxic waste into the rainforest
over a 26-year period, decimating indigenous groups and poisoning the water
supply in an area the size of Rhode Island. Rather than deal with the evidence,
Chevron has unleashed a massive public relations assault on the Ecuador court
system, tried to sue lawyers for the plaintiffs, tried to intimidate
court-appointed experts into quitting the case and launched an abusive
collateral litigation strategy in U.S. federal courts to try to exhaust the
resources of the Amazonian communities. Lacking a real defense, Chevron has
tried to undermine the rule of law as part of "delay and distract" stratagem
that keeps tens of thousands of suffering people waiting decades for a
resolution of their claims. Chevron`s latest ploy was to recruit a journalist to
go undercover in Ecuador to spy on court personnel and the plaintiffs, who in
the past have been victimized with death threats and an attempted kidnapping.
Chevron`s behavior in the Ecuador trial is a textbook example of abusive
litigation. 

Chevron Turns Down Chance To Submit Its Own Damage Assessment

The Ecuador court order in early August allowed Chevron to submit its own
damages assessment. That should have been seen as a victory for the company. One
would think its lawyers would be grinning from ear to ear. Instead, the
company`s local counsel filed a motion to block the court`s order and hence the
company`s own ability to get what it always asked for - the right to go head to
head with Cabrera on a damages assessment. This is just the latest and most
obvious sign of the Chevron`s obstructionism. 

The Real Story is Chevron`s Fraud

Chevron`s problem in Ecuador is that it is losing the case based on the evidence
and that its own officials are under criminal indictment for fraud related to a
sham remediation. The real story is that the evidence convincingly demonstrates
that an American company went to a foreign nation and deliberately devastated
the Amazon rainforest environment out of greed. The destruction was done in
violation of Ecuadorian laws, industry standards, Chevron`s own operating
contract, and all sense of basic decency. Chevron`s allegations of "fraud" are
themselves part of an elaborate scheme to cover up the company`s pervasive
illegality in its Ecuador drilling operation and in its advocacy during the
trial.

&lt;p&gt; * Says new drugs could redeem rocky track record&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Cites need for more flexible RD budget&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Says external partnerships could stretch research gains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - The public has good reason to
look beyond Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) disappointing track record in
developing new medicines, the drugmaker's research chief told
investors on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mikael Dolsten, speaking at the Morgan Stanley Global
Healthcare Conference in New York, said the company would have
preferred more new drugs to have come out of its laboratories in
recent years. Few big-selling medicines have emerged from Pfizer's
labs since its Viagra anti-impotence pill was introduced in 1998,
despite the company's unmatched research budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Dolsten said people should not look through "eyes of the
past," but instead focus on the company's pipeline of experimental
drugs now making their way through clinical trials. They include
compounds to treat arthritis and Alzheimer's disease, and to
prevent strokes linked to irregular heartbeats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're building a coherent organization, allowing a diversity
of approaches" for success, he said, including an increasing focus
on biotechnology medicines that target proteins linked to specific
diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dolsten, former head of research for Wyeth, became co-head of
research at Pfizer when the larger company acquired Wyeth for $67
billion last October -- sharing responsibility with Pfizer veteran
Martin Mackay. But McKay left Pfizer just seven months later to
head research at rival AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), leaving Dolsten in
command of research for the world's largest drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McKay's unexpected departure underscored the often-told
difficulties of consolidating research efforts from mega-mergers
of drugmakers with different product lines and cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dolsten on Monday noted that Pfizer and other big
pharmaceutical companies traditionally have earmarked 15 to 20
percent of annual company revenue to research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Pfizer spent $2.19 billion on research and development in the
second quarter, amounting to about 13 percent of its $17.3 billion
in quarterly revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Dolsten said the company needs to be more flexible about its
level of RD spending, and that the traditional industry research
spending formula should not be carved into stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By relying more on external research partnerships, such as
with biotechs and universities, Dolsten said Pfizer could amplify
its research and development output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's depressed share price, however, reflects investor
doubts whether the company can indeed finally revive its research
labs, which faltered badly after its earlier mega-mergers over the
past decade with U.S. rivals Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the meantime, Pfizer is counting on cost savings from its
latest mega-deal and Wyeth's vaccines and biotech drugs to keep
its earnings fairly intact when Pfizer's $11 billion-a-year
Lipitor cholesterol fighter begins facing U.S. generic competition
late next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)

&lt;p&gt;VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Human trafficking groups have exploited Canada's visa rules to bring victims from Europe and Asia to work in the illegal sex trade, according to a police study released on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada is also used as a transit route for victims, mostly women, who are transported to the United States for work as prostitutes, according to a threat assessment released by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RCMP report says there is also sex-trade trafficking within Canada, and recent convictions have mostly involved victims who were Canadian citizens or had permanent resident status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report, which studied Canadian police investigations from 2005 to 2009, acknowledged that authorities are hampered by a lack of intelligence information and poor public awareness about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying victims as they enter the country is difficult because many do not realize they will be exploited after they arrive, even if they know they are coming to work in the sex trade, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffickers use businesses such as escort services as fronts to hide their activities. Prostitution per se is not illegal in Canada, but it is illegal to live off the earnings of prostitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human trafficking, which involves the transporting of people for the purpose of exploiting them, is illegal and the Canadian government announced last week it was planning to crack down on the crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet is sometimes used to lure victims who are then kept under the trafficker's control by fears of reprisal or the victim's own drug addictions, investigators said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffickers from Eastern Europe have taken advantage of the visa exemptions Canada has granted some countries, and will use fraudulent documents from them to ease transporting women across the border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel, Estonia, Latvia and Korea are among the countries whose passports have been exploited by traffickers bringing foreign nationals into Canada for sex-trade work, according to the RCMP's analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The different visa requirements for entry into Canada and the U.S. may result in migrants legally entering Canada with visa-exempt status and then seeking to illegally enter the U.S.," the report also said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sex-trade traffickers also recruit women within Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A majority of Asian sex-trade workers found in Canadian bawdy houses raided by the police had entered the country using visitor or student visas, some of which had expired, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators said they have evidence of Canadian women being trafficked to U.S. cities such as Las Vegas, but have not determined yet if a specific criminal network is responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting Allan Dowd; editing by Rob Wilson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights: Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) as the Bull of
the Day and Kirkland's (Nasdaq: KIRK) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS), Royal
Bank of Scotland Group plc (NYSE: RBS) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) looks forward to widening its market share through
its accelerated product transformation plan: "One Ford." 

Incorporating key objectives such as shifting focus from trucks to small cars,
delivering more vehicles from fewer core platforms and implementing cost
reduction efforts, the plan continues to have a favorable impact on the stock.
In 2009, the plan already turned in a profit after 4 years. Furthermore, it
helped the automaker gain market share in the U.S. 

In addition, favorable net pricing and improved Ford Credit results are driving
Ford's earnings. We also expect the company to benefit significantly from its
focus on emerging markets. These factors have led us to continue with our
Outperform recommendation on the stock with a target price of $14. 

Bear of the Day: 

Kirkland's (Nasdaq: KIRK) reported meager second-quarter 2010 results with
earnings of $0.16, which was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.02. The
company's susceptibility to the global economic downturn coupled with stiff
competition, severely undermines the company's future growth prospects and
profitability. 

The global economic environment has been challenging for the past fifteen
months. Declining real estate value, reduced lending by banks, solvency concerns
of major financial institutions, increase in unemployment levels and significant
volatility in the global financial markets have negatively impacted the level of
consumer spending for discretionary items. 

The company s sales are also highly dependent on its ability to anticipate and
respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer demands in a timely manner.
Any slackness in doing so would spoil the company's image with its customers
thereby reducing customer traffic which in turn would finally affect revenues
and margins.

Goldman Fined $27M by UK Authority

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) has been fined &#163;17.5 million ($27 million)
for its failure to comply with the principles of the U.K. Financial Services
Authority (FSA). 

FSA has fined Goldman`s London-based unit Goldman Sachs International for not
satisfying UK regulatory reporting obligations. Goldman Sachs International
failed to disclose to the U.K. authorities about the scrutiny being carried out
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on one of its London-based
executives in connection with the Abacus 2007-AC1 synthetic collateralized debt
obligation (Abacus). 

SEC Charges

SEC claimed that Goldman Sachs created an investment vehicle named Abacus
2007-AC1, comprising subprime mortgage-backed securities. It was created just at
the onset of the housing bubble bursting. 

The investors were informed by Goldman that the mortgage bonds would be selected
by an independent manager. However, according to SEC charges, Goldman asked its
client Paulson &amp; Co. to select those mortgage bonds that they believed were most
likely to decline in value. 

Once the Abacus portfolios declined as they were bound to, European banks and
other investors lost more than $1 billion, while Paulson made money from the
bets against the mortgage bonds. 

Companies like ABN Amro and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, a German bank, made
huge investments in Abacus and incurred severe losses. Ultimately, IKB received
a government support while Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc (NYSE: RBS) acquired
ABN Amro. 

The UK Connection

The Abacus product, though structured by Goldman`s US affiliate, was partly
marketed from UK by Goldman Sachs International to institutional investors. The
executive in question, Fabrice Tourre, was a part of the US team that structured
this product. He was later transferred to Goldman`s UK unit in London and became
an FSA-approved person in November 2008. 

In August 2008, SEC started investigating Goldman`s US unit over the Abacus and
following its investigation, SEC served a Wells Notice to Goldman`s US unit and
Fabrice Tourre, alleging significant violations of the US securities law. 

Typically a Wells notice is, in effect, an indication from the SEC staff that
they intend to recommend that the SEC has filed an enforcement action against
the person or entity to whom the notice is addressed. 

However, despite the involvement of the UK unit and the FSA approved personnel
Fabrice Tourre in the marketing of the product, this information regarding the
Wells Notice was not shared with the FSA. As a result, Mr. Tourre continued
working with the UK unit. 

The FSA was rather disappointed with the omission despite the fact that a number
of senior executives at Goldman Sachs International in London knew about
Tourre`s Wells notice. 

SEC Settlement

In July, Goldman Sachs agreed to settle the SEC lawsuit for $550 million. The
settlement involved a civil penalty of $535 million and required Goldman to pay
$15 million of profits from the Abacus deal. However, Mr. Tourre has denied the
allegations. 

FSA Settlement

Finally, Goldman agreed to the &#163;17.5 million ($27 million) settlement with the
FSA. Since the FSA investigation did not find Goldman`s UK unit to intentionally
withhold any information and since the company had fully cooperated with the
authority, agreeing for an early settlement, it was given a 30% discount from
the maximum fine; otherwise, it would have had to pay &#163;25 million. 

FSA has intensified its regulatory scrutiny activities over the past couple of
years following criticism over its role prior to the financial crisis. In June,
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) had been fined &#163;33.3 million for mishandling
clients` money by not separating their funds securely from its own available
liquidity. 

Our Take

Such run-ins with financial authorities could shatter investors` confidence,
even when -- or especially when -- giants like Goldman are involved. Such issues
are also likely to cast a shadow over the financials of the company. 

However, Goldman maintains a well managed global franchise with a strong capital
base and a leading position in investment banking, capital markets, trading and
asset management business. We also believe that with the recovery of the U.S.
economy, the company should experience improvements in credit spreads. 

Goldman currently carries a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold), implying no clear directional
pressure on the stocks over the next one to three months.

&lt;p&gt;Bogus Lab Tests, Threats against Plaintiffs Counsel, Ex Parte Meetings with
Judge Paint Nasty Picture of Oil Giant`s Litigation Tactics
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Evidence of fraud by Chevron is mounting in Ecuador, dealing the oil giant a
potentially crippling blow as it faces a potential multi-billion judgment for
environmental damage, representatives of the Amazonian communities asserted
today. 

In a series of recent court filings in federal courts across the United States,
the Ecuadorians suing Chevron for oil contamination in the Amazon rainforest
have demonstrated the oil company faces an increasing array of problems, among
them:

* Diego Borja, a Chevron contractor in Ecuador, ran a "dirty tricks" operation
for the oil giant in Ecuador that attempted to ensnare the trial judge in a
corruption scandal, according to taped phone conversations. 
* Borja claimed that Chevron had "cooked" court evidence and that he would turn
against Chevron if company officials did not pay him what they promised for
videotapes he made of the judge in the lawsuit. Widely covered by the news
media, the videotapes were later discredited. 
* Chevron hired Kroll, the publicly traded investigations firm, to try to pay an
American journalist to become an undercover spy for the company in Ecuador,
according to a recent article in The Atlantic. 
* Chevron`s lawyers had ex parte meetings with judges and have not denied having
ex parte meetings with court-appointed experts on the case - the exact same
basis for Chevron`s false claims of "fraud" against lawyers for the plaintiffs. 
* The plaintiffs also produced evidence that a court-appointed expert adopted
many materials wholesale that were prepared by Chevron`s own expert without
citation - the exact same charge that Chevron has leveled against the
plaintiffs. 
* Two Chevron officials are under criminal indictment in Ecuador for, according
to the charges, conspiring to defraud the government by lying about the results
of a sham remediation in the mid-1990s. Chevron`s own tests submitted into
evidence show illegal levels of contamination at the so-called "remediated"
sites. 
* Due to a series of death threats from unknown sources, lawyers for the
plaintiffs and their families are now protected with armed bodyguards.

Chevron is arguing in various jurisdictions around the country that any ex parte
meetings between the plaintiffs and a court-appointed expert prove "fraud,"
though they have failed to cite any order, rule, regulation, or law prohibiting
such meetings under Ecuadorian court procedures. Legal experts in both Ecuador
and in the United States have disagreed with Chevron`s argument. 

"Chevron has not denied that its own lawyers met with court experts and has yet
to deny the evidence that its lawyers met ex parte with judges in the lawsuit,"
said Ilann Maazel, an American who is representing the Ecuadorians. "Why can
Chevron meet ex parte with judges, but plaintiffs can not meet with an expert?
This is hypocrisy with a capital "H". 

"Chevron`s true complaint is not with the Ecuadorian courts, but with the
evidence of its own wrongdoing," Maazel said. 

Originally filed in the U.S. in 1993, Chevron requested the case be moved to
Ecuador. Now that a decision is approaching and the evidence points to its
culpability, Chevron is attempting to retry the lawsuit in the same U.S. court
system it once rejected as inappropriate. 

In a brief submitted to the Southern District Court of New York last week,
attorneys for the Ecuadorians argued that Chevron had conducted ex parte
meetings with court-appointed experts and that one of them, Gerado Barros,
copied entire pages of a 2005 Chevron report into his expert report, entitled
Pr&#225;cticas y Reglamentos Internacionales Para el Uso y la Remediaci&#243;n de Piscinas
de Campos Petroleros. Barros is one of several experts who have written about
100 reports, in total, that the court may rely on as evidence in the case. The
majority of the reports show illegal levels of contamination, even at sites
allegedly "remediated" by Texaco. 

The plaintiffs assert that adopting materials directly from reports is not
inappropriate, as long as the court-appointed expert is in agreement with the
materials or is using them to explain or make a point. Such practice is common
in U.S. courts, Maazel said. 

Maazel said Chevron has yet to identify an "order, rule regulation, or law
prohibiting" contact with experts. 

Penn State law professor Catherine Rogers, a scholar of international
arbitration and professional ethics, wrote on Opiniojuris.org, a well-respected
online legal forum, that Ecuadorian "standards for the impartiality of
court-appointed experts may treat such attendance (ex parte meetings) as
acceptable, and perhaps not even necessary to disclose....."

year, another change in the top ranks of its asset management
division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eileen Rominger, the global chief investment officer of

Goldman's asset management division. She joined Goldman in
1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She will not be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The announcement of her departure comes as Goldman on
Friday named Jim O'Neill to the role of chairman of asset
management. O'Neill, based in London, headed global economics,
commodities and strategy research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's asset management arm has experienced rapid growth
over the past decade, managing $802 billion as of June 30,
nearly double the assets it managed in 2004. But the unit has
reported outflows in recent quarters, in line with broader
industry trends.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/f481c4/petroleum_refining) has
announced the addition of the "Petroleum Refining " report to their offering. 

About 150 petroleum refineries operate in the US, owned by about 90 companies,
with combined annual revenue of about $700 billion. Large refiners include
Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Valero, and BP's US-based subsidiaries.
Annual revenue fluctuates substantially because of the shifting price of crude
oil. The industry is concentrated: the eight largest refiners hold about 60
percent of all US refining capacity. 

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

Demand is driven by US consumption of gas and diesel fuel. The profitability of
refineries depends on efficient operations and the best mixture of products.
Although there are significant economies of scale in refinery operations, a
small refinery can compete effectively with large ones if it's located in a
favorable market area, or if it produces specialty products that are in high
demand. The industry is highly automated: average annual revenue per worker is
over $7 million. 

PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS &amp; TECHNOLOGY 

Major products are gas, 50 percent by volume; diesel fuel, 20 percent; and jet
fuel, 9 percent. Diesel fuel and heating oil are jointly called "distillates." A
refinery uses crude oil as raw material. The output of a particular refinery
depends on the grade of crude oil it uses and the downstream processing
operations it has installed. 

Refineries come in many different sizes, from 5,000 barrels per calendar day
(BBL/CD) of distillation capacity up to 500,000. A typical refinery has a
capacity of about 125,000 BBL/CD.

&lt;p&gt; * Head of global fixed income defects to JP Morgan-sources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Gartside to remain at Schroders until year end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Schroders' (SDR.L) head of
global fixed income is to move to rival JP Morgan (JPM.N),
sources said, where he will run assets many times larger than
his existing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schroders said in a statement that Nick Gartside would be
leaving at the end of the year, while sources close to Schroders
and JP Morgan said he is headed to the U.S. banking group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Schroders he ran funds with assets of around 2.2 billion
pounds ($3.4 billion), a small part of the firm's 164 billion in
funds under management, while JP Morgan is one of the world's
largest fixed income managers with around $800 billion globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gartside's own funds have had a mixed run of late, up 6
percent on average but underperforming rival funds by an average
of 1.4 percentage points since the beginning of the year. His
160 million pound Strategic Bond fund was underperforming peers
by 4.6 percentage points over the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His responsibilities and management of the funds will be
split between the existing team that he currently heads,
Schroders said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gartside's move follows in the footsteps of Bob Michele,
former global head of fixed income at Schroders who moved to JP
Morgan in 2008, where he is currently global chief investment
officer of fixed income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman at JP Morgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schroders has seen strong inflows of new money this year but
Gartside's move follows more high profile departures earlier in
the year. [ID:nLDE6731OI]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In May, two top performing equity fund managers, Nick Purves
and Ian Lance -- who ran the 1.5 billion pound ($2.2 billion)
Schroder Income fund LP60011119, left to join rival firm RWC
Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One month later, Schroders said it had acquired a 49 percent
stake in RWC. [ID:nLDE65L1QX]

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday that the European Union was dragging its feet in talks on scrapping visas and warned that the delay was already hurting relations with its biggest trading partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has repeatedly said that clinching a deal on visa-free travel is one of its top priorities in relations with the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some EU members are worried that scrapping visas for Russians could spark a surge of illegal immigration from Russia and other former Soviet republics whose citizens already have the right to travel to Russia without a visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One problem which I would say is becoming unseemly for our level of our relations is the foot-dragging on the move to a visa-free (travel) regime," Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is already creating real problems for the development of our relations," Lavrov said. He added that fears about illegal immigration were unfounded and said the EU needed to make a political decision as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russians, most of whom consider themselves as part of a wider European culture, say visa rules are one of the most frustrating aspects of their dealings with the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European officials say privately that visa-free travel with Russia is a matter of time but that there are serious divisions between member states on what measures need to be implemented before a deal could become reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Union, for which tourism generates over 5 percent of gross domestic product each year, has reported soaring numbers of tourists from countries such as Russia, India, China and Brazil over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russians were the ninth biggest spenders on international travel in 2009, spending $20.8 billion, according to the World Tourism Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options Investment Pioneer Leaves Legacy of Commitment to Investors
CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Gateway Investment Advisers, LLC, a registered investment adviser since 1977
with over $7 billion in assets under management, announced today that its
founder and chairman, Walter G. Sall, is retiring effective year-end 2010. Sall,
a pioneer in the use of options in investment strategies, spent his career
striving to make sophisticated options strategies more widely available to the
investing public. His success can be measured by the impressive growth of the
$4.4 billion Gateway Fund, the firm`s flagship mutual fund, which has quadrupled
in size over the past decade. 

"Walter`s foresight and invaluable guidance have contributed greatly to
Gateway`s position of strength today," said J. Patrick Rogers, president and
chief executive officer of Gateway Investment Advisers and co-portfolio manager
of the Gateway Fund. "We wish Walter all the best in his retirement years,
knowing that he has left the fund in good hands with strong prospects for future
growth." 

Mr. Sall`s departure from Gateway will have no effect on day-to-day money
management operations at the firm, including management of the Gateway Fund. In
February 2008, Gateway was acquired by Natixis Global Asset Management (NGAM),
an international multi-boutique manager, which distributes the Gateway Fund
through financial intermediaries via its proprietary distribution network. As
with NGAM`s other affiliates, Gateway will continue to operate autonomously. 

"By agreeing to merge Gateway with Natixis Global Asset Management in 2008,
Walter helped us further our efforts to provide innovative investment solutions
aimed at helping individual investors build and preserve wealth," said John
Hailer, president and chief executive officer of Natixis Global Asset
Management, US and Asia, and head of Natixis Global Associates US and
International distribution. "We wish Walter well as he prepares for a very
well-deserved retirement."

&lt;p&gt; * People not hurt by the fire&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Supplies to Malpensa airport near Milan may be cut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MILAN, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil's (XOM.N) Sarpom
refinery in Italy is operating at 30-40 percent capacity after a
bigger crude distillation unit was shut following a fire on
Saturday, the refinery's spokesman said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was too early to say when the unit could be back on
stream because magistrates who have opened an investigation into
the cause of the fire would decide when it could be restarted,
Sarpom's Rino Lentini said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We hope to be able to restart the unit as soon as possible
once it has been repaired and its safety is ensured," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People were not hurt by the fire which broke out at Sarpom's
major atmospheric distillation unit at 8.43 a.m. (0743 GMT) on
Saturday and it was put quickly out at 9.20 a.m., Lentini said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarpom, which refines about 7 million tonnes of crude oil a
year, was meeting its sales contracts in full "for now" drawing
on its stocks, but needed to evaluate the damage to see for how
long it would be able to meet all obligations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International airport of Malpensa near Italy's financial
centre Milan was a vulnerable client, Lentini said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We cannot guarantee the full flow of deliveries as when we
have 100 percent of capacity," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Half of Malpensa's jet fuel supplies come from Sarpom and
the rest is covered by Sannazzaro refinery owned by Italy's oil
and gas major Eni (ENI.MI), he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarpom refinery near Milan is 74.1 percent owned by Exxon
Mobil and 25.9 percent by Italy's refiner ERG (ERG.MI).

&lt;p&gt;  AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS, Sep 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBC2010, Stand #4.B84 - Verimatrix, the specialist in securing and
enhancing revenue for multi-screen digital TV services around the globe,
today announced it has licensed Microsoft PlayReady Server technology in
order to provide integrated MultiRights(TM) support for devices that
support Microsoft PlayReady digital rights management (DRM). As a
component of the Verimatrix Video Content Authority System (VCAS(TM)) 3,
the company's MultiRights(TM) framework enables transparent rights
management across a range of networks and devices for streamlined
multi-network and multi-screen video services. 

    Microsoft PlayReady is the latest DRM technology that Verimatrix is
supporting through its MultiRights strategy. Under a common unified VCAS
3 security solution, Verimatrix's digital TV operators can extend their
multi-screen services to a wide range of platforms and devices, including
those that support Microsoft Silverlight. PlayReady technology is
currently protecting content for several top service providers including
Netflix, BSkyB's Sky Player, Yahoo! Japan and Canal+ among others.
Furthermore, the Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem (DECE) selected
PlayReady as one of the DRM technologies it will support.

    "We are pleased to work with Verimatrix, a leader in the digital TV
security market, to extend VCAS support to the base of PlayReady
devices," said Garrett Glanz, senior director of the Media Platforms
Business, Microsoft Corp. "The number of manufacturers and service
providers that have selected PlayReady to enable part of their service
strategy is exponentially increasing and companies like Verimatrix can
help service providers further extend the reach of their
PlayReady-enabled services."

    MultiRights mediates different DRM technologies on multiple networks and
devices through a single set of VCAS subscriber entitlements interfaces
and Web services APIs. Verimatrix's single content authority and
entitlement process is able to deliver licenses in whatever DRM format
the requesting user device requires. The company's core architecture,
VCAS 3, addresses the new video marketplace with a proactive revenue
security and enhancement approach for IPTV, DVB broadcast, hybrid, and
over-the-top (OTT) networks, including standards-based security for
Internet TV delivery on PC, phone, tablet, and set-top box devices.
Whatever network transition and evolution challenges are awaiting
operators, VCAS 3 can help optimize operational costs, expand device
footprint, and cast a wider net with their service offerings.

    "As operators map out their TV Everywhere strategies, they find that our
MultiRights solution significantly streamlines the OPEX and CAPEX of
their revenue security platform by providing a single security head-end,"
said Steve Oetegenn, chief sales and marketing officer, Verimatrix.
"PlayReady DRM is a natural choice for us to support our customers and we
look forward to growing our market share."

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Horizon Fails, Tally Hits 119

Following a lull in bank failures for the last week of August and the first week
of September, U.S. regulators last Friday shuttered Bradenton, Florida-based
Horizon Bank, pushing up U.S. bank failures to 119 so far in 2010. This compares
with a total number of 140 bank failures in 2009, 25 in 2008 and just 3 in 2007.


While the bigger banks benefited greatly from the various programs launched by
the government, many smaller banks are still weak. Tumbling home prices, soaring
loan defaults and a high unemployment rate continue to take their toll on such
institutions. Failure of both residential and commercial real estate loans as a
result of the credit crisis has primarily hurt banks. 

With the industry absorbing bad loans made during the credit explosion, the
trouble in the banking system has worsened, increasing the possibility of more
bank failures. Economic threats emanating from the European debt crisis, the
impact of tighter regulations of the new financial reform law and weak economic
growth data further add to the concerns. 

Horizon Bank had total assets of about $187.8 million and total deposits of
about $164.6 million as of June 30. 

This recent failure represents another blow to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) fund meant for protecting customer accounts, as it has been
appointed receiver for the bank. 

The FDIC insures deposits in 7,830 banks and savings associations in the country
and promotes the safety and soundness of these institutions. When a bank fails,
the FDIC reimburses customers for deposits of up to $250,000 per account. 

Though the FDIC managed to shore up its deposit insurance fund during the last
couple of quarters, the outbreak of bank failures has tested its limits. As of
June 30, 2010, the fund remained in the red with a deficit of $15.2 billion. 

The failed Horizon Bank is expected to cost the FDIC about $58.9 million. 

Little Rock, Arkansas-based Bank of the Ozarks has assumed all of the deposits
and assets of the failed bank. Bank of the Ozarks did not pay the FDIC a premium
for the deposits of Horizon Bank. Additionally, the FDIC and Bank of the Ozarks
have agreed to share losses on $150.4 million of Horizon Bank's assets. 

In the second quarter of 2010, the number of banks on the FDIC's list of problem
institutions grew to 829 from 775 in the previous quarter and 416 in the
year-ago quarter. This is the highest since the savings and loan crisis in the
early 1990s. 

Banks that feature on the problem list are most likely to fail, though some may
still scrape through. As of now, only about 13% of banks on the FDIC's problem
list have actually failed. What is interesting is that this percentage is likely
to change; though the problem list is growing at a slower pace, bank failures
are accelerating. 

Increasing loan losses on commercial real estate are expected to cause hundreds
more bank failures in the next few years. The FDIC expects bank failures to cost
about $60 billion over the next four years. 

The failure of Washington Mutual in 2008 was the largest in U.S. banking
history. It was acquired by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM). The other major
acquirers of failed institutions since 2008 include Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq:
FITB), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), Zions Bancorp (Nasdaq: ZION), PNC Financial
Services Group Inc. (NYSE: PNC),among others.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM Corp has been known to revel in its image as the most boring technology company. But Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano took that a step further when he used a rare public appearance to tell his Silicon Valley rivals they should consider being more boring themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palmisano in particular took several swipes at computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co, questioning everything from its acquisition strategy to its technology investment levels and its recent handling of the exit of former CEO Mark Hurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said on Tuesday that Hurd's exit package -- estimated at about $34.6 million -- was a mistake, especially since Hurd very quickly joined rival Oracle Corp after departing amid a scandal related to allegations of sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They spent a lot of money to keep him for an hour," the executive said in response to a question at the Wall Street Journal Viewpoints Executive Breakfast. "That to me was not handled in the best interests of shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executive also questioned HP's recent flurry of acquisition, including deals to buy data storage company 3Par Inc for $2.4 billion and security technology company ArcSight Inc for $1.5 billion. He said IBM makes its acquisitions at "reasonable valuations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'd never do a 3Par or the one (ArcSight) yesterday. We don't have to," Palmisano said, noting that 3Par had traded at $18 a share before HP agreed to pay $33 a share for the company to win a bidding war with Dell Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of making flashy acquisitions, Palmisano said IBM makes sure it sticks with its policy of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I understand this is boring and old-fashioned," said the executive, who joked that he would never get the HP CEO job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also defended IBM's policy of not providing mid-quarter earnings updates, saying he focused on the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palmisano said he respects Oracle's high level of investment in new technologies. He was much less worried about competing against HP because that company does not invest enough in research and instead depends on reselling products of partners such as Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're pushing technology you will get returns," Palmisano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to their latest quarterly reports, HP invested 2.4 percent of its revenue in research and development (RD) while IBM invested about 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP declined to respond to the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palmisano also said he was glad IBM had sold its personal computer business to Lenovo several years ago because of the declining profit margins in PCs. Retail prices have fallen to the extent PCs can sell for as low as $400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't even cover advertising and support at $400," he said. Asked if the PC business was over Palmisano said: "It ended three or four years ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, he said IBM focuses on investing overseas and building its technology services business by placing employees in growing markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palmisano said IBM is looking to benefit from growth in economies such as China and India, and also cited Vietnam and Egypt as countries where IBM sees a lot of promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the executive said he had made little progress with the Obama administration in his discussions with officials about what would be good for business. In particular, the executive criticized the government's policies on exports, saying that exports were key to future growth of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palmisano, who turned 59 in July, said he was not "going anywhere" when asked if he would retire when he reaches 60. But in a slight effort to balance his criticisms, he also made fun of the flamboyance of his performance at the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You see why they don't let me out very often," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares closed down 76 cents, or 0.58 percent, at $128.85 on New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Gabriel Madway in San Francisco; editing by Stephen Orlofsky and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I understand this is boring and old-fashioned," said the

partners such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you're pushing technology you will get returns,"
Palmisano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to their latest quarterly reports, HP invested

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Brett Olsher, the

acquisitions at Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) until late July,
has left for Goldman Sachs (GS.N), a Deutsche spokeswoman said

report on The Wall Street Journal's website. He will join in
December, one added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Olsher joined Deutsche in 2001 as global head of metals and
mining and became global co-head of MA in 2008 alongside

opportunity that the sellers provided," said Craig King, president and CEO of J.
P. King Auction Company. "We had a great turnout and great results for our
sellers and buyers, which is the definition of what an auction can do - bring
satisfying prices for both sides of a sale."

September, with a ranch, a bank portfolio, waterfront condos and a 216-acre
island to be sold later this month. For additional information on upcoming

&lt;p&gt; * Says HP did not handle Hurd departure well&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says IBM would "never do a 3Par" type acquisition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Sees growth in Egypt, Vietnam as well as China, India&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sinead Carew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) has been known to
revel in its image as the most boring company in technology.
But Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano took that a step further
on Tuesday when he used a rare public appearance to lob sharp
criticism at high-profile Silicon Valley rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Palmisano in particular took several swipes at
Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), questioning everything from its
acquisition strategy to its technology investment levels and
its recent handling of the exit of former CEO Mark Hurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Hurd's exit package -- estimated at about $34.6
million [ID:nN0995681] -- was a mistake, especially since Hurd
very quickly joined rival Oracle ORCL.O after departing amid
a scandal related to allegations of sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They spent a lot of money to keep him for an hour," the
executive said in response to a question at the Wall Street
Journal Viewpoints Executive Breakfast. "That to me was not
handled in the best interests of shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The executive also questioned HP's recent flurry of
acquisition, including deals to buy data storage company 3Par
Inc (PAR.N) for $2.4 billion and security technology company
ArcSight ARST.O for $1.5 billion. He said IBM makes its
acquisitions at "reasonable valuations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We'd never do a 3Par or the one (ArcSight) yesterday. We
don't have to," Palmisano said, noting that 3Par had traded at
$18 a share before HP agreed to pay $33 a share for the company
to win a bidding war with Dell Inc DELL.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of making flashy acquisitions, Palmisano said IBM
makes sure it sticks with its policy of returning value to
shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I understand this is boring and old-fashioned," said the
executive, who joked that he would never get the HP CEO job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also defended IBM's policy of not providing mid-quarter
earnings updates, saying he focused on the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Palmisano said he respects Oracle's high level of
investment in new technologies. He was much less worried about
competing against HP because that company does not invest
enough in research and instead depends on reselling products of
partners such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you're pushing technology you will get returns,"
Palmisano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to their latest quarterly reports, HP invested
2.4 percent of its revenue in research and development (RD)
while IBM invested about 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Palmisano also said he was glad IBM had sold its personal
computer business to Lenovo several years ago because of the
declining profit margins in PCs. Retail prices have fallen to
the extent PCs can sell for as low as $400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You can't even cover advertising and support at $400," he
said. Asked if the PC business was over Palmisano said: "It
ended three or four years ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, he said IBM focuses on investing overseas and
building its technology services business by placing employees
in growing markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Palmisano said IBM is looking to benefit from growth in
economies such as China and India, and also cited Vietnam and
Egypt as countries where IBM sees a lot of promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the executive said he had made little progress
with the Obama administration in his discussions with officials
about what would be good for business. In particular, the
executive criticized the government's policies on exports,
saying that exports were key to future growth of the United
States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Palmisano, who turned 59 in July, said he was not "going
anywhere" when asked if he would retire when he reaches 60. But
in a slight effort to balance his criticisms, he also made fun
of the flamboyance of his performance at the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You see why they don't let me out very often," he said.

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BC, Sep 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
BroadMotion today announced support of its JPEG2000 decoding technology
for the NVIDIA Fermi-based Quadro(R) and Tesla(TM) professional graphics
processing units (GPUs). By also leveraging the NVIDIA CUDA(TM) parallel
computing architecture, BroadMotion's technology is able to decode
digital cinema compliant 2K JPEG2000 streams at more than 24 frames per
second (fps), achieving real-time results by utilizing the latest NVIDIA
professional GPUs. The decoding technology is currently available to
select customers and will be widely available in the first quarter of
2011.

    "We have had our sights set on GPU technology for several years," said
Jeff Brooks, president of BroadMotion. "By demonstrating our ability to
decode real-time 2K streams, we have proven that digital cinema
technology can be achieved in a cost-effective GPU configuration. In
future releases, we are targeting all decoding resolutions and frame
rates in the digital cinema specification, namely 2K48fps, 4K24fps and
4K48fps on a wide variety of NVIDIA GPUs; thus enabling cost-effective
digital cinema solutions on standard computing parts."

    "BroadMotion has made a strategic, smart choice for its current and
future customers by utilizing CUDA technology and our GPUs to accelerate
its latest decoding solutions," said Andrew Cresci, general manager,
vertical market solutions, NVIDIA. "JPEG2000 decoding technology,
especially at digital cinema resolutions, requires significant processing
power, a perfect fit for the massively parallel processing power that
NVIDIA delivers."

    JPEG2000 is the next-generation International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) still image and video compression standard. In
2005, it was adopted by Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI) as the format
for the storage and distribution of motion pictures. JPEG2000 addresses
several weaknesses inherent in existing video formats by providing
improved visual fidelity at high compression rates, low latency,
increased error resiliency in wireless network environments and
multi-resolution decoding from a single source file. JPEG2000 is
currently being deployed in digital cinema, HD broadcast production,
wireless transport of in-home entertainment and video surveillance
applications.

    About BroadMotion

&lt;p&gt; * CFO: U.S. debit about 16 percent of revenue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Law expected to have greater impact on PIN debit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares trading up 2.9 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Maria Aspan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) expects a
major regulatory reform law to affect less than 16 percent of
its net revenue, Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt told
investors on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares rose more than 3 percent before falling back to
trade up 2.9 percent at $67.36 after Pollitt gave investors
more clarity on the company's sources of debit revenue at a
Barclays (BARC.L) Capital conference on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A provision in the Dodd-Frank law will restrict the fees
that merchants pay banks and transaction processing networks
every time a consumer pays with a debit card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa, the world's largest credit- and debit-card
transaction processing network, has seen its shares lose more
than 20 percent since the law's provision was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just over 20 percent of Visa's net revenue comes from
processing debit card transactions, Pollitt said, with about 16
percent coming from U.S. debit card transaction processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa believes the law will have greater restrictions on PIN
debit transactions, where consumers have to enter a PIN number
to authorize a purchase instead of signing a receipt, Pollitt
said. PIN debit accounts for about one-third of Visa's U.S.
debit business, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa and other transaction processing companies are in
discussions with the Federal Reserve, which will have to pass
rules to fully implement the debit fee restrictions next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the Fed has not "clarified its thinking" yet or
explained the ways it intends to restrict debit processing
fees, Pollitt said.

&lt;p&gt;Convert Paper Documents into Electronic Files for Management in SharePoint
GREENWOOD VILLAGE, Colo.--(Business Wire)--
Digitech Systems, the principle capture technology provider to high-volume
scanning centers around the world, is embracing Microsoft SharePoint. The
Company announced today that they have optimized PaperVision Capture for use
with Microsoft SharePoint. 

PaperVision Capture allows businesses to scan paper documents, convert them to
an electronic format, and index them for secure storage, management and
retrieval within their SharePoint installation. PaperVision Capture also exports
scanned information to a wide variety of other Enterprise Content Management
(ECM) systems including Digitech Systems` PaperVision&#174; Enterprise software or
their SaaS ECM service, ImageSilo&#174;. 

As businesses convert to managing information in electronic formats, many are
struggling to understand how to enhance processes-like AP/AR and human
resources-that are still largely paper-based. Experts indicate that paper usage
is rising by around 20% every year, with the average office worker using
approximately 50 sheets of paper every day1, making it critical that this
information be considered in every company`s overall information management
plan. 

"Historically, integrating paper documents with a SharePoint system has been
difficult," says Rai Wasner, Managing Director at Kollabria, a leading ECM
analyst firm. -PaperVision Capture is the first well-established scanning
technology to make it easy to integrate paper documents with Microsoft
SharePoint. It`s a must for any organization looking to fully leverage ECM
across all critical business information." 

PaperVision Capture makes it easy to convert paper documents to electronic files
that can be managed and secured within the SharePoint system. Once uploaded, the
documents are available to all of the sites and communities that the SharePoint
implementation serves. 

"Traditionally, liberating critical information from paper documents has been a
challenge," said HK Bain, Chief Executive Officer of Digitech Systems.
"PaperVision Capture converts paper information to a digital format that can be
loaded directly to an organization`s SharePoint implementation. It improves
paper information management exponentially, thereby expanding control of
sensitive data and speeding up processes throughout the business. We intend to
be the King Daddy of data capture for SharePoint installations." 

About Digitech Systems, Inc.

Digitech Systems, Inc. enables businesses of any size to more effectively and
securely manage, retrieve and store corporate information of any kind using
either PaperVision Enterprise Content Management (ECM) software or the world`s
most trusted SaaS ECM service, ImageSilo. By significantly reducing the cost,
Digitech Systems has moved ECM from a luxury convenience to an essential element
for every well-managed business. 

Digitech Systems continues to raise the standard of excellence in the ECM
sector, as evidenced by the numerous awards they have received including the
InfoWorld 100, CRN`s Emerging Tech Dynamos and multiple Nucleus Research ROI
Awards. To learn more about the company`s software and services that deliver any

&lt;p&gt;DonorsChoose.org collaboration will provide funding options for classroom
projects and a special offer for classrooms in Gulf region
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney today announced the kickoff of the second annual Disney`s Planet
Challenge, a free, project-based environmental and science competition for
classrooms nationwide. The response to Disney`s Planet Challenge last year was
unprecedented, with thousands of classrooms enrolled from all 50 states. That
success has prompted new program elements for year two including:

* Expansion to additional grade levels with an all new middle school track 
* A new level of collaboration with DonorsChoose.org to help classrooms cover
the costs of class projects - with an added focus on educators in the Gulf
region 
* A new online video series that will help engage classrooms as they embark on
the educational adventure of a lifetime that could result in a trip to
Disneyland Resort

Disney`s Planet Challenge offers budding scientists the chance to use their
imagination and creativity to help the planet while giving educators a fresh new
way to motivate students with the help of an educationally sound curriculum that
meets national and state guidelines requirements. Last year, a 6th grade class
from Mediapolis, Iowa took top honors with a project that focused on saving the
quail population in their local community. 

Special Disney prizes will be granted to national and state winners.
Participation is free, and enrollment is open now through December 17 at
www.disney.com/planetchallenge. For the project, students identify an
environmental issue in their local community and design a solution they manage
from start to finish. Past projects from the elementary competition range from
campus-wide renewable energy projects to protection of local habitats. 

"It is our goal to inspire a sense of environmental stewardship in kids as the
inheritors of our planet, and education is a critical component of that," said
Beth Stevens, senior vice president of Environmental Affairs, The Walt Disney
Company. "Building off the success of our first year, we are thrilled to expand
the reach of Disney`s Planet Challenge and offer more tools and resources that
educators can draw from." 

Expansion to Middle Schools

Middle school students now have the opportunity to participate in Disney`s
Planet Challenge, thanks to collaboration with UL Environment, with whom Disney
has a shared mission to inspire environmental stewardship and education in young
people. Formerly open to 4th through 6th grade classrooms, Disney`s Planet
Challenge is being expanded to include two tracks: one for elementary schools
grades 3-5, and another for middle schools grades 6-8. The middle school
curriculum will offer an increased focus on STEM (science, technology,
engineering and math) education. 

New Funding Options with DonorsChoose.org

For teachers who may need help funding their projects, Disney is again working
with DonorsChoose.org, an online charity that connects individual "citizen
philanthropists" with classrooms in need. 

Disney is providing a $250,000 grant to DonorsChoose.org that will in part be
applied towards a "Double Your Impact" matching offer on its website, which will
fund 50% of the cost of environmental science classroom projects for Disney`s
Planet Challenge. This funding is matched by individual donors visiting the
DonorsChoose.org site. A portion of Disney`s grant will also provide funding
specifically for educators in the Gulf region whose projects meet specific
criteria. For more information about eligibility, deadlines and funding limits,
visit www.disney.com/planetchallenge. 

Spreading the Word

To help increase awareness and create a sustaining community of learners,
Disney`s Planet Challenge is launching a new video series that will feature two
types of videos every month: "The Newsfeed" and "Imagine Your Planet." 

"The Newsfeed" videos focus on updates from the Disney`s Planet Challenge
newsroom, including environmental news from around the world as well as
tutorials on getting the most out of the Disney`s Planet Challenge website. With
"Imagine Your Planet," Disney`s Planet Challenge goes into classrooms across the
country, following students on their mission to create a better planet. The
videos also will highlight former students that had participated in Disney`s
Planet Challenge as they continue their project beyond the classroom. 

A Rewarding Experience

Adding to the education and sense of pride students will have working on their
projects, Disney offers special prizes to national and state winners. The
national grand prize winning elementary school class will enjoy a celebration at
Disneyland and middle school national grand prize winners will earn a $20,000
grant for their school. Additionally, both grand prize-winning classrooms will
be illustrated and appear within a Marvel comic book. 

Built on a Solid Educational Foundation

Disney collaborates with the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), the
WestEd K-12 Alliance as well as state and federal agencies to develop
curriculums that meet all state education standards. Disney has also worked
closely with the U.S. and California Environmental Protection Agencies, the U.S.
Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the California Department of Education to
ensure the highest environmental standards. 

About Disney`s Planet Challenge

Disney's Planet Challenge is a project-based environmental competition for 3rd -
8th grade classrooms that empowers students to make a difference in school, at
home and in their local communities. With more than 15 years of experience
running highly-acclaimed classroom environmental competitions in regional
markets including California and Florida (as "Disney's Environmentality
Challenge"), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) developed the new Disney's
Planet Challenge in response to growing demand across all 50 states. Program
collaborations with the National Science Teachers Association, the WestEd K-12
Alliance, the U.S. and California Environmental Protection Agencies, the U.S.
Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife and the California Department of Education ensure

Southern California. The new Disney Store locations opening in San Diego`s
Fashion Valley Mall on September 14 and The Shops at Mission Viejo in Mission
Viejo on September 21 offer one-of-a-kind, interactive and magical experiences
for Disney fans of all ages. To mark the celebration and thank the hundreds of
enthusiastic guests present, Disney Store premiered its new and exclusive
limited edition "Beauty and the Beast" inspired collection for the first time to
members of D23, Disney`s official fan club. Guests were also surprised by a
special appearance by Paige O`Hara, the voice of Belle, and enjoyed clips of
"Beauty and the Beast" playing in the Disney Store Theatre. Disney`s "Beauty and
the Beast" will be available on Blu-Ray and DVD on October 5. 

"My first visit to one of the newly designed Disney Stores reminded me once
again of the magic of Disney," said O`Hara. "It was exciting to meet fans who
love the timeless story and classic characters in Beauty and the Beast." 

"The magic and wonder of Disney is captured within the unique experiences that
await families at the newly designed Disney Store," said Paul Gainer, vice
president and general manager of Disney Store North America. "More than a store,
we`ve created a destination that brings Disney stories to life - with the wave
of Belle`s wand in our Disney Princess Castle`s Magic Mirror a child becomes
part of `Beauty and the Beast` and can bring a part of that story home through
our unique and limited edition products." 

Disney Store artists and designers created only 1,600 Mrs. Potts bone china
teapot sets trimmed in 24 karat gold, 1,500 Cogsworth clocks, and 2,000 Lumiere
candlesticks each inspired by the beloved Disney characters. Each item is
packaged in a specially designed deluxe box lined in royal blue satin. The
hand-crafted collectibles are limited to a worldwide edition and are accompanied
by a certificate of authenticity. A limited number of items were made available
at Disney Store in Fashion Valley on September 14 and will be available for
pre-order at DisneyStore.com beginning September 22.

stores already opened around the world including locations in Montebello, CA;
Garden City, NY; Santa Monica, CA; Madrid, Spain; Porto, Portugal; Bergamo,
Italy; Belfast, Ireland; and Aberdeen, Scotland.

&lt;p&gt;Value of DRs Traded Increases 42% Year-Over-Year; IPO Capital Raising through
DRs Doubles, Led by China and India
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Despite uncertainty and volatility in the global equity markets in the first
half of 2010, depositary receipts (DRs) continue to prove popular with both
issuers and investors, according to J.P. Morgan`s DR 2010 Mid-Year Review
report. 

In the first half of 2010, the value of DRs traded increased 42% compared with
the first half of 2009 - $1.8 trillion in 1H 2010 compared with $1.3 trillion in
1H 2009. Additionally, capital raising more than doubled when comparing the same
periods. DR issuers raised more than $4.1 billion in 1H 2010 compared to $1.8
billion in 1H 2009, a more than two-fold increase. 

"Although the past year has continued to be difficult for equity markets
overall, it has been extremely encouraging to see that issuers and investors
have maintained high levels of interest in DRs," said Claudine Gallagher, global
head of J.P. Morgan`s DR business. "Despite significant headwinds, DRs have
continued to perform extremely well, evidenced by the higher levels of DR
trading and capital raising that we`ve seen in the first half of 2010." 

Other key findings from J.P. Morgan`s DR 2010 Mid-Year Review include:

* 42 issuers from 11 countries created new DR programs during the first half of
2010, increasing the total number of sponsored DR programs to 2,158. 
* More than one-third of capital raised in 1H 2010 was through IPOs. Twenty-nine
new issuers raised $1.4 billion through DR IPO listings in the U.S., Luxembourg,
London and Paris, or through private placements. In the same period of 2009,
eight IPOs raised $400 million. 
* 13 existing issuers from across the globe raised $2.6 billion in the U.S.,
Europe or Asia through follow-on offerings in 1H 2010, as compared to $1.4
billion raised by seven issuers through follow-on offerings in the same period
in 2009.

DR Capital-Raising

Total DR capital-raising was more than $4.1 billion in 1H 2010, with
approximately 65% of this capital being raised in follow-on offerings. Of the 42
issuers raising capital in 1H 2010, 37 of these were from Brazil, Russia, India
or China ("BRIC" countries). The collective BRIC markets accounted for
approximately 46% and 44% of 1H 2010 DR trading value and volume, respectively.
BRIC-market trading value was $831 billion on volume of 35.4 billion shares. 

Local DRs

A global trend in local DR market establishment accelerated in 1H 2010.

* Markets and regulators in India, Brazil, Egypt and Hong Kong facilitated the
creation of new local DR programs and more issuers listed Taiwan Depositary
Receipts (TDRs). 
* In May, Standard Chartered PLC raised $530 million by launching the first-ever
Indian Depositary Receipt (IDR) offer.

Alternative Trading Venues

As stock exchanges continue to compete for market share, alternate trading
venues are emerging to enable ADR/GDR investments on electronic markets.

* The Singapore Exchange (SGX) is launching a Bulletin Board to allow trading of
Asian companies` ADRs in Singapore in an effort to attract new investors and
boost trading volumes. 
* NYSE Euronext launched its new stock market, NYSE Euronext London, which
offers international issuers the opportunity to list shares and DRs on the
Official List of the UK Listing Authority.

Themes to Watch in 2H 2010

Depositary receipts continue to be a popular alternative for investors to gain
exposure to foreign issuers. J.P. Morgan expects DR trading to strengthen in 2H
2010 relative to the first half of the year. 

J.P. Morgan expects capital market issuance activity in China and India to
continue, with increased IPO activity from Russia, CIS and the Middle East. In
addition, there may also be a DR IPO from a South American issuer. 

J.P. Morgan Continues DR Industry Leadership

Having created the first-ever ADR in 1927, J.P. Morgan continued its industry
innovation and leadership in 1H 2010. Programs managed by J.P. Morgan, on
average, continue to be much more liquid relative to those with other depositary
banks.

&lt;p&gt;SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Incisive, a leading developer of enterprise-class spreadsheet analysis and
management solutions, today announced it has attained Gold Certified Partner
status in the Microsoft Partner Program with a competency in ISV/Software
Solutions, recognizing Incisive`s expertise and impact in the technology
marketplace. As a Gold Certified Partner, Incisive has demonstrated expertise
with Microsoft technologies and a proven ability to meet customers` needs.
Microsoft Gold Certified Partners receive a rich set of benefits, including
access, training and support, giving them a competitive advantage in the
channel. 

"We`ve gone the extra mile to ensure that our customers have reliable solutions
to base their financial decisions upon," said Dan Vega, senior software engineer
and customer service representative for Incisive. "By becoming a Microsoft Gold
Certified Partner, we`ve proven that our solutions work seamlessly with the best
Microsoft technologies. As a result, our customers can focus on their
productivity instead of technology." 

Incisive is using its Microsoft Gold Certified Partner status to develop
easy-to-use solutions that help users comprehensively analyze their
spreadsheets. Its installable products, Xcellerator and Validate, seamlessly
integrate with a variety of established Microsoft technologies. These
technologies include Windows XP/Vista/7 and .NET Framework. 

"Customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the gap between
their business demands and technology capabilities," said Allison Watson,
corporate vice president of the Worldwide Partner Group at Microsoft Corp. "They
need to trust in a company that can act as an expert adviser for their long-term
strategic technology plans. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners, which have
certified expertise and direct training and support from Microsoft, can build a
positive customer experience with our technologies. Today, Microsoft recognizes
Incisive as a new Gold Certified Partner for demonstrating its expertise in

As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner status,
Incisivedeclared a Microsoft Competency. Microsoft Competencies are designed to
help differentiate a partner`s capabilities with specific Microsoft technologies
to customers looking for a particular type of solution. Each Competency has a
unique set of requirements and benefits, formulated to accurately represent the
specific skills and services that partners bring to the technology industry.
Within select Competencies, there are Specializations that focus on specific
solution areas that recognize deeper expertise within that Competency. Serving
as a specialized path to earning those Competencies, Specializations give direct
access to the tools and resources that support that specific area of focus. 

The ISV/Software Solutions Competency recognizes the skill and focus partners
bring to a particular solution set. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners that have
obtained this competency have a successful record of developing and marketing
packed software based on Microsoft technologies. 

"Solutions competencies are an important way for Microsoft to better enable ISVs
to meet customer needs," said Sanjay Parthasarathy, corporate vice president of
the Developer and Platform Evangelism Group at Microsoft Corp. "They allow ISVs
to keep and win customers through their deep knowledge of solutions-based
Microsoft platform technologies. Microsoft has a long history of working closely
with ISV partners to help them deliver compelling solutions and applications to
our mutual customers, and the Microsoft Competencies are an important step in
continuing to enhance vital relationships with ISVs worldwide." 

The Microsoft Partner Program was launched in October 2003 and represents
Microsoft`s ongoing commitment to the success of partners worldwide. The program
offers a single, integrated partnering framework that recognizes partner
expertise, rewards the total impact that partners have in the technology
marketplace, and delivers more value to help partners` businesses be successful.

&lt;p&gt;Company Expands Relationship with Microsoft, Joins the Microsoft System Center
Alliance and Increases Support for Microsoft Core Technologies, Providing
Superior Storage Performance 
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Virsto Software, an innovator in storage solutions for virtual servers, today
announced its popular Virsto One software will add advanced support for
Microsoft datacenter and infrastructure solutions, including Microsoft Windows
Server 2008 Hyper-V R2 and Microsoft System Center, through its work with
Microsoft as a Microsoft System Center Alliance partner. The new release, Virsto
One v1.2, supports Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager 2010,
Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008 and Microsoft Volume Shadow
Copy Service (VSS). Further, Virsto One complements the recently announced
Hyper-V Dynamic Memory feature in Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 service pack
1, which enables greater virtual machine density by optimizing available memory
for servers and desktop virtualization deployments. Virsto One has the unique
ability to relieve the storage performance bottleneck caused by the virtual
machine I/O blender found in all virtualization solutions today, and can as much
as triple I/O performance. 

"One of the biggest obstacles to fully virtualizing our data center has been I/O
performance," said Rob McShinsky, senior systems engineer, Dartmouth Hitchcock
Medical Center. "We selected Hyper-V for a number of reasons, and coupled with
Virsto One we've been able to further consolidate servers and save money by
minimizing our spending on VM storage. With the tighter Microsoft integration
and the capabilities in the System Center solutions, we see Virsto One playing a
significantly expanded role in our data center." 

Enhanced Support for Microsoft System Center Technologies

Virsto One v1.2 can reduce virtual machine storage consumption by 90 percent,
triple I/O throughput, and provision virtual hard disk (VHD) clones in less than
a second. The performance delivered by Virsto One`s unique architecture is ideal
for test and development environments, server consolidation, cloud application
hosting and centralized desktop virtualization. New support for Microsoft
technologies includes:

* Tight integration with Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager 2010 -
delivering users with an incredibly fast, best-of-breed data protection solution
for Microsoft server applications running on Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2008 R2. 
* Support for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008 - faster
provisioning with the Rapid Provisioning feature. 
* Full implementation of Microsoft VSS -ensuring that users deploying storage
compatible with Hyper-V and the Hyper-V VSS Writer can perform a full server
backup that helps protect all of the data required to fully restore the server.

Additionally, the new release offers increased usability features for
visualizing disk usage and includes a new export feature which complements
existing import capabilities, making it easier to migrate data into and out of
Virsto One. 

"What Hyper-V does exceptionally well is bring the benefits of server
virtualization to customers at a low total cost of ownership," said Jim
Schwartz, director of virtualization solutions, Server and Tools Business at
Microsoft Corp. "Coupling Dynamic Memory in Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V with
a solution like Virsto can improve memory usage and disk I/O performance when
using dynamic virtual hard disks to deliver even lower TCO. Partner innovation
like this is a major reason that we`re focused on providing customers an
ecosystem of strategic ISVs to support the growing number of Hyper-V and System
Center customers." 

Providing Superior VM Density

Virsto One's unique architecture enables users of Microsoft Hyper-V
virtualization to achieve superior levels of VM density and I/O performance.
Customer deployments in environments such as test and development show that
Virsto One can triple a server`s I/O throughput on both high end and commodity
storage hardware. 

"Microsoft's Dynamic Memory capabilities solve memory bottlenecks. Virsto One
delivers breakthrough storage performance in virtual environments. The
combination of the two is unbeatable," said Mark Davis, CEO of Virsto Software.
"The momentum behind Virsto's partnership with Microsoft, signified by
membership in the System Center Alliance, is growing." 

About Virsto One

Most data storage technologies deployed with virtual servers today were not
designed specifically for virtualization, and were built based on assumptions
that are true for physical servers, but are false for a virtual data center.
Virsto One is designed to increase the agility of storage in virtual
environments and help users take advantage of the opportunities native to
virtualization. Initially supporting Hyper-V, Virsto One is architected to be
storage- and hypervisor- agnostic and enable users to virtualize
storage-intensive workloads, maximize consolidation of server and storage
hardware, reduce storage management complexity and significantly reduce overall
storage costs. 

Availability and Pricing

The new version of Virsto One is now available. Pricing is per server socket.
Hyper-V users may download a free 30-day evaluation from www/virsto.com/try.

&lt;p&gt;  CARLISLE, IA, Sep 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
GreenMan Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: GMTI) announced that its APG
International, Inc. subsidiary has received an order from its in-country
distributor (CNG Technologies Limited/Odizim) on behalf of Nigerian
Bottling Company, PLC, an authorized bottler for Coca-Cola Hellenic
Bottling Company S.A. The initial order will upgrade three diesel
generators (800kW to 1.1MW) to dual fuel capabilities which will reduce
net operating costs and help lower emissions in support of Coca-Cola
Hellenic's corporate sustainability initiatives. The conversions are
scheduled to be completed before the end of this calendar year. Other
Nigerian Coca-Cola bottling facility generators and diesel delivery
trucks are being quoted for future dual fuel conversions.

    APG's dual fuel system converts existing diesel engines to function more
efficiently and at a lower operating cost (fuel costs reduced by 25%-35%)
by seamlessly displacing 40%-60% of the normal diesel fuel consumption
with natural gas ("NG"), compressed natural gas ("CNG") or compressed
bio-methane ("CBM"). As important, APG's dual fuel conversion and
emissions reduction systems can reduce carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen
oxide (NOX) and particulate matter while enhancing the engine's operating
life with natural gas as a cleaner burning fuel source. 

    Coca-Cola Hellenic serves approximately 560 million people in 28
countries and is the largest Coca-Cola bottler and vendor based in
Europe. Coca-Cola Hellenic is committed to behaving in a socially
responsible manner throughout all of its operations and has officially
embedded the principles of sustainability into its business strategy. 

    Lyle Jensen, GreenMan's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated,
"We have reported several recent international orders related to the use
of our dual fuel technology in vehicular applications and are pleased to
have received this order from a prominent international partner for use
in a stationary diesel generator application. Our conversion technology
will enable the bottling facility to save costs, reduce emissions, and
contribute to Coca-Cola Hellenic's sustainability initiatives."

    Mr. Jensen added, "Sustainability is defined as meeting the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs. We believe our success on this project will illustrate
the valuable role our dual fuel technology can play in meeting
sustainability goals of corporations, hospitals, town/cities, and
anywhere reliable and cleaner power is preferred. We are adding strategic
and tactical expertise to the GreenMan Board of Directors and the APG
Management Team to support this emerging market need of sustainability.
We look forward to this anchor contract and to promoting our products and
services among other authorized bottlers within the Coca-Cola family."

&lt;p&gt;Internet Identity to Contribute Information about Stolen Credentials; Existing
Customers from IID`s Wide Spectrum of Clients Such as Monster.com, BECU and
Yakima Valley Credit Union among First to Join Program
TACOMA, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
IID (Internet Identity), a provider of technology and services that help
organizations secure Internet presence, today announced it has partnered with
the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) to join the Internet
Fraud Alert program. Internet Fraud Alert is the only system of its kind that
instantly notifies organizations about fraudulent online activity involving
their own stolen credentials. As part of the partnership, IID will contribute
malicious activity data to Internet Fraud Alert, and IID will assist existing
IID ActiveControl customers in joining the network at no extra fee to receive
the latest alerts about compromised credential activity. Monster.com, BECU
(Boeing Employees' Credit Union) and Yakima Valley Credit Union are some of the
first IID customers to sign up to receive the alerts. 

"Monster.com has an unrelenting focus on providing a secure and trusted
experience for both job seekers and employers. We have made, and will continue
to make, significant investments in data security and with IID we have yet
another resource to ensure that we`re doing our best to maintain trust with our
users," said Patrick Manzo, Senior Vice President for Fraud Prevention and Chief
Privacy Officer at Monster.com. "Internet Fraud Alert`s real time reports will
serve as a valuable supplement to our robust global threat monitoring program." 

"As a not-for-profit, member-owned credit union, helping our members prevent
identity theft is paramount," said Ken Kinloch, BECU Information Protection
Officer. "Our participation in the Internet Fraud Alert program with IID is a
continuation of our commitment to our members` security and will further enhance
BECU's ability to protect our members." 

"The safety of our members' financial and personal information is extremely
important to us at Yakima Valley Credit Union," said Don Rowe, Yakima Valley
Credit Union Network Administrator. "That's why advanced security measures are a
top priority, and IID helps us give our members the safety and security they
deserve." 

Internet Fraud Alert was recently developed by Microsoft and the NCFTA - a
nonprofit whose mission is to identify, mitigate and neutralize cyber crime
threats in partnership with the private sector, law enforcement agencies,
academics, and other groups. The alert enables reporting of suspected online
fraudulent activity and offers a trusted and effective means of alerting service
providers, retailers, financial institutions, social networking companies,
government entities and more about compromised account credentials helping to
diminish losses due to fraud. Once stolen data is reported, Internet Fraud Alert
will match it to the institution that manages the account in question, sending a
secure alert to the appropriate parties, who can then take action to protect
their customers and mitigate the potential for future fraud or financial losses.


"By bringing IID on-board, we will be able to gain a wealth of vital data from
one of the world`s leading Internet fraud fighting organizations," said NCFTA
President and CEO Ron Plesco. "In addition, IID`s customers, which comprise many
of the world`s largest brands and hundreds of financial institutions, will have
instant access to the Internet Fraud Alert, providing protection to the
organizations and their customers." 

Customers using IID ActiveControl will get instant access to their alerts.
ActiveControl actively detects and blocks new malicious sites, emails and
advertisements, and controls leakage of sensitive data - before these attacks
can propagate, and before they can cause extensive damage to an organization and
its stakeholders. By utilizing the Internet Fraud Alert network, IID`s customers
will have a new tool in their anti-fraud arsenal, receiving immediate reports of
stolen debit and credit card information and compromised account access
credentials. 

IID will be using its ActiveKnowledge solution to relay data to Internet Fraud
Alert. IID ActiveKnowledge provides a comprehensive, centralized and
continuously refreshed list of the latest malicious (or compromised) IP
addresses, domains, hostnames and email accounts - protecting an enterprise and
its extended network of partners. The company will channel all stolen credential
information it comes across during its normal Internet scanning operations and

&lt;p&gt;Phineas and Ferb: Ride Again Puts Players on Skateboards, Spaceships, Mine Carts
and More in This Fun Action Game
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney Interactive Studios today announced the release of Phineas and Ferb: Ride
Again for Nintendo DS. In this new action-platformer game inspired by the hit
Disney XD and Disney Channel television series, players enter the world of
Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher where they build cool new rides and race or
perform tricks. They can also play as Agent P and do battle. As part of the fun,
players avoid obstacles, tackle new puzzles, build and use cool gadgets, and
participate in zany mini-games, including one exclusive Nintendo DSi camera
game. 

"The first Phineas and Ferb video game is a huge hit, and now we`re amping up
the fun and offbeat antics to make Phineas and Ferb: Ride Again even more
entertaining," said Craig Relyea, senior vice president of global marketing,
Disney Interactive Studios. "Fans of the television series will be excited to
see familiar locations make their DS debut in this sequel, along with all of the
humor that fans expect." 

In Phineas and Ferb: Ride Again players construct wild rides, spanning
skateboards, spaceships, mine carts and surfboards. They also participate in a
variety of mini-games to build and upgrade new gadgets and rides which play a
prominent role in aiding Phineas and Ferb on their adventures. Phineas uses
special gadgets including a jet pack, a skateboard and a fishing rod, while Ferb
has a super tractor beam and drill, all of which can be upgraded. Agent P
engages in fantastic action sequences, such as the boss battles against Dr.
Doofenshmirtz. 

Ensuring a fresh and fun experience, Phineas and Ferb: Ride Again features four
new show inspired worlds. Fans will recognize themes from familiar episodes
including "At the Car Wash," "Gaming the System" and more. Players can also
gather hidden collectibles around each world. 

Interaction with familiar characters from the hit TV show also plays a part,
including Baljeet, Buford, Isabella and Candace. Candace will also be around
with new "You`re So Busted" mini-games where the boys use trampolines, turtles
and sinking logs to get away from her. 

Phineas and Ferb: Ride Again takes full advantage of the various DS
capabilities. Players can compete and play with their friends and share four
cool rides via DS download play and through Ad hoc multiplayer. In addition, the
game features a Nintendo DSi specific camera controlled mini-game. 

Phineas and Ferb: Ride Again from Disney Interactive Studios is Rated E for
Everyone by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) and available now at
a suggested retail price of $29.99. 

About Phineas and Ferb the TV Series:

In the Emmy Award-winning animated series, Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother,
Ferb Fletcher, set out to conquer boredom and make every day of their 104-day
summer vacation count, even if it means building a giant marine aquarium,
creating their own video games or rebuilding an alien aircraft. Their older
sister, Candace, makes it her mission to get the boys in trouble but every time
without fail, the proof she needs mysteriously disappears by the time she can
get Mom to come and see her brothers' antics. Meanwhile, the family's pet, Perry
the Platypus, may seem like any other domesticated house pet but he has a secret
life as suave Agent P, deftly battling the evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz to save the
Tri-State area.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/b1fc20/the_battle_for_ban) has
announced the addition of the "The Battle for Banks' Mainframe Business: HP vs.
IBM" report to their offering. 

HP has bolstered its Mainframe Advantage program to promote migration away from
mainframe systems, with banks a major focus for its efforts. Mainframe vendors
IBM and Unisys, meanwhile, are enhancing their offerings to retain their
respective customer bases. Ovum looks at how enterprise customers and tech
vendors can take advantage of this situation. 

Scope

* Mainframe and open systems hardware 
* Core banking systems

Highlights of this title

* The cost of maintaining legacy applications on expensive hardware and software
infrastructure is coming under increasing scrutiny. CIOs are looking to reduce
monthly hardware costs, software maintenance charges, and total cost of
ownership (TCO) and bring them in line with open systems.

Key reasons to purchase this title

* Gain an understanding of how the mainframe and open system vendors are
pitching the banks to influence their core hardware systems decisions. 
* See what opportunities exist for tech vendors allied to HP to aid migration.

Key Topics Covered:

SUMMARY

* Catalyst 
* Ovum View 
* Key Messages 
* Mainframes prevail in retail banking 
* The global financial crisis has forced banks to think about costs 
* One area that's inevitably receiving increased attention is mainframe costs 
* Open systems stake their claim as viable alternatives for core systems 
* IBM responds with open source, consolidation and improved TCO 
* There are, however, obstacles to doing more on the mainframe

INTRODUCTION: MAINFRAMES PREVAIL IN RETAIL BANKING 

THE MAINFRAME IS ALIVE AND WELL IN RETAIL BANKING

* IBM is the 800lb mainframe gorilla, with Unisys more like a chimp 
* The global financial crisis has forced banks to think about costs 
* Open systems stake their claim as viable alternatives for core systems

HP'S MFA OFFERS RE-HOSTING, A RE-WRITE OR MIGRATION TO A PACKAGED CBS

* Re-hosting is the least disruptive alternative 
* Intellectual property rights can be an obstacle to re-hosting 
* The other alternatives are a move to a packaged CBS or a re-write 
* Moving to a packaged CBS has a longer ROI, but the costs can be spread out too

* Re-writes are strategic; re-hosting is tactical

IBM RESPONDS WITH OPEN SOURCE, CONSOLIDATION AND IMPROVED TCO

* zIIPs, zAAPs, and IFLs help to lower TCO 
* Solutions Editions reduce costs 
* IBM urges customers to consolidate systems on the mainframe 
* There are, however, obstacles to doing more on the mainframe 
* IBM now touts the mainframe as an "intelligent switch" for data center
workloads 
* Has IBM got all bases covered for the mainframe? 
* Unisys works to keep ClearPath relevant 
* Is ClearPath more than just a side show in the market?

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENTERPRISES

* Assess which solution is right for your IT platform strategy 
* Extract discounts from IBM with Solutions Editions 
* Explore Linux on IFLs 
* CBS re-hosting holds the promise of reducing TCO 
* The mainframe is still unbeaten on security and robustness 
* Windows support remains a shortcoming for mainframes 
* Consider modularizing a monolithic CBS, regardless of your hardware 
* Small and midsized banks should seek to benefit from both sides' efforts 
* Assess CBS platforms in the context of the overall IT strategy and operations 
* Expect applications, staff and systems admin to account for a larger
proportion of TCO in open systems

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR VENDORS

* Application vendors should offer their software in open systems Linux and
z/Linux 
* There are opportunities for systems software vendors who can aid migration 
* Ovum also sees opportunities for IT Services vendors and SIs 
* Alternative views

efficiency and reduce the environmental impact and carbon footprint of
our fleet operations across the greater China region," said Raymond
Cheng, GM Supply Chain - Environment. "The improved fuel efficiency and
reduced emissions that we are realizing by using DiesoLiFT(TM) 10 is a
major contributor to our efforts."

manufacture, market and distribute products of The Coca-Cola Co. in Hong
Kong and Taiwan, as well as part of 11 states in the USA and seven

&lt;p&gt;  SCOTTSDALE, AZ, Sep 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Integro, Inc., a leading expert in eDiscovery and email/records
management technology solutions for the IBM platform, and Informative
Graphics Corporation (IGC), a leader in viewing, collaboration, and
redaction technology, today announced a partnership to deliver automated
redaction to companies using IBM eDiscovery Manager.

    Through the partnership, Integro will help companies purchase and
implement IGC's Redact-It(R) for IBM eDiscovery Manager (eDM) software,
which performs automated redaction on documents within the IBM eDM
environment. Integro is the first IBM Business Partner to offer the IGC
technology since it was announced last month.

    "As a consultancy, we often hear about companies challenged by redaction
during the eDiscovery process. The only option has been to depend on
outside contractors, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and poses
increased risk of inadvertent disclosure due to improper redaction," said
Scott Burt, Integro President. "Our overall goal is to help companies
reduce eDiscovery risk and costs, and Redact-It together with an IBM
eDiscovery solution does just that by helping them do more in-house."

    "IGC is extremely pleased to be working together with Integro to take
this offering to market," said Richard Warren, Director of Business
Development at IGC. "By combining Integro's expertise in IBM eDiscovery
solutions, IGC's proven redaction technology, and IBM's market-leading
eDiscovery products, we are confident we'll bring significant benefits to
our mutual customers."

    Customers using IGC Redact-It software look forward to the benefits to be
gained by Redact-It for IBM eDiscovery. "Redact-It Enterprise provides a
flexible development environment and full suite of tools to automate mass
redaction of privacy information for our chain of titles and account
documentation," said Bruce Gilmore, CIO of Global Debt Registry, a

&lt;p&gt;  SCOTTSDALE, AZ, Sep 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Integro, Inc., a leading expert in eDiscovery and email/records
management technology solutions for the IBM platform, and Informative
Graphics Corporation (IGC), a leader in viewing, collaboration, and
redaction technology, today announced a partnership to deliver automated
redaction to companies using IBM eDiscovery Manager.

    Through the partnership, Integro will help companies purchase and
implement IGC's Redact-It(R) for IBM eDiscovery Manager (eDM) software,
which performs automated redaction on documents within the IBM eDM
environment. Integro is the first IBM Business Partner to offer the IGC
technology since it was announced last month.

    "As a consultancy, we often hear about companies challenged by redaction
during the eDiscovery process. The only option has been to depend on
outside contractors, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and poses
increased risk of inadvertent disclosure due to improper redaction," said
Scott Burt, Integro President. "Our overall goal is to help companies
reduce eDiscovery risk and costs, and Redact-It together with an IBM
eDiscovery solution does just that by helping them do more in-house."

    "IGC is extremely pleased to be working together with Integro to take
this offering to market," said Richard Warren, Director of Business
Development at IGC. "By combining Integro's expertise in IBM eDiscovery
solutions, IGC's proven redaction technology, and IBM's market-leading
eDiscovery products, we are confident we'll bring significant benefits to
our mutual customers."

    Customers using IGC Redact-It software look forward to the benefits to be
gained by Redact-It for IBM eDiscovery. "Redact-It Enterprise provides a
flexible development environment and full suite of tools to automate mass
redaction of privacy information for our chain of titles and account
documentation," said Bruce Gilmore, CIO of Global Debt Registry, a
Redact-It Enterprise customer. "I can see how its use will provide ideal
capabilities for eDiscovery."

 What:         According to a recent report by Forrester Research, "financial services firms haven`t been blind to their customers` adoption of social tools&#8230; but it`s clear that the industry hasn`t fully embraced social technologies either.1" Findings demonstrate the importance of creating a foundation for the adoption of modern cross-channel strategies in order to more effectively communicate with customers and better target their needs no matter how they interact with a brand - via email, web, direct mail, social media or call center. Financial services and insurance industry marketers have long known that customer data is the lifeblood of their operations; however, they have struggled to effectively and    
               efficiently leverage available new channel data that can help drive exceptional customer experiences. During this breakfast, marketers will learn how to capitalize on valuable customer intelligence, drive marketing performance and overcome organizational and technological constraints.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN DIEGO, CA, Sep 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Advanced Telemetry (www.AdvancedTelemetry.com), developer of the
EcoView(TM) smart energy management system for light commercial and
residential applications, today announced that General Electric Co.
(NYSE: GE) ("GE") has adopted its "EcoView Residential" solution for
select energy conscious home builders across North America.

    General Electric is working with a select group of home builders and
developers to design homes that are not only comfortable, but also
achieve at least a 20% reduction in household energy usage, indoor water
consumption and overall carbon emissions as compared to industry-accepted
average new homes. Now a key component of the program, the EcoView
Residential energy management system is integral in helping homeowners
easily and consistently achieve this high level of energy efficiency --
and also benefit from the related cost savings.

    "EcoView Residential is an innovative solution addressing the rapidly
growing smart grid industry, enabling homeowners to actively participate
in taking the pressure off our overloaded grid infrastructure," notes
Advanced Telemetry President Gus Ezcurra. "This helps improve grid
reliability and security, while reducing residential energy bills and
environmental impacts."

    "We worked closely with GE's builder and developer affiliates to deliver
a feature rich, cost-effective, flexible and scalable product to meet
their needs today and in the future," continues Ezcurra. "We're honored
to partner with General Electric and its esteemed builder and developer
partners from coast to coast to help homeowners reduce resource usage,
utility costs and their overall environmental footprint."

    In addition to EcoView Residential, all homes being built by the GE
customers are equipped with an array of GE products that address today's
environmentally conscious consumer values. These include GE's ENERGY
STAR(R) appliances and Energy Smart(TM) compact fluorescent lighting
package. Homeowners can now maximize benefits with these products when
used in combination with the EcoView Residential energy monitoring touch
screen, which gives them the power to measure and control utility use and
better understand the true value of their home's energy-efficient
features.

    About EcoView Residential
 EcoView Residential provides homeowners with
an array of world-leading features, including real time information on
energy and resource usage that allows owners and tenants to pinpoint and
minimize consumption from devices ranging from flat screen televisions to
computers to light bulbs. The system, which is easily installed by a
qualified professional in under 2 hours, may be readily connected to
wireless control devices like thermostats and light switches, enabling
users to quickly, easily, and even remotely make adjustments to a home's
energy consumption.

    EcoView Residential's high resolution, flat screen interactive
touch-screen communicates wirelessly with metering devices that measure a
home's electricity and water consumption, providing real-time, graphical
illustrations of-and control over-energy usage or generation. The system
also takes advantage of an existing broadband Internet connection
enabling homeowners to remotely access their system to view current
consumption and make adjustments to settings and schedules for
thermostats, lighting controls and other appliances from any Web-enabled
device outside the home.

    About Advanced Telemetry, LLC
 With a corporate belief that energy and
fiscal conservation begins with an awareness of wasteful consumption
habits as they occur, Advanced Telemetry offers EcoView(TM) -- a
proprietary, smart energy and resource management system for both
residential and small commercial applications. Server-based and entirely
Web accessible, EcoView is the most cost-effective, future-proof system
available that -- completely independent of a utility company -- enables
users to easily view, manage and reduce their resource consumption -- and
thus utility bills and carbon footprint -- in real-time. These are among
the many reasons Advanced Telemetry's has been chosen as a General
Electric Co. Ecomagination(SM) program partner. Founded in 2007, Advanced
Telemetry is headquartered in San Diego, California. More information may

&lt;p&gt;Strangeloop Site OptimizerTM accelerates luxury travel website more than 200%
for worldwide customers
VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(Business Wire)--
Kiwi Collection has announced that it will be deploying the Strangeloop Site
OptimizerTM to provide a fast, seamless user experience for its audience of
discerning, high-end travelers. 

Kiwi Collection is a curated collection of more than 2,000 international luxury
hotels and resorts, which also powers the Visa Luxury Hotel Collection. Each
hotel is individually reviewed before being invited to join this selective
network. The Kiwi Collection website allows travelers to research and book their
hotels online. The site is tailored toward knowledgeable, discriminating
travelers, which means the entire user experience must be impeccable, from the
home page through to the booking confirmation page. 

"We were incredibly impressed at how quickly Strangeloop improved our site`s
performance," said Jackie Reid, VP Project Services for Kiwi Collection. "On
average, they cut our page load time in half - and even more in key markets such
as Asia and Europe." 

Before working with Strangeloop, it took up to 22 seconds for key pages to load
for Visa Signature Hotels` online visitors. After implementing the Strangeloop
Site Optimizer, average page load times for all visitors dropped to a 6.4
seconds. This is a full 3 seconds faster than the 9.4 seconds that it takes for
the average Fortune 500 website to load for international visitors. 

How the Strangeloop Site Optimizer works

Strangeloop offers the only solution designed to address the unique performance
issues of today`s highly interactive web environments. The Strangeloop Site
Optimizer is an easy-to-use web acceleration solution that is available as
either a hardware appliance or as a service via the cloud. Site Optimizer
transforms optimization from a lengthy and complex coding process into an
automated function performed in real time by an intelligent appliance. 

Companies like Sodexo, O`Reilly Media and AutoAnything have implemented the
Strangeloop Site Optimizer and gotten the following results:

* Increased sales by 13% 
* Increased conversions by 9% 
* Increased organic search traffic by 10% 
* Reduced CDN costs 
* ROI within weeks

About Strangeloop

Founded in 2006, Strangeloop`s original product offering was the Strangeloop
AS1000, a delivery-focused accelerator for ASP.NET. In 2010, the company
launched Site OptimizerTM, a next-generation solution that offers a powerful set
of features that work together to provide roundtrip reduction, rapid rendering,
and dynamic browser caching. Site Optimizer makes Strangeloop`s web acceleration
capabilities available to companies in different environments: as a hardware
appliance, as a virtual appliance, and as a service via the cloud. Strangeloop
clients - including AutoAnything, Sodexo, O`Reilly, and Visa Signature Hotels -
report that, after implementing Strangeloop solutions, their conversion rates
have increased by up to 8.5% and they have experienced revenue increases of up
to 52%. Strangeloop is based in Vancouver, BC. For more information, visit
www.strangeloopnetworks.com.

&lt;p&gt;PARIS, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Euro Disney (EDLP.PA), which runs
the Disneyland Paris theme park, could open a third park and
expand its hotel business as part of an agreement with the
French public authorities to further boost the region's economy,
it said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Other projects agreed on include the building of homes as
part of the development of Marne-La-Vallee where Disneyland
Paris is located, as well as a nature park that will be set up
with French holiday company Pierre et Vacances (PVAC.PA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Euro Disney said in a statement that according to state
estimates these projects could bring in investments of 8 billion
euros ($10.3 billion), of which the nature park "Les Villages
Nature de Val d'Europe" would take up 1.8 billion euros, and
create 70,000 jobs overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreement, which will be signed this afternoon, between
Euro Disney and the French state and other public authorities
runs until 2030 following an extension from 2017.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp released the latest version of its Web browser, saying that it would work at faster speeds, deliver better graphics and be less obtrusive to users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer 9, unlike previous versions and many competing browsers, pushes itself into the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People go to the Web for site, not the browser," said Dean Hachamovitch, general manager for IE, at a press event in San Francisco. "Today Web sites are boxed in, the box is the browser."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE9 is available in a public beta, or trial version, in more than 30 languages. Many of the world's most popular sites including Facebook, Amazon.com, Time Warner Inc's CNN, eBay and Twitter are taking advantage of IE9's new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The browser has become one of the most important programs on a PC. As people watch more video and use sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, browser makers are making their latest versions quicker and better at handling graphics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is promising a faster, cleaner, more secure version of its browser, one that will support evolving Web technologies, such HTML5, a standard for presenting content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also more tightly integrated with the company's Bing search engine, which the company hopes will begin to eat away at the dominance of Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In IE9, the rendering of graphics and text has shifted to the graphics card from the CPU, accelerating speed and visuals. As a result, Microsoft said sites will look and perform more like applications that are installed directly on a PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE9's tight integration with Microsoft's Windows operating system, which runs on most of the world's PCs, enables IE9 to use a computer's hardware in a way that rival browsers cannot, said Forrester Research analyst Peter O'Neill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is going to make the Windows platform more attractive, and Microsoft hopes, help stop people from leaking away to other browsers," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE has been the market leader for many years, but has been losing share to Mozilla's Firefox and Google's Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE had 51 percent of the worldwide browser market last month, according to StatCounter, compared to Firefox's 31 percent and Chrome's 11 percent.

to pursue joint opportunities related to gas-field development
and LNG offtake in Australia, and broader cooperation on
upstream opportunities in China," Chevron said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Chevron was close to
striking a deal to supply CNPC with liquefied natural gas from
Chevron's Wheatstone project in Australia.

 (Adds background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, Sept 16 (Reuters) - U.S. energy group Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) is close to striking a deal to supply China National
Petroleum Corp (CNPC) with gas from Chevron's Wheatstone
project in Australia, the Wall Street Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The newspaper quoted Chevron chief John Watson as saying in
an interview that under the deal CNPC would also take a stake
in a gas field supplying the Wheatstone liquefied natural gas
plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron expects to make a final investment decision on
Wheatstone in 2011. Media reports have put the project's cost
at around A$20 billion ($19 billion), among roughly $200
billion worth of LNG projects on the drawing board in
Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Getting CNPC onboard is important because it would be the
cornerstone buyer, underpinning Chevron's plans to more than
double the capacity of Wheatstone to 25 million metric tonnes,"
the Wall Street Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The gas intended for China would go to market by 2016."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has already committed 60 percent of the gas from
the first phase of Wheatstone to other Asian buyers, including
Japan and South Korea, which have also taken small stakes in
gas fields feeding the project, the newspaper added.

&lt;p&gt; * Promises faster, better browser as more people use video&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Browser to be less visible, focus on websites&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Gabriel Madway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
released the latest version of its Web browser, saying that it
would work at faster speeds, deliver better graphics and be
less obtrusive to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Internet Explorer 9, unlike previous versions and many
competing browsers, pushes itself into the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People go to the Web for site, not the browser," said Dean
Hachamovitch, general manager for IE, at a press event in San
Francisco. "Today Web sites are boxed in, the box is the
browser."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IE9 is available in a public beta, or trial version, in
more than 30 languages. Many of the world's most popular sites
including Facebook, Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Time Warner Inc's
(TWX.N) CNN, eBay (EBAY.O) and Twitter have sites that take
advantage of IE9's new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The browser has become one of the most important programs
on a PC. As people watch more video and use sites such as
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, browser makers are making their
latest versions quicker and better at handling graphics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is promising a faster, cleaner, more secure
version of its browser, one that will support evolving Web
technologies, such HTML5, a standard for presenting content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is also more tightly integrated with the company's Bing
search engine, which the company hopes will begin to eat away
at the dominance of Google  (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In IE9, the rendering of graphics and text has shifted to
the graphics card from the CPU, accelerating speed and visuals.
As a result, Microsoft said sites will look and perform more
like applications that are installed directly on a PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IE has been the market leader for many years, but has been
losing share to Mozilla's Firefox and Google's Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IE had 51 percent of the worldwide browser market last
month, according to StatCounter, compared to Firefox's 31
percent and Chrome's 11 percent. Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Safari
and Opera Software's (OPERA.OL) browser had about 4 percent and
2 percent.

&lt;p&gt;Judge Has More than 100 Expert Reports as Oil Giant Continues to Obstruct
Judicial Process
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
New damages assessments from both Chevron and the Amazonian communities are due
in Ecuador`s court Thursday, but Chevron has indicated it likely will refuse to
participate despite complaining previously it never had the opportunity to
submit its own damages report. 

For more than two years, Chevron has protested a previous $27 billion report
submitted by court-appointed expert Richard Cabrera. 

"We predict that Chevron`s bad faith will be on full display yet again," said
Pablo Fajardo, the lead lawyer for the Amazonian communities. "Chevron
complained that it did not have an opportunity to produce its own damages
assessment. But when given the opportunity, company lawyers accuse the judge of
bias against Chevron and launch attacks on the justice system." 

Fajardo said the Amazonian communities will submit their own damages assessment
to the court on Thursday and that it was prepared by a team of scientific and
medical experts. Chevron, on the other hand, recently filed a motion in Ecuador
to remove the judge and cited the order asking for the new damages assessments
as a basis. 

Chevron has filed 104 separate motions before the Ecuador court in the last
several weeks as part of a strategy to delay the trial, which has been litigated
now for seven years, said Fajardo. Most of the recent motions concern efforts to
nullify the report of Cabrera, who in a 4,000-page summary of the evidence found
Chevron could be liable for up to $27.3 billion in damages. 

The $27.3 billion would only partially clean up the damage given that a
significant portion of the harm caused by Chevron to the delicate rainforest
ecosystem can never be fully remediated, said Fajardo. 

As an example of Chevron`s abuse of the judicial process, in just one 30-minute
period on August 5 - just three days after the court ordered the parties to
submit their own damages assessments - Chevron bombarded the court with 19
separate and largely repetitive petitions, said Fajardo. 

"It`s extraordinary how Chevron tries to abuse the judicial process while
thousands of people, many sick from cancer, cannot afford to pay for the most
basic medical treatment," he said. "Tragically, many suffering people will not
live long enough to see justice done." 

He added: "Chevron`s actions demonstrate the company`s blatant disregard of the
people of Ecuador and prove its double standard in asking that the case be tried
here. No litigant, including Chevron, would ever get away with this in the
United States." 

Chevron is accused in the lawsuit of deliberately dumping billions of gallons of
toxic waste into Amazon waterways when it operated a large oil concession from
1964 to 1990. Independent studies demonstrate cancer rates in the area are
higher than in other parts of Ecuador, and several indigenous groups have seen
their traditional lifestyles decimated. 

After the communities submit their new damages assessment to the court on
Thursday, the judge will have in evidence 105 expert reports and more than
64,000 chemical sampling results from dozens of former Chevron well sites, all
of which show extensive contamination, said Karen Hinton, a spokesperson for the
communities. 

Most of the evidence comes from Chevron`s own sampling, which alone prove the
claims in the lawsuit, said Hinton. In all, the court has voluminous scientific
evidence to impose liability and damages on Chevron independent of the Cabrera
report, she added. 

In the meantime, Chevron`s outside counsel at Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher have filed
a series of discovery actions in U.S. federal courts where they claim there is
no evidence of contamination left by Chevron in Ecuador - a blatant
misrepresentation, said Hinton. 

"The company`s own test results in Ecuador show that Chevron`s lawyers are
mischaracterizing the entire case before U.S. courts," said Hinton. "What`s
worse is that these misrepresentations have grave human consequences." 

The case against Chevron was originally filed by 30,000 rainforest residents in
1993 in U.S. federal court, but was shifted to Ecuador at Chevron`s request in
2002. Once the trial evidence in Ecuador pointed to a possible multi-billion
dollar judgment against Chevron, the company launched a public relations and
lobbying campaign to discredit Ecuador`s justice system as well as the lawyers
who represent the communities. 

As a condition of the removal of the case from U.S. federal court to Ecuador,
Chevron promised to subject itself to jurisdiction in Ecuador and to satisfy any
judgment imposed by Ecuador`s courts.

  (Adds details on parties that exited, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Greg Roumeliotis and Hendrik Sackmann &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMSTERDAM/STUTTGART, Sept 15 (Reuters) - At least two
utilities are eyeing the German gas storage assets of Exxon
Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), valued at
up to 1 billion euros ($1.30 billion), people familiar with the
matter said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; German power utility EnBW (EBKG.DE) is one of the contenders
and is in talks with Antin Infrastructure Partners, a fund
backed by BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), about submitting a joint offer,
sources familiar with the negotiations said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "EnBW is interested. They are checking and exploring the
offer as other interested buyers are," said one of the sources
close to EnBW. Another source said a joint bid would help the
firm with meeting its requirements for A-grade credit ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; France's GDF Suez (GSZ.PA), which owns stakes in two of the
gas storage sites and is the technical operator of three of
them, is also in discussion with the oil majors about acquiring
the assets, two other people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several financial investors have either withdrawn or been
excluded from the process. These include infrastructure funds
from EQT, Allianz (ALVG.DE), and RREEF, sources close to them
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shell, BEB Erdgas und Erdoel GmbH -- a joint venture between
Exxon and Shell -- EnBW, Antin and RREEF declined to comment.
Spokespeople for GDF Suez, Allianz and EQT were not immediately
available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AXA Private Equity was also interested in the assets until
recently, two people close to its infrastructure fund told
Reuters. An AXA Private Equity spokesman declined to comment on
whether it was still involved in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The enterprise value of the storage sites for sale is
estimated between 500 to 700 million euros and could reach 1
billion euros if the cushion gas needed to keep them operational
is factored in, sources have previously told Reuters.
[ID:nLDE65T1CE]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONTRACTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The assets, located in Lower Saxony, Baden-Wurttemberg and
Hamburg, are split between those owned by Exxon and those owned
by BEB. Collectively they have a storage capacity of 4.1 billion
cubic metres, although one of them in Dotlingen is not for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS AG (UBSN.VX) has been tapped to run parallel sale
processes for the two categories of assets, according to a
teaser document seen by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gas storage capacity in Germany is generally allocated on a
first-come, first-served basis with tariffs set through
negotiated third-party access and a partial inflation escalator,
making their cashflows attractive to infrastructure funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, some infrastructure funds left the process because
not enough storage caverns had long-term contracts of more than
five years to secure stable cashflows, sources close to them
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fact that the assets are substantially contracted in the
shorter term, for at least the first three years, also
discourages energy companies who would like to use them
immediately for trading or other purposes, the sources added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GDF Suez already has a gas storage subsidiary called
Storengy and a foothold in Germany. It owns 50 percent of a gas
cavern in Reitbrook, with Exxon owning the rest, and a third of
a site in Schmidhausen, with BEB and Exxon owning the rest.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc was hit with a gender bias lawsuit by three women who said Wall Street's most profitable bank maintains an "outdated corporate culture" that systematically deprives women of pay and promotions available to men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status on behalf of women who have worked as Goldman managing directors, vice presidents and associates in the last six years. It seeks punitive and other damages, and an end to gender bias at Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, contends that Goldman managers have unfettered discretion to assign accounts and responsibilities, and decide who gets administrative support and training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has resulted in "unchecked gender bias," the lawsuit said, that causes women to be underrepresented in management, at just 14 percent of partners, 17 percent of managing directors and 29 percent of vice presidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policies "are part and parcel of an outdated corporate culture," the complaint said. "Goldman Sachs has intentionally implemented these company-wide policies and practices in order to pay their male employees more money than their female counterparts, and to promote them more frequently."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman denied the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suit is without merit," spokesman Lucas van Praag said in an email.

She also contended she was subjected to a sexually charged email by a male colleague that made fun of her Chinese heritage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orlich contended in the court papers that she was deprived of work and subjected to greater criticism than male workers. She said she once was kept from a golf outing because she was too "junior" though several male colleagues just out of college attended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen-Oster resigned from Goldman after eight years in 2005, while Parisi and Orlich's jobs were terminated in 2008 after they had worked there since 2001 and 2006, respectively, the lawsuit said.

&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
NEON Enterprise Software, LLC announced today it filed a Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment with the U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas, in the
case of NEON Enterprise Software, LLC v. International Business Machines
Corporation (case number 1:09-cv-00896-JRN). 

Partial summary judgments are typically filed in civil court cases to request a
ruling by the court that specific issues of the case do not need to proceed to
trial because they can be decided as a matter of law. 

NEON filed its motion on the basis that there are certain aspects of this case
that are appropriate for an early decision, as a matter of law, without the need
for a trial. 

NEON v. IBM

NEON`s lawsuit alleges that IBM has engaged in conduct that disparages NEON and
its product, zPrime, that unlawfully interferes with customers purchasing zPrime
and that violates United States antitrust laws. 

Facts about zPrime

NEON zPrime is a proprietary software product that enables IBM System z business
application workloads (IMS, DB2, CICS, TSO/ISPF and batch) to run on IBM`s

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM/STUTTGART, Sept 15 (Reuters) - At least two
utilities are eyeing the German gas storage assets of Exxon
Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), valued at
up to 1 billion euros ($1.30 billion), people familiar with the
matter said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; German power utility EnBW (EBKG.DE) is one of the contenders
and is in talks with Antin Infrastructure Partners, a fund
backed by BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), about submitting a joint offer,
sources familiar with the negotiations said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "EnBW is interested. They are checking and exploring the
offer as other interested buyers are," said one of the sources
close to EnBW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; France's GDF Suez (GSZ.PA), which owns stakes in two of the
gas storage sites and is the technical operator of three of
them, is also in discussion with the oil majors about acquiring
the assets, two other people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spokespeople for Shell, BEB, EnBW and Antin declined to
comment. A GDF Suez spokesman was not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The enterprise value of the storage sites for sale is
estimated between 500 to 700 million euros and could reach 1
billion euros if the cushion gas needed to keep them operational
is factored in, sources have previously told Reuters.

&lt;p&gt;National Class Action Lawsuit in Federal Court Charges Violations of Federal and
Local Civil Rights Laws 


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Sachs has engaged in systemic and pervasive discrimination against its
female professional employees, a lawsuit filed today in federal court in New
York alleges. 

The lawsuit, Chen-Oster v. Goldman Sachs, Inc., Case No. 10-6950 (S.D.N.Y.),
filed by three highly-credentialed women represented by Outten &amp; Golden LLP and
Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann &amp; Bernstein, LLP, accuses Goldman Sachs, a leading
global investment banking, securities and investment management firm, of
engaging in a pattern and practice of gender discrimination against its female
Associates, Vice Presidents, and Managing Directors.The women allege violations
of federal and city laws, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
and the New York City Human Rights Law.The case is pending before United States
District Court Judge Leonard Sand.

According to the complaint, the "violations of [Goldman Sachs`] female
employees` rights are systemic, are based upon company-wide policies and
practices, and are the result of unchecked gender bias that pervades Goldman
Sachs` corporate culture.They have not been isolated or exceptional incidents,
but rather the regular and predictable result of Goldman Sachs` company-wide
policies and practices."

"The gender-equality issues raised by this lawsuit are all too familiar -
Goldman Sachs systematically undervalues the efforts and achievements of its
female employees.This is an important step in our efforts to eradicate
discrimination within the financial-services industry," said plaintiffs`
attorney Adam T. Klein of Outten &amp; Golden LLP of New York, New York.

"This case challenges Goldman Sachs` practice of treating its talented female
professionals like disposable, second class citizens," said plaintiffs` attorney
Kelly M. Dermody of Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann &amp; Bernstein, LLP of San Francisco,
California. "By coming forward, the plaintiffs are working to ensure a level
playing field across Wall Street."

The complaint charges that, among other things, Goldman Sachs compensates its
female professionals less than similar male professionals, disproportionately
promotes men over equally or more qualified women, and offers better business
opportunities and professional support to its male professionals.

Attorneys Adam T. Klein, Cara E. Greene, and Jennifer Liu of Outten &amp; Golden LLP
and Kelly M. Dermody, Anne Shaver, and Heather Wong of Lieff Cabraser Heimann
and Bernstein LLP represent the plaintiffs.The case is Chen-Oster v. Goldman
Sachs, Inc., Case No. 10-6950 (S.D.N.Y.).

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a global financial firm that provides
investment banking management services to corporations, governments, and
individuals around the world.In 2009, Goldman Sachs generated $45 billion in net
revenues and $13 billion in net earnings, ranking number 40 on the Fortune 500
list of America`s largest corporations.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/1fd98d/technology_credent) has
announced the addition of the "Technology Credentials no Impediment to SAS
Australian Expansion but IBM the One to Beat" report to their offering. 

Longhaus prepared this Briefing Note to assist Information and Knowledge
Management professionals assess the applicability of SAS as a potential solution
within existing and planned information and intelligence strategies. 

SAS currently retains a very strong market position in Australia specifically
within the Federal Government, and as the customer loyalty technology backbone
for large private-sector companies including the National Australian Bank (NAB),
Telecom NZ, Coles (Wesfarmers), and Qantas for their premium brand Frequent
Flyer program. In 2009 and 2010 SAS have made two key placements in Australia
within their technology division with the hire of ex-Cognos executives Peter
Kokinakos to the position of General Manager Technology Services, and Patrick
Spedding to the position of Solution Manager for Reporting and Solution
Management. 

While SAS has many strong and large company supporters, there are only 5,000
large organisations in Australia with greater than 200 employees. As such, SAS
is routinely criticised in the Australian and New Zealand market for its breadth
of service offerings, and the level of proprietary technology in use within the
SAS solution platform. The authors clients have expressed that the sales
approach for SAS can be strongly "anti-IT" citing examples of going around the
CIO through the promotion of failed business intelligence (BI) programs to win
support at other layers within the organisation. 

Beyond the major release of SAS Social Media Analytics in April at the US Global
Forum, there was little visible advance in the SAS platform in 2010.

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs raised its recommendation on Banco do Brasil
(BBAS3.SA) to buy, as concerns eased over the lender's
international expansion plans and capital injection needs. The
U.S. bank also said in a report on Wednesday that it favors
Brazilian banks over their Latin American peers as current
trading prices still offer some room for further gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Banco do Brasil is Latin America's largest bank by assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While Brazilian bank stocks rallied in July, making up
some lost ground, the current discounts make valuations
compelling, in our view," a group of analysts led by Jason
Mollin wrote in a note. "Accelerating loan growth, resilient
net interest margins, and lower provisions expenses are
important earnings drivers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also added Itau Unibanco (ITUB4.SA), Brazil's
largest non-government lender, to its so-called focus list
after spotting room for further price increases. Banco Bradesco
(BBDC4.SA) was removed from the list after recent gains.

&lt;p&gt;30% of Analyzed Deals Had Claims Against Escrow; 78% of Claims Paid Out
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
For the second year, J.P. Morgan has issued its M Holdback Escrow Report that
is designed to give the M community a deeper understanding of the dynamics of
holdback escrows and their value as a risk mitigation tool. The study uses J.P.
Morgan`s proprietary data and provides information not available elsewhere. A
third of the deals analyzed had claims filed, and 78% had pay outs, which speaks
to the value of a holdback escrow as a hedge against deal risks. 

With a holdback escrow, a percentage of the value of the M deal is placed in
an escrow account and held until the terms of the escrow agreement have been
satisfied. The agreement enables the buyer to make claims against the account
and retrieve funds in the event that the seller fails to meet specific terms of
the sale and purchase agreement. 

The 2010 M Holdback report looks at a variety of factors, including the
percentage of escrows that have claims filed against the account; the types of
claims; the average life span of the escrowsand more. Also in the report is a
summary of benefits that both buyers and sellers have experienced when including
holdback escrows in their deal structures. 

Key findings in the report include:

* The average expected duration of holdback escrow accounts is 19 months. 
* Of the deals analyzed, 30 percent had claims filed against the escrow. Six
percent of these had multiple claims. On average, 78 percent of amounts claimed
from escrow accounts were ultimately paid out. 
* Purchase price adjustments and working capital adjustments were the most
common claim reasons, followed by representations and warranties. 
* Escrow fees were split between counterparties 80 percent of the time,
indicating that both buyers and sellers value holdback escrows.

The report findings are based on analysis of a sample of active and terminated
escrow transactions originated in the United States with J.P. Morgan from June
2008 to December 2009 in which J.P. Morgan Escrow Services acted as escrow agent
for the buyer and the seller. 

"As a leading provider of escrow services, J.P. Morgan has the unique ability to
provide the deal community with information not available from other sources."
said Rocky Motwani, managing director and head of J.P. Morgan's Escrow business.
"Our second annual report delivers compelling insights that demonstrate the
importance of holdback escrows. It also provides a base of information that
helps us guide our clients as they consider their escrow needs." 

J.P. Morgan provides customized end-to-end Escrow services to help customers
better manage financial risk associated with a range of business transactions,
such as mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings, import and export
payments, collateral trusts for reinsurance, and construction project funding.
Acting as an independent third party, J.P. Morgan holds assets in escrow until
the commitments of the agreement are fulfilled. J.P. Morgan`s dedicated Escrow
team offers a reliable and dependable service to ensure that transactions close
quickly, accurately and securely. 

The company actively administers more than 5,000 escrow accounts globally with
more than $30 billion under management and offers Escrow services in Australia,
Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, India, Korea, the
Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States.

&lt;p&gt;    * Downgrades Micron to neutral from buy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Goldman cuts price target on Micron to $7.85 from 12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Lowere Maxim to sell from neutral&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Cuts price target on Maxim shares by $3 to $16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sept 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs lowered its rating onmemory-chip maker Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) to "neutral,"saying it had underestimated the amount of negative impacttablets would have on the PC supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman also cut its rating on Maxim Integrated ProductsInc (MXIM.O) to "sell" on weakness in the mainstream PC marketand said it expects the chipmaker to underperform peers in thenext 6-12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman said it had added Micron to its buy list in Juneon expectations of margin expansion and hopes of a rise instock price due to upward revisions of analysts' estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman had expected an undersupply of dynamic randomaccess memory (DRAM) chips in the market to drive growth atMicron, but now sees excess capacity to persist through theyear-end and drive average selling price (ASP) deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Tablets cannibalized notebooks faster and to a greaterdegree than we had expected," it said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Boise, Idaho-based Micron, which closed at $7.27Tuesday on Nasdaq, have lost 25 percent of their value in thepast three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sunnyvale, California-based Maxim, which has seen itsstock drop about 6 percent in the last three months, closed at$16.84. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC hasgained almost 2 percent in the last three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Sayantani Ghosh in Bangalore; Editing by MajuSamuel)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  ((sayantani.ghosh@thomsonreuters.com; within U.S. +1 646 2238780; outside U.S. +91 80 4135 5800; Reuters Messaging:sayantani.ghosh.reuters.com@reuters.net))Keywords: MICRON RESEARCH/GOLDMANSACHS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2010.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Candy maker Mars Inc., computer company IBM Corp. and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have mapped the cacao genome in an effort to improve cocoa crop quality and sustain the world's supply of the key ingredient for chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies and the USDA's Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) on Wednesday released the preliminary genome sequence for the cacao tree, which produces cocoa beans used to make chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The particular cultivar that was sequenced -- Matina 1-6 -- forms the basis of 99 percent of the world's cocoa, and is a promising first step in advancing farmers' ability to plant more robust, higher yielding and drought and disease-resistant trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Genome sequencing helps eliminate much of the guess-work of traditional crop cultivation," said Howard-Yana Shapiro, Ph.D., global staff officer of plant science and research at Mars, Incorporated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This effort, which will allow fast and accurate traditional breeding, is about applying the best of what science has to offer in taking an under-served crop and under-served population and giving them both the chance to flourish," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this collaborative project -- delivered three years early due to Mars' scientific leadership, advances in genome technology and constant real-time collaboration -- marks a significant scientific milestone that is already starting to benefit millions of farmers, particularly in West Africa, where more than 70 percent of the world's cocoa crop is produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The collaboration with Mars and the USDA-ARS leverages more than a decade of IBM Research's experience in computational biology, as well as the power of the Blue Gene supercomputer," said Ajay Royyuru, senior manager, IBM Computational Biology Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By assembling the sequence fragments into the complete genome sequence and developing a detailed genetic map, we can help maximize the potential yield and income for cocoa farmers and catalyze future research and endeavors involving the cacao tree."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the research will be made available to the public with permanent access via the Cacao Genome Database www.cacaogenomedb.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Chris Kelly; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Genome sequence to improve cocoa-growing process&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Collaborative effort three years ahead of schedule&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Candy maker Mars Inc.,
computer company IBM Corp. (IBM.N) and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture have mapped the cacao genome in an effort to
improve cocoa crop quality and sustain the world's supply of
the key ingredient for chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies and the USDA's Agricultural Research Service
(USDA-ARS) on Wednesday released the preliminary genome
sequence for the cacao tree, which produces cocoa beans used to
make chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The particular cultivar that was sequenced -- Matina 1-6 --
forms the basis of 99 percent of the world's cocoa, and is a
promising first step in advancing farmers' ability to plant
more robust, higher yielding and drought and disease-resistant
trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Genome sequencing helps eliminate much of the guess-work
of traditional crop cultivation," said Howard-Yana Shapiro,
Ph.D., global staff officer of plant science and research at
Mars, Incorporated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This effort, which will allow fast and accurate
traditional breeding, is about applying the best of what
science has to offer in taking an under-served crop and
under-served population and giving them both the chance to
flourish," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results of this collaborative project -- delivered
three years early due to Mars' scientific leadership, advances
in genome technology and constant real-time collaboration --
marks a significant scientific milestone that is already
starting to benefit millions of farmers, particularly in West
Africa, where more than 70 percent of the world's cocoa crop is
produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The collaboration with Mars and the USDA-ARS leverages
more than a decade of IBM Research's experience in
computational biology, as well as the power of the Blue Gene
supercomputer," said Ajay Royyuru, senior manager, IBM
Computational Biology Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "By assembling the sequence fragments into the complete
genome sequence and developing a detailed genetic map, we can
help maximize the potential yield and income for cocoa farmers
and catalyze future research and endeavors involving the cacao
tree."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results of the research will be made available to the
public with permanent access via the Cacao Genome Database

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world's
largest credit card network, has been blocked from starting new
operations in China for almost a year after disagreement with
UnionPay, the country's state-backed bank card monopoly, the
Financial Times said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The newspaper said Visa first warned UnionPay a year ago to
stop processing international transactions for co-branded cards
through UnionPay's own payment system rather than Visa's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UnionPay refused and issued a statement quoted by the FT:
"Both companies have a responsibility and obligation to provide
overseas transaction services to co-branded card holders.
Neither side has the right to unilaterally restrict cardholders
options for overseas payment channels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citing people in the Chinese bank card industry, the FT
said UnionPay has refused to consider new business lines with
Visa since the group asked it to observe the terms of their
agreement. It did not give further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa was not immediately reachable for comment.

&lt;p&gt; * Judge asked by court to respond to Chevron's accusations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Plaintiffs ask for $27 billion in environmental damages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Victor Gomez&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LAGO AGRIO, Ecuador, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Ecuadorean Judge
Leonardo Ordonez, who had been asked by Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to
recuse himself from hearing a $27 billion damages lawsuit
against the  U.S. oil company, will have a day to respond to
Chevron's accusations of ignoring evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The clock will start ticking once Ordonez is officially
notified of the information order, Nicolas Zambrano, a fellow
judge on the Court of Sucumbios Province, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Judge Ordonez has 24 hours to respond to Chevron's
arguments," Zambrano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was unclear when official notification would take
place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Residents of Ecuador's Amazon region have said that Texaco,
bought by Chevron in 2001, wrecked wide areas of the jungle
with faulty drilling practices in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors and the world petroleum industry are watching the
18-year-old case closely to see what precedent could be set for
other mega-lawsuits against oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month Chevron requested that Ordonez recuse himself
based on the company's view that the judge had not investigated
evidence of collusion between the plaintiffs and Richard
Cabrera, the court-appointed expert who came up with the $27
billion damages figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The motion to recuse Judge Ordonez is based on his
repeated violation of Chevron's due process rights by, among
other things, ignoring irrefutable proof of fraud committed by
plaintiffs' lawyers in the Lago Agrio litigation," said Chevron
spokesman James Craig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lago Agrio is the provincial capital of Sucumbios, a key
oil drilling province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representatives of the plaintiffs deny any collusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron has tried to have every judge on this case
recused. This is all a sideshow designed to distract attention
from the real fraud of contaminating the Rainforest and then
faking a cleanup," said plaintiffs' spokeswoman Karen Hinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which has said it remediated all areas of the
jungle for which it was responsible, has said that geologist
Cabrera colluded with the plaintiffs' lawyers and technical
consultants to develop a fraudulent damages assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the ruling looms, each side accuses the other of
presenting fraudulent evidence while a slew of related legal
actions are played out in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A previous judge stepped down from hearing the lawsuit last
year after he was recorded discussing the case with a couple of
men who secretly video-taped him with cameras stuck inside a
wristwatch and a pen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also on Thursday, a U.S. federal judge in San Francisco
granted a request by the government of Ecuador to subpoena
Diego Borja, one of the men who made the secret taping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rafael Correa, leftist president of OPEC-member Ecuador,
has said he hopes the case is won by the plaintiffs. They claim
their health and farmlands have suffered due to contamination
of the jungle.

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, Sept 16 (Reuters Life!) - For Raven-Symone, the
transformation from being a Disney child star to a 20-something
actress has taught her one major lesson -- how to say no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Raven, whose full name is Raven-Symone Christina Pearman,
started out as a child model but got her break into show
business at the age of 3 with an acting role on "The Cosby
Show."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now 24, her list of credits including the lead role in TV
sitcom "That's So Raven" which ran on Disney Channel for 2003
until 2007,  "The Cheetah Girls" movies, and the 2008 movie
"College Road Trip."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she has also branched out from on-screen acting,
releasing four albums with a fifth coming and lending her voice
to various animated series including "Kim Possible" and the
fairy Iridessa on Disney's direct-to-DVD film series "Tinker
Bell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raven talked with Reuters in an interview in Australia
where she was promoting the movie "Tinker Bell and the Great
Fairy Rescue," which will be released this week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: You've managed to make a successful transition from a
child star to 20s-something actress. What's the tip?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: "If you stay true to who you are you will find roles
that will reflect what you are trying to portray. I am growing
up, I am 24, and so I find roles that fit that. In my latest
movie, "Revenge of the Bridesmaids," I played a 27-year-old
author and I had a bottle of wine in it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: So you do pick and choose your roles?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: "Yes and I have been chugging along slowly which is how
I want my career to go. There have been projects I have said no
to as I am selective. I think it is hard now in the industry as
there are not a lot of jobs going but if you stay true to who
you are and you pick the right things your career will last
longer than if people get sick of seeing your face."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: Your parents have been very involved with your career,
moving to New York help you advance. Are they still?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: "Yes, my mom is my business manager but they no longer
have to make all the calls. They trust my opinion now and know
it is my life. Everyone gives this opinion on what I should do
but I am the last say."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: How do you keep out of the gossip magazines?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: "I just don't go to places where people take crazy shots
of me...I have fun and hit the parties and I know all the
business and gossip but it is so easy to avoid the paparazzi.
You just don't go to the hot spots. I would rather have the
publicity and the media when I have something to promote."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: You act, sing, dance. Which do you enjoy most?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: "I think it is a combination. With acting I get to act
crazy most of the time, particularly with the roles I choose,
and with dancing I can get my sneakers on and get down and
dirty. With my music I like to promote self confidence and
respectability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: Any advice for aspiring stars?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: "Do you want to be a celebrity or have a career? You
have to understand that it is hard work. What you see and read
is about 20 percent of what happens behind the big Hollywood
curtain. You get rejected more than you are accepted but it
makes you stronger and fight harder for what you want."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: What is the biggest lesson you have learnt?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: "It is OK to say no -- in real life and in Hollywood.
People are scared and think they won't be liked if they say no
but in reality you are respected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Writing by Belinda Goldsmith, Editing by Jill Serjeant)

&lt;p&gt;Judge Says Evidence Suggests Borja Was Not "Innocent Third Party" but "Longtime
Associate" Whom Chevron "Would Pay for Any Favorable Testimony" 
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Ordering that a Chevron contractor be deposed to explain his involvement in the
oil giant`s attempts to derail a multi-billion environmental lawsuit against it
in Ecuador, a federal district court judge has ruled that evidence suggests
Diego Borja is a "longtime associate of Chevron`s whom Chevron would pay for any
favorable testimony." 

San Francisco Magistrate Judge Edward M. Chen ordered Borja to appear on October
1st in San Francisco, near his San Ramon home, where Chevron paid to re-locate
him from Ecuador, after he and an accomplice secretly videotaped a judge hearing
the lawsuit. Last year Chevron released the videotape to the news media and
accused the judge of bribery. Borja lives only a few miles away from Chevron`s
corporate headquarters in San Ramon. 

"The subpoena is important because Borja has bragged about being at the
epicenter of Chevron`s fraudulent activities in Ecuador," said Karen Hinton,
spokesperson for the Amazon Defense Coalition. 

Investigations conducted by the news media and the Ecuadorians suing Chevron
found that Borja had threatened to turn evidence in the lawsuit against the
company if they did not pay him for making the videotapes and that his
accomplice, Wayne Hansen, was a convicted felon who had been sentenced for two
years in a federal prison for drug trafficking. 

In his order, Chen wrote: "there is evidence ... suggesting that Mr. Borja was
not an innocent third party who just happened to learn of the alleged bribery
scheme but rather was a long-time associate of Chevron whom Chevron would pay
for any favorable testimony." 

Chen also noted that Chevron was using the videotapes that Borja made as
evidence that the Ecuadorian court is corrupt and biased against the company and
plans to call Borja as a witness should an international arbitration court agree
to hear its claims. 

The government of Ecuador and the Ecuadorians suing Chevron are awaiting a
decision from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on their request to stay
Chevron`s arbitration claim on grounds that the international panel does not
have jurisdiction. The government of Ecuador asked Chen`s court, the Northern
District Court of California, this past Friday to order the deposition. 

Borja, who has worked for Chevron in Ecuador from at least 2004 until the video
scandal erupted in 2009, has been taped in phone conversations saying he has
incriminating evidence that would cause Chevron to lose the Ecuador
environmental litigation, according to papers filed September 10th in federal
court in San Francisco. Chevron paid for Borja to relocate to the United States,
where he remains on the company payroll while living in a luxury house abutting
a golf course in a gated community. 

Borja has failed to turn over the incriminating evidence, but representatives of
the plaintiffs have long charged the oil giant with engaging in corrupt
practices to undermine the trial. 

The court filings, made by the American law firm Winston &amp; Strawn on behalf of
Ecuadorian authorities fighting Chevron over an international arbitration claim,
seek to depose Borja about his involvement in the sting operation, conducted
with Borja`s sidekick Wayne Hansen. In 2009, both Borja and Hansen used cameras
hidden in a pen and a watch to secretly tape meetings with the trial judge
presiding over the environmental case, and supposed government officials. 

The men then turned over the tapes to Chevron, which posted them on YouTube.
Chevron initially alleged the tapes showed an attempted bribery of the judge,
but it was only the Chevron employee who discussed the bribe, and the judge was
never in a meeting when a bribe was discussed. 

Despite this fact, Chevron lawyer Andrea Neuman told the Los Angeles/San
Francisco Daily Journal that the judge was seen on the tapes "soliciting" a
bribe. It also turned out that Hansen was a convicted drug trafficker with a
history of legal problems, and had been lying about owning a remediation
company, which stood to benefit from a judgment ordering a clean-up of the oil
disaster. For more information about Borja and Hansen, see
http://chevrontoxico.com/news-and-multimedia/borja-report/. 

For more than a year, many journalists and the falsely accused judge have
questioned the credibility of Chevron`s claims. The judge and representatives of
the plaintiffs have charged that the sting was likely orchestrated by Chevron`s
U.S. legal counsel, and could expose the company to potential civil and criminal
liability in the U.S. and Ecuador, said Hinton. Chevron`s lawyers have admitted
meeting with Borja in the United States before the only meeting where the issue
of a bribe was raised. 

The court documents supporting Borja`s subpoena make it plan that:

* Chevron claimed in a press release that Borja was a "Good Samaritan," when in
fact he was working under the direction of Chevron`s legal team since at least
2004, and he himself said he was responsible for "dirty tricks" during the
trial; 
* Borja formed four dummy companies for Chevron to make the work he did for
Chevron appear independent; 
* Borja`s wife also worked for Chevron, and both he and his wife signed
documents as representatives of Severn Trent Labs, a supposedly independent
laboratory used to test soil and water samples from the litigation; 
* Borja and his Chevron "boss" attempted to infiltrate a lab used by the
plaintiffs using false names.

Among Borja`s quotes from the tapes cited in the legal papers is the following
passage: 

"&#8230; I have correspondence [with Chevron officials] that talks about things you
can`t even imagine, dude&#8230; they`re things that can make the Amazons win this just
like this [snapping fingers]&#8230; I mean, what I have is conclusive evidence, photos
of how they managed things internally." 

The tapes were made by Santiago Escobar, a childhood friend of Borja`s who lives
in Canada. They have been turned over to authorities in Ecuador and the United
States. 

Escobar had told journalists that Borja indicated to him on several occasions
that he has carried out a series of clandestine "dirty tricks" operations on
behalf of Chevron over a series of years. In June 2009, Escobar said Borja told
him he arranged "the biggest business deal of his life" that would "take down
the lawsuit" and that he had received a "ton of money" from Chevron for his
work.

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation announced today that Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and CEO,
has joined the board of Change the Equation, a CEO-led initiative launched by
President Barack Obama to cultivate widespread literacy in science, technology,
engineering and math. The company also announced it expects to spend more than
$120 million on U.S. math and science education through 2012. 

"Our success as a nation depends on strengthening America`s role as the world`s
engine of discovery and innovation," said President Obama. "I applaud ExxonMobil
and its partners for lending their resources, expertise, and their enthusiasm to
the task of strengthening America`s leadership in the 21st century by improving
education in science, technology, engineering and math." 

"High-quality education, especially in math, science, technology and
engineering, is critical for the ability of countries to successfully compete
and prosper in the 21st century," Tillerson said. 

"As the leader of a company that relies on technology and innovation, I
understand the need to support efforts to improve math and science education. I
applaud those in business and government who have joined together to establish
Change the Equation, and its mission to promote innovation and investment in
science, technology, engineering and math teaching and learning." 

Tillerson is scheduled to participate in the Change the Equationlaunch at the
White House later today and will be accompanied by Tony Zini, a third-grade
teacher from Huntington Beach, CA, who attended the Mickelson ExxonMobil
Teachers Academy. The academy is a partnership with PGA golfer Phil Mickelson
and his wife, Amy, and has equipped more than 2,600 teachers with innovative
tools to inspire students in math and science. 

"The Academy literally changed the way I teach," said Zini. "My role changed
from one of being a dispenser of information to one of a facilitator of
knowledge. My students changed from passive recipients to active participants in
the learning process." 

Tillerson said he is encouraged by the Obama Administration`s Educate to
Innovate campaign, which will greatly benefit efforts to increase the supply of
qualified math and science teachers, and he urged other businesses to engage in
educational initiatives focused on the science, technology, engineering and math
curriculum. 

ExxonMobil focuses on education initiatives that encourage students to take an
active interest in math and science and related careers, motivate students to
learn and perform well in math and science, support the development of highly
qualified math and science teachers and provide teachers with professional
development opportunities in math and science. 

A key part of ExxonMobil`s investment for 2010-2012 is the company`s continued
support for the National Math and Science Initiative, an organization whose
mission is to broaden the reach of programs that have proven to boost math and
science education in schools nationwide. 

The most recent results from NMSI`s Advanced Placement (AP) program, which
offers incentives for students to take college level math and science classes,
have been spectacular. Students at NMSI schools achieved an overall 98 percent
increase in math, science and English AP exams passed, more than seven times the
national average. Already, NMSI`s AP programs are in place in 229 high schools
in 6 states, with an enrollment of more than 50,000 students. 

In addition, NMSI`s UTeach program, which is being utilized in 22 universities,
has been praised as a model for increasing the supply of qualified math and
science teachers through rigorous undergraduate education programs at colleges
and universities across the country. 

Other initiatives by the company include the Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers
Academy, ExxonMobil Reasoning Mind Teacher Qualification Program and the
partnerships with former astronauts Bernard Harris and Sally Ride to encourage
students to study math and science. 

ExxonMobil`s investment in education in 2010 helped train and improve the math
and science skills of 600 teachers as part of the Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers
Academy, sent approximately 1,500 students to ExxonMobil Bernard Harris Summer
Science Camps and provided training to promote careers in math and science for
300 educators as part of the Sally Ride Science Academy brought to you by
ExxonMobil. 

The Bernard Harris Dream Tour, which hosted more than 26,000 middle-school
students from across the country in 2009, traveled to 10 cities in 2010
encouraging students to follow their dreams and pursue careers in math and
science. 

In addition to the funding of science, technology, engineering and math
education, another important component of ExxonMobil`s education investment is
the ExxonMobil Foundation`s Educational Matching Gift program. The program, one
of the most generous of its kind in the United States, matches employee and
retiree gifts to higher education on a 3-to-1 basis and has provided almost $400
million to universities across the United States since the program`s inception
in 1962.

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - For Raven-Symone, the transformation from being a Disney child star to a 20-something actress has taught her one major lesson -- how to say no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raven, whose full name is Raven-Symone Christina Pearman, started out as a child model but got her break into show business at the age of 3 with an acting role on "The Cosby Show."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now 24, her list of credits including the lead role in TV sitcom "That's So Raven" which ran on Disney Channel for 2003 until 2007, "The Cheetah Girls" movies, and the 2008 movie "College Road Trip."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she has also branched out from on-screen acting, releasing four albums with a fifth coming and lending her voice to various animated series including "Kim Possible" and the fairy Iridessa on Disney's direct-to-DVD film series "Tinker Bell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raven talked with Reuters in an interview in Australia where she was promoting the movie "Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue," which will be released this week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: You've managed to make a successful transition from a child star to 20s-something actress. What's the tip?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "If you stay true to who you are you will find roles that will reflect what you are trying to portray. I am growing up, I am 24, and so I find roles that fit that. In my latest movie, "Revenge of the Bridesmaids," I played a 27-year-old author and I had a bottle of wine in it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: So you do pick and choose your roles?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "Yes and I have been chugging along slowly which is how I want my career to go. There have been projects I have said no to as I am selective. I think it is hard now in the industry as there are not a lot of jobs going but if you stay true to who you are and you pick the right things your career will last longer than if people get sick of seeing your face."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: Your parents have been very involved with your career, moving to New York help you advance. Are they still?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "Yes, my mom is my business manager but they no longer have to make all the calls. They trust my opinion now and know it is my life. Everyone gives this opinion on what I should do but I am the last say."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: How do you keep out of the gossip magazines?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "I just don't go to places where people take crazy shots of me...I have fun and hit the parties and I know all the business and gossip but it is so easy to avoid the paparazzi. You just don't go to the hot spots. I would rather have the publicity and the media when I have something to promote."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: You act, sing, dance. Which do you enjoy most?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "I think it is a combination. With acting I get to act crazy most of the time, particularly with the roles I choose, and with dancing I can get my sneakers on and get down and dirty. With my music I like to promote self confidence and respectability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: Any advice for aspiring stars?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: "Do you want to be a celebrity or have a career? You have to understand that it is hard work. What you see and read is about 20 percent of what happens behind the big Hollywood curtain. You get rejected more than you are accepted but it makes you stronger and fight harder for what you want."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: What is the biggest lesson you have learnt?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "It is OK to say no -- in real life and in Hollywood. People are scared and think they won't be liked if they say no but in reality you are respected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Belinda Goldsmith, Editing by Jill Serjeant)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partnership to benefit low-income families by preserving and greening existing
housing
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
TheGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) through its Urban Investment Group (UIG)
announced today it has committed $23 million to a new fund sponsored by Jonathan
Rose Companies` Investment Practice. The fund, Rose New Jersey Green Affordable
Housing Preservation Fund LLC, will acquire existing, CRA-eligible affordable
housing in mass-transit accessible locations throughout New Jersey, with a focus
on Hudson and Essex Counties. The fund will preserve the affordability of these
assets for the long term. 

The Rose New Jersey Green Affordable Housing Preservation Fund will improve
assets through a "green" capital improvement and operations program, seeking to
replicate the success of 107-145 West 135th Street in Harlem, NY, a portfolio
asset of the Rose Smart Growth Investment Fund which has become a national model
for the greening and preservation of affordable housing. The Rose New Jersey
Green Affordable Housing Preservation Fund will obtain third-party verification
of its work through LEED or Enterprise Green Community Standards. 

The fund builds upon Jonathan Rose Companies` deep commitment to New Jersey. The
firm is currently Master Planner to the cities of Newark and Morristown and has
served as program manager for the Housing Authority of the City of Elizabeth`s
(HACE) 2004 HOPE VI revitalization plan. The firm is continuing its work with
HACE to develop a 31-unit senior building that integrates affordable housing
with supportive services. 

"We are delighted to be working with Goldman Sachs and continue our efforts to
benefit the lower-income families of New Jersey. Lower-income families spend a
disproportionate share of their income on housing, home energy and
transportation. There is an increasing need for quality affordable housing in
urban areas, near convenient forms of mass-transit," said Jonathan F.P. Rose,
President of Jonathan Rose Companies. "We are very excited about the opportunity
to bring the economic, social and environmental benefits of green retrofits to
affordable housing projects in New Jersey. Together with Goldman Sachs, we can
have a meaningful impact on the lives of lower-income families." 

UIG deploys the firm`s capital to help transform underserved U.S. communities
into sustainable and vibrant neighborhoods of choice and opportunity. UIG is a
business platform with a mission to revitalize and improve urban environments by
making loans, investments and grants that benefit low- and moderate-income
people and communities. The group has extensive experience with market-rate,
mixed-income and affordable housing projects, as well as with public-private
partnerships that stimulate mixed-use development. Since its inception in 2001,
UIG has committed nearly $1.2 billion to revitalize underserved urban
communities. This investment has facilitated the creation and preservation of
approximately 9,000 housing units - 75% of which are affordable to low, moderate
and middle-income families - as well as 630,000 sq. ft. of community facility
and approximately 900,000 sq. ft. of commercial and retail space. 

"The Urban Investment Group has traditionally focused on affordable housing
development, but also recognizes the critical importance of affordable housing
preservation," said Alicia Glen, Managing Director and Head of the Urban
Investment Group at Goldman Sachs. "As part of our firm`s comprehensive approach
to community and neighborhood revitalization, this fund will not only preserve
affordable housing, but it will also improve the quality and environmental
sustainability of New Jersey`s affordable housing stock. We are thrilled to
launch this fund with our partners to help stabilize neighborhoods and
communities in New Jersey and help keep it an affordable place to live." 

"Today`s changing regulatory climate and uncertain financial markets require
thoughtful consideration of environmental and social factors that impact the
bottom-line and create long-term value," said Wendy Rowden, Managing Director of
Jonathan Rose Companies` Investment Practice, who along with Nathan Taft will
direct the acquisitions team for the new fund. "Goldman Sachs recognizes, as do
we, that green retrofits can reduce costs for owners and tenants, mitigate
greenhouse gas emissions and provide healthier living environments, all while
revitalizing existing communities. We expect to see a number of well-located
CRA-eligible housing projects that can benefit from practical green upgrades
with a reasonable investment payback."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan has enhanced its offering of regulatory reporting services for money
market funds to assist asset managers in complying with the SEC revised Rule
2a-7 requirements. 

J.P. Morgan has enhanced its accounting and compliance monitoring services to
comply with new money market rules for higher credit quality, improved
liquidity, and shorter maturity limits, including the calculation of the new
weighted average life. J.P. Morgan is also prepared to help advisors meet
enhanced disclosures of fund level, class level and security level data required
in the new monthly public website posting and SEC Form N-MFP filing. 

The revised SEC Rule 2a-7 also requires funds to establish procedures for stress
testing, periodic testing of a funds ability to maintain a stable NAV. J.P.
Morgan`s enhanced services for money market funds features a suite of stress
tests, including: an increase in short-term interest rates; an increase in
shareholder redemptions; a downgrade of or default on portfolio securities; a
widening or narrowing of spreads between yields on an appropriate benchmark
selected by the fund for overnight interest rates and commercial paper and other
types of securities held by the fund; and a combination of events. J.P. Morgan
is anticipating that it will offer additional stress test scenarios that can
provide useful insight into how adverse market conditions can affect money
market fund performance. 

"The pressure on asset managers to keep pace with the rate and scope of
regulatory changes, including Rule 2a-7 has been significant," said Mark Kelley,
asset gatherers segment executive for J.P. Morgan Worldwide Securities Services.
"We believe we best serve our clients by responding quickly to these reforms,
consulting with our clients to fully understand their needs, and providing
timely and effective solutions."

&lt;p&gt;  PHILADELPHIA, PA and WASHINGTON, DC, Sep 16 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
Alteva, a Unified Communications (UC) solution provider headquartered in
Philadelphia, today announced another affordable way to leverage
Microsoft Communication Services integrated with Alteva's enterprise
hosted VoIP service, at the Channel Partners Conference &amp; Expo in
Washington, D.C. Together, Microsoft and Alteva are providing hosted UC
solutions for smaller businesses that integrate communication and
business processes to increase productivity, streamline costs, provide
more flexibility and increase and manage growth.

    To further make these new technologies accessible to the SMB market,
Alteva is now offering its complete UC solution to organizations
purchasing 10 or more phones through an IP phone rental program.
Companies that choose to take advantage of the rental program will not
have to put any money down to get a new Voice over IP phone system. "This
rental option will greatly improve the channel managers' ability to close
sales in this turbulent economy," said Alteva Chief Sales Officer Louis
Hayner.

    Back in April, Alteva launched the complete suite of Microsoft
Communication Services, including Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint and
Office Communications Server (OCS) with hosted voice services. Alteva can
be found on Microsoft's website along with more information at
http://microsoft.com/commservices/.

    "Hosted unified communications will change the way that businesses
communicate," said Rich Cannon, Industry Marketing Development Manager,
Communications Sector NA, Microsoft. "By integrating voice with Microsoft
Communication Services, we are opening the doors to service providers and
their partners by providing a range of functionalities to offer to the
end user that will inevitably change the landscape of their business."

    In a survey by Infonetics Research of North American companies and their
plans for deploying Unified Communications equipment and services, as
well as their ratings of leading Unified Communications vendors,
Microsoft is one of the most widely deployed Unified Communications
suppliers among survey respondents, enjoying high buyer awareness and
receiving high marks from buyers on the most important buying criteria.
"Against the backdrop of significant enterprise spending reductions on
all kinds of products, the unified communication market is holding up
remarkably well. Perhaps it shouldn't come as a surprise, as these tools
are designed to allow users to communicate and collaborate more
effectively," notes Matthias Machowinski, directing analyst for
enterprise voice and data at Infonetics Research.

    "By pushing the capability of a fully integrated communications platform
in the cloud, we are empowering small businesses by giving them the
ability to improve their employee productivity and enhance office
efficiency with a more productive way of communicating," states Alteva
Chief Innovation Officer William Bumbernick.

    Alteva will showcase its hosted UC solution at the Channel Partners
Conference &amp; Expo (September 20-22) in Washington, D.C., booth #4021. A
representative from Microsoft will also be available to discuss the
benefits of hosted Unified Communications to the small business.

    Additionally, Alteva will join several other leading industry
organizations including Cisco, ADTRAN and Smoothstone, on a Hosted vs.
Premises UC session on Tuesday, September 21st, 8:30 - 9:45 a.m.
Bumbernick will present on the hosted side of the panel, discussing the
value proposition of hosted UC and the benefits and business opportunity
it brings to the SMB market.

&lt;p&gt;Sponsors Sign on to the Successful Event Format that Applies Online Lead
Generation Strategies to a Live Setting; IT Business Edge Adds Info-Tech
Research as a Partner for the November Event
LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(Business Wire)--
IT Business Edge has announced the preliminary roster of current sponsors for
its second Midmarket CIO Forum, to be held from November 14-16, 2010 in Orlando,
Florida. The innovative event series re-imagines the technology conference
model, applying the company`s successful lead generation approach to a live
setting. The Midmarket CIO Forum connects pre-qualified IT executives with
vendors and peers in a series of face-to-face meetings in small group sessions,
allowing C-level and executive-level midmarket IT professionals to source
technology solutions, build professional relationships, and refine best
practices. 

The unique relationship-building event brings strong benefits for sponsor
companies wishing to interact with midmarket executives that are actively
reviewing solutions to meet their immediate purchasing needs. Preliminary
sponsors that are confirmed for the Orlando event include CA Technologies
(NASDAQ:CA), Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Hitachi Data Systems
(NYSE:HIT), IBM, Instantis, Rackspace Hosting (NYSE:RAX), SAS Institute,
Sentrigo, TriGeo Network Security and Webroot. 

Designed to maximize every minute and deliver information, strategies and
results, Midmarket CIO Forum attendees and sponsor companies hit the ground
running with a series of productive and efficient meetings that fill multiple
days. IT Business Edge has taken its online model of matching technology
decision makers with vendors from a virtual to physical process, delivering
no-nonsense, in-person meetings that allow attendees to drill down into
technology, share best practices and potential pitfalls in a rapid-fire set of
30 minute meetings over multiple days. All attendees are pre-qualified based on
purchase-decision-making power and organizational profile, and then flown to
Orlando, where they meet in groups of 10 to 12 with vendor sponsors. Vendors and
IT executives also have opportunities to schedule one-on-one meetings, and IT
executives participate in peer-to-peer roundtables and attend keynote speeches
throughout the three-day event. 

IT Business Edge continues to connect IT buyers and IT sellers through B2B
strategies that bring value to technology decision makers and technology
vendors. The company re-launched their flagship IT Business Edge site in early
2009, seeing profitability and increased ad revenues while other online
publishers faced losses. After rolling out multiple network sites to serve CIOs
and IT executives throughout 2009 and into 2010, the company premiered the first
Midmarket CIO Forum event in March of this year. Based on feedback, the format
encourages a level of information exchange that is difficult to match in the
traditional marketing process. 

"Since IT Business Edge hand selects, prequalifies and actually delivers IT
executives that are actively looking to purchase needed solutions, sponsors see
the Midmarket CIO Forum as a highly efficient way to jump-start their sales
process and consolidate what would normally be months of travel and logistics
into a solidly scheduled three days of closed door meetings," said Phil Branon,
president, IT Business Edge. "CIOs and IT executives see the Forum as a one-stop
source to query vendor executives directly with their specific requirements,
accomplishing specific research and building relationships in a focused setting.
Both sponsors and attendees see quantifiable benefits to the format, providing a
win/win situation for marketers, sales executives and midmarket technology
decision makers looking for solutions." 

In additional news, IT Business Edge has partnered with Info-Tech Research Group
for the upcoming Midmarket CIO Forum. Info-Tech is a leading analyst firm that
provides action-oriented advice, practical recommendations and real solutions to
IT leaders and their teams globally. The top ten-ranked research group serves
over 8,000+ IT departments subscribing to their IT research and advisory
services, with topics focusing on midmarket and enterprise issues. During the
three day event, Info-Tech will be heavily involved in educational sessions,
available to discuss research in one-on-one sessions with attendees, and provide
guidance to midmarket executives to help shape their decision processes. 

"We`re pleased to partner with Info-Tech Research Group as our analyst partner
for the November Midmarket CIO Forum and look forward to working with them
closely as we ramp up to the event," continued Branon. "We know both our
attendees and sponsors will gain significant knowledge from Info-Tech analysts
that will be on-site, and are excited to have them engaged in our Forum
activities."

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Microsoft said its new videogame "Halo: Reach" had racked up $200 million in global sales on its launch day, building strong momentum for the November debut of the Xbox 360 maker's new gaming system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Halo: Reach," the latest in the blockbuster "Halo" series, is a key title for Microsoft heading into the holiday shopping season when it and archrivals Nintendo and Sony Corp clash with new products and look to reverse a recent sales slump in the $60 billion game industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil Spencer, vice president of Microsoft Game Studios, said a lack of blockbuster games was to blame for the industry slowdown, and the success of "Halo: Reach" would support Xbox 360 console sales for the world's biggest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel really good about where the 'Halo: Reach' numbers are," he told Reuters on the sidelines of the Tokyo Game Show, adding that the number of gamers who played "Reach" on Xbox Live, its online system, had topped that of "Halo 3," the previous title in the series, without providing figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What 'Halo: Reach' numbers tell me is gamers are there. They are willing to buy the great experiences when they come out. In fact, that we are exceeding 'Halo 3' numbers out of the gate tells me that the industry is in a healthy state."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spencer said the $200 million figure made "Reach" the biggest launch of any game or movie this year. "Halo 3" garnered more than $300 million globally in its first week. First-day global sales for "Halo 3" were not available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Reach," a prequel to the main "Halo" narrative, pits players against murderous aliens in a variety of settings, and provides better graphics, more complex fighting scenarios and new ways of playing with others online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "Halo" franchise has sold more than 34 million copies in its nine-year history, boosting the popularity of Microsoft's Xbox console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The series has grossed nearly $2 billion in sales over its lifetime. The game is made by Bungie and Microsoft owns the rights to the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic version of "Reach" costs $60, with special editions priced at $80 and $250. Microsoft is also selling a special Xbox console plus the new version of the game for $400. An Xbox normally costs $200 or $300 depending on memory size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will begin selling its "Kinect" full-body motion-sensing game system from November 4, while Sony launched its "Move" motion-controlled gaming system on September 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo will sell a new version of its DS handheld device that can play games and show movies in 3D without glasses sometime before March 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft's Spencer was cautious about the outlook for 3D games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I really think 3D has to move along as a creative medium. Right now it's more of a soft medium and it kind of wears out," he said. "But in the long run, we are believers in 3D."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Isabel Reynolds; Editing by Chris Gallagher)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Indian textile firm S Kumars
Nationwide (SKMK.BO) has hired seven banks including JPMorgan
(JPM.N) and UBS AG (UBSN.VX) to raise as much as $250 million
through an IPO of one of its units, a top official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Clothing chain Reid  Taylor, which is 75 percent owned by
S Kumars and the remainder by Singapore sovereign fund GIC
[GIC.UL], will file initial papers for the share sale with the
Indian market regulator in 10 days, Nitin Kasliwal,
vice-chairman and managing director at S Kumars, told Reuters
by phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HSBC HSBC.L, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Edelweiss Capital
(EDEL.BO), JM Financial (JMSH.BO) and Antique Capital are the
deal's other book runners, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are planning to launch the issue by end of this year,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; S Kumar raised $50 million through a share sale to
institutional investors this week, sources told Reuters on
Tuesday. [ID:nBMA008445]

&lt;p&gt; PRAGUE, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Czech logistics firm CS Cargo
Group said on Thursday it has hired J.P. Morgan as a strategic
financial adviser for acquisitions on international markets and
to prepare it for a stock listing by the second half of 2011.
The group said it was looking at a possible listing of
shares in Prague and London, and also Warsaw.

 "This could be achieved by the second half of next year. Our
decision will, however, depend on market conditions," CS Cargo
director Martin Vesely said in a statement.

 CS Cargo, owned by two Czech investors, operates in the
Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland and saw revenue rise 23
percent year-on-year in the first half 2010. The group had
revenue of 189.6 million euros in 2009.

better graphics, more complex fighting scenarios and new ways of
playing with others online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "Halo" franchise has sold more than 34 million copies in
its nine-year history, boosting the popularity of Microsoft's
Xbox console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The series has grossed nearly $2 billion in sales over its
lifetime. The game is made by Bungie and Microsoft owns the
rights to the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The basic version of "Reach" costs $60, with special editions
priced at $80 and $250. Microsoft is also selling a special Xbox
console plus the new version of the game for $400. An Xbox
normally costs $200 or $300 depending on memory size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft will begin selling its "Kinect" full-body
motion-sensing game system from Nov. 4, while Sony launched its
"Move" motion-controlled gaming system on Sept. 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nintendo will sell a new version of its DS handheld device
that can play games and show movies in 3D without glasses
sometime before March 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Microsoft's Spencer was cautious about the outlook for 3D
games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I really think 3D has to move along as a creative medium.
Right now it's more of a soft medium and it kind of wears out,"
he said. "But in the long run, we are believers in 3D."

(CVX.N) paved the way for a gas supply deal with China National
Petroleum Corp (CNPC) on Thursday, reaching an agreement with
the Chinese firm to jointly explore opportunities in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron and CNPC have signed a memorandum of understanding
to pursue joint opportunities related to gas-field development
and LNG offtake in Australia, and broader cooperation on
upstream opportunities in China," Chevron said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron expects to make a final investment decision on its
proposed Wheatstone project on the western Australian coast in
2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Media reports have put the project's cost at around A$20
billion ($19 billion), out of roughly $200 billion worth of LNG
projects on the drawing board in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the agreement CNPC would also take a stake in a gas

tonne per annum (Mtpa) two-train LNG processing plant in North
Ashburton, Western Australia, but Chevron has said the capacity
of the project could eventually reach 25 Mtpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, which owns a stake of approximately 75 percent in
Wheatstone, is also developing the neighbouring Gorgon LNG
project, which will produce 15 Mtpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, Chevron said it already had about 80
percent of production from the initial two trains committed to
long-term agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tokyo Electric Power Co Inc (TEPCO) (9501.T) has a
long-term agreement for 4.1 Mtpa, while South Korea's Korea Gas
Corporation (KOGAS) agreed to buy almost 2 Mtpa. Both TEPCO and
KOGAS have taken small stakes in gas fields feeding the
project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apache Corp (APA.N) and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum
Exploration Co (KUFPEC), whose Julimar and Brunello fields will
feed the first phase of Wheatstone, also own stakes in the
project.

&lt;p&gt;  SEATTLE, WA, Sep 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The chance to own your own island doesn't arise often, but on September
30, Vendovi Island, a 216-acre island in the San Juan Archipelago, will
sell at real estate auction. J. P. King Auction Company, the nation's
leading real estate auction marketing firm, will conduct the event.

    Located off the coast of Washington, Vendovi Island has 13,000 feet of
shoreline and six beaches, providing an opportunity to own the ultimate
private escape. It has been owned as a family retreat since 1966 with
improvements including a four-bedroom home and self-contained utilities. 

    "My family has always been into big projects, and when we ran across
Vendovi Island, we knew what our next project was," said David Fluke, the
island's owner. "It has kept us very close as a family, and it's been a
great place for us to escape for the past 43 years."

    Completely self-contained, the island has utilities provided privately
onsite including a well, a water tower and tank, four generators, a
septic tank, fuel trailer tank, two fuel storage tanks and two propane
tanks. The island can be accessed by boat or floatplane and has a
protected harbor with a rock breakwater, 52-foot pier, a metal ramp and a
floating dock.

    The typography of the island ranges from sea level to 338 feet. The home
sits on 10 acres, completely manicured from the home to the harbor, and
has zoning approval for additional improvements. 

    "A complete and relaxing escape doesn't come much more ideal than this,"
said Craig King, president and CEO of J. P. King Auction Company. "Its
seclusion and beautiful scenery still comes with the conveniences of
self-contained utilities and convenient access."

    The property is available to be previewed through auction day by
scheduling a tour through J. P. King.
 
 The auction will take place on
Thursday, September 30 at 11 a.m. at the Hyatt at Olive Eight in Seattle,
located at 1635 8th Avenue. For additional information, individuals may
contact J. P. King at 800.558.5464 or visit the company's website at
www.jpking.com. 

    J. P. King Auction Company specializes in high-value properties and
portfolios such as luxury homes, developments, condominiums and land and
ranches. The company has marketed properties in all 50 states and six
countries with recent sales in Texas, Alaska, Tennessee, Oregon,
Wisconsin, Alabama and Wyoming.

&lt;p&gt;  SPOKANE, WA, Sep 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Hunt Ranch, a 15,548-acre ranch in Bridgeport, Wash., will sell at a real
estate auction on September 28 at the DoubleTree City Center in Spokane
in 31 tracts. The event will be conducted by J. P. King Auction Company,
the nation's leading real estate auction marketing firm.

    "Land is a great investment. It will always be in demand, and its
availability is decreasing," said Craig King, president and CEO of J. P.
King Auction Company. "This property is especially attractive because it
is ideal for farming, hunting, cattle grazing or recreation, and you can
buy as few or as many tracts as you like, providing the opportunity to
customize your own ranch."

    Wheat is currently being grown as the main crop on the farm, and Tract 20
has several barns, sheds, silos and two newly-remodeled farmhouses.
Thirty of the tracts also have FSA government contracts, and qualified
buyers have the option to take over the contracts.

    "The property is quite diverse. We have beautiful views, large tracts of
land, privacy and tranquility," said Rusty Hunt, one of the property's
owners. Hunt Ranch has been in his family since his grandfather purchased
it, and he and his dad have both added to the family property. "It looks
over the Columbia River and the Cascade Mountains, and it features
everything from flat plateaus to lakes and meadows." 

    The property also has a large wildlife population. Hunters can find Sage
Grouse, Sharptail Grouse, Mule Deer, ducks, geese, quail, dove, Chukar
Partridge and Hungarian Partridge onsite, and it is also surrounded by
hunting and fishing destinations.

    An auction representative will be available through September 27 from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. for property previews. To schedule a tour, call
256.490.9966.

    The auction will take place on Tuesday, September 28 at 11 a.m. at the
DoubleTree Hotel City Center located at 322 N Spokane Falls Court in
Spokane, Wash. For additional information, individuals may contact J. P.
King at 800.558.5464 or visit the company's website at www.jpking.com.

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Yesterday, Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) submitted expert testimony from leading
scientists to the Provincial Court of Sucumb&#237;os in Lago Agrio, Ecuador
demonstrating that there is no evidentiary basis for the lawsuit against the
company. Chevron also has renewed its motion for dismissal of the case because
there is no evidence of liability and because there is overwhelming proof of
fraud on the part of the plaintiffs` lawyers. 

In response to a parallel filing by the plaintiffs` lawyers, the company issued
the following statement: 

"Numerous Federal Courts in the United States have stated that the trial in
Ecuador is marred by fraud and misconduct. The views of these Courts speak for
themselves. Chevron views the latest filing by the plaintiffs` lawyers as a
continuation of a strategy to commit fraud." 

Key Excerpts from U.S. Courts Follow

Over the last several months, Federal Courts throughout the United States have
authorized discovery producing an overwhelming record of misconduct on the part
of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs` lawyers. The evidence, in the form of film
outtakes from the movie Crude, sworn deposition testimony from the plaintiffs`
own consultants, and documents produced through discovery has led United States
Federal Judges and Magistrates to declare that the trial in Ecuador has been
marred by fraud that goes to the heart of the case: 

A Magistrate in New Mexico wrote, "The release of many hours of the outtakes has
sent shockwaves through the nation`s legal communities, primarily because the
footage shows, with unflattering frankness, inappropriate, unethical and perhaps
illegal conduct. In the film itself, Attorney Donziger brags of his ex parte
contacts with the Ecuadorian judge, confessing that he would never be allowed to
do such things in the United States, but, in Ecuador, everyone plays dirty. The
outtakes support, in large part, [Chevron`s] contentions of corruption in the
judicial process. They show how non-governmental organizations, labor
organizations, community groups and others were organized by the Lago Agrio
attorneys to place pressure on the new Ecuadorian government to push for a
specific outcome in the litigation, and how the Ecuadorian government intervened
in ongoing litigation." 

Subsequently, the Magistrate wrote that, "The undersigned viewed those outtakes
and finds that they are sufficient to establish a prima facie case of attempted
fraudulent activity by attorney Donziger, including directing Respondents to
`extrapolate` scientific evidence that does not exist, and having a purportedly
neutral expert sign his name to a report that was actually prepared by
Plaintiffs` attorneys and experts without Chevron`s knowledge." 

A Magistrate in North Carolina wrote, "While this court is unfamiliar with the
practices of the Ecuadorian judicial system, the court must believe that the
concept of fraud is universal, and that what has blatantly occurred in this
matter would in fact be considered fraud by any court. If such conduct does not
amount to fraud in a particular country, then that country has larger problems
than an oil spill." 

In New Jersey, a Judge stated that, "The provision of materials and information
by consultants on the litigation team of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs in what
appears to be a secret and an undisclosed aid of a supposedly neutral
court-appointed expert in this Court`s view constitutes a prima facie
demonstration of a fraud on the tribunal." 

In California, a Magistrate stated that, "I feel that the crime fraud exception
is implicated by the ghost writing that was done. The two orders from the
Ecuadorian tribunal were very clear that Mr. Cabrera was to give to the Court
his independent intellectual work, and while he may adopt certain findings and
conclusions of other experts, that adoption may occur only after he has
independently assessed the integrity and validity of those findings and
conclusions and notified the Court of such adoption, the reason for his
adoption, and the process by which he came to the conclusion that such adoption
was consistent with his own duties to the Court. 

"It appears that Mr. Cabrera has failed to do that, implicating the crime fraud
exception, and Chevron has a right to explore whether there has indeed been a
violation of the -- whether indeed the crime fraud exception is implicated as
directly as the evidence suggests it has been." 

Subsequently, a Judge in California ruled that "The Court is persuaded by the
reasons explained by Magistrate Judge McCurine as well as other U.S. courts who
have addressed the issue, that the crime-fraud exception applies. There is ample
evidence in the record that the Ecuadorian Plaintiffs secretly provided
information to Mr. Cabrera, who was supposedly a neutral court-appointed expert,
and colluded with Mr. Cabrera to make it look like the opinions were his own." 

Meanwhile, the outtakes from Crude reveal the plaintiffs` lawyers` true damages
strategy. On film, plaintiffs` lawyer Steven Donziger states, "We ask for much
more than what we expect. If for example, if we believe three million to clean
and we ask for eighteen billion, are they going to regard us as if we`re crazy,
or will the judge see, `eh, I can give Texaco about eighty percent of what they
want, then I`m going to give them three billion.` Then, if we ask for eighteen
billion&#8230; But as a concept, I ask, do we ask for much more than what we really
want as a strategy? Do we ask for eight and expect three, so that [the judge]
says, `Look, Texaco, I cut down the largest part.`" It is clear that the
plaintiffs` lawyers` latest filing is a continuation of this strategy. 

Evidence now before the Lago Agrio court demonstrates that the plaintiffs`
lawyers have engaged in fraud through the use of forged testimony, fabricated
evidence, intimidation and threats against judges, and collusion with
purportedly "impartial" court experts to "jack up" a damages claim that far
exceeds the scope of their complaint. The only reliable evidence in the record
exonerates Chevron and Texaco from any liability, showing that Texaco properly
performed the agreed remediation of its share of oil sites in Ecuador, and that
any remaining remediation in Ecuador is the responsibility of Petroecuador.
Accordingly, Chevron has petitioned the Lago Agrio court to dismiss the lawsuit,
and to refer the matter of the plaintiffs` lawyers` fraud to Ecuador`s Office of
the Public Prosecutor for criminal investigation.

&lt;p&gt;Arizona Father of Four Receives Keys to Home Valued at $200,000
ANAHEIM, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Bernardo family`s first trip to the Disneyland Resort was one they soon
won`t forget. Not only did Michael and Lisa Bernardo get to show their kids
around the famed park for the very first time, they also picked up the keys to
the brand new $200,000 Taylor Morrison home they won this past summer. 

"Simply unreal," said Michael Bernardo, who in July was declared the winner of
the 2010 Taylor Morrison Dream Home Giveaway. "This has easily been the best
experience of our lives." 

After receiving the key to their new home, Bernardo and his family were given a
tour of the Innoventions Dream Home exhibit before embarking on his family`s
weekend vacation at the resort. This exhibit was developed by the Disneyland
Resort in collaboration with Taylor Morrison, Microsoft and HP and was the
inspiration for the contest. 

Bernardo, who lives in El Mirage, Ariz., entered the popular contest every day
during the promotion period. His 119 entries resulted in his winning the
$200,000 grand prize, perfect for his family, which includes two sons, two
daughters, his wife and his mother. 

Because of his large family, Bernardo said he and his wife tried to find the
most spacious house they could afford without sacrificing his other hobbies,
which include a love of cooking and restoring vintage cars. The couple chose the
two-story, three-car garage Legend floor plan at Del Rio Ranch in Avondale,
Ariz., as their new home. 

Construction of the home is underway and Charlie Enochs, division president of
Taylor Morrison Arizona, said the home should be finished by the holidays. 

"We`re very pleased to have the winner of this great contest come from Arizona
again," said Enochs, who oversaw the construction of the home for the 2009 Dream
Home Giveaway winner, Kristin Pierce, at Stratland Estates in Gilbert, Arizona.
"If the previous years` winners are any indication, the Bernardos are going to
love their new home."

&lt;p&gt;Top American Technical Experts Weigh In On High-Profile Damages Case 


LAGO AGRIO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
A group of highly respected American technical and medical experts, using
conservative assumptions, have concluded that it could cost Chevron up to tens
of billions of dollars to clean up oil waste discharged into Ecuador`s
rainforest and compensate local communities for the damage it caused over the 26
years it operated a large oil concession, according to valuation assessments
submitted Thursday to the Ecuador trial court. 

Relying on official Ecuador census and mortality data, as well as relevant
studies, the analysis finds that what is believed to be the world`s largest
oil-related catastrophe likely will cause nearly 10,000 Ecuadorians to be at
significant risk of dying from cancer by the year 2080 even if Chevron cleans up
in the next ten years. The numbers could rise substantially if no remediation
takes place. 

The assessments analyzed numerous categories of damages, including soil and
groundwater contamination, drinking water, excess cancer deaths, natural
resources damage, and health costs. While the high end of the damages range of
$113 billion is substantially greater than the $27.3 billion damages number set
forth in a report in 2008 by court-appointed expert Richard Cabrera, some
categories of damages were found to be lower than those estimated in that
report. 

For example, the combined cost of clean-up for soil and groundwater
contamination in the new analysis - which relied mostly on Chevron`s own
internal environmental audits -- at the high end of the range was roughly $1.8
billion, compared to more than the $5 billion estimate in the earlier Cabrera
report. The analysis found the existence of other categories of contamination,
such as oil sediment in rivers, but they could not be accurately quantified. 

The differences in the soil and groundwater remediation numbers is largely a
function of the fact the new analyses used far more conservative assumptions
than the Cabrera report. For example, the Cabrera report concluded soil should
be cleaned to a depth of five meters, while the recent analysis assumed only
four meters. 

A large portion of the damages in the new analyses can be attributed to
Chevron`s "unjust enrichment" - money saved by using sub-standard drilling
practices - and compensation for potential excess cancer deaths that have a
significant chance of occurring in coming decades due to exposure to
cancer-causing crude oil. Most of the damages in the Cabrera report were from
the same two categories. 

"The new valuation analyses are different, in many ways, than the damage
assessment report from 2008 but both present reasonable and sound assessments
based on the evidence," said Pablo Fajardo, the lead lawyer for the Amazonian
communities suing the oil giant. 

"The Ecuador court has more than enough evidence and expert analyses to
determine the cost of remediating the extensive oil pollution that has
devastated thousands in the region for decades," Fajardo added. "There are more
than 100 different expert reports in evidence, dozens of them produced by
Chevron, which overwhelmingly demonstrate extensive contamination at all of
Chevron`s former oil production facilities." 

The new damages analyses came in a supplemental report submitted by lawyers for
the dozens of Amazon communities suing Chevron for what is believed to be the
world`s worst oil-related disaster - larger than the size of the BP Gulf spill.
Unlike the BP Gulf spill, the Ecuador disaster has been contaminating the
rainforest ecosystem for almost 50 years. 

Ecuadorian law provides that the court can consider the supplemental information
when reaching a decision, but under Ecuadorian law the judge is under no
obligation to adopt the estimates. Chevron, which has attacked the credibility
of Cabrera`s damages assessment, had the opportunity to submit its own
valuations analysis but the company previously indicated it would boycott the
process. 

Lawyers for the affected communities have asserted Chevron has been trying to
sabotage the Ecuador trial by bombarding the court with frivolous motions and
boycotting any part of the case that addresses damages. The indigenous and
farmer communities first filed the lawsuit in 1993 in U.S. federal court, but it
was shifted to Ecuador at Chevron`s request. 

"The information in this submission is highly significant because it reflects
clearly that there is a terrible oil-related disaster in Ecuador in the area
where Chevron operated," said Fajardo. 

"What these analyses make chillingly clear is that thousands of Ecuadorian
citizens may well contract and die of cancer in the coming decades because of
Chevron`s contamination," he added. 

The analyses, based largely on technical information found in the 200,000-page
trial record and relevant studies, found the following damages:

* Soil Remediation: A conservative estimate of potential costs to remediate
contaminated soils at all of Chevron`s 378 former oil production facilities in
Ecuador ranges from $487 million to $949 million depending on the clean-up
standard used. The actual cost could be significantly higher. 
* Groundwater Remediation: Based on data in the trial record, the range for
clean-up of groundwater is $396 million to $911 million. 
* Rivers and wetlands: Data indicates that sediment contamination exists, but no
clean-up number was presented pending further investigation. 
* Health Care: Using recent data from the World Health Organization and the
Ecuadorian Ministry of Health, an estimated $1.4 billion will be needed to
provide health care to the thousands of affected persons over the next three
decades. 
* Drinking Water: Degradation of the environment with petroleum hydrocarbons
associated with Chevron`s production activities has been documented at numerous
locations. The cost of a comprehensive series of regional water systems is
estimated to be between approximately $326 million to $541 million. 
* Excess Cancer Deaths: Actuarial life-table methodology demonstrates that the
aggregate cost of excess cancer deaths due to exposure to oil contamination in
the area where Chevron operated could be approximately $69.7 billion. This is
the based on the value of a statistical life used by averaging relevant data
used in the U.S. court system and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
($7 million for each lost life), and comparing it with official Ecuador
mortality data and census information. Up to 9,950 people in the affected area
will face a significant risk of dying from cancer in the coming decades even if
the area is remediated in the next ten years.

Even if the analysis stops in 1990 - the year when Chevron ceased being the
operator of the oil fields - the aggregate cost of excess cancer deaths is still
estimated at $12.1 billion based on 1,732 deaths from cancer. (The earlier
Cabrera report estimated 1,401 deaths from cancer, but he did not project future
deaths.)

* Natural Resources Losses: This estimate is based on the evidence that
concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons and harmful metals in soil,
groundwater, and surface water have exceeded levels considered to be toxic to
terrestrial and aquatic biota. While determining the exact values of service
losses in the rainforest with precision is not possible, it is not clear that
further studies would produce a range of plausible values different from the
range posited earlier by Mr. Cabrera - approximately $874 million to $1.7
billion, depending on the methodology employed. 
* Unjust Enrichment: Chevron`s unjust enrichment ranges from $4.57 billion to
$9.46 billion assuming a 100% probability of detection and ultimate payment, and
from $18.26 billion to $37.86 billion assuming a 25% probability of detection
and ultimate payment. Given the evidence of Chevron`s malfeasance in Ecuador,
the plaintiffs assume the company had at best a 25% probability of detection and
ultimate payment, and therefore the unjust enrichment award should at minimum
range from $18.26 billion to $37.86 billion. This is a conservative figure, as
in reality it is highly unlikely that Chevron believed it had more than a 10%
probability of detection and ultimate payment. 
* Cultural Impacts on Indigenous Groups: Representatives of the Amazonian
communities, noting the acute interdependence between indigenous groups and the
rainforest ecosystem, analyzed the impact of hydrocarbon contamination on
indigenous culture. The team reviewed economic valuations to repair the loss of
cultural and ancestral practices, including a program to purchase unspoiled
land, and to construct pools of native fishes and centers to restore flora and
fauna. The cost for this restoration is estimated at $481.5 million.

The analyses were submitted by the following scientists and technical experts:

* Douglas Allen, who has 25 years of experience as an environmental consultant
working in soil and groundwater remediation; 
* Dr. Lawrence Barnthouse, one of the nation`s leaders in ecological risk
assessment and a Fellow at the American Association for the Advancement of
Science; 
* Carlos Emilio Picone, a medical doctor certified in critical care medicine and
Chief of the Pulmonary Section at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C.; 
* Jonathan S. Shefftz, a financial economist from Harvard who has performed
economic modeling on theories of unjust enrichment for the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy; 
* Dr. Daniel L. Rourke, who has extensive experience applying advanced
statistical techniques to solve complex litigation problems; and 
* Dr. Robert Paolo Scardina, a civil and environmental engineer and member of
the faculty at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute.

&lt;p&gt;A Comprehensive Securities Class Action Claims Filing Solution for INFOVISA
Clients 
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Securities class action settlements have become a major part of the financial
landscape. Over $32 billion have been distributed in the last five years-and due
to recent market turmoil, it is estimated that $200 billion will be distributed
to claimants over the next decade. While bank trust departments have a fiduciary
duty to file claims on behalf of their clients, many are overworked and
understaffed. Trust departments may simply not be prepared for the coming wave
of securities litigations in the next few years. 

INFOVISA, www.infovisa.com, a leading independent provider of data processing
systems and related services for bank trust departments, trust companies,
universities, and other investors, today announces an agreement with Chicago
Clearing Corporation (CCC), www.chicagoclearing.com, a leading claims filing
specialist in securities class action claims. This strategic relationship will
allow clients to keep up with all securities settlement funds, avoid the hassle
of filing claims, and remain focused on their core competencies. 

INFOVISA has built an extract that will allow clients to seamlessly deliver
their historical data and outsource the entire claim filing process to CCC.
Outsourcing to CCC will remove the burden of filing claims internally, and save
INFOVISA clients both time and resources. CCC`s comprehensive services include
retrieving and compiling trade data, searching for relevant trades, and filing
claims. CCC provides online monitoring of all potential securities class
settlements as well as reporting on all cases CCC has filed for each client. CCC
also responds to ongoing claims administrators` requests, and receives,
reconciles, and distributes proceeds per client direction. 

There is no direct cost to INFOVISA clients for this service. CCC`s fee is
contingent upon receipt of settlement funds only. 

Mike Dinges, President of INFOVISA, says: "Our partnership with Chicago Clearing
Corporation will allow our clients to file claims on behalf of their customers
as regulations require, and do so with no out of pocket expense. Those clients
who are not managing claims currently can begin doing so without dedicating
internal resources; those clients that are currently managing their own claims
can let Chicago Clearing Corporation handle it for them and redeploy those
resources to other areas of their companies. Additionally, because our system
does not purge history, our clients will be able to provide robust data to
Chicago Clearing Corporation for use in claims management." 

James Tharin, CCC`s CEO, said, "We are looking forward to partnering with
INFOVISA. This arrangement will allow us to bring substantial benefit to an
expanding client base as we continue in our mission to retrieve the funds owed
to harmed investors. INFOVISA`S clients can rest assured that Chicago Clearing
Corporation's considerable experience, expertise, and dedication makes us
especially qualified to manage their class action settlement claims." 

CCC is the claims filing specialist in securities class action settlements. With
17 years in the class action arena, CCC is uniquely qualified to file and manage
securities class action claims for an assortment of investors. CCC`s client base
includes bank trust departments, investment advisors, money managers, mutual
funds, pension funds, hedge funds, brokerage firms, family offices, high net
worth individuals, market makers, specialists, proprietary trading firms, and
professional traders. 

INFOVISA is an independent provider of data processing systems and related
services for bank trust departments, independent trust companies, not-for-profit
foundations, colleges, and universities. INFOVISA was founded in 1992 when it
was determined that there was a need for a Windows based, automated performance
measurement system. Shortly thereafter INFOVISA became the trust industry's
first company to release such a system. ETR (Enhanced Trust Reporting) proved to
be a very powerful solution for many users and INFOVISA quickly became a leader
in the industry. INFOVISA was the first company to develop a complete Windows
based, real-time trust accounting system - MAUI. MAUI is made up of individual
modules providing the user with a customized system to meet their needs. Through
a combination of proprietary software coupled with Application Service Provider
(ASP) services, clients of INFOVISA are provided with a robust and comprehensive
technology solution. Never before has the wealth management industry had such
leading edge technology at their fingertips.

&lt;p&gt; * To manage Bharti's IT operations in 16 countries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Contract planned for 10 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * IBM manages Bharti's IT in India
 (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW DELHI, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Bharti Airtel (BRTI.BO) has
selected IBM (IBM.N) to manage computing technology and
services that power its mobile networks in 16 African countries
in a 10-year planned agreement, the companies said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An agreement would be finalised in the fourth quarter, the
companies said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bharti was the first Indian mobile operator to outsource
its network to save on costs, a strategy that helped it on its
way to become the country's top mobile operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM already manages Bharti's IT infrastructure in India in
a 10-year deal that began in 2004. The deal had an initial
value of about $750 million, but is estimated to have grown
manifold as it is linked to Bharti's subscriber and revenue
growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Bharti Airtel plans to replicate the success of its
relationship with IBM by lowering the barrier to entry for the
people of Africa to own a mobile device," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bharti said the partnership will help it scale its network
and systems to more than 100 million African customers by 2012,
from about 36 million currently.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Adding Spiriva to conventional therapy improves symptoms in patients whose asthma is poorly controlled and gives them more days without breathing problems, researchers reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spiriva, co-marketed by Pfizer and the privately held Boehringer Ingelheim, is already used for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and works by blocking the nerves that can tighten the muscles surrounding the airways to the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some asthma patients need more than the low dose of the corticosteroids they are typically given to inhale, but doctors fear more aggressive treatment can have drawbacks, including making the asthma worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking a better treatment, the researchers tested different regimens on 210 patients, all of whom continued inhaling a low dose of corticosteroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 14 weeks they received a double dose of the steroid, during another 14-week stretch they added Spiriva, known generically as tiotropium, and for a third testing period they inhaled salmeterol, a drug known as a beta agonist that relaxes the muscles lining the breathing passages of the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spiriva worked at least as well as salmeterol and better than doubling the steroid dose, according to the results, released online by the New England Journal of Medicine and at a meeting of the European Respiratory Society in Barcelona, Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who got Spiriva had improved symptoms and a greater ability to force air from their lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers estimated that long-term treatment would give the patients an extra 48 days a year without breathing problems, compared to 19 days if the steroid dose were simply doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tiotropium relaxes smooth muscle in the airways through a different mechanism than beta agonists, and thus may help people who do not respond well to current recommended treatments," Dr. Stephen Peters of Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who worked on the study, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it did not work for everyone.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM, joining the deal-making frenzy, plans to buy data analytics company Netezza Corp for $1.7 billion to expand in technology services and help clients better analyze market information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM agreed to pay $27 per share for Netezza, the companies said on Monday, a 10 percent premium from Friday's closing price of $24.60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netezza's stock rose 14.9 percent on Monday to close at $28.27, slightly above the offer price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said another offer could emerge, given a recent resurgence of dealmaking in the sector, including a bidding war between Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc over data storage company 3PAR Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As such, we recommend investors to keep their position rather than sell with the idea that another bidder may appear," said Roth Capital Partners analyst Nathan Schneiderman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veteran technology banker Frank Quattrone's Qatalyst Group, which advised 3Par, also advised Netezza, according to a source familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest deal comes as International Business Machines Corp is shifting its focus from increasingly commoditized hardware to higher-margin software and services, particularly analytics, which help clients analyze market data to plot trends or prevent fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marlborough, Massachusetts-based Netezza sells appliances that combine analytical software and hardware to help, for example, online dating site eHarmony comb through online profiles and massive Web data to figure out who might be a good match for a particular user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said analytics, which accounted for about $9 billion of IBM's $95.76 billion in revenue last year, was a significant growth opportunity for the company.

Dell may be smarting from its loss against HP over 3PAR while HP may be giving its wallet a rest, some said. HP followed the 3PAR deal with a $1.5 billion offer for security company ArcSight,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is going to be a stretch for HP to get into this bidding," said Morningstar analyst Sunit Gogia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month saw an unseasonable burst of deal making, including Intel Corp's agreement to buy McAfee Inc for $7.7 billion. Thomson Reuters data showed total announced deals of $262 billion in August, the highest for the month since 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With low interest rates, record cash holdings and low stock values, analysts say more deals are likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another trend driving deals in technology is the ambition among large vendors to become one-stop shops selling everything from networking and servers to software and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said in May that it planned to spend about $20 billion in acquisitions through 2015 to expand its software and services business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's top rivals include HP, Oracle Corp and Cisco Systems Inc, all of which have announced new services and acquisitions in an effort to offer a broader set of technology services to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also said they expected the deal to spark interest in other data analytics companies including Teradata and smaller, privately owned companies such as ParAccel and Vertica. Teradata shares closed up, $2.59, or 7.5 percent, at $37.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netezza, which also makes data warehouse and monitoring equipment, reported fiscal second-quarter revenue of $63.8 million last month, up 45 percent from a year earlier. It also raised its full-year revenue forecast, a rare move in a sector fretting about a possible double-dip in technology spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of IBM's recent acquisitions have been small, low-key deals.

 (Updates with market close, analyst's comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ritsuko Ando&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N), joining the
deal-making frenzy, plans to buy data analytics company Netezza
Corp NZ.N for $1.7 billion to expand in technology services
and help clients better analyze market information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM agreed to pay $27 per share for Netezza, the companies
said on Monday, a 10 percent premium from Friday's closing
price of $24.60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Netezza's stock rose 14.9 percent on Monday to close at
$28.27, slightly above the offer price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts said another offer could emerge, given a
recent resurgence of dealmaking in the sector, including a
bidding war between Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Dell Inc
DELL.O over data storage company 3PAR Inc (PAR.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As such, we recommend investors to keep their position
rather than sell with the idea that another bidder may appear,"
said Roth Capital Partners analyst Nathan Schneiderman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Veteran technology banker Frank Quattrone's Qatalyst Group,
which advised 3Par, also advised Netezza, according to a source
familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For a Breakingviews column see [ID:nN20261941].)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest deal comes as International Business Machines
Corp is shifting its focus from increasingly commoditized
hardware to higher-margin software and services, particularly
analytics, which help clients analyze market data to plot
trends or prevent fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marlborough, Massachusetts-based Netezza sells appliances
that combine analytical software and hardware to help, for
example, online dating site eHarmony comb through online
profiles and massive Web data to figure out who might be a good
match for a particular user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said analytics, which accounted for about $9 billion of
IBM's $95.76 billion in revenue last year, was a significant
growth opportunity for the company. IBM employs 6,000 analytics
consultants, while Netezza has 500 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM's offer raised speculation that other data analytics
companies such as Teradata Corp (TDC.N) could be targeted
next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An IBM executive said it chose Netezza due in part to its
ability to analyze online data quickly. The two companies also
are partners, with Netezza using IBM hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Speed is critical," said Arvind Krishna, general manager
of information management at IBM. "Clients don't have the
patience to wait for weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other Netezza customers include retailers as well as
financial exchange operator NYSE Euronext NYX.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUATTRONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quattrone's involvement could be another reason investors
might expect Netezza to attract a higher offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quattrone was widely credited with creating a bidding
frenzy over an obscure and unprofitable data storage company.
HP ultimately won the deal with a premium that many analysts
said was unreasonably high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Qatalyst did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jayson Noland, an analyst at Robert W. Baird, said

(SAPG.DE) could also step forward for Netezza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We assume these firms have already discussed this
opportunity with bankers," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others, however, were more cautious about a rival bid. Dell
may be smarting from its loss against HP over 3PAR while HP may
be giving its wallet a rest, some said. HP followed the 3PAR
deal with a $1.5 billion offer for security company ArcSight
ARST.O,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is going to be a stretch for HP to get into this
bidding," said Morningstar analyst Sunit Gogia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month saw an unseasonable burst of deal making,
including Intel Corp's (INTC.O) agreement to buy McAfee Inc
MFE.N for $7.7 billion. Thomson Reuters data showed total
announced deals of $262 billion in August, the highest for the
month since 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With low interest rates, record cash holdings and low stock
values, analysts say more deals are likely. [ID:nSGE68C0H6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another trend driving deals in technology is the ambition
among large vendors to become one-stop shops selling everything
from networking and servers to software and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said in May that it planned to spend about $20 billion
in acquisitions through 2015 to expand its software and
services business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM's top rivals include HP, Oracle Corp ORCL.O and Cisco
Systems Inc (CSCO.O), all of which have announced new services
and acquisitions in an effort to offer a broader set of
technology services to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts also said they expected the deal to spark interest
in other data analytics companies including Teradata and
smaller, privately owned companies such as ParAccel and
Vertica. Teradata shares closed up, $2.59, or 7.5 percent, at
$37.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Netezza, which also makes data warehouse and monitoring
equipment, reported fiscal second-quarter revenue of $63.8

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Paris Hilton pleaded guilty on Monday to cocaine possession and was fined $2,000 by a Las Vegas judge and ordered to complete 200 hours of community service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hilton, 29, was also given a one-year, suspended sentence and warned that any new arrests in Las Vegas would result in her going to jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilton could have been jailed for up to four years on the cocaine possession charge, but she reached a plea deal with prosecutors over her arrest on the Las Vegas strip on August 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The purpose of this is that you change your conduct," Las Vegas justice Joe Bonaventure told Hilton at a brief hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I assure you that Clark County Detention Center is not the Waldorf Astoria," Bonaventure added. The Waldorf Astoria in New York is part of the Hilton group of hotels founded by Paris Hilton's great-grandfather Conrad Hilton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sometimes actress and celebrity socialite and her boyfriend, nightclub manager Cy Waits, were stopped by police just before midnight after they said they smelled marijuana coming from their vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilton was charged with possessing 0.8 grams of cocaine found in a purse. The former reality TV star initially denied the purse belonged to her, resulting in an additional charge of obstructing police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was in possession as well as telling the officer the purse was not mine," Hilton, dressed demurely in a silk blouse and black skirt, told the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked what drug she was carrying, Hilton answered, "Cocaine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilton spent three weeks in jail in Los Angeles in 2007 for violating probation on a reckless driving charge. In July, she was briefly detained in South Africa on suspicion of marijuana possession but was released without charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her lawyer, David Chesnoff, told reporters outside the Las Vegas court that Hilton was contrite "and accepts responsibility for her actions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was treated like anybody else would be treated under the circumstances," Chesnoff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Bob Tourtellotte)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
Robbins Umeda LLP has commenced an investigation into possible breaches of
fiduciary duty and other violations of state law by members of the Board of
Directors ("Board") of Netezza Corporation ("Netezza" or the "Company") (NYSE:
NZ) in connection with their efforts to sell Netezza to International Business
Machines Corp. ("IBM") (NYSE: IBM). If the transaction is completed, Netezza
shareholders will receive $27.00 in cash for each share of Netezza common stock
they hold. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of
2010. 

Robbins Umeda LLP's investigation concerns whether Netezza's Board undertook a
fair process to obtain fair consideration for all shareholders of Netezza.
Specifically, our investigation concerns whether the Company's Board breached
their fiduciary duties to Netezza shareholders by failing to adequately shop the
Company before entering into the transaction with IBM. Notably, Netezza's second
quarter earnings were $63.8 million, significantly higher than consensus
estimates of $53.9 million. In light of this strong quarter, Netzza raised its
annual outlook to revenue growth of 30% for the Company's 2011 fiscal year.
Furthermore, Netezza shares are currently trading well above the $27.00
consideration from IBM. 

If you are a shareholder of Netezza, plan to continue to hold your shares, and
would like more information about your rights as a shareholder, please contact
attorney Gregory E. Del Gaizo at 800-350-6003 or by e-mail at

&lt;p&gt;Tickets to the Kentucky event available at secretariat.com starting Wednesday,
Sept. 22, 2010
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Studios announced plans today for a special advance screening of
the upcoming motion picture "Secretariat" to benefit the Secretariat Foundation.
The Oct. 3, 2010, event, which takes place five days before the film`s Oct. 8
release date, will be held at the Kentucky Theater in Lexington, Ky., with a
cocktail reception following the screening at Lexington`s Portofino Restaurant. 

"Secretariat`s victories have stirred people`s emotions for decades, but with
this film, we`ve been swept up again with the incredible story of this horse and
its owner, Penny Chenery," said Rich Ross, chairman of The Walt Disney Studios.
"In reliving Secretariat`s extraordinary achievements, we can all appreciate
Penny`s passion and determination, and the need to support her efforts on behalf
of the Secretariat Foundation." 

"It gives me great pleasure that the advance screening of `Secretariat` in
Kentucky will help benefit the Secretariat Foundation," said Chenery. "Though I
now reside in Colorado, Kentucky is still `home` to me. I am just delighted that
the many friends and fans there can enjoy this wonderful film while directly
supporting the industry-related causes dearest to me." 

The film, shot on location in Kentucky and Louisiana, captures a host of fan
favorite locales, including Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby.
Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear and First Lady Jane Beshear will attend special
advance screening. "The spectacular story of Secretariat is tightly woven into
the horse legacy of Kentucky - truly, this film could not have been made
anywhere else but here in the horse capital of the world," said Governor
Beshear. "I worked hard to create film credits as part of our new economic
development incentives package that will attract movie projects like
Secretariat, and our efforts have clearly paid off. I speak for the citizens of
the Commonwealth when I say we can`t wait to see Big Red on the big screen." 

Tickets, starting at $125 per person, include general admission to the screening
and cocktail reception. The $250 per person ticket also includes reserved
seating at the screening and reception. Tickets can be purchased beginning

ABOUT THE MOVIE

Based on the remarkable true story, "Secretariat" chronicles the spectacular
journey of the 1973 Triple Crown winner. Housewife and mother Penny Chenery
(Diane Lane) agrees to take over her ailing father`s Virginia-based Meadow
Stables, despite her lack of horse-racing knowledge. Against all odds, Chenery -
with the help of veteran trainer Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich) - manages to
navigate the male-dominated business, ultimately fostering the first Triple
Crown winner in 25 years and what may be the greatest racehorse of all time. For

The Secretariat Foundation was created by Penny Chenery to serve as a non-profit
charitable organization within the Thoroughbred and equine-related industries.
Long a supporter of many charities and research programs, Mrs. Chenery named the
Foundation after her great champion with a specific purpose - to use

Foundation is to assist and support various charities and organizations that
meet the Thoroughbred racing community's needs including:

By joining under the banner of Secretariat's incredible legacy, the Secretariat
Foundation will work to enhance the welfare of the Thoroughbred community. By

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Singer Bruno Mars, whose hit "Just the Way You Are" is rising up record charts, was arrested early Sunday morning in a Las Vegas hotel for cocaine possession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mars, whose real name is Peter Hernandez, was arrested at 2:40 a.m. pdt after police were called to the Hard Rock Hotel when a bathroom attendant saw a man, later identified as Hernandez, with "a baggy of white powder," according to a police report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police tested the powder and concluded it was cocaine. The report also stated the singer admitted doing a foolish thing and said he had never used drugs before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Mars broke into the ranks of rising stars with featured vocals on B.o.B's "Nothin' on You" and Travie McCoy's "Billionaire."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mars is set to release his debut album, "Doo-Wops  Hooligans," on October 5.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Core CPI Remains Unchanged

Right now, the risk of deflation is greater than the risk of runaway inflation.
This report does little to alleviate those fears, although the somewhat hotter
than expected PPI yesterday did help a bit. We are not in it yet, at least as
measured by core prices, but we are uncomfortably close. 

The threat of deflation is one of the reasons that long-term T-note yields are
so low. A return of under 2.7% per year is not very enticing for locking up your
money for ten years. If inflation were to average over the next ten years, what
it has averaged over the last ten years (2.5%) the increased amount of goods and
services you could get for delaying your gratification for a decade would be
almost nothing. If it were to average what it has since 1988 (the period covered
by the graph above, 2.9%) you would actually lose purchasing power by locking up
your money. 

At the first hint that inflation is picking up, bond yields can be expected to
head much higher. Even though I think that deflation is a greater threat right
now than a return to the high inflation of the 1970`s, I do not think that the
Fed will allow it to happen. Deflation is the only scenario under which the
purchase of long-term treasuries makes sense at these levels. To buy a T-note,
you have to be rooting for breadlines and Hoovervilles. A good way to bet on
T-note yields rising is the ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year ETF (NYSE: TBT). 

Where Do Price Increases Exist?

So what areas are showing price increases? Health care costs always seem to run
faster than overall inflation, but even they seem relatively well behaved.
Medical commodity prices (i.e. Drugs) were up 0.2% in August, but that simply
reversed a 0.2% decline in July and came after they were unchanged in June. 

While year over year they were up 3.0%, if the pace of the last three months
were sustained, there would be no inflation at all in the price of medical
commodities. Part of the reason for that is probably the increasing substitution
of generic drugs for name-brand prescriptions. While the drugs are still on
patent, firms like Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Merck (NYSE: MRK) are still
aggressively raising prices, but they are now losing share to their slightly
older drugs that are no longer state-enforced monopolies and have to face the
free market. 

Medical Services prices (i.e. a visit to the hospital) also were up 0.2% in
August after being unchanged in July but up 0.4% in June. Year over year,
medical service prices are up 3.2%, but if the last three month pace were
maintained, they would only be up 2.4%. 

The other noteworthy area of inflation is in car prices, particularly used car
prices. In August, the price of a used car rose 0.7%, and that is on the heels
of a 0.8% increase in July and a 0.9% increase in June. Hey, at least the trend
is in the right direction. Still, we are talking about a 15.5% rise over the
last year. In contrast, the price of new cars rose just 0.3% after back-to-back
increases of 0.1% in June and July. 

Year over year, new car prices are up 2.3%. While that is still more than the
overall rate of inflation, which indicates more pricing power on the part of
Ford (NYSE: F) than the average company has it pales in comparison to the jump
in used car prices. The differential seems obviously unsustainable to me, but
yet it persists month after month. 

That is probably good news for the big used car dealers like CarMax (NYSE: KMX).
However, if it were to continue for a few more years, a 1999 Ford Escort would
cost more than a new Ford Focus. Somehow I don`t see that happening. What we are
probably seeing is a large "inferior good" effect. In other words, in tough
times people gravitate to buying the cheaper product, even if is of inferior
quality. Used cars relative to new cars meet that description. 

Overall, this was a fairly solid report. It does not totally put to bed the
danger of deflation, but it does not further fan the worries of it. It certainly
does not raise the specter of run away inflation anytime soon. It will not
resolve the debate within the Fed about resorting to unconventional methods of
increasing the money supply by buying up large quantities of long-term T-notes,
but is probably a minor argument in favor of doing so.

The deal is an extension of the companies existing partnership:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Netezza designs and develops its appliances on IBM systems  technology and combined with IBM software powers many applications  within organizations. &#160;The two companies have been strategic partners  for many years focused on workload optimized systems that deliver  integrated systems, software and storage for analyzing vast amounts of  complex data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition will bolster IBMs own analytics offering  the company intends to integrate Netezza into its Information Management software portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based in Marlborough, Mass., Netezza has around 500 employees worldwide.

 (Adds analyst's comment, background on IBM deals)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ritsuko Ando&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) offered to buy
data analytics company Netezza Corp NZ.N for $1.7 billion,
the latest deal to emerge from a recovering tech sector, to
expand its technology services business and help clients better
analyze market information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monday's announcement comes as International Business
Machines Corp is shifting its focus from increasingly
commoditized hardware to higher-margin software and services,
particularly analytics, which help clients analyze market data
to plot trends or prevent fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal values Netezza at $27 per share, a 9.8 percent
premium from Friday's closing price of $24.60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a Breakingviews column see [ID:nN20261941].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock rose 15.2 percent to $28.50 late Monday
afternoon, with some analysts saying a rival bidder could
emerge considering the recent surge in technology acquisitions.
The deal also raised speculation that other data analytics
firms such as Teradata Corp (TDC.N) could be targeted next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal is the latest in a rash of acquisitions in the
technology sector. Last month, Intel Corp (INTC.O) agreed to
buy McAfee Inc MFE.N for $7.7 billion. This month,
Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) agreed to pay $1.5 billion for
security firm ArcSight ARST.O. [ID:nSGE68C0H6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marlborough, Massachusetts-based Netezza sells appliances
that combine analytical software and hardware to help, for
example, online dating site eHarmony comb through online
profiles and massive Web data to figure out who might be a good
match for a particular user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other customers include retailers as well as financial
exchange operator NYSE Euronext NYX.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said the speed of Netezza's technology had convinced it
to buy the company. The two are partners, with Netezza using
IBM hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Speed is critical," said Arvind Krishna, general manager
of information management at IBM. "Clients don't have the
patience to wait for weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE DEALS IN TECH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said analytics, which accounted for about $9 billion of
IBM's $95.76 billion in revenue last year, was a significant
growth opportunity for the company. IBM employs 6,000 analytics
consultants, while Netezza has 500 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal also comes amid a resurgence in mergers and
acquisitions activity. Last month saw an unseasonable burst of
deal making, with Thomson Reuters data showing total announced
deals of $262 billion, the highest for an August since 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have said this could continue, helped by low
interest rates, record cash holdings and low stock market
values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another trend driving deals in technology is the ambition
among large vendors to become one-stop shops selling everything
from networking and servers to software and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said in May that it planned to spend about $20 billion
in acquisitions through 2015 to expand its software and
services business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM's top rivals include Hewlett-Packard, Oracle Corp
ORCL.O and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), all of which have
announced new services and acquisitions in an effort to offer a
broader set of technology services to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts also said the deal could spark interest in other
data analytics companies including Teradata and smaller,
privately owned firms such as ParAccel and Vertica. Teradata
shares were up 7.8 percent at $37.14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given the recent, heated bidding war between HP and Dell
Inc DELL.O over data storage company 3PAR Inc (PAR.N), they
said, a rival bid could emerge for Netezza as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As such, we recommend investors to keep their position
rather than sell with the idea that another bidder may appear,"
said Roth Capital Partners analyst Nathan Schneiderman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Veteran technology banker Frank Quattrone's Qatalyst Group
advised Netezza while UBS AG (UBS.N) advised IBM, according to
a source familiar with the situation. Quattrone had also
advised 3PAR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jayson Noland, an analyst at Robert W. Baird, said
companies such as Dell, HP, NEC Corp (6701.T) and SAP AG
(SAPG.DE) could be interested in Netezza, although they may
have already discussed a possible deal with bankers and decided
not to make a move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Netezza, which also makes data warehouse and monitoring
equipment, reported fiscal second-quarter revenue of $63.8
million last month, up 45 percent from a year earlier. It also
raised its full-year revenue forecast, a rare move in a sector
fretting about a possible double-dip in technology spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many of IBM's recent acquisitions have been small, low-key
deals. Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano said last week that IBM
buys companies at "reasonable valuations" and criticized HP's
$2.4 billion acquisition of 3PAR as well as its $1.5 billion
deal to buy security technology company ArcSight Inc ARST.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM's offer for Netezza values it at over six times its
expected revenue for 2010, a healthy valuation in the tech
industry where anything over 5 is considered high, but lower
than than the multiple of around 9 times that HP offered 3PAR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares were up 1.36 percent at $131.96.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies said they expected the deal to close in the
fourth quarter. The merger agreement includes a termination fee
of $56 million, according to a regulatory filing.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil, on behalf of the Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC), today
announced an agreement with BP to provide its underwater well containment
equipment to MWCC as part of BP's intent to join the new organization. Chevron,
ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell are establishing the MWCC to provide
emergency response services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. As part of the
agreement, BP equipment will be made available to all oil and gas companies
operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 

The equipment could be deployed to capture and contain oil from a potential
underwater well blowout while the new rapid-response system announced in July is
being developed. ExxonMobil is leading the engineering, procurement and
construction of the system on behalf of the sponsor companies. 

"We are working quickly and effectively in an unprecedented effort to improve
incident preparedness," said Lloyd Guillory, marine well containment system
project executive. "Our progress since we announced the system demonstrates the
commitment of our companies to make equipment immediately available for incident
response." 

Existing BP equipment is being assessed for use in near-term response
capability. The sponsor companies' project team will utilize full time BP
technical personnel with experience from the Gulf of Mexico response. 

Guillory added, "This and other equipment that the project expects to acquire
will enable us to preserve and secure existing capability for use by the oil and
gas industry in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico while we build the new system that
exceeds current response capabilities." 

The equipment will be operated by MWCC. The formation of the company and details
about membership will be announced soon. 

"We are pleased to provide the experience and specialized equipment needed to
respond to a deepwater well control incident and intend to join the Marine Well
Containment Company," said Richard Morrison, BP vice president for Gulf of
Mexico operations. "We believe the addition of our recently gained deepwater
intervention experience and specialized equipment will be important to the
marine well containment system."

&lt;p&gt; * NFL CFO to become co-head of Goldman's media group&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Noto is former Goldman analyst&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Rejoins Goldman after two years with league&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ben Klayman and Joe Rauch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DETROIT/CHARLOTTE, N.C., Sept 20 (Reuters) - The National
Football League's chief financial officer is leaving his post
to return to Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), after two years on
the job, the league announced on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anthony Noto, 42, will leave the NFL on Oct. 4 and rejoin
Goldman Sachs as co-head of the global media group within its
investment banking division, working with Andy Gordon in New
York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Noto had previously worked at Goldman Sachs as an equities
analyst for 9 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He ran Goldman's communications, media and entertainment
research team before leaving for the NFL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His move comes as the league -- arguably the largest and
most successful in U.S. pro sports -- is preparing for a
showdown with its players' union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eric Grubman, the NFL's executive vice president of
business operations, will oversee the league's finance group
during the league's collective bargaining negotiations with the
NFL Players' Association, the league said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Senior vice presidents Joe Siclare, Neil Glat and Mike
Smith will continue in their current roles at the NFL. Siclare
is treasurer and oversees club finance. Glat manages corporate
development, while Smith manages finance and administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am confident that we are well-positioned to meet the
challenges ahead, and to succeed both financially and in
reaching a fair agreement with the players' union," said NFL
Commissioner Roger Goodell in a memo to the league's clubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The NFL, which kicked off its season two weeks ago, boasts
a U.S. fan base of more than 180 million, strong television
ratings and annual revenue topping $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, it could be the last season before a work stoppage
as the 32 owners in 2008 terminated their labor contract with
the players union early in a move to cut salary costs. They
cited rising payments to cover stadium construction, operations
and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Should a new deal not be reached before next season,
players expect the owners to lock them out.

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC, founded by a former state prosecutor and enforcement
attorney for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and the law
firm of Powers Taylor, LLP are investigating potential legal claims against the
Board of Directors of Netezza Corporation ("Netezza" or "NZ") (NYSE: NZ) related
to the proposed acquisition of Netezza by International Business Machines Corp.
("IBM") (NYSE: IBM). 

The definitive agreement, which was announced on September 20, 2010, involves a
transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion, under which Netezza
shareholders will receive $27 in cash for each share ofNetezza/NZ common stock
they hold. Although the proposed acquisition price represents an approximate
9.8% premium over Netezza`s closing price on September 17, 2010, based on
historical stock prices and Netezza`s better than expected earnings of $3.2
million reported in August 2010, the proposed price appears to be unfair to
Netezza shareholders. 

The investigation relates to possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other
violations of state law by the Board of Directors of Netezza for approving this
transaction, whether the consideration to be received by Netezza shareholders is
fair, and whether Netezza`s Board of Directors acted in the shareholders` best
interests.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Levi &amp; Korsinsky is investigating the Board of Directors of Netezza Corporation
("Netezza" or the "Company") (NYSE: NZ) for possible breaches of fiduciary duty
and other violations of state law in connection with their attempt to sell the
Company to International Business Machines Corp. ("IBM") (NYSE: IBM). Under the
terms of the transaction, Netezza shareholders will receive $27 in cash for each
share of Netezza common stock they own for a total transaction value of
approximately $1.7 billion, after adjusting for cash. 

On August 26, 2010, the Company posted better than expected earnings of $3.2
million, or $0.05 per share, compared to $730,000, or $0.01 per share, in the
same quarter last year and also reported that revenue was up 45%, to $63.8
million. The investigation concerns whether the Netezza Board of Directors
breached their fiduciary duties to Netezza stockholders by failing to adequately

&lt;p&gt;SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Underscoring its commitment to help enterprises get control of their network
infrastructure,Infoblox todayannounced availability of the Infoblox Microsoft
Management module, an agent-less solution for adding crucial management
functionality to Microsoft domain name system (DNS)/ dynamic host configuration
protocol (DHCP) environments. 

The solution, which can be used in parallel with existing DNS/DHCP
infrastructures running on Infoblox or Microsoft DNS/DHCP servers, leverages
Infoblox`s unique Grid technology to deliver powerful visibility, control,
reliability and IP address management (IPAM) capabilities - the same benefits
that more than 200 of the Global 500 realize today with their Infoblox
solutions. 

Infoblox Module Addresses Challenges Facing Today`s Dynamic Networks

Essentially all IP network applications depend on DNS and DHCP; without them,
networks grind to a halt. To enable these critical functions, many enterprises
have traditionally relied on Microsoft DNS and DHCP services that are included
with Microsoft Windows servers. 

In the past, when networks were primarily static, management of DNS and DHCP
servers was simpler and home-grown tools using spreadsheets were effective.
However, as networks continue to add IP-enabled devices at an accelerating rate
and compounded by the adoption of virtualization , using these tools has become
impractical. 

According to an independent Forrester Research report: "Performing the necessary
process execution in this new world by following the same old methods will prove
catastrophic. Reliance on large numbers of technical experts to perform manual,
repetitive work is unsustainable."&#8230; "In fact, many legacy management tools are
rendered irrelevant in this environment because they can`t adapt to the changing
nature of the environments they manage ("The Shifting Sands Of IT Compel A New
Landscape For IT Automation Tools, Forrester Research, Inc., October 2009). 

As a Certified Microsoft Gold Partner, Infoblox has worked diligently to address
these challenges. 

Infoblox Microsoft Management Offers Visibility, Reliability and Control

The Infoblox Microsoft Management module enables IT administrators to quickly
and easily replace spreadsheets, manual processes and home-grown management
tools. Key enhancements to a Microsoft DNS/DHCP infrastructure provided by the
module include:

* Central management and maintenance of Microsoft DNS/DHCP servers; 
* Enterprise-wide, automated IP address management capabilities; 
* Role-based, delegated administration and detailed audit logs; and, 
* Automated disaster recovery

Solution Lifeblood: Unique Infoblox Grid Technology

Infoblox Grid technology, a real-time network data management system, is the
lifeblood of the solution. The Grid links Infoblox appliances and managed
Microsoft DNS/DHCP servers together across a distributed enterprise using
sophisticated database technology, transforming the collection of appliances and
servers into a unified system. 

Leveraging the Grid technology and Infoblox`s intuitive user interface, IT
administrators have a single unified web-based interface for viewing and
managing the DNS/DHCP infrastructure - all Microsoft or a combination of
Infoblox appliances and Microsoft DNS/DHCP servers. The Infoblox Microsoft
Management module will automatically synchronize Microsoft DNS and DHCP changes
across the Infoblox Grid. This enables automation of Microsoft Server DNS and
DHCP reconfiguration after a server outage as well as reduces downtime using the
anywhere, anytime access and change control provided by the Infoblox web
interface. 

The Infoblox Microsoft Management module web interface also provides detailed
visual reports about the network and IP address allocation and utilization which
simplifies network planning and troubleshooting. 

Kevin Dickson, Infoblox Vice President of Product Management commented: "The
centralized management from a single web-based GUI and built-in automation of
many manual tasks associated with daily maintenance of Microsoft DNS/DHCP
servers, coupled with Infoblox`s Grid architecture and hardened appliances, can
enable 99.999 percent service availability, reduce operating expense and
increase overall visibility and control of the DNS and DHCP infrastructure - a
necessity in today`s increasingly complex and dynamic networks." 

Pricing &amp; Availability

The Infoblox Microsoft Management module is now available through Infoblox
authorized channel partners on multiple Infoblox-appliance platforms. Pricing
for the Infoblox Microsoft Management module on the Infoblox-550 starts at
$7,495 in the United States / $8,995 in Europe and Asia Pacific. 

Bundled offerings that combine the Microsoft Management module, hardware and
annual maintenance contracts are also available through authorized Infoblox
channel partners.

&lt;p&gt;Moab Unified Automation Intelligence Technology Enables Orchestration of Windows
HPC Server and Other Leading Operating Systems in a Single HPC or Cloud
Environment
PROVO, Utah--(Business Wire)--
Adaptive Computing, the company behind the Moab unified automation intelligence
technology, today announced the certification of Moab Adaptive HPC Suite with
Microsoft Windows HPC Server 2008 R2, released today, and the company`s
participation in the Windows HPC Server Launch Partner program. This
announcement extends collaboration between the two companies, which have worked
together for years co-delivering large HPC and cloud installations, including
South Africa`s Centre for High Performance Computing, Rocky Mountain
Supercomputing Centers, Baker Hughes and other customers in the oil and gas and
manufacturing industries. 

Adaptive Computing`s solutions, powered by Moab, deliver intelligent governance
that empowers customers to optimally consolidate and virtualize resources,
allocate and manage applications, improve service levels, and reduce operational
costs. Moab Adaptive HPC Suite enables multiple operating systems and
applications to run on a single computational system within existing operational
and system-administration costs through dynamic, policy-driven scheduling and
optional automatic systems configurations. This capability, known as "dual
boot," has traditionally been complex and labor-intensive, but Moab
intelligently automates the process, minimizing the operational and management
costs associated with dedicated systems administrators. 

"Microsoft`s relationship with Adaptive Computing in the HPC and cloud markets
is valuable; Microsoft`s popular operating system and servers open the world of
complex computing to a much wider audience, further expanding our market
opportunities. Organizations that deploy Moab and Windows HPC Server 2008 R2
will gain additional workload throughput from existing clusters, resulting in
increased ROI, improved utilization and greater application performance," said
Scott Hurst, director of alliances and business development at Adaptive
Computing. 

Windows HPC Server 2008 R2 makes it easier and more affordable to put the power
of supercomputing within reach of more analysts, engineers, and scientists,
giving them the computational resources they need to make better decisions, fuel
product innovation, speed research and development and accelerate time to
market. 

"By using advanced management solutions like Moab Adaptive HPC Suite together
with Windows HPC Server 2008 R2, customers who have traditionally used Linux in
their high-performance computing clusters have been able to increase their
utilization and extend the reach of their HPC services to more users," said Bill
Hamilton, director, Technical Computing, Microsoft Corp. "It`s allowed them to
create dynamic HPC environments that span multiple operating systems, increase
access to more applications, and increase the breadth of HPC users for their
clusters." 

Moab Adaptive HPC Suite is available through Microsoft's Certificate Transfer
Agreement (CTA). Packaged with Windows HPC Server 2008 R2 and multiple Linux OS
support, it offers customers an attractive low-risk and very low-cost option to
cover both current and future end-user support needs. For more information,

&lt;p&gt;Featured Leading Analyst Dale Vecchio to Discuss Market Trends, Scenarios and
Roadmaps to Cutting Mainframe Costs
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The considerations surrounding migrating mainframe applications to more
efficient platforms will be the subject of an executive IT summit on Tuesday,
September 21 at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta. Hosted by Microsoft, Idea
Integration, and Alchemy Solutions, this half-day session will feature a
presentation by Gartner Research Vice President Dale Vecchio, who will convey
Gartner's latest observations on the state of the mainframe modernization
market. 

The theme of the IT Executive Summit is "Leverage Real Customer Experience to
Plan Your Mainframe Future." The summit objective is to help enterprises
determine the best roadmap to cut mainframe costs, increase agility and maintain
solid workforce talent by exposing attendees to current best practices and
expert projections. 

"Any IT executive with a mainframe is likely to have struggled with issues such
as increased operational costs (MIPS), and dwindling mainframe talent due to an
aging workforce," said Gartner Research Vice President Dale Vecchio. "Our
research shows that enterprises are increasingly taking matters into their own
hands, exploring technology and organizational alternatives that have changed
their IT infrastructure and improved their operations." 

Attendees will hear success stories about companies that have migrated their
legacy applications to Microsoft .NET, thereby achieving substantial cost
savings, increased performance and developer productivity. 

"A decade ago, solving these infrastructure and platform problems might have
been daunting, there were so few tried-and-true alternatives," said Ron Langer,
General Manager at Alchemy Solutions. "But with the rapid technology advancement
of mainframe modernization solutions, companies are realizing vast cost savings
and productivity gains leveraging innovative migration strategies. This is
becoming a growing trend, and there is much to be learned from the experience of
others." 

Idea Integration has collaborated with many of these enterprises in the Atlanta
area, and will provide its first-hand insights on mitigating risk and ensuring
successful delivery of migrated applications. "As a member of the Alchemy
Solutions partner program, Idea Integration has assisted many enterprises in
evaluating and modernizing their use of mainframe technology. So, it was logical
that we team-up on this executive summit to share the insights gained from this
experience," said Steve Steuart, senior vice president of Idea Integration.
"Through the tools and services available through the partnership program,
Alchemy Solutions has been a major contributor to these successes, collaborating
on bringing solutions to market more quickly than ever before possible." 

The summit begins at 8:30 am. Upon its conclusion at 12:30 pm, the Georgia
Aquarium will be open for a breathtaking "behind the scenes" tour. Space is
limited - reservations can be made online.

&lt;p&gt;ST. LOUIS--(Business Wire)--
Advertisers could see a cost-per-click (CPC) increase up to 78 percent above
current Bing CPCs as a surge of competitors move to one platform with the Yahoo
and Microsoft Search Alliance transition, a study completed by GroupM Search
revealed. 

Based on the impact two industry milestones had on advertisers - Yahoo`s
introduction in 2007 of Panama and Microsoft`s transition in 2009 from MSN Live
to Bing, GroupM Search projects a three-week period of volatility
post-transition before costs begin to settle. At the campaign level, advertisers
can expect an average increase of 64 percent over current Bing CPCs for
unbranded keywords and 78-percent for branded keywords during this time. Once
the marketplace settles, CPCs on Bing will rest at 13 to 23 percent above
current Bing CPCs for unbranded and branded keywords, respectively. 

"Any time you interject change into the auction you invite pricing pressure,"
said Chris Copeland, chief executive officer of GroupM Search. "In this case, we
see historical evidence that suggests regardless of the bid tools and the
preparation, a period of short-term volatility will exist." 

The study was completed by GroupM Search`s Predictive Insights unit, a team
comprised of econometric statisticians and mathematicians with expertise
cultivated in the area of search marketing. GroupM Search looked at current and
historical paid search campaign data to estimate cost implications and how long
it will take advertisers to return to equilibrium after this shock to the
market. The study included campaign data of 12 market-leading clients who have
maintained a steady presence on both Yahoo and Microsoft`s search networks
dating back to 2007. 

The insights from this study are important for advertisers because it allows
advanced preparation for what to expect from this transition. 

"If three-week volatility and CPC increases can be countered through better
understanding of competitive sets, sophistication of those advertisers and what
strategies they use today, then this research will have served our client base
well," said Copeland. 

One of the most important insights from the study is the understanding of the
number of advertisers with paid search campaigns unique to Yahoo that
potentially will now be running on the Microsoft adCenter platform. Within the
search marketing campaigns analyzed, on average only 27 percent of the
advertisers` competition for branded and unbranded keywords were running on both
Yahoo and Bing. GroupM Search projects that advertisers unique to Yahoo moving
to adCenter could lead to a 74-percent increase in competition levels on Bing
than exist at present. 

This increased competition will be the greatest factor for the amplification in
paid search costs, the study revealed. In a pay-per-click auction system, such
as paid search, the number of competitors matters greatly in the final price of
the item because each competitor vies for its desired position. 

"The industry has long known the variances of performance between Yahoo and
Bing. What we found and what we believe has the biggest material impact for
advertisers are the vastly different competitive sets between the two," said
Copeland. "When you put such a large set of new advertisers of varying
sophistication into the mix, you are going to see a less stable CPC
marketplace." 

On the heels of the Yahoo and Microsoft Search Alliance transition, however,
comes the peak of the holiday season when paid search sees its greatest surge in
advertisers and CPCs. With this unique timing, the marketplace could experience
bidding variables it hasn`t seen before and it could be early 2011 before
everything settles and the "new CPC" is realized. 

Copeland added, "It is essential for all parties to get this right and we
support the decision to go forward ahead of the 2010 holiday season. However,
this predicted fluctuation, combined with holiday bidding strategies, means it
could be three to four months before the new normal is set."

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) raised its quarterly dividend by 23 percent to 16 cents per share on Tuesday, its first increase in two years, marking the latest move by a technology company to return cash to shareholders frustrated by stagnant share prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company, whose stock is trading at the same level it was eight years ago, has been under pressure to distribute more of the $37 billion of cash on its balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is an anti-climax, but a step in the right direction," said Bill Smead at Smead Capital Management, a Microsoft shareholder who has agitated for the company to give more money back to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other cash-rich tech companies have felt similar pressure. Oracle Corp ORCL.O started paying dividends last year and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) said last week it would start paying dividends this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief executive of Xerox Corp (XRX.N) said in an interview on cable channel CNBC on Tuesday that the company would look at raising its dividend next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A regular dividend is generally regarded as a mark of a mature company which cannot match earlier growth rates or stock gains, and tends to attract more conservative investors. It is the antithesis of what many tech companies aspire to in their early years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of Microsoft's peers have paid dividends for many years, but Intel Corp (INTC.O) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) have increased payouts dramatically over the past 10 years. Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) has held its dividend unchanged since 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The holdouts are Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which used to pay dividends but stopped in 1995, and Google Inc (GOOG.O), which has never paid a dividend and says it doesn't plan to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGH YIELD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With about 8.65 billion shares outstanding, Microsoft is set to pay out about $5.5 billion in dividends per year at the new rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quarterly dividend of 16 cents per share gives Microsoft an annual dividend yield of about 2.5 percent. That puts it 12th in the Nasdaq 100 by dividend yield and 138th in the Standard  Poor's 500, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its shares were up 19 cents in after-hours trading after closing at $25.15 on Nasdaq. They are down 17 percent this year, compared with a 3.5 percent gain in the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which went public in 1986, started paying an annual dividend in 2003.

 (Adds analyst quote, paragraph 3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) raised
its quarterly dividend by 23 percent to 16 cents per share on
Tuesday, its first increase in two years, marking the latest
move by a technology company to return cash to shareholders
frustrated by stagnant share prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company, whose stock is
trading at the same level it was eight years ago, has been
under pressure to distribute more of the $37 billion of cash on
its balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is an anticlimax, but a step in the right direction,"
said Bill Smead at Smead Capital Management, a Microsoft
shareholder who has agitated for the company to give more money
back to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other cash-rich tech companies have felt similar pressure.
Oracle Corp ORCL.O started paying dividends last year and
Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) said last week it would start paying
dividends this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The chief executive of Xerox Corp (XRX.N) said in an
interview on cable channel CNBC on Tuesday that the company
would look at raising its dividend next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A regular dividend is generally regarded as a mark of a
mature company that cannot match earlier growth rates or stock
gains, and tends to attract more conservative investors. It is
the antithesis of what many tech companies aspire to in their
early years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several of Microsoft's peers have paid dividends for many
years, but Intel Corp (INTC.O) and International Business
Machines Corp (IBM.N) have increased payouts dramatically over
the past 10 years. Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) has held its
dividend unchanged since 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The holdouts are Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which used to pay
dividends but stopped in 1995, and Google Inc (GOOG.O), which
has never paid a dividend and says it doesn't plan to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HIGH YIELD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With about 8.65 billion shares outstanding, Microsoft is
set to pay out about $5.5 billion in dividends per year at the
new rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A quarterly dividend of 16 cents per share gives Microsoft
an annual dividend yield of about 2.5 percent. That puts it
12th in the Nasdaq 100 by dividend yield and 138th in the
Standard  Poor's 500, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its shares were up 19 cents in after-hours trading after
closing at $25.15 on Nasdaq. They are down 17 percent this
year, compared with a 3.5 percent gain in the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which went public in 1986, started paying an
annual dividend in 2003. The following year it issued a special
dividend of $3 per share -- shelling out more than $30 billion
in one go -- and started a quarterly dividend of 8 cents per
share. It raised the quarterly dividend regularly until its
last increase to 13 cents per share in September 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Redmond, Washington-based company also said on Tuesday
its board authorized it to issue up to $6 billion in additional
debt, which could be used for paying dividends or buying back
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two years ago the board authorized $6 billion in debt,
which the company used by selling $3.75 billion in long-term
corporate bonds, $1.25 billion in convertible bonds and $1
billion in short-term commercial borrowings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of Microsoft's abundant cash is overseas, which makes
it cost-effective for the company to take on cheap debt rather
than pay taxes on repatriated cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which says it has returned nearly $170 billion
to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases over
the past 10 years, made no new plans for share buybacks. It
said it still has about $23.7 billion left of the $40 billion
share repurchase authorization the board granted two years
ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new dividend is payable Dec. 9 to shareholders of
record on Nov. 18.

billion to Disney and its affiliate stations under the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect to see a portion of retransmission fees" from
affiliates, Iger told investors at the Goldman Sachs
Communacopia conference in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've struck some deals with affiliates to gain access for
fees and are in negotiation with others. Retrans payments are
real and will grow and there is no incremental cost to get
them," said Iger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DEATH OF TV, MOVIES OVERPLAYED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney, which owns the ESPN sports cable network and Pixar
studio, said it had suffered no loss of subscribers as a result
of the Internet, nor cannibalization of DVD sales because of
low-cost DVD renters like Coinstar Inc's CSTR.O Redbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other studios have sought to delay making films available
to Redbox for 30 days to preserve sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Disney's DVD business is heavily skewed toward kids
and that people frequently buy, not rent DVDs because families
tend to view them again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger also said he has also seen no evidence of
"cord-cutting" or dropping of pay-TV subscriptions to watch
shows over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The channel business is not only alive and well, but
actually much healthier than people suggest," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think its far too premature to write the epitaph" for
channel television and multichannel television, he said, but
also noted that Disney saw Web-connected TV as an opportunity,
citing the new ESPN3.com Web services as an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Internet connected TV will create challenges, but
will also enable Disney to make more product available to
consumers and other content providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are very mindful of products that we make available,"
for the Internet direct experience, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall investors and Wall Street underappreciates Disney's
brand value, Iger said.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Utilimetrics, the world`s premier utility technology association announced that
Portland General Electric is the first recipient of the Utilimetrics AMI/Smart
Grid Award. 

"This prestigious new award honors a utility that demonstrates superior
achievement in innovation," said Rick Stevens, Utilimetrics past chairman of the
board." We received many impressive entries from utilities whose AMI/Smart Grid
projects are under way." 

PGE completed installation of a system-wide wireless smart metering project
consisting of 827,000 end points and featuring a series of business process
automations that will produce $18.2 million U.S. annually in operating savings. 

PGE`s new system is a two-way wireless fixed network. It features 46 collectors
positioned throughout a 4,000-square-mile service territory. 

By Sept. 1 PGE rolled nearly 700,000 meters over to network reads and was
successfully capturing nearly 100% of the required daily billing reads. PGE
scaled up the company`s meter data management system to handle register reads
from 1.2 million meters, interval data from 100,000 meters and storage for up to
7 terabytes of validated meter data. 

"PGE is a wonderful example to all utilities engaged in AMI deployment,"
concluded Stevens. 

About Utilimetrics: Utilimetrics brings together diverse stakeholders of
electricity, water and gas distribution utilities to promote and share best
practices for smart grid/smart metering, communications, utility automation and
data management. Utilimetrics believes that utilities and consumers must be
closely linked to compel efficient and responsible energy and water management.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Is Novell Selling to VMWare?

Enterprise software developer, Novell Inc. (Nasdaq: NOVL) is in discussions with
the virtualization infrastructure software solutions provider VMware Inc. (NYSE:
VMW) to sell its Linux Operating systems business, according to the Wall Street
Journal. 

According to the Journal, Novell is in advanced stages of negotiations with
VMware to sell its SUSE Linux operating systems, with the only point of
consideration being valuation. Novell acquired the Germany based SUSE AG in
2003. 

Following the acquisition news, Novell shares rose by 32 cents, or 5.8%, to
$5.89. 

According to the Journal, Novell is also in talks with a software company
Attachmate Corp. which is supported by private equity firms like Golden Gate
Capital and Francisco Partners, to sell the remaining part of the company that
comprises NetWare network operating system. 

Novell remains a potential takeover candidate and has been approached by various
other entities this year. In March, Novell rejected a buyout offer from the
investment firm Elliott Associates L.P., citing that the proposal of $5.75 per
share (49.0% over the company`s enterprise value) in cash is inadequate and it
undervalues the company's franchise and growth prospects. 

Elliott is an investment firm with over $16.0 billion in assets and holds
approximately 8.5% of Novell`s common stock. 

We believe Novell`s Linux assets deserve premium valuation as it has a strong
customer base and remains a major revenue contributor. Novell remains the #2
maker of the open source Linux operating system. 

Recently, Novell launched WorkloadIQ to benefit from the rapidly growing
intelligent workload management (IWM) market. Novell currently has more than 30
new customers for its WorkloadIQ products. 

Moreover, the company has an impressive clientele, including General Electric
Co. (NYSE: GE), Monsanto Co. (NYSE: MON) and Sony Corp. (NYSE: SNE).

&lt;p&gt;http://www.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Research Equity Strategist, Dirk Van Dijk says that S 500 earnings are
continuing to show red ink. He tracks companies on the Zacks.com web site,
naming names, while forecasting trends for the months ahead. 

Slower - but Still Strong - Growth

Earnings will have fully recovered by mid-2011, and that full-year 2011 earnings
will be 6.1% above full-year 2007 earnings (i.e., before the Great Recession
started). That is years before we are likely to see a full recovery in the job
market. 

Collectively the 500 firms in the S 500 earned $546.9 billion in "2009," and
that is going to grow to $773.2 billion this year and $871.4 billion in 2011.
Translated into "EPS" for the index, earnings are expected to rise from $57.67
in 2009 to $81.50 in 2010 and $91.44 in 2011. 

In other words, then, the S 500 is selling for 19.5x 2009 earnings, but just
13.8x 2010 and 12.3x 2011 earnings. By historical standards, that is quite
cheap. Normally, when interest rates and inflation are low, P/E ratios are
higher than average. Well we currently have some of the lowest rates of
inflation in decades and interest rates are at near record lows. 

It only costs the government 2.74% to borrow for 10 years (these numbers are
based on Thursday, 9/16). It is not hard to find good, solid blue-chip companies
that are providing dividend yields of more than that, and not just a bunch of
electric utilities, either. 

One thing is certain, the coupon on a 10 year T-note will not increase over the
next 10 years. The odds of the likes of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) 3.51%,
Chevron (NYSE: CVX)3.67% or DuPont (NYSE: DD) 3.73% increasing their dividend in
the next 10 years is pretty high. Currently 123 S 500 stocks yield over 2.74%,
and 74 of those have payout ratios of less than 60%. Earnings that are not paid
out in dividends are reinvested for future growth, or are used to buy back
stock, which also lifts earnings per share. Based on this year`s earnings, the
earnings yield is 7.24% and based on next year it is 8.13%. 

Earnings Estimate Revisions Slow

At this point the total level of estimate revision activity is plunging and
approaching a seasonal low. The total number of 2010 estimate changes in the
system fell by 8.7% in the last week, while 2011 estimate revisions dropped by
5.0%. Relative to the peak of the second quarter earnings season, the totals are
down 74.4% and 72.2% respectively. Since the revisions ratios are based on the
four week moving totals of estimate changes, it means that changes in the
revisions ratios a more due to old estimates falling out of the sample, than new
estimates being made. 

The revisions ratios for both years have fallen significantly in recent weeks,
down to 0.98 for 2010 and 0.83 for 2011. That is not, however, due to a flood of
new estimate cuts being made, but rather from the estimate increases that
followed positive second quarter earnings surprises ageing out of the system.
The total number of revisions in the system will continue to fall until the
third quarter earnings season gets under way in early October.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com Analyst Blog features: Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS), Visa
Inc. (NYSE: V), MasterCard Inc. (NYSE: MA), Sallie Mae (NYSE: SLM) and Citibank
(NYSE: C). 

Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the free Profit from
the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Discover Beats Zacks Estimate

Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) reported a fiscal third quarter earnings
of $261 million or 47 cents per share, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus
Estimate of 35 cents. However, results dipped about 55% from the net income of
$577 million or $1.07 per share in the year-ago quarter. This included an
after-tax gain of approximately $287 million related to the settlement of an
antitrust litigation with Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and MasterCard Inc. (NYSE: MA). 

The surge in profits was due to a significant rise in the use of credit cards
with reduced defaults, improved credit quality, as well as gains from the
payments business driven by strong volumes. However, these were partially offset
by higher-than-expected expenses, primarily on higher interest expenses and tax
rate. 

Discover`s deposit balances originating from direct-to-consumer and affinity
relationships increased $1.5 billion from the year-ago quarter and $1.6 billion
from the prior quarter to $19.1 billion. 

Direct Banking Segment

The Direct Banking segment reported a pre-tax gain of $395 million, reflecting a
$177 million improvement from the year-ago quarter on an adjusted basis. 

Total loans declined 2% year over year to $50.1 billion. Though student loans
increased, this was offset by a decrease in credit card loans, which declined by
$2.9 billion to $45.2 billion. 

The decrease in credit card loans reflects reduced promotional rate offers for
balance transfer against an increase in payment rate. However, it was partially
offset by a 5% year over year increase in Discover Card sales volume, which
improved due to higher consumer spending and merchant acceptance. 

Other income also declined by 4% to $19 million on an adjusted basis from the
year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower late fees and the discontinuance of
overlimit fees beginning in February 2010. However, this was partially offset by
a gain from liquidation of collateral supporting Discover`s previously disclosed
Golden Key investment, along with higher discount and interchange revenue from
higher sales volume. 

The net charge-off rate improved 122 basis points (bps) year over year and 79
bps from the prior quarter to 7.18%, almost in line with the management`s
expectation of 8%-8.0%. Also, the over-30-days delinquency rate was 4.16%,
improving 95 bps year over year and 36 bps sequentially, reflecting an overall
better credit trend since the fourth quarter of 2009. 

The trend also contributed to a reserve release of $187 million, against the
reserve addition of $7 million on an adjusted basis in the third quarter of
2009. Provisions for losses declined 34% year over year to $713 million on an
adjusted basis. 

However, expenses escalated 9% year over year to $45 million, resulting from
increased account acquisition, advertising and promotional marketing spending,
which were partially offset by cost containment initiatives. 

Net interest margin decreased 79 bps to 9.16% from the prior-year quarter, as
adjusted, and relatively flat as compared with the prior quarter. While the
decline was due to the increase in lower rate student loan balances, the impact
of legislative changes on credit card yield and higher funding costs, these were
partially offset by a reduction in promotional rate credit card balances and
lower interest charge-offs. 

Payment Services Segment

The Payment Services segment`s pre-tax income grew $10 million or 36% year over
year to $37 million, almost flat sequentially. Revenues were up $7 million,
reflecting an increase in transactions and higher margin volume on the PULSE/ATM
network along with increased volumes from new and existing clients. Expenses
were also down $3 million from the year-ago quarter. 

Payment Services dollar volume increased 8% from the year-ago quarter to $39
billion, reflecting higher Third-Party Issuer and PULSE dollar volume. The
number of transactions on the PULSE network increased 17% year over year due to
increased transactions from new and existing clients. 

Financial Update

As on August 31, 2010, Discover`s total assets stood at $60.1 billion, while
total equity was recorded at $7.1 billion. However, book value per share
declined to $11.22 per share against $15.45 per share in the year-ago period. 

Business Update

On September 17, 2010, Discover announced that it has reached an agreement to
acquire The Student Loan Corporation (SLC) for $600 million or $30 per share.
The transaction is expected to be closed by December 2010, subject to regulatory
approvals. 

Prior to closing of the deal, SLC will sell $28 billion of assets to Sallie Mae
(NYSE: SLM) and $9 billion of assets to Citibank (NYSE: C) Discover will acquire
$4.2 billion of private student loans and related assets at an 8.5% discount,
along with $3.4 billion of SLC`s existing asset-backed securitization debt
funding. The amount to be paid by Discover for the private student loan assets
is subject to a post-closing purchase price adjustment between Discover and
Citibank, which owns 80% of SLC`s outstanding common stock. 

During the fourth quarter of 2010, the company expects to sell approximately
$1.4 billion of certain eligible Federal Family Education Loan Program loans to
the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) as part of the DOE`s loan purchase
program. 

Dividend Update

On September 15, the board of Discover announced a regular quarterly dividend of
2 cents per share on its common stock, payable on October 21, 2010 to
stockholders of record as on October 7, 2010.

Markets Are In Jubilee Mode

The major stock market indexes are all surging higher today as President Obama
assures the public that he understands the economy and salutes his economic
team. Today the President appeared in a CNBC exclusive town hall style meeting
and was very upbeat as he answered various questions about the current state of
the economy. The gathering was very short and there were not any questions asked
about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

The toughest question in the meeting was from CNBC's own Rick Santelli who asked
what the country is going to do about the current amount of debt that it is in.
President Obama simply said that he will need to address it soon. The rest of
the questions seemed rather basic and most were asked mostly by supporters of
the administration. 

Today's volume on the major indexes are extremely light again which is certainly
helping the markets to trade higher on the day. Tomorrow the Federal Reserve
Bank will make their decision on the fed funds rate and make a brief statement
on the economy, therefore, light volume could dominate the market again. 

Some leading stocks that are trading sharply higher today include Exxon Mobil
Corp. (NYSE: XOM) and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM). Some stocks that were
lagging the markets earlier in the trading session such as U.S. Steel Corp.
(NYSE: X) and Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (NYSE: CLF) have reversed earlier
declines. This is a short term bullish move for the markets as they remain
strong today.

* ExxonMobil Women`s Economic Opportunity Initiative has invested more than $35
million since 2005, reaching women in 77 developing countries

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today announced a $1 million commitment at
the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) to invest in the expansion of high impact,
sustainable technologies that advance women economically in the developing
world. 

The program is expected to directly benefit more than 13,500 people, with
indirect benefits reaching more than 475,000 people in the next two years. 

The new commitment will help innovators in scaling up technologies that benefit
women economically and were identified through ExxonMobil`s partnership with
Ashoka`s Changemakers in the Women | Tools | Technology:Building Opportunities &amp;
Economic Power Challenge, launched at last year`s CGI. The new financial support
from ExxonMobil will help provide consulting support, facilitate the innovators`
connections with other social entrepreneurs, business and technical experts and
identify best practices. 

"The programs identified through the 2009 commitment use technology to improve
the lives of women in developing countries," said Suzanne M. McCarron, general
manager, ExxonMobil public and government affairs. "By further supporting these
programs, we will be advancing technologies that are proven to create more
economic opportunities for women and, as a result, strengthen their
communities." 

A significant barrier to economic advancement is a lack of access to energy. An
estimated 1.6 billion people in the world have no access to electricity and
approximately 2.4 billion rely on biomass fuels like wood, charcoal or dung for
cooking and heating. This undermines the productivity, education, health and
safety of these people - 70 percent of whom are women and girls. 

ExxonMobil grants will be provided to select innovators who advance technologies
to increase access to energy through innovative sources. These technologies help
women increase their productivity and effective participation in the economy.
The grant recipients include Kopernik, Solar Electric Light Fund, Solar Sister,
Productive Agricultural Linkages and Marketing Systems (P.A.L.M.S) and
smallsolutions. 

"My country will be a better place when more women have access to technologies,"
said Leticia Brenyah, an ExxonMobil-supported innovator from Ghana who spoke at
CGI as part of the meeting`s Empowering Girls and Women focus area. "When women
thrive economically they improve their lives, families and country." 

As part of its support for the programs identified through the Women | Tools |
Technology program, ExxonMobil will work with partners Ashoka`s Changemakers,
the International Council for Research on Women and the Thunderbird Emerging
Markets Laboratory (TEM Lab) to support the further development of a number of
concepts involving the use of innovative technologies to enable women`s access
to energy in a sustainable and scalable manner. 

TEM Lab will deploy on the ground consulting teams to help diagnose business
problems and opportunities with the goal of strengthening program effectiveness.


"We are excited to enter into this meaningful partnership which leverages
business and technology expertise to enable innovators to improve their
capacity," said Angel Cabrera, president of Thunderbird School of Global
Management. 

Innovators will have the opportunity to engage with experts at CGI and utilize
the Ashoka`s Changemakers Discovery Framework to better understand the
challenges and opportunities in bringing their concepts to scale. 

"The passion and new ideas represented by the solutions sourced through last
year`s commitment and the subsequent Women | Tools | Technology:Building
Opportunities &amp; Economic Power Challenge represent a powerful new force for
advancing women`s economic opportunities globally," said Bill Drayton, chairman
and CEO of Ashoka. "I look forward to not only the deep and lasting impact these
leaders will create, but also the future generations of changemakers they will
inspire along the way." 

As part of the 2009 CGI Commitment, the research report, "Bridging the
Technology Divide," by the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW),
provided insights into how technology can help advance women economically. ICRW
will continue to provide monitoring and evaluation support for the commitment
activities. 

"A year later, it is great to see how innovators have turned good intentions
into actions that effectively integrate women in various stages of the
technology lifecycle to give them the tools they need to thrive," said Sarah
Degnan Kambou, president of ICRW.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Announces "5 BY 20", An Ambitious Goal to Empower Women Entrepreneurs
Across the World
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
At a plenary session on empowering women at the Clinton Global Initiative,
Muhtar Kent, chairman and chief executive officer of The Coca-Cola Company,
today pledged to empower 5 million women entrepreneurs throughout Coca-Cola`s
global business system by 2020. 

This pledge builds upon a commitment made by The Coca-Cola Company in 2008 to
the United Nations "Business Call to Action" to grow the Company`s Micro
Distribution Centers (MDCs) in Africa. MDCs are an independent network of
entrepreneurs who distribute Coca-Cola`s beverage products to retailers, often
by bicycle or pushcart. At last year`s Clinton Global Initiative, the Company
committed that 50% of all new MDCs would be run by women. The Company is well on
track to achieve both targets as part of its commitments to the UN Millennium
Development Goals. 

"Our experience on the great continent of Africa and the model of our existing
MDC program provides an expanded platform to empower an additional five million
women worldwide over the next ten years. We need to increase awareness that
better societies can be created as a result of empowering women," Mr. Kent said.


Research conducted by the Harvard Kennedy School and engagement with local
stakeholders on Coca-Cola`s MDC business in Africa indicates that women face
three main barriers to success: 1) Lack of access to finance; 2) Lack of
business skills training; and 3) Lack of access to mentors and networks of
peers. The Company plans to conduct further research with potential partners to
better understand how to empower women across its global system. 

"Enhancing economic opportunities for women in the Coca-Cola value chain will
result in increased incomes, enhanced skills in business, increased stature
within the community, and improved potential for communities," Mr. Kent stated
during the session, which was moderated by Katie Couric, anchor and managing
editor of CBS Evening News, and featured panelists, Her Majesty Queen Rania Al
Abdullah, Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of
the Republic of Liberia. Mr. Kent indicated that the Company and its bottling
partners - together with civil society and government partners - would work
together over the next year to build a detailed plan toward meeting this goal. 

"With today`s announcement, Coca-Cola has issued an ambitious challenge with the
potential to transform millions of lives, significantly contributing to
community development while driving business success - a great example of
sustainability. This is exactly the type of investment that we need in order to
reinvigorate our economies and foster long-term, sustainable growth," said
Melanne Verveer, Ambassador-At-Large for Global Women`s Issues at the U.S.
Department of State. 

"The only way we are going to have a profound and lasting impact on global
issues is by joining the forces of business, government and civil society to
pool our collective expertise and experience" said Mr. Kent. 

This new pledge capitalizes on the Company`s presence in over 200 countries and
its business model which relies on millions of small-scale distributors and
retailers, many of whom are women. To meet this far-reaching target, the Company
will build on best-practices in its business system worldwide, encourage
innovation, and seek the insights of women executives as it considers how to
break down barriers faced by women in its value chain.

&lt;p&gt;25 Year Contracts Will Help Supply Renewable Power to PGE Customers
PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
enXco, an EDF Energies Nouvelles Company (PARIS:EEN) and Portland General
Electric (NYSE:POR) have entered into two power purchase agreements for solar
photovoltaic installations to be located in the Willamette Valley near Salem,
Oregon. The two installations will combine for a total of 2.84 MW (dc) of
generating capacity providing power for approximately 2,300 homes at peak
production. 

"These agreements with enXco are part of our strategy to help meet Oregon`s
renewable energy goals," said Jim Lobdell, vice president for power operations
and resource strategy at PGE. "Together with PGE`s other ground-based and
rooftop arrays as well as strong support for residential and commercial
customer-owned projects, these installations will help us grow solar in our
state." 

enXco will develop, build, and own the solar projects consisting of thin film
technology, while PGE will purchase the power generated under a 25-year power
purchase agreement. The projects are expected to commence construction in early
2011 and reach commercial operation in July 2011. enXco Service Corporation will
operate and maintain the projects. 

"These projects represent the largest ground-mounted solar PV installations in
the Pacific Northwest as well as the first solar development for enXco in the
region. We are pleased to be working with PGE and Energy Trust of Oregon to
bring them to fruition," Troy Gagliano, project developer with enXco said. "The
local farmers have always harvested the sun to grow crops, and now they are able
to benefit from the sun in another way. Solar energy diversifies their
operations helping these farmers to not only survive, but thrive." 

Both sites are located in the south eastern portion of Yamhill County. The
Bellevue Solar Project site will comprise 1.69 MW of capacity and the Yamhill
Solar Project site will produce 1.15 MW. The projects will connect to the
existing PGE utility system, which provides power for 822,000 customers in 52
Oregon cities within a 4,000 square mile service territory. 

"Our investment in these solar projects is an investment in a cleaner energy
future for Oregon," said Betsy Kauffman, senior program manager for Energy Trust
of Oregon. "These projects are visible proof that Oregon is a great place for
solar." 

With these new projects, PGE will have more than 17 megawatts of solar capacity
in its resource mix, helping the utility meet the state`s renewable energy
standard of providing 25 percent renewable energy by the year 2025. This will
also help achieve the state`s solar photovoltaic generating capacity standard,
which calls for investor-owned utilities in Oregon to have a combined total of
at least 20 megawatts of large-scale solar projects online by 2020. PGE expects
approximately 9 percent of its resource mix will come from renewable energy
sources in 2010. 

"Our customers are best served with a diverse mix of resources," Lobdell said.
"That`s why we`re bringing new renewable generating facilities online, while at
the same time promoting energy efficiency and making improvements to our
existing hydropower and thermal plants. Our goal is always to deliver safe,
reliable, responsibly-generated electric power to our customers at a reasonable
price." 

The two projects received approval from the Yamhill County Planning Commission
in September 2010.

&lt;p&gt;* Perforating and fracturing combined into one efficient operation 
* Award-winning technology in commercial use since 2005 
* Calfrac Well Services experienced in advanced stimulation technologies

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today the licensing of its
award-winning Multi-Zone Stimulation Technology (MZSTSM) well treatment process
to Calfrac Well Services Ltd. of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. 

The MZST process can be used to rapidly and reliably stimulate multiple
reservoir zones in a single operation, yielding improved well economics. The
MZST process was developed by ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company in Houston,
Texas and was recognized with Platts Global Energy Award for Most Innovative
Commercial Technology in 2005. 

The MZST process can be particularly beneficial for fracturing operations in
tight gas, shale gas, and coal bed methane wells that target multiple reservoir
zones, thick reservoir sections, or long reservoir intervals where multiple
stimulation treatments are required. 

The MZST process will enable Calfrac to optimize its stimulation operations by
combining the deployment of perforating and fracturing equipment simultaneously
in the wellbore to enable single-trip, multi-zone stimulations. The technology
dramatically increases the number of zones that can be fractured per day
compared to conventional fracturing and stimulation operations. 

Calfrac is a leading Calgary-based independent provider of specialty designed
fracturing, coiled tubing, cementing and well servicing solutions. 

"For a variety of unconventional plays ExxonMobil`s MZST process continues to be
a premier technology for rapidly moving from drilled well to completed
production well," said ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company President Sara
Ortwein. "The track record of the MZST process for cost effective and efficient
operations is a testament to the value of the technology and the reason service
companies choose to license the technology from ExxonMobil." 

Calfrac President and Chief Executive Officer Doug Ramsay said, "We are pleased
to add this proven stimulation technology to our portfolio and plan to promote
the effectiveness and efficiency of using the ExxonMobil MZST process with our
many customers throughout Canada and the United States." 

*MZST is a service mark of Exxon Mobil Corporation.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Statements in this release regarding future events or
conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including the
performance of new technology, could differ materially depending on geologic
conditions, technical or operating factors, and other factors discussed under
the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" on the "Investors" section of our
website at www.exxonmobil.com.

&lt;p&gt; * Initiates Dril-Quip, Dresser-Rand with overweight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sept 21 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities initiated
coverage of six capital equipment companies, including National
Oilwell Varco (NOV.N) and Cameron International (CAM.N), with
"overweight" rating citing their exposure to both onshore and
offshore markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said new deepwater drilling regulations
following the BP (BP.N) (BP.L) oil spill will likely result in
increased rig equipment orders and aftermarket services for the
companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Higher onshore rig counts will also increase equipment
demand, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Both National Oilwell and Cameron are exposed to multiple
capital equipment cycles, have substantial aftermarket growth
potential," the brokerage wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said National Oilwell has many markets to
operate in, including jackup and land rig newbuilds and blow
out preventers (BOPs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new regulations will lead to new BOP orders, upgrades,
and substantially higher parts and maintenance contracts for

&lt;p&gt;Groundbreaking mobile phone application now accepted in the New York City
subway, the PATH rail system, and NJ TRANSIT
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) announced today that commuters in New York and Los Angeles
can use the world`s most popular way to pay - Visa - for bus, subway and train
fares. In New York, Visa is allowing riders to pay using Visa payWave-enabled
cards and mobile phones, while commuters in Los Angeles can use a special Visa
prepaid card to ride the LA metro system. 

The programs in New York and Los Angeles are part of Visa`s long-term strategy
of extending the speed, security and convenience of Visa acceptance to new
locations. As part of this strategy, Visa has successfully brought payment
services to commuters in the world`s most populous areas, including Kuala
Lumpur, Seoul, Singapore, London and Paris. 

In driving acceptance at the mass transit fare gate, Visa is providing riders
with a better way to pay by eliminating the time-consuming step of searching for
cash to buy a ticket while minimizing cash handling costs for transit operators.


"Transit agencies the world over have one primary goal - to get their customers
to where they need to go quickly and efficiently. What transit agencies and
riders recognize is that using Visa on buses, subways and trains is the logical
evolution in terms of improved speed, security and convenience," said Jim
McCarthy, global head of product, Visa Inc. "For commuters, paying with Visa
means no more fumbling for change or worrying about lost transit cards. For
transit authorities, accepting Visa means better customer service, integrated
collections and the potential for increased ridership." 

The pilot program in New York uses Visa payWave technology, which is based on a
small electronic chip embedded in a mobile phone or payment card that
communicates securely with contactless readers at the fare gate and on the bus.
Transit riders pay by simply holding their Visa payWave-enabled mobile phone or
card near the designated reader at the fare gate. The program in Los Angeles is
exclusive to Visa and started September 15, 2010 and is a system wide commercial
implementation available to all riders of the LA Metro system. The TAP ReadyCARD
combines Visa prepaid functionality with the LA Metro`s TAP (Transit Access
Pass) proprietary transit application on a single card. 

As part of the company`s ongoing effort to add ever greater utility to its core
credit, debit and prepaid payment products, Visa is working closely to integrate
its electronic payments network, VisaNet, with mass transit fare collection
systems. 

New York / New Jersey

Visa payWave, Visa`s contactless payment application, is now accepted as part of
a pilot payment program underway with New York City Transit, NJ TRANSIT and The
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

* As part of Visa`s participation in the NY transit program, Visa is testing
both payment cards and popular smart phones enabled with Visa payWave. The
mobile technology, which was developed by DeviceFidelity, transforms many smart
phones with a microSD slot into a Visa payment device. 
* The NYC transit trial covers 28 stops along the Lexington subway line in
Manhattan, enabling busy commuters to pay with a wave of their mobile phone or
card enabled with Visa payWave technology. 
* Visa payWave is also accepted at most PATH rail stations in New York and New
Jersey, on several MTA bus lines in New York City, on select NJ TRANSIT bus
routes in northern New Jersey and at Newark Liberty AirTrain Station in New
Jersey. 
* In addition to Visa payWave-enabled credit, debit, prepaid cards and mobile
phones, a Visa payWave-enabled commuter benefits card will be accepted at the
fare gate and on the bus. The TransitChek QuickPay&#169; Card, a Visa prepaid card,
enables participants to pay fares using funds in their tax-advantaged flexible
spending accounts. 
* In addition to subway, trains and buses, more than 10,000 New York City cabs
have already installed state-of-the-art Visa payWave terminals enabling tourists
and locals to pay by simply waving their phone or card in front of terminals
found in the back seat of the cab.

Los Angeles

Earlier this month, Visa, the LA Metro system and Ready Credit Corporation
started a system wide commercial deployment offering riders a TAP ReadyCARD Visa
Prepaid Card that incorporates the transit system`s "TAP" fare application.
These dual-use, Visa prepaid cards will let riders pay their fares and purchase
fare products using their Visa account, while also allowing cardholders to make
purchases anywhere Visa debit is accepted. 

Two types of cards will be available to LA Metro transit riders:

* Ride, pay and reload cards - sold through automated ReadySTATION kiosks within
the LA Metro system and at select retailers. These cards will be active and
ready to use immediately for both transit fares and Visa purchases everywhere
Visa debit is accepted. Riders will be able to add up to $500 in value at the
kiosks. 
* Ride, pay, reload and ATM cash access cards - these are personalized cards,
which are ordered online or over the phone. Beyond a larger value limit, the
personalized cards have the added feature of a Personal Identification Number
(PIN) for obtaining cash at ATMs. It will also function as a standard Visa
prepaid card for purchases outside the transit system wherever Visa is accepted.
In addition, cardholders will be eligible for free direct deposit of their
paychecks directly to the Visa prepaid card account, providing added convenience
and security over payment alternatives like checks and cash, to riders currently
without traditional banking relationships.

"Combining LA Metro`s TAP with a ReadyCredit Visa prepaid card gives riders
secure and convenient access to Metro`s transit services and the ability to make
payments at Visa-accepting merchants," said Jane Matsumoto, Deputy Executive
Officer Regional TAP Program and Services, LA Metro. "This program also delivers
enhanced financial services for underbanked TAP riders, enabling them to
conveniently and securely access funds, as well as conduct everyday transactions
like reserving a hotel room, paying bills online and shopping on the Internet -
which can`t be done with cash." 

Visa Transit Around the World

In addition to the programs in New York and Los Angeles, Visa recently announced
the expansion of some of its global transit initiatives:

* Kuala Lumpur: From August 2010, Express Rail Link (ERL) accepts all domestic
and international Visa payWave cards for payment on the express train link from
Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) to the city center. Malaysia was the
first country in the world to experience the convenience and security of
EMV-based contactless payment and the KLIA Express Rail Link is the first mass
transit system in Asia Pacific to accept Visa payWave cards. 
* Singapore: In August 2010, Visa launched the Youth Olympic Games Visa Prepaid
card that combines general purpose payment, prepaid contactless transit and
event access. The card, launched in conjunction with the Inaugural Youth Olympic
Games in Singapore, allows cardholders to make purchase at Visa merchants, and
payment on Singapore`s public transportation system. As part of Visa`s
partnership with the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games Organizing Committee,
DBS Bank and EZ-Link, Youth Olympic Game attendees were able to use the card as
a ticket for entry to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies. 
* Paris: In May 2010, Visa, in collaboration with the R&#233;gie Autonome des
Transports Parisiens (RATP), the public transport operator in Paris and its
surroundings, launched a pilot to demonstrate that Visa payWave acceptance at a
Paris metro fare gate is technically feasible. 
* Istanbul: Visa Europe and DenizBank in Turkey introduced Visa payWave
acceptance at Istanbul ferry gates in partnership with IDO (Istanbul's Fast
Ferries Co. Inc). Now, Visa payWave cardholders from Turkey or abroad can simply
wave standard Visa payWave card over the gate reader and pay for their journey,
just like any other Visa payWave transaction. DenizBank also launched a special
co-branded IDO Sea Miles card that offers reward miles that can be redeemed for
free ferry travel. 
* London: A multifunctional Barclaycard Visa credit card features Visa payWave
for payment and a contactless Oyster smartcard application enabling cardholders
to use the same card to make low-value purchases and to travel throughout London
on the public transport network. Visa Europe is also actively collaborating with
Transport for London to define how Visa payWave cards might be accepted directly
at the fare gate in the London transport network.

&lt;p&gt;Premier Manufacturer of Period Lighting Streamlines Cross-Channel Operations to
Improve Visibility and Customer Experience
LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(Business Wire)--
- Chicago-based Junction Solutions (www.junctionsolutions.com), a provider of
vertical market-specific software applications and services built in Microsoft
Dynamics AX, today announced that Rejuvenation, the nation`s largest
manufacturer and leading direct marketer of authentic reproduction lighting and
house parts, has implemented JunctionMCR, an end-to-end solutions set designed
for Multi-Channel Retailers to achieve cross-channel visibility and streamline
retail operations between its stores, website and extensive catalogue business. 

Rejuvenation was founded in Portland, Oregon in 1977 by Jim Kelly, who was
renovating a historic building at the time and struggled to find historically
accurate materials and fixtures. Recognizing a niche market, he created an
architectural salvage business to serve the needs of like-minded old home
renovators. Quickly realizing that demand exceeded supply, the company began
designing and manufacturing basic reproduction Victorian and early-20th-century
ceiling fixtures and wall brackets. Today, Rejuvenation is the country`s largest
manufacturer of period lighting and sells an extensive variety of historic home
fixtures and products through its catalogue and website as well as retail stores
in Portland and Seattle. 

JunctionMCR replaced four separate IT systems. The solution provides a
standardized platform across the enterprise and enables Rejuvenation to have
complete visibility across their organization, from finance to the warehouse,
through a single system. Junction Solutions also developed a customized
Point-of-Sale solution to meet Rejuvenation`s cash and carry order needs.
Rejuvenation now has a better view of their customer and can be more responsive
and deliver an even better customer experience. 

"Rejuvenation grew from the experience of its founder," said Jeff Marker, senior
vice president, Retail Practice, Junction Solutions. "Jim Kelly had a keen
understanding of his customers` needs and built a business to meet a gap in the
marketplace. JunctionMCR provides Rejuvenation with the visibility across its
retail channels and throughout its value chain to streamline operations and
deliver an optimal customer experience." 

"Ensuring customer satisfaction is a high priority for Rejuvenation and has been
a cornerstone to our business," said Alysa Rose, President and CEO,
Rejuvenation. "JunctionMCR provided us with the foundation to achieve
operational transparency critical to enhancing business performance and meeting
customer demand. This is strategic in our growth initiatives of greater
cross-channel sales and additional retail stores. Their expertise in
cross-channel retail was very beneficial to us."

&lt;p&gt;While Finance Executives Report Advancements in Establishing Corporate Green
Programs, Several Areas for Improvement Remain
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan Treasury Services, sponsor of Treasury &amp; Risk`s first annual Going
Green survey, found that approximately 80% of the more than 200 finance
executives surveyed say green strategies or sustainability efforts have saved or
are expected to save their company money. Approximately 79% of these executives
expected to see increased efficiencies if they were to shift to a completely
green treasury operation. Certain green strategies are quite popular, including
converting paper-based treasury processes to electronic transactions, which was
cited by 71% of participants. 

While the Go Green survey identifies several successes in establishing corporate
green strategies, businesses still have a ways to go. Only 31% say their company
has assessed its carbon footprint. In addition, only 37% say their company`s
environmental strategy is integrated in its business plan, and a mere 20% have
factored climate change into business sustainability plans. Less than half say
their company has formal environmental policies or sustainability programs. 

"Migrating to electronic Treasury processes can have a measurable impact on a
corporation`s carbon footprint as large treasury operations can easily generate
5.5 tons of paper each year-the equivalent of 143 trees and 106 tons of
greenhouse gasses," said Susan Webb, managing director, J.P. Morgan Treasury
Services. "We sponsored this survey to highlight the benefits of establishing a
completely green treasury and help bring greater focus to what role finance
executives can take in improving corporate sustainability efforts." 

"In addition to environmental concerns, today`s economic climate is making it
even more essential for treasury departments to go green," observed Gregory
Long, Vice President, J.P. Morgan Treasury Services. "Many face tremendous
pressure to trim costs, operate more efficiently and improve customer service.
Electronic solutions help businesses automate workflow, give them instant access
to financial data and eliminate the costs and risks of producing and storing
paper." 

J.P. Morgan Treasury Services began its own "Go Green" campaign in 2007. Since
then, the Bank has helped treasury clients eliminate more than 101 million paper
documents and save three million pounds of paper annually. In addition, J.P.
Morgan clients report that the Bank`s Web-enabled image technology has helped
improve efficiency within their own treasury operations. For example, clients
have decreased the amount of time needed to identify and resolve exceptions;
manually enter data into accounts receivables or payables systems; manage, store
and retrieve paper documents from on and off-site storage facilities; and
research and respond to internal and external requests. 

J.P. Morgan`s "Go Green" campaign in the Asia-Pacific region covers a wide range
of services, including Yen clearing and multi-currency clearing. J.P. Morgan
Treasury Services in Japan surpassed its paper reduction objectives in 2009 by
decreasing the amount of paper advice and statements sent to its clients by 83
percent. Amongst the 155 banks that are members of Japan`s Tokyo Dollar Clearing
system, 54 have actively participated in these efforts to promote an
environmentally friendly future, increase their efficiency and mitigate risk by
choosing paperless solutions for their treasury operations. 

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., parent company of J.P. Morgan Treasury Services, launched
its own business sustainability efforts several years ago. The company has been
measuring its carbon footprint since 2005 and has taken numerous steps to
improve its carbon impacts, such as increased recycling and decreased water use
and emissions from employee travel. The company also has reduced paper use by
utilizing electronic transactions within its own divisions, including Card,
Retail and Treasury Services operations.

&lt;p&gt;  SHELTON, CT, Sep 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
CYA Technologies, an enChoice(R) company, today announced the
availability of the IBM(R) Tivoli(R) Storage Manager (TSM) Backup Module
for CYA SmartRecovery(TM). This new module enables customers on IBM
FileNet(R) P8 versions 4.0 and higher to reduce storage costs by backing
up repository content directly to IBM TSM without any P8 downtime.

    CYA SmartRecovery is an application-aware hot backup and granular
recovery solution for enterprise content management (ECM) systems that
complements existing backup products. It provides hot, synchronized
backups and hot, granular recovery of P8 objects (content and metadata).
To date, CYA SmartRecovery's P8 object backups have been stored on disk,
however, the IBM TSM Backup Module helps customers reduce storage costs
by providing them with the less-expensive option of storing the content
within TSM. 

    According to the InformationWeek Analytics 2010 State of Enterprise
Storage Survey*, 85 percent of technology professionals say their
companies have data growth rates of more than 10 percent per year, with
87 percent currently managing more than one terabyte of data, and 29
percent managing more than 100 terabytes. IT budgets are not keeping up
with this growth. According to a global CIO survey conducted by
Gartner**, IT budgets will increase only 1.1 percent this year. 

    "Our new module can save P8 customers using IBM TSM a significant amount
of money because they don't have to invest in new storage technologies to
accommodate repository backups that are growing larger and larger by the
day," said Mike Fernandes, director of product management and services
for CYA. "It also helps them store information more efficiently by
facilitating a tiered storage strategy that lets them choose the content
backup location that best meets their needs and requirements."

    The IBM TSM Backup Module is available with CYA SmartRecovery version
4.0. CYA SmartRecovery is also available for EMC Documentum. For more
information, please visit www.cya.com or www.facebook.com/cyatech.

enChoice company, provides the only end-to-end portfolio of
application-aware solutions that optimize enterprise content management
(ECM) system efficiency, facilitate compliance, and insure companies

&lt;p&gt;World-Famous Supercentarian Another Year Older and More Remarkable
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") today celebrates the
remarkable birthday of one of its most famous residents Walter Breuning,
certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world`s oldest living man
at the age of 114. The celebration will take place at The Rainbow Senior Living
in Great Falls, Montana, where Walter has resided for the past 30 years. 

"What Walter has achieved by reaching the age of 114 is no small feat," said
Robert Young, Senior Consultant for Gerontology, Guinness World Records. "Walter
officially became the Oldest Man in the World on July 18, 2009, and the fact
that he has held this record for over a year is amazing. The 2011 edition of the
Guinness Book of World Records is the first edition that recognizes Walter`s
accomplishment, and I`m so pleased to personally present him with a copy today."


The age of 114 has been reached much more often by women. So far, Guinness has
recognized 72 women, but only five men, to have reached the age of 114.
Currently, the world`s oldest person, Eugenie Blanchard of the French island of
Saint Barthelemy, born February 16, 1896, is just seven months older than
Walter. 

Expected to attend Walter`s birthday celebration today at The Rainbow Senior
Living are Mr. Young and the Governor of Montana Brian Schweitzer, in addition
to several Shriners (Walter is the oldest living Shriner), friends, and fellow
residents. 

"All of us here at Ventas wish Walter a very happy birthday and a wonderful
114th year," Ventas Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Debra A.
Cafaro said. 

In anticipation of this birthday, Walter reflected on the three centuries his
life has spanned and shared some of his experiences and thoughts, which are
shown below. 

Life in the 1900s:

There was no electricity, and transportation was only horses and the Great
Northern Railway, and no running water or bathroom in the houses - imagine that.


Growing up during WWI:

It was pretty tough business; you had no choice, you just had to do what was
going on. There were no jobs, and you were just lucky to get a job. My job on
the railroad paid $60 a month and that was a lot of money. 

Invention of the Car:

We boys would take out the Model T and about every five miles you had to get out
and change out the tires, patch them up and pump them up and then off we`d go
again. 

The Great Depression:

Banks were closing all over the place; there was no money and no jobs. If the
war hadn`t started, we`d still be in a Depression! And my advice, stay working
as long as you can and don`t retire too early `cause you`ll find out you need a
little more money than what Social Security pays. 

Most Memorable Invention:

Radio and TV are probably the biggest inventions that changed the world. And
then in the 1960s the computer made a real difference in how business was done. 

Most Memorable Event:

Halley`s Comet, the flash of fire lasted three nights. People stayed up all
night to see the ball of fire going across the sky - that was quite a sight. 

Secret to a Long Life:

I`ll tell you one thing is diet - stay slim and keep that mind and body busy all
the time, and you`ll find it a darn good thing to do. 

Words of Wisdom:

Be good to everybody, be kind to everybody, and help other people. The more you
do for other people, the better you are going to help yourself. Every day is a
good day and make it that way.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) plans to
invest up to 5.5 billion rupees ($121 million) in a new plant
it would set up in south India, a senior company official said,
as it expands capacity in one of the fast-growing markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt Ltd, a unit of Coca-Cola
Co, will build the plant in Karnataka state to make sparkling
and still beverages, juices and juice drinks, T. Krishnakumar,
CEO of the unit said in a statement to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We want to ensure that we create adequate capacity to meet
the projected growth in the packaged beverage market over the
coming years," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company plans to invest 2.5 billion rupees to set up
the facility and has also provisioned to spend 3 billion rupees
in the second phase, Krishnakumar said, adding Coca-Cola had so
far invested more than $1 billion in its Indian operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new plant would be in addition to two bottling plants
already operational in the state, he said. Coca-Cola currently
has 23 company owned bottling facilities, 22 franchise-owned
plants and 11 contract packing units in India.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The timing of the Securities and Exchange Commission's case against Goldman Sachs Group Inc is "suspicious," a federal watchdog said, suggesting that the SEC used it to divert attention from a report that sharply criticized its probe into accused Ponzi schemer Allen Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SEC filed civil fraud charges against Goldman in mid-April, the same day it released a watchdog report accusing the agency of mishandling an investigation into Stanford's alleged $7 billion Ponzi scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report by SEC Inspector General David Kotz said the regulator suspected as early as 1997 that Stanford was running a Ponzi scheme but did nothing to stop it until late 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing "strains credulity," Kotz told a congressional hearing on Wednesday examining the SEC's handling of the Stanford case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kotz's report went largely unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford is in a Texas jail awaiting trial on 21 criminal charges related to his alleged Ponzi scheme involving the issuance by his Antiguan bank of certificates of deposit with improbably high interest rates. The SEC filed civil charges related to the matter in February 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Republican lawmakers accused the SEC of suing Goldman to help Democrats pass the landmark Wall Street reform bill, which was winding its way through Congress in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kotz is probing whether the SEC's lawsuit against Goldman was politically motivated, a charge the SEC vehemently denies. He expects to complete his Goldman report by the end of next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Senate Banking Committee hearing, the top Republican, Richard Shelby, said the Stanford case represents a "major failure" by the SEC. He also suggested the timing was suspect and seemed intended to draw lowered scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC, still recovering from missing Bernard Madoff's $65 billion Ponzi scheme, is under pressure to root out fraud after the U.S. housing collapse and Wall Street's ensuing meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEC REGRETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC's enforcement director, Robert Khuzami, and other SEC officials apologized at the hearing and said they had deep regrets that the regulator failed to act more quickly to limit losses suffered by Stanford investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But apologies did little to assuage Stanford victims, who traveled to Washington to attend the hearing and snickered as the regulators testified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel that the SEC did a good job of covering their own tails. I think they were part of the problem in this whole thing," said Richard Muzyka, 67, of Fort Myers Beach, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muzyka is a retiree who initially invested with Stanford because of the company's seeming stable returns, which he saw as attractive for someone living on a fixed retirement income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kotz's report found the SEC's Fort Worth, Texas, office examined Stanford in 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2004, "concluding in each case that Stanford's CDs were likely a Ponzi scheme or a similar fraudulent scheme."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the enforcement arm of the SEC finally agreed to seek a formal order from the commission to investigate Stanford. But Kotz said it failed to conduct due diligence on his investment portfolio, a missed opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kotz said he was talking to criminal authorities about the former head of enforcement in Fort Worth, Spencer Barasch, who "played a significant role" in quashing investigations of Stanford and sought to represent him on three occasions after he left the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According the report, Barasch briefly represented Stanford in 2006 before being informed by the SEC ethics office that it was improper to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked why he was so insistent on representing Stanford, Barasch replied: "Every lawyer in Texas and beyond is going to get rich over this case. Okay? And I hated being on the sidelines," according to Kotz's report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republican Senator Jim Bunning said he "almost fell off his chair" when he read that and asked Kotz whether that looked like criminal negligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kotz only said he was talking to criminal authorities and would not elaborate further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barasch is a partner at the law firm Andrews Kurth LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the firm's managing partner, Bob Jewell, called Kotz's testimony "disappointing," and said Barasch "acted properly during his contacts with the Stanford Financial Group and the Securities and Exchange Commission. He did not violate conflicts of interest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC has said that most of Kotz's seven recommendations have been implemented and that it would carefully analyze the report and implement any additional reforms as necessary for effective investor protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kotz's report says that even after SEC examiners identified multiple violations of securities laws by Stanford in 2002, the enforcement division did not open an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said senior Fort Worth office officials perceived they were judged by the number of cases they brought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Novel or complex cases were disfavored," he concluded. "As a result, cases like Stanford, which were not considered 'quick-hit' or 'slam-dunk' cases, were not encouraged."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joe Rauch and Rachelle Younglai; Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), the
world's largest software company, sold $4.75 billion in debt on
Wednesday at the lowest corporate borrowing rates on record for
its three-year notes, a market source said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Proceeds for the bonds, due in three years, five years, 10
years and 30 years, will be used for general corporate
purposes, Microsoft said in a filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft sold $1 billion of three-year notes priced at a
record coupon of 0.875 percent, equating to a yield of 25 basis
points more than comparable U.S. Treasuries, and $1.75 billion
of five-year notes priced at 40 basis points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also sold $1 billion of 10-year notes priced at
55 basis points over Treasuries, and $1 billion of 30-year
bonds were sold at 83 basis points, the source said.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Cooper Raises Guidance

Cooper Industries plc (NYSE: CBE) has increased its revenue and earnings per
share guidance for the third quarter of 2010. The company had anticipated its
third quarter revenue to expand by 2% to 5% year over year, including the effect
of the deconsolidation of the Tools segment. The revenue growth guidance has now
been raised by the company to the range of 6% to 8%. 

The company also increased its earnings per share guidance to the range of 82
cents to 85 cents from its prior range of 75 cents to 80 cents. Cooper also
expects its share repurchase for 2010 to reach 6 million by end of the quarter.
The third quarter 2010 financial results will be reported by the company on
October 21, 2010. 

Cooper Industries and Danaher Corporation (NYSE: DHR) on July 6 announced the
completion of the joint venture combining Cooper`s Tools business with certain
tools businesses from Danaher Corporation`s Tools and Components segment. As a
result of this JV, Cooper`s Tools Segment was deconsolidated in its consolidated
financial statements from the beginning of the third quarter. The segment will
be reflected as an equity investment on Cooper`s balance sheet and as equity
earnings from a joint venture in the consolidated income statement. The joint
venture is named Apex Tool Group, LLC. As per the agreement, both Cooper and
Danaher will each own 50% share of the new company and will have equal
representation on the joint venture`s Board of Directors. 

Cooper has several opportunities for additional growth in the current year
including stimulus spending, restructuring benefits and accretive capital
allocation in the form of share repurchase or mergers and acquisitions. If
Congress decides to retroactively reverse tax inversion legislation, Cooper`s
tax rate would be higher than expected, which will, in turn, affect earnings.
While earnings risk still remains, we believe that the previous year marked the
bottom of the earnings cycle. 

The company will likely realize an outsized portion of its growth from
developing markets in China, the Middle East and Mexico. Industrial, utility and
energy markets are expected to rapidly expand and industrializing economies will
help offset some of the declines in the already developed regions. This will
eventually help support higher growth rates for the current year. 

However, heightened global competition, given that Cooper expands its
international exposure, can act as a negative catalyst for the company. Major
competitors of the company are ABB Ltd. (NYSE: ABB), General Electric Co. (NYSE:
GE) and Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc. (NYSE: SWK). Operations and supply sources
located outside the United States, particularly the emerging markets, are
subject to increased risks. Operating entities outside the USA contribute
significantly to the company`s revenue and earnings. 

Incorporated in Ireland, headquartered in Houston, Texas, Cooper Industries plc
is a diversified manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of electrical products,
tools, and hardware. General industrial manufacturers, such as those in the
aerospace and automobile industries, are the main users of Cooper`s power tools
and assembly systems. Its brands include Buss, Edison, Crouse Hinds, Weller,
DGD, Buckeye, Cooper, and Master Power. 

We continue to maintain a Neutral rating on Cooper Industries, with a Zacks #2
Rank (Buy recommendation) over the next one-to-three months.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AA+' rating to Microsoft Corporation's
(Microsoft) proposed offering of up to $6 billion in senior notes. Proceeds from
the offering are to be used for general corporate purposes including share
repurchases and potential acquisitions. 

Fitch currently rates Microsoft as follows: 

--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'AA+'; 

--Senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF) 'AA+'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'AA+'; 

--Short-term IDR 'F1+'' 

--Commercial paper (CP) Program 'F1+'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. 

The ratings and Stable Outlook are supported by Microsoft's: i) leading market
position in its core software businesses; ii) industry leading liquidity,
supported by a considerable cash position and consistent strong free cash flow;
and iii) unparalleled financial performance and operating profile, complemented
by a sizable recurring revenue base. 

The company's sizable liquidity and superior credit profile provide a
significant degree of financial flexibility within the current ratings. Fitch
believes Microsoft will become more active with acquisitions and share buybacks
than it has been during the economic downturn, although overall activity is
expected to remain conservative relative to the company's total liquidity and
free cash flow profile. Fitch expects the company to continue to maintain a
significant net cash position. Nonetheless, the company has ample capacity for
significant acquisition activity, particularly given its large cash balance. 

Although Microsoft's software licensing revenue model currently faces various
competitive pressures, Fitch does not believe there are any near-term threats or
financial risks that would place the company outside of current ratings. That
said, longer-term rating concerns consist of: i) new software models that could
challenge Microsoft's highly profitable model, including open-source software,
software as a service, or advertising-supported software; ii) gross margin
pressures attributable to investments in and stronger growth of products/regions
with lower average selling price (emerging markets, netbooks); iii)
substantially lower operating margins for the Online Services and Entertainment
&amp; Devices Divisions, which represent nearly 20% of total revenue; and iv)
further legal and/or regulatory actions that could impede the company's course
of business. Fitch expects higher international growth and the ongoing expansion
into adjacent businesses will continue to pressure margins, but are unlikely to
materially affect free cash flow.

  (Updates to late afternoon)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Edward Krudy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday
in a tech-led decline after a weak revenue forecast from Adobe
Systems Inc (ADBE.O) and a dividend increase from Microsoft
Corp (MSFT.O) that disappointed some investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Federal Reserve's cautious statement in the last
session, which hinted that the U.S. central bank may embark on
a new round of monetary stimulus, unsettled some investors who
had become more optimistic about the economy as stocks rallied
to a four-month high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adobe slid 19.7 percent to $26.45, the heaviest weight on
the SP 500 and the Nasdaq, after the software maker forecast
lower-than-expected revenue, prompting analysts to slash their
ratings on the stock. [ID:nN21181826]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frank Ingarra, a fund manager at Hennessy Funds in
Stamford, Connecticut, said Adobe is a warning to companies
that fall short of revenue or issue bearish guidance in the
coming earnings season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The same theme is going to come from the second quarter
into the third: Who has revenue growth and what is their
guidance?" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft MSFT. fell 2.7 percent at $24.47 after the
company raised its quarterly dividend. But the move to return
cash to shareholders, frustrated by a stagnant company stock
price, fell short of some investors' expectations. For details,
see [ID:nN21191991]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 17.33
points, or 0.16 percent, to 10,743.70. The Standard  Poor's
500 .SPX fell 4.55 points, or 0.40 percent, to 1,135.23. The
Nasdaq Composite .IXIC lost 18.44 points, or 0.78 percent, to
2,330.91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 has rallied almost 9 percent in the last 3
weeks, hitting a four month-high and breaching a strong
technical resistance level as improved economic data suggested
the economy might not slide back into recession as some had
feared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gold hit a record $1,296.10 per ounce and the price of the
30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose more than a full point as its
yield slid to a three-week low on hopes the Fed may boost its
purchases of Treasuries as part of a second round of
quantitative easing. The Arca Gold Bugs index .HUI rose 0.7
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset
Management in Bedford Hills, New York, said investors were torn
between promises of cheap money and concerns about the Fed's
dour outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a bit of a mixed blessing," he said, adding that
concern about the economy was "creeping back up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other downbeat corporate news, Chipmaker PMC-Sierra Inc
(PMCS.O) also cut its third-quarter revenue outlook and
forecast gross margins at the lower end of its expectations,
driving its stock down 7.2 percent to $7.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of online retail site operator eBay Inc (EBAY.O)
fell 2 percent to $24.23 after it eliminated the likelihood
that its third-quarter profit would beat analyst expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cereal maker General Mills Inc (GIS.N) reported slightly
better-than-expected quarterly profit. The stock rose 3.8
percent to $36.04.

&lt;p&gt;Says Oil Giant's Legal Motions Are "Spiraling out of Control"
NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(Business Wire)--
A federal magistrate judge in Tennessee told Chevron yesterday that he would
sharply limit any further discovery of a scientific consultant for the Amazonian
communities suing for the clean-up of what is believed to be the world`s worst
oil-related disaster, according to court papers in the case. 

Judge Joe B. Brown, in an order, limited further discovery by Chevron and ruled
that the oil giant cannot "use" the U.S. federal court "to try a dispute that is
pending in a foreign proceeding." The case against Chevron is being heard in
Ecuador at the request of the company after 30,000 Ecuadorians originally filed
suit in U.S. federal court in 1993. 

Judge Brown was ruling on Chevron`s attempt to obtain further testimony and
document production from Mark Quarles, a former scientific consultant for the
Ecuadorian communities based in Nashville. Quarles already was deposed by
Chevron; he is one of 23 persons in ten states that Chevron has sued in federal
courts to get discovery documents related to the Ecuador case to try to prove
that a "fraud" occurred in the preparation of a damages assessment. 

Lawyers for the plaintiffs in Ecuador have called the discovery lawsuits a form
of harassment designed to exhaust the resources of the Amazonian communities
just as the long-running trial comes to a close. They also say that Chevron`s
allegations are actually designed to distract attention from its own fraud and
misconduct; two Chevron officials are under criminal indictment in Ecuador for
lying about the results of a purported environmental clean-up. 

Both Chevron and the Amazonian communities say the evidence points to Chevron`s
culpability and that a judgment against Chevron is likely. 

In the Quarles case, Judge Brown wrote that the discovery proceeding initiated
by Chevron "is not an opportunity to put on a full trial" and ruled that
"Chevron is not entitled to pierce the work-product protection&#8230;because it has
not shown the `exceptional circumstances` required" by the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure. 

Judge Brown noted in his ruling that what should be a limited proceeding is
quickly "spiraling out of control." He added: 

"Chevron had the opportunity to litigate this matter in the United States and
strongly opposed jurisdiction in favor of litigating in the Ecuadorian courts.
While fraud on any court is a serious accusation that must be investigated, it
is not within the power of this court to do so, any more than a court in Ecuador
should be used to investigate fraud on this court." 

"Chevron`s litigation strategy throughout the trial has been one of designed to
distract and delay," said Pablo Fajardo, the Ecuadorian lawyer for the
communities. 

"All information that Chevron supposedly is seeking is already squarely before
the Ecuadorian court and most of it has been in the trial record for years," he
added. "In the meantime, thousands of people are suffering from cancers and
other health impacts as a result of Chevron`s contamination."

  (Updates to midday, changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Edward Krudy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday
in a tech-led decline after a weak revenue forecast from Adobe
Systems Inc (ADBE.O) and a dividend increase from Microsoft
Corp (MSFT.O) that disappointed some investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Federal Reserve's cautious statement in the last

new dollars into the economy, also unsettled some investors who
had adopted a more optimistic view of the economy as stocks
have rallied in recent weeks. On Monday, the day before the
Fed's meeting, the SP 500 ended at a four-month high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adobe Systems Inc (ADBE.O) slid 20 percent to $26.39,
making it the heaviest weight on the SP 500 and the Nasdaq,
after the software maker forecast lower-than-expected revenues,
prompting analysts to slash their ratings on the
stock.[ID:nN21181826]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Clearly, Adobe was a disappointment," said Michael James,
a senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in
Los Angeles. "That is having some impact. The Nasdaq is
underperforming the rest of the market, but I think a big part
of that is Microsoft, too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp MSFT. fell 2.8 percent at $24.45 after the
company raised its quarterly dividend. But Microsoft's latest
move to return cash to shareholders, frustrated by stagnant
share prices, fell short of some investors' expectations. For
detail, see [ID:nN21191991]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 35.23

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/5fd912/computer_software) has
announced the addition of the "Computer Software Development" report to their
offering. 

The US computer software development industry involves about 50,000 companies
with combined annual revenue of about $220 billion. About 60 percent of industry
revenues come from software publishing and the rest from custom programming.
Large companies include Activision Blizzard, CA, Microsoft, Oracle, and
Symantec. The packaged products segment is concentrated: the 50 largest
companies generate about 70 percent of revenue. The custom programming segment
is highly fragmented. 

Large companies often are involved in both publishing and programming services,
while smaller programming firms typically sell their products to publishers. 

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

The US economy heavily influences business spending for software products. The
success of programming companies depends heavily on strong technical expertise.
The success of packaged-software companies depends on technical expertise and
good marketing. Small software companies compete mainly by developing packaged
products in small niches or producing custom products for individuals. Many
small companies form alliances with larger ones to market their products. 

The packaged software industry is capital-intensive: average annual revenue per
worker is about $360,000. The custom programming industry is relatively
labor-intensive: average annual revenue per worker is about $175,000. 

PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS &amp; TECHNOLOGY 

Packaged software products are generally programs that can be installed and
operated by the customer with little or no assistance, such as an operating
system. Custom programming either creates a new software product from scratch,
or, more typically, customizes an existing software product for customer use.

balance sheet and modest financial leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, Microsoft raised its quarterly dividend by 23
percent to 16 cents per share, disappointing some investors who

&lt;p&gt;Detroit-Area Real-Estate Brokerage Firms Alleged to Have Overcharged Home
Sellers
DETROIT--(Business Wire)--
The Detroit area is one of the most economically depressed in the country with
declining home prices and sales leading the way. Now comes news from the Federal
Trade Commission that various Detroit-area real-estate brokerage firms may have
victimized as many as 141,000 home sellers in the region by manipulating
real-estate commissions. Now, time is running out for victims seeking
restitution in this case, as the statute of limitations is October 12, 2010. 

The FTC recently ruled that the Detroit area`s multi-listing service, called
Realcomp II, manipulated its membership rules. These manipulated rules kept
participating real-estate brokerages from fully publicizing discounted options
for listing homes, which options could have resulted in lower real-estate
brokerage commissions paid by home sellers. According to the FTC, these Rule
changes may have significantly increased home sellers` real-estate commissions,
which could translate into significant dollars. 

The FTC`s action concerns people who sold homes in Livingston, Oakland, Macomb,
or Wayne County between May 2004 and April 27, 2007.

  (Updates to mid-morning trade)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Angela Moon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street fell on Wednesday

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities
Trust 2010-C2 (US CMBS)
http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=562213

Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial
Mortgage Securities Corp. commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series
2010-C2. 

Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Loss Severity (LS) ratings as
follows, with a Stable Outlook: 

--$266,660,000 class A-1 'AAAsf/LS1';
--$243,099,000 class A-2 'AAAsf/LS1';
--$390,533,000 class A-3 'AAAsf/LS1';
--$900,292,000* class X-A 'AAAsf';
--$37,168,000 class B 'AAsf/LS3';
--$53,688,000 class C 'Asf/LS3';
--$33,038,000 class D 'BBB+sf/LS3';
--$22,025,000 class E 'BBB-sf/LS4';
--$16,520,000 class F 'BBsf/LS4';
--$13,766,000 class G 'Bsf/LS4';
--$2,753,000 class H 'B-sf/LS5'. 

*Notional amount and interest only. 

The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as of Sept.
17, 2010. 

The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, primary assets
of which are 30 loans secured by 47 commercial properties having an aggregate
principal balance of approximately $1.101 billion as of the cutoff date. The
loans were originated by JP Morgan Chase Bank, National Association. 

Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, including
site inspections on 78.8% of the properties by balance, cash flow analysis of
92.8% of the pool and asset summary reviews on 97.7% of the pool. 

The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.32
times (x), a Fitch stressed loan-to value (LTV) of 83%, and a Fitch debt yield
of 10.9%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a variance of 6% to issuer
cash flows and 22% below full-year 2009 performance. This compares favorably
relative to the average Fitch DSCR and LTV of 1.05x and 110.7% across Fitch
rated conduit transactions in 2007. 

The transaction is concentrated by loan and sponsor. The largest 10 loans
account for 74.5% of the pool and the largest 15 account for 84.9%.
Additionally, Simon Property Group, via joint ventures, is among the sponsors of
the largest and fourth-largest loans, which account for 23% of the pool. 

The Master Servicer and Special Servicer will be Midland Loan Services, Inc.
(rated 'CMS1' and 'CSS1', respectively, by Fitch).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Steven Donziger, one of the attorneys representing the Ecuadorian plaintiffs,
said today in response to a hearing in the federal Southern District Court of
New York concerning Chevron`s attempt to seek discovery of privileged
attorney-client communications and work product: 

"Chevron`s efforts to smear those acting to hold the oil giant accountable for
its criminal misconduct in Ecuador is a long-running tactic of the company. I am
the fourth lawyer to represent the Amazonian communities in Ecuador who has been
the target of what believe is abusive legal action by Chevron; this is all part
of the company`s strategy to delay the trial and distract attention from the
mountain of evidence pointing to its responsibility for massive contamination in
Ecuador`s Amazon rainforest. Some of my remarks taken out of context from
discarded outtakes from the film `Crude` may be viewed as intemperate or
ill-advised. Understood in their full context, they were part of the plaintiffs`
response to clear evidence that Chevron was exercising corrupt influence over
Ecuador`s court system and had done so for decades while it discharged billions
of gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon. 

"Chevron itself does not dispute that it dumped billions of gallons of toxic
`water of formation` into Amazon waterways, relied upon by thousands of
indigenous people for their drinking water. As a result, recent scientific
evidence presented by respected American technical experts demonstrates that
thousands of citizens are at risk of dying of cancer in the coming decades if
there is no clean-up. I will continue to work for the victims of Chevron`s
intentional misconduct and I will not be deterred by Chevron`s campaign of
personal destruction to undermine the claims of its victims."

&lt;p&gt;  BUSSIGNY, SWITZERLAND, Sep 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Westcore Europe, an affiliate of U.S.-based Westcore Properties, today
announced the 12'120'000 (CHF) sale of Coca Cola Logistics, a
7,174-square-meter industrial building located at Route de Sorge 1 in
Bussigny-Pres-Lausanne, Switzerland, to Procimmo Swiss Commercial Fund
(PSCF), a public real estate investment fund.

    Westcore Europe represented itself in the transaction. The buyer was
represented by Jean-Philippe Barbey of NAEF &amp; Cie. The lender was Banque
Cantonale Vaudoise (BCV).

    According to Olivier Hezelot, asset manager with Westcore Europe, the
sale follows Westcore's successful completion of several value-added
capital improvements. 

    "This first rate property is well-located in a commercial development
zone, just 40 minutes from the Geneva Airport and less than a mile from
the E25 Highway, leading to the A1 Highway connecting Geneva with
Lausanne and Bern. This coupled with its fully leased status to strong
credit tenants, represented a great opportunity for PSCF," he said.

    The primarily industrial facility also includes mixed-use and office
space. Tenants of the building include DHL Express and Societe de la
Loterie de la Suisse Romande. PSCF plans to hold the property as an
investment.

    Westcore Europe acquired the Coca Cola Logistics building in 2006. The
project is part of Westcore's worldwide 10.6-million-square-foot

NUEVA YORK--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) anunci&#243; hoy un compromiso de donaci&#243;n de 1
mill&#243;n de d&#243;lares estadounidenses a la Iniciativa Global Clinton (Clinton Global
Initiative, CGI) para invertir en la expansi&#243;n de tecnolog&#237;as sostenibles de
alto impacto para hacer prosperar econ&#243;micamente a las mujeres en el mundo en
desarrollo. 

Se prev&#233; que el programa beneficie de manera directa a m&#225;s de 13.500 personas,
con beneficios indirectos para m&#225;s de 475.000 personas en los pr&#243;ximos dos a&#241;os.


El nuevo compromiso ayudar&#225; a los innovadores a ampliar las tecnolog&#237;as que
beneficien econ&#243;micamente a las mujeres y fueron identificados a trav&#233;s de la
alianza de ExxonMobil con Ashoka`s Changemakers en el desaf&#237;o Mujeres |
Herramientas | Tecnolog&#237;a:Construyendo Oportunidades y Valor Econ&#243;mico,
presentado en la CGI del a&#241;o pasado. El nuevo aporte financiero de ExxonMobil
ayudar&#225; a proporcionar apoyo de consultor&#237;a, facilitar&#225; los contactos de los
innovadores con otros empresarios sociales, expertos empresariales y t&#233;cnicos, e
identificar&#225; las mejores pr&#225;cticas. 

"Los programas identificados a trav&#233;s del compromiso de 2009 usan la tecnolog&#237;a
para mejorar la vida de las mujeres en los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo", afirm&#243; Suzanne
M. McCarron, gerenta general de Asuntos P&#250;blicos y Gubernamentales de
ExxonMobil. "Al ofrecer un mayor apoyo a estos programas, estaremos fomentando
tecnolog&#237;as que han demostrado crear m&#225;s oportunidades econ&#243;micas para las
mujeres y, en consecuencia, fortaleceremos sus comunidades". 

Un obst&#225;culo importante para el progreso econ&#243;mico es la falta de acceso a la
energ&#237;a. Se estima que 1600 millones de personas en el mundo no tienen acceso a
la red el&#233;ctrica y aproximadamente 2400 millones dependen de combustibles de
biomasa como madera, carb&#243;n vegetal o esti&#233;rcol para cocinar y calentar. Esto
perjudica la productividad, la educaci&#243;n, la salud y la seguridad de estas
personas, de las cuales el 70 % son mujeres y ni&#241;as. 

Las donaciones de ExxonMobil se ofrecer&#225;n a innovadores seleccionados que
promuevan tecnolog&#237;as para aumentar el acceso a la energ&#237;a a trav&#233;s de fuentes
innovadoras. Estas tecnolog&#237;as ayudan a las mujeres a aumentar la productividad
y la participaci&#243;n efectiva en la econom&#237;a. Entre los beneficiarios de las
donaciones se incluyenKopernik, Solar Electric Light Fund, Solar Sister,
Productive Agricultural Linkages and Marketing Systems (P.A.L.M.S) y
smallsolutions. 

"Mi pa&#237;s ser&#225; un lugar mejor cuando un mayor n&#250;mero de mujeres tenga acceso a
las tecnolog&#237;as", manifest&#243; Leticia Brenyah, una innovadora de Ghana apoyada por
ExxonMobil que habl&#243; en la CGI como parte del &#225;rea de enfoque "Empowering Girls
and Women" (Empoderamiento de ni&#241;as y mujeres) de la reuni&#243;n. "Cuando las
mujeres prosperan econ&#243;micamente mejoran sus vidas, sus familias y su pa&#237;s". 

Como parte de su apoyo a los programas identificados a trav&#233;s del programa
Mujeres | Herramientas | Tecnolog&#237;a, ExxonMobil trabajar&#225; con los socios
Ashoka`s Changemakers, International Center for Research on Women (Centro
internacional de investigaci&#243;n sobre la mujer) y Thunderbird Emerging Markets
Laboratory (TEM Lab) para apoyar el desarrollo adicional de una serie de
conceptos que impliquen el uso de tecnolog&#237;as innovadoras que permitan el acceso
de la mujer a la energ&#237;a de manera sostenible y escalable. 

TEM Lab desplegar&#225; equipos de consultor&#237;a en el &#225;rea para ayudar a diagnosticar
problemas y oportunidades de negocio con el objetivo de reforzar la efectividad
del programa. 

"Estamos muy contentos de formar parte de esta significativa alianza que
aprovecha la experiencia empresarial y tecnol&#243;gica para permitir a los
innovadores mejorar su capacidad", expres&#243; &#193;ngel Cabrera, presidente de
Thunderbird School of Global Management. 

Los innovadores tendr&#225;n la oportunidad de participar con los expertos en la CGI
y utilizar Ashoka`s Changemakers Discovery Framework para comprender mejor los
retos y las oportunidades para desarrollar sus conceptos. 

"La pasi&#243;n y las nuevas ideas representadas por las soluciones obtenidas a
trav&#233;s del compromiso del a&#241;o pasado y el posterior desaf&#237;oMujeres |
Herramientas | Tecnolog&#237;a:Construyendo Oportunidades y Valor Econ&#243;mico
representan una fuerza nueva y potente para la promoci&#243;n de oportunidades

NOVA YORK--(Business Wire)--
A Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) anunciou hoje uma doa&#231;&#227;o de US$ 1 milh&#227;o na
Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) para investir na expans&#227;o de tecnologias
sustent&#225;veis e de alto impacto, que promovem mulheres economicamente nos pa&#237;ses
em desenvolvimento. 

Espera-se que o programa beneficie diretamente mais de 13.500 pessoas, com
benef&#237;cios indiretos para mais de 475 mil pessoas nos pr&#243;ximos dois anos. 

A nova doa&#231;&#227;o ajudar&#225; inovadores a expandir tecnologias que beneficiam mulheres
economicamente e foram identificadas por meio da parceria da ExxonMobil com
Ashoka`s Changemakers no Women | Tools | Technology:Building Opportunities &amp;
Economic Power Challenge, lan&#231;ado na CGI do ano passado. O novo apoio financeiro
da ExxonMobil ajudar&#225; a fornecer suporte de consultoria, facilitar as conex&#245;es
dos inovadores com outros empreendedores sociais, especialistas t&#233;cnicos e
empresariais e identificar melhores pr&#225;ticas. 

"Os programas identificados por meio da doa&#231;&#227;o de 2009 usam a tecnologia para
melhorar a vida das mulheres nos pa&#237;ses em desenvolvimento", disse Suzanne M.
McCarron, gerente geral de assuntos p&#250;blicos e governamentais da ExxonMobil. "Ao
apoiarmos ainda mais estes programas, promoveremos as tecnologias que
comprovadamente criam mais oportunidades econ&#244;micas para mulheres e, por isso,
fortalecem suas comunidades". 

Um obst&#225;culo consider&#225;vel ao progresso econ&#244;mico &#233; a falta de acesso &#224; energia.
Estima-se que 1,6 bilh&#227;o de pessoas no mundo n&#227;o t&#234;m acesso a eletricidade e
cerca de 2,4 bilh&#245;es dependem de combust&#237;veis de biomassa como madeira, carv&#227;o
ou fezes para o preparo de alimentos e o aquecimento dos lares. Isto prejudica a
produtividade, a educa&#231;&#227;o, a sa&#250;de e a seguran&#231;a destas pessoas, sendo 70% delas
mulheres e garotas. 

As doa&#231;&#245;es da ExxonMobil ser&#227;o fornecidas para selecionar inovadores que
promovam tecnologias para aumentar o acesso &#224; energia por meio de fontes
inovadoras. Estas tecnologias ajudam as mulheres a aumentar sua produtividade e
participa&#231;&#227;o efetiva na economia. Os agraciados com as doa&#231;&#245;es incluem Kopernik,
Solar Electric Light Fund, Solar Sister, Productive Agricultural Linkages and
Marketing Systems (P.A.L.M.S) e smallsolutions. 

"Meu pa&#237;s ser&#225; um lugar melhor quando mais mulheres tiverem acesso a
tecnologias", disse Leticia Brenyah, uma inovadora de Gana apoiada pela
ExxonMobil, que falou na CGI como parte da &#225;rea de foco Capacitar mulheres e
garotas (Empowering Girls and Women) do encontro. "Quando as mulheres prosperam
economicamente, elas melhoram a vida delas, de suas fam&#237;lias e do seu pa&#237;s". 

Como parte do seu apoio aos programas identificados por meio do programa Women |
Tools | Technology, a ExxonMobil trabalhar&#225; com os parceiros Ashoka`s
Changemakers, International Center for Research on Women e Thunderbird Emerging
Markets Laboratory (TEM Lab) para apoiar o desenvolvimento futuro de v&#225;rios
conceitos que abrangem o uso de tecnologias inovadoras para permitir o acesso
das mulheres &#224; energia de modo sustent&#225;vel e flex&#237;vel. 

TEM Lab implantar&#225; equipes de consultoria no local para ajudar a diagnosticar
problemas e oportunidades empresariais com o objetivo de fortalecer a efic&#225;cia
do programa. 

"Estamos entusiasmados com a participa&#231;&#227;o nesta parceria significativa que usa a
especialidade tecnol&#243;gica e empresarial para permitir que os inovadores melhorem
sua capacidade", declarou Angel Cabrera, presidente da Thunderbird School of
Global Management. 

Os inovadores ter&#227;o a oportunidade de entrar em contato com especialistas na CGI
e usar a Ashoka`s Changemakers Discovery Framework para entender melhor os
desafios e as oportunidades de expandir os seus conceitos. 

"A paix&#227;o e as novas ideias representadas pelas solu&#231;&#245;es encontradas por meio da
doa&#231;&#227;o do ano passado e subsequente Desafio Women | Tools | Technology:Building
Opportunities &amp; Economic Powerrepresentam uma nova for&#231;a poderosa para promover
as oportunidades econ&#244;micas das mulheres globalmente", explicou Bill Drayton,
presidente e diretor executivo da Ashoka. "Quero ver n&#227;o apenas o impacto
profundo e duradouro que estes l&#237;deres criar&#227;o, mas tamb&#233;m as gera&#231;&#245;es futuras
de inovadores que eles v&#227;o inspirar ao longo do caminho". 

Como parte da Iniciativa CGI 2009, o relat&#243;rio de pesquisa, "Bridging the
Technology Divide (Vencendo o abismo tecnol&#243;gico)", do International Center for
Research on Women (ICRW), forneceu percep&#231;&#245;es sobre como a tecnologia pode
ajudar a promover as mulheres economicamente. O ICRW continuar&#225; a fornecer
monitoramento e suporte de avalia&#231;&#227;o para as atividades da iniciativa. 

"Um ano depois, &#233; muito bom ver como os inovadores transformaram boas inten&#231;&#245;es
em a&#231;&#245;es que integram efetivamente mulheres em diversas etapas do ciclo de vida
da tecnologia para dar-lhes as ferramentas que precisam para prosperar", disse

&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
IBM`s z/OS Version 1 R. 10 System SSL Cryptographic Module recently received
FIPS 140-2 Level 1 certification. The successful certification is shown on the
NIST website (certification number 1389). 

For many companies, the single most important asset they have is information,
and so it needs to be protected accordingly. Software companies understand this
need, and help their customers secure valuable data using a variety of measures.
IBM z/OS - one of the world`s most advanced operating systems - is no exception:
having undergone numerous Common Criteria evaluations at high assurance levels,
now it has added additional security assurances for one of its key cryptographic
components. 

Apostol Vassilev, CST laboratory manager for atsec, commented: "IBM z/OS is one
of the most complex operating systems in the world, incorporating numerous
advances in technologies intended to improve the scalability, performance, and
security of the platform. As a result, the SystemSSL module is one of the most
complex cryptographic modules ever validated under the FIPS 140-2 standard. It
combines software, hardware, and firmware within the cryptographic boundary on
the z/OS architecture and delivers an unprecedented level of cryptographic
performance for a wide range of cryptographic services backed by equally strong
security assurances provided by the FIPS 140-2 certification. The validation of
the module required atsec testers to explore the full breadth and depth of the
FIPS 140-2 standard, and take advantage of the flexibility it offers for modules
of such high hybridization. I am very proud that the atsec CST Lab successfully
completed this challenging project that showcases so vividly the high
professionalism and dedication of our staff." 

The Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 (FIPS 140-2) describes the US
federal government`s requirements for IT products in sensitive, but unclassified
use. It defines the security requirements that must be met by cryptographic
modules used to protect unclassified data within IT systems. FIPS 140-2 is
published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The
certification is mandatory for cryptographic products used by the US Federal
Government.

&lt;p&gt;AVON, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
Evolution BenefitsTM, Inc. (EB) - the industry leader in electronic benefits
card payment services - announced today it has been selected by The Great-West
Life Assurance Company, a leading group benefits provider in Canada, to deliver
innovative card technology for its Visa payment card for healthcare spending
accounts (HCSAs) in Canada. This is the first contract outside the United States
for Evolution Benefits. 

Under the agreement, Great-West Life will use Evolution Benefits` prepaid
benefits card services to launch Health SolutionsPlus, an innovative group
benefits solution for healthcare spending accounts, allowing group plan members
direct access to HCSA available funds through a Visa payment card. Evolution
Benefits will also provide substantiation technology to automatically verify the
eligibility of the items purchased with the card. 

"We are pleased to work with Evolution Benefits to offer this new service to our
group plan sponsors and their plan members," said Dave Johnston, Executive
Vice-President of Great-West Life`s Group Insurance Division. "In addition to
providing plan sponsors with new options for benefits plan design, plan members
will also be empowered to choose how and where they spend their healthcare
spending account funds, thereby offering significantly increased convenience and
flexibility." 

The Health SolutionsPlus card, which will be made available in Canada for the
first time through Great-West Life, will be loaded with a group plan member`s
HCSA funds, allowing members to conveniently pay for covered health-related
products and services from providers authorized by Great-West Life. This will
significantly reduce the need for plan members to pay upfront and submit paper
or electronic claims for reimbursement, thereby decreasing out-of-pocket
expenses. 

"We are delighted to have the opportunity to provide card technology and
services to a leading organization such as Great-West Life," commented Robert
Patricelli, Evolution Benefits` Chairman, President and CEO. "We are pleased
that our card technology adapted so well to Great-West Life`s requirements for
their Health SolutionsPlus Visa payment card for the Canadian market. We look
forward to working together to make the program a major success."

&lt;p&gt;
RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Sept. 23, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Icagen, Inc.
(Nasdaq:ICGND) today announced an additional extension through December 2011 to
an existing worldwide collaboration and licensing agreement with Pfizer aimed at
discovering, developing and commercializing compounds that modify three specific
sodium ion channels as new potential treatments for pain and related disorders.

For the past three years, Icagen and Pfizer have partnered to identify compounds
that target three specific sodium ion channels in a global research and
development collaboration overseen by a joint research committee. These sodium
channels are important in the generation of electrical signals in nerve fibers
that mediate the initiation, transmission and sensation of pain. By selectively
targeting these ion channels, the companies seek to develop effective treatments
for serious pain disorders.

During the extension period, Pfizer will continue to fund all aspects of the
collaboration including research efforts at both companies and all clinical
development costs. Pfizer also will continue to have exclusive worldwide rights
to commercialize products resulting from the collaboration. Under the terms of
the extended agreement, Pfizer will provide approximately $5 million in
committed funding to Icagen through December 2011. Additionally, Icagen remains
eligible to receive approximately $359 million upon achievement of specified
research, development, regulatory and commercialization milestones for each
product. Icagen is also eligible to receive tiered royalties, against which the
commercialization milestones are creditable, based upon product sales.

"We are very pleased to announce this extension of our collaboration with
Pfizer," noted P. Kay Wagoner, Ph.D., President and CEO of Icagen. "The
collaboration has made substantial progress, as highlighted by the recent
initiation of clinical studies with compounds directed against Nav1.7. In
addition, we continue to make progress in identifying additional compounds
targeting the sodium channels that form the basis for the collaboration. Pfizer
has brought tremendous resources to bear upon this program, and we are delighted
to work with such an extraordinary group of scientists as we pursue this very
exciting avenue of research."

Gillian Burgess, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Pfizer's Pain Research Unit,
stated, "Icagen continues to be a key partner in this important area of pain
research. Working together, the Pfizer and Icagen research team continues to
make advances as we jointly seek to develop a new class of pain therapeutics."

&lt;p&gt;  KIRKLAND, QUEBEC, Sep 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Editors Note: There are two photos and a video associated with this press
release.

    Healthy habits start small. 

    In fact, according to Pfizer Canada - the nation's leading
biopharmaceutical company - adopting healthy habits can start with just a
smidge(TM) of inspiration, motivation and support.

    Today Pfizer Canada introduces its first-ever "app" and health motivator
- smidge(TM). smidge(TM) is available as a free "app" and can be
downloaded on iPhones, iTouches, iPads and Blackberries. 

    A first for Pfizer Canada, smidge(TM) identifies and celebrates small,
easy actions that impact the body, mind and spirit. As you build momentum
over a 21-day period, smidge(TM) shows you how to do just a little bit
more by choosing across six activities that include: Be Positive, Eat
More Fruits and Veggies, Train Your Brain, Take the Stairs, Deep
Breathing and Drink More Water. 

    Start with a smidge(TM) - Healthy Habits Start Here(TM)

    Developed with the support and assistance of leading Canadian experts
that include medical doctors, stress experts, life coaches, fitness
trainers, dietitians and nutritionists, smidge(TM) embraces the
philosophy that it's more helpful to focus health choices on small,
sustainable steps as opposed to trying to incorporate large, sweeping
health goals all at one time. 

    "People have busy lives and sometimes, we don't take the small wellness
steps that will keep us healthier over our lifetime," says Ghislain
Boudreau, Vice President of Public Affairs and Stakeholder Relations at
Pfizer Canada. "Canadians told us they want to build healthier habits,
but they just weren't sure where to start. smidge(TM) motivates you to
start taking small, positive steps that pay-off over the long-term. It's
simple, rewarding and fun," he says.

    smidge(TM) was created to let Canadians move at their own pace. You can
do the activity as often as you like; set up reminders; track your
progress; share your accomplishments with friends on Facebook, Twitter
and via email. 

    "Small, consistent changes build momentum and most importantly, change
your focus from future "someday goals" to what you can do this minute,
right now, today," agrees Dr. David Posen, a Toronto-based MD, stress
management and work-life balance expert and author, who particularly
likes smidge(TM) reminders and motivational messages.

    Deep Breathing

    Looking to lighten up and manage stress better? Sign-up for a daily
breathing exercise that helps to remind you to breathe and tune in every
day. "Breathing deeply is fundamental to good health and creates
beneficial physiological changes in the body. smidge(TM) is a great way
to focus on your breath every day," says Dr. Posen.

    "Once you've begun to build momentum, you can start incorporating other
small changes, like taking a deep breath at stop lights," says Dr. Posen.
"All this will help you work up to a deeper, longer breathing practice
2-3 times a week. Get started with smidge(TM) and when you're ready, move
on to longer, free audio and video breathing exercises at
morethanmedication.ca/smidge."

    Take the Stairs

    When it comes to getting active, smidge(TM) advocates little changes that
add up, like taking the stairs, a little more often. Take two extra
flights of stairs a day and, over time, you'll improve your conditioning
and feel stronger, confirms Montreal-based fitness expert and life coach
Annick Robinson, a regular contributor to Pfizer's wellness site
morethanmedication.ca.

    Just a few extra minutes of strength training and active movement every
day, can help you continually improve your fitness in a gradual,
sustainable way, adds Annick.

    Not all prescriptions come in a package

    "Good health takes more than information and facts, it takes commitment,
optimism, healthy choices and motivational support that builds over
time," says Ghislain Boudreau from Pfizer Canada. "Because when it comes
to your health, the good news is that even a little smidge(TM) counts and
this is Pfizer's way of helping Canadians build and maintain healthy
habits - and start new ones." 

    smidge(TM) is part of Pfizer Canada's More than Medication(R) program; a
wellness awareness initiative that's devoted completely to non-medicinal
health information. Pfizer medications are never mentioned. 

    Canadians can visit morethanmedication.ca - Pfizer's free, made-in-Canada
wellness site - for more information about smidge(TM) and a wide variety
of audio, video and interactive health tools. smidge(TM) is available
free at the iTunes and Blackberry App World stores.

Breathing and Drink More Water. 

    Start with a smidge(TM) - Healthy Habits Start Here(TM)

    Developed with the support and assistance of leading Canadian experts
that include medical doctors, stress experts, life coaches, fitness
trainers, dietitians and nutritionists, smidge(TM) embraces the
philosophy that it's more helpful to focus health choices on small,
sustainable steps as opposed to trying to incorporate large, sweeping
health goals all at one time. 

    "People have busy lives and sometimes, we don't take the small wellness
steps that will keep us healthier over our lifetime," says Ghislain
Boudreau, Vice President of Public Affairs and Stakeholder Relations at
Pfizer Canada. "Canadians told us they want to build healthier habits,
but they just weren't sure where to start. smidge(TM) motivates you to
start taking small, positive steps that pay-off over the long-term. It's
simple, rewarding and fun," he says.

    smidge(TM) was created to let Canadians move at their own pace. You can
do the activity as often as you like; set up reminders; track your
progress; share your accomplishments with friends on Facebook, Twitter
and via email. 

    "Small, consistent changes build momentum and most importantly, change
your focus from future "someday goals" to what you can do this minute,
right now, today," agrees Dr. David Posen, a Toronto-based MD, stress
management and work-life balance expert and author, who particularly
likes smidge(TM) reminders and motivational messages.

    Deep Breathing

    Looking to lighten up and manage stress better? Sign-up for a daily
breathing exercise that helps to remind you to breathe and tune in every
day. "Breathing deeply is fundamental to good health and creates
beneficial physiological changes in the body. smidge(TM) is a great way
to focus on your breath every day," says Dr. Posen.

    "Once you've begun to build momentum, you can start incorporating other
small changes, like taking a deep breath at stop lights," says Dr. Posen.
"All this will help you work up to a deeper, longer breathing practice
2-3 times a week. Get started with smidge(TM) and when you're ready, move
on to longer, free audio and video breathing exercises at
morethanmedication.ca/smidge."

    Take the Stairs

    When it comes to getting active, smidge(TM) advocates little changes that
add up, like taking the stairs, a little more often. Take two extra
flights of stairs a day and, over time, you'll improve your conditioning
and feel stronger, confirms Montreal-based fitness expert and life coach
Annick Robinson, a regular contributor to Pfizer's wellness site
morethanmedication.ca.

    Just a few extra minutes of strength training and active movement every
day, can help you continually improve your fitness in a gradual,
sustainable way, adds Annick.

    Not all prescriptions come in a package

    "Good health takes more than information and facts, it takes commitment,
optimism, healthy choices and motivational support that builds over
time," says Ghislain Boudreau from Pfizer Canada. "Because when it comes
to your health, the good news is that even a little smidge(TM) counts and
this is Pfizer's way of helping Canadians build and maintain healthy
habits - and start new ones." 

    smidge(TM) is part of Pfizer Canada's More than Medication(R) program; a
wellness awareness initiative that's devoted completely to non-medicinal
health information. Pfizer medications are never mentioned. 

    Canadians can visit morethanmedication.ca - Pfizer's free, made-in-Canada
wellness site - for more information about smidge(TM) and a wide variety
of audio, video and interactive health tools. smidge(TM) is available
free at the iTunes and Blackberry App World stores.

&lt;p&gt;New Princess &amp; Me Lifestyle Brand from Disney and JAKKS Pacific Extends Disney
Princess Stories into Girls` Everyday Moments
GLENDALE &amp; MALIBU, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney Consumer Products and JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (Nasdaq: JAKK) introduce the
new Princess &amp; Me lifestyle brand of large "friend" dolls inspired by beloved
Disney Princess characters, now available at Toys"R"Us stores nationwide. The
new collection creates a world where girls can deepen their friendship with
their favorite Disney Princess characters through an all new assortment of
beautifully sculpted 18" scale dolls, fashions, accessories and dress-up that
appeal to a slightly older Disney Princess fan (girls ages 5 - 8). Beloved as a
lifestyle brand for girls around the world, Disney Princess ranks among the top
choices for dolls and girls role play in the United States.1 Already a leading
brand in the fashion doll category,2Disney Princess now offers girls a new way
to play with their favorite characters with the Princess &amp; Me line, the first
foray into the large doll category for the powerhouse brand. 

For the first time ever, girls can dress their favorite Disney Princess dolls in
sleepwear and ballet outfits in their signature colors and styles. Stunning
matching dress-up ball gowns for girls from JAKKS` Creative Designs
International (CDI) division allow girls to mimic the exact outfits their dolls
are wearing - just like real friends do. Designed with special attention to
detail and high-end fabrications, Princess &amp; Me delivers an aspirational look
and feel that envelopes girls in a royal world and allows them to "grow" with
their favorite Disney Princess characters. 

Toys"R"Us is the first retailer to showcase the collection of more than 25
Princess &amp; Me products, available now in its stores nationwide and at
Toysrus.com. The retailer recently named Princess &amp; Me dolls to their list of
`Fabulous 15` toys for the holiday season. At a holiday preview event this
summer, moms and their daughters gushed over the beauty and quality of the
dolls, role play dresses and accessories. In July, the Princess &amp; Me 18" dolls
made their initial debut on QVC`s CHRISTMAS IN JULY as one of the top selling
items during the event. Disney Stores will also carry the Princess &amp; Me line
later this fall. 

"This new line of `friend` dolls is perfect for young girls as they get older,"
notes Elaine Carovilla, director of girls` toys for Disney Consumer Products.
"Princess &amp; Me dolls invite girls to develop a deeper relationship with a
trusted companion - a Disney Princess character who they know and love and whose
stories they`ve grown up with - while also allowing girls to continue playing
out the thrills of any adventure she can dream up." 

On October 16 from 2 - 4 p.m., girls are invited to attend the Princess &amp; Me
Royal Party at their local Toys"R"Us store to participate in royal activities,
including a decorate-your-own Princess &amp; Me tiara, story time, and more.
Attendees will also be given information on how to enter the Princess &amp; Me
online sweepstakes to win a Princess &amp; Me doll, a set of fashions and the entire
collection of accessories. 

"The sophisticated styles and attention to detail, as well as the new activity
themes, should resonate with girls who grew up with Disney Princess and are now
looking for new ways to relate to the characters as they get older," added
Jennifer Caveza, vice president, girls marketing, JAKKS Pacific. "Princess &amp; Me
will appeal to all girls who love everything `princess.` The entire line
provides a royal world where girls can play out what they love to do with their
favorite Disney Princess friends." 

Each doll comes with a booklet filled with Disney Princess fun facts and
activities including a "Princess Personality" quiz, doll accessory features and
tips for how to live like a princess including smile, hair styling, tea party
and slumber party tips. Girls can even send in a card to become an honorary
princess and will receive a special card from their favorite Disney Princess on
their birthday. 

The Princess &amp; Me product line includes: 

The Princess &amp; Me 18" friend dolls have sweet faces and beautiful long silky
hair; girls can choose from Ariel, Aurora, Belle, Cinderella and Tiana, or
collect them all! Each Princess &amp; Me doll wears a tiara and comes dressed in her
exquisitely detailed, signature ball gown. Also included is an invitation for
girls to become a member of the Disney Princess royal family so girls will get a
birthday card from their favorite Disney Princess, as well as a small magazine
featuring the full product line and helpful princess lifestyle tips.

and Tiana`s signature styles. Perfect for slumber parties! To set the scene for
a slumber party, Princess &amp; Me doll accessories include the Royal Wardrobe to
store all doll fashions and the Princess Canopy Bed, a fancy doll-size canopy
bed fit only for a princess.

ballet slippers and a headband for girls. Princess &amp; Me Royal Vanity Set

&lt;p&gt;Rich Ross, installed by Walt Disney Co. CEO Robert Iger as chairman of Walt Disney Studios last October 5, might as well have hung out a sign reading "Undergoing Renovations" at the Burbank lot from his first day on the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a mandate laid down by Iger, Ross has set about shaking up the studio's slumping film operations. He swept out top executives, shut down several movies about to begin filming and began courting such distinctive filmmakers as David Fincher ("The Social Network") and horror veteran Sam Raimi who hardly fit the family-friendly mold at Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, he also inherited a two movies -- "Alice in Wonderland" and "Toy Story 3" -- that became worldwide blockbusters. In the process, Disney became the first studio to field two $1 billion movies in a single year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, agents, producers and filmmakers are trying to take the measure of the TV veteran. Ross' appointment took most by surprise, and at first he was regarded as an outsider, especially because he was replacing longtime Disney hand Dick Cook. But now, despite two large summer disappointments, Ross is finding support in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're going to have to give him time to get his people and his agenda in place," Jerry Bruckheimer said of Ross' regime, even after the rocky openings of the prolific producer's "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" and "The Sorcerer's Apprentice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the past, it was a struggle (at Disney to get all the divisions working together). So far, I think he's done an excellent job getting everyone's attention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Jon Turteltaub, who was in the midst of directing "Sorcerer's Apprentice" when Ross arrived: "Rich was stepping into a situation where he was replacing somebody beloved on the studio lot. He was somebody who was a top-down hire, and that's not easy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even though his movie didn't prove a hit, Turteltaub said he appreciated Ross' enthusiasm and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around town, Ross has sought to raise his profile, attending the studio's premieres and the Academy Awards in February. Most recently, he made his way to the Toronto International Film Festival to mingle with filmmakers and support "The Debt," starring Helen Mirren, one of the last remaining movies Disney will release under its jettisoned Miramax brand. While there, he even dropped by a party thrown by Fox Searchlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As might be expected, though, not everyone is applauding Ross' efforts to redesign the studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One executive with ties to Disney, while acknowledging that the new chairman is "smart, very gracious and ingratiating," said Ross still has "a big and steep learning curve. There are people that he's rubbed the wrong way. I don't hear vitriol and revolt and insurrection, but I definitely hear, 'Where's the there there? What's he trying to do? Who is he that he still hasn't quite seized the moment to create advocates?' The organization still feels traumatized by the firings. Those moments require a human touch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ross, traveling abroad this week, wasn't available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first few months of his tenure, the 47-year-old executive moved quickly to shake up things. He axed several movies -- like the sequel to the 2007 hit "Wild Hogs" -- that were headed toward production. In their place, production has begun on smaller teen movies like "Prom," studio franchises like the fourth "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie and Tim Burton's 3D, stop-motion-animated "Frankenweenie."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One movie, a new version of Jules Verne's "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" that was to have been directed by McG, was shut down, only to be revived a few months later as a directing vehicle for Fincher -- one of several high-profile talents developing projects for the studio. Others include Burton, Raimi, Guillermo del Toro, Jim Whitaker, William Monahan, Susannah Grant, Doug Wright and Ron Bass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a rival studio head observed that Ross is betting on ideas for movies rather than on specific filmmakers, there are those on the lot who dispute that. "It's a very different Disney," another producer on the lot said. "I could never have dreamed of a Disney movie with David Fincher or Guillermo del Toro."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the old Disney was very much about a brand unto itself -- Disney being the sole studio that had cultivated a specific, family-friendly image in the eyes of the general public -- Ross, following Iger's orders, is making sure the new Disney is more brand-oriented than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney itself is cutting back its own production to make eight to 10 movies a year -- a mix of tentpoles, comedies, Disney-made animated pics and what the studio calls "movies that inspire." Last year, when "The Blind Side" proved a surprise commercial and critical hit for Warner Bros., Ross pointed to it as a movie that should have been made by Disney, and he subsequently signed a deal with one of its producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Ross' new team has been releasing the movies the old team left behind to mixed results. In terms of summer box-office market share, Disney was in the middle of the pack, and it lags in year-to-date ranks. However, Pixar 3D phenom "Toy 3" grossed $1.05 billion globally to top all summer releases, and spring's extra-dimensional fantasy "Alice in Wonderland" conjured $1.02 billion worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there were a couple of major misfires, like the $91 million domestic haul for "Prince," which cost $200 million to produce; even though it picked up another $244 million internationally, it was written off as a failed bid for a new franchise. "Sorcerer's," which attracted $62 million domestically and $200 million worldwide, had the less forgiving among Disney watchers wondering whether the studio had lost its marketing mojo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But "Alice" and "Toy 3" did a lot to restore the studio's fortunes. Revenue for the year's first three quarters was $5.1 billion, up 10% compared with the first nine months of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has a few more movies from the old regime to shepherd into release, but the new team has embraced them almost as if they were its own. Disney is heralding "Secretariat," the sports drama about the legendary race horse that opens October 8, as a template for the studio's commitment to inspirational tales -- and a possible awards contender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its biggest bet at year's end is "Tron Legacy," the 3D sequel to the pioneering 1982 visual effects movie that took viewers inside a video game. Disney has promoted the movie at the past three Comic-Cons. And after consulting with the Pixar brain trust -- to which the new Disney executives frequently turn for advice -- the studio scheduled several days of reshoots. "Pretty much everything is riding on 'Tron,'" another source at the studio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving into next year, the new regime's first effort is "Prom," a John Hughes-esque tale about a high school prom, set for April 29. And it's looking to dominate the final weeks of May with its fourth "Pirates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be several more years before Disney sees the full benefits from its acquisition of Marvel Entertainment, which it bought last year for $4 billion, though it already has begun to share in Marvel's profits. Marvel's current slate culminates with "The Avengers," which Paramount is set to release in May 2012, and after that Marvel movies then can begin rolling out through Disney on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More immediately, Disney will be heavily dependent on DreamWorks, which struck a distribution deal early last year. The first of the new batch of DreamWorks titles kicks in with the February 18 release of the Steven Spielberg- and Michael Bay-produced sci-fi thriller "I Am Number Four," directed by D.J. Caruso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  MENLO PARK, CA, Sep 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
InVisage Technologies, Inc. -- a Silicon Valley-based start-up that is
revolutionizing the image sensor market -- today announced
QuantumShutter(TM), a new technology that eliminates the "rolling
shutter" effect that has plagued today's digital camera industry. Also
known as "wobble" and "Jell-O," rolling shutter causes an image to bend,
slant or skew when photographing a moving object with either a still or
video camera. InVisage is the first and only company to solve the rolling
shutter effect in any device, from high-end cameras like digital SLRs to
small everyday devices like cameraphones.

    In 2009, image sensors were a $4.6 billion* market. Of this market, CMOS
image sensors make up the lion's share because they require less cost,
power and space -- from DSLRs, security cameras, medical devices,
automobiles to cameraphones. However, they do pose some technical
challenges. Traditional CMOS image sensors read images from top to
bottom. If something is moving faster than the image can be read (think
of a swinging golf club, a moving propeller or a speeding race car) the
object being captured will have moved before the sensor can complete its
read out. This phenomenon, called rolling shutter, causes image
distortion.

    InVisage's QuantumShutter solves this problem by using a portion of the
silicon to store the image "charge" so the entire image is captured at
the exact same moment. Because of its QuantumFilm(TM) technology,
announced earlier this year, InVisage is the only image sensor company
that has the extra silicon space needed for a storage node. QuantumFilm
is a quantum dot-based light absorber that sits on top of the pixel,
employing the silicon beneath it to read out the image. InVisage spent
three years engineering the quantum dot material to produce
highly-sensitive image sensors that integrate with standard CMOS
manufacturing processes.

    "While other image sensor companies have been focused on increasing the
number of pixels, InVisage is focused on bringing completely new thinking
and technologies to CMOS image sensors -- like tackling rolling shutter,"
says Jess Lee, CEO, InVisage Technologies. "InVisage's QuantumShutter
will bring better and more reliable picture quality to an industry that
is desperate for innovation."

    QuantumShutter provides compelling advantages for both video and still
camera applications. The technology serves the same purpose as a
mechanical shutter like those found in high-end cameras such as digital
SLRs. Mechanical shutters, while highly desirable, are expensive, have a
high rate of mechanical failure, and add height and weight.
QuantumShutter enables the same capability, but without the need for
moving parts.

    "In 2010, we expect sales of more than one billion cameras that use CMOS
image sensors, and it is growing," says Dr. Tom Hausken, director of
photonics and compound semiconductors at Strategies Unlimited. "This
creates a huge opportunity for new technologies like InVisage's
QuantumShutter that offer advancements over traditional CMOS image
sensors."

    Initially targeting cameraphone applications, which is the largest and
fastest growing portion of the image sensor market, InVisage
Technologies' QuantumShutter will be available later this year as an
optional feature with the first samples of its QuantumFilm-based image
sensors. More information on QuantumShutter, QuantumFilm and InVisage
Technologies is available at www.invisageinc.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil said Friday that operations
at its 238,600 barrel per day refinery in Joliet, Illinois returned to
normal after Enbridge (ENB.TO) reopened a crude pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Operations returned to normal early this week," said Kevin Allexon, a
spokesman for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enbridge Line 6A brings Canadian crude to refiners in the U.S. Midwest.
The line was shut after a leak was found on Sept. 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The line can carry 670,000 bpd of crude.  At the time of the shutdown,
it had been carrying 459,000 bpd.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Co (JPM.N) is making the traditional top two in the worldwide rankings of deal advisors -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) -- fight hard to keep their dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the bank led by hard-charging CEO Jamie Dimon, has climbed two places to the No. 2 slot in the top league table rankings, Thomson Reuters data through September 21 shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the third quarter on its own, JPMorgan actually led the pack with $179.2 billion of deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's strength through the financial crisis over the last couple of years has burnished the second-largest U.S. bank's image and helped it draw more clients, Jimmy Elliott, global head of MA, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliott, a veteran of deals such as Exxon's $86 billion takeover of Mobil in 1999, is pleased with the results, but still wants to bolster the bank's technology and natural resources MA teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliott, a Texas resident, has been involved personally in some of JPMorgan's largest MA assignments this year, including two hostile bids -- BHP Billiton Ltd's (BHP.AX)(BLT.L) $39 billion offer for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc (POT.TO) and Air Products and Chemicals Inc's (APD.N) $5.5 billion bid for Airgas Inc (ARG.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We weathered the storm. This has certainly had a positive effect on people's perspective on JPMorgan as a brand," Elliott said. "There is no doubt that has created synergies that have benefited our MA business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, along with its unit JPMorgan Cazenove in Europe, is advising on five of the 10 largest deals announced this year, including the BHP Billiton offer and Sanofi-Aventis SA's (SASY.PA) bid for Genzyme Corp GENZ.O, the data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are high-profile clients," Elliott said. "When they have mission-critical transactions that they need to get done ... they are turning to us more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliott credits his team for landing these assignments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having the best people to bring to the table is what makes us successful," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also does not hurt that the bank has the firepower to finance almost any deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that we have a balance sheet to help our clients is an additional competitive advantage," Elliott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which bought investment bank Bear Stearns in 2008, also push its way to the top of the European league table through September 21, up from No. 9 last year, the data shows. It also rose a spot to third among advisers on deals involving U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, its lead is tenuous. In the worldwide MA league table, Morgan Stanley is a mere $4 billion behind JPMorgan's deal volume of $344.1 billion so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've had a tremendous run," Elliott said. "We don't judge our business on a quarter-to-quarter basis, though we certainly are happy about the quarter we had."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paritosh Bansal; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  * Could raise about 800 mln euros from sale of 80 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds details, share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Clara Vilar and Greg Roumeliotis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MADRID/AMSTERDAM, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Endesa SA (ELE.MC),
the Spanish subsidiary of Italy's Enel SpA (ENEI.MI), is in
exclusive talks with a Goldman Sachs (GS.N) infrastructure fund
to sell its Spanish gas grid, sources close to the deal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Endesa could receive close to 800 million euros ($1.07
billion) for the network, two sources said, confirming an
earlier report in Spanish newspaper Expansion on Friday. A deal
could be announced by early next week, two other sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spokespeople for Endesa and Enel said negotiations were
ongoing. A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Funds sponsored by Macquarie (MQG.AX) and AXA Private Equity
also submitted final offers for the grid on Sept. 13, in which
Endesa is looking to sell an 80 percent stake, people familiar
with the matter previously told Reuters. [ID:nLDE68D11D] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Driven by the debt-cutting drive of highly geared Enel,
Endesa has been selling assets in order to help the Italian
power group cut its net debt to 45 billion euros by the end of
2010 from 51 billion euros at the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 1028 GMT, Endesa shares rose 0.05 pct to 19.83 euros,
compared to a 0.31 percent drop on the blue chip IBEX .IBEX.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Mexico broadcasting giant
Televisa on Thursday suffered a setback in its bid to enter the
local mobile phone market after a judge denied it access to the
broadcast spectrum it seeks, local media reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In mid-August, Mexico's telecommunications regulator
approved a controversial joint-bid by Televisa TVLACPO.MX
(TV.N) and partner Nextel NIHD.O to enter the mobile phone
market in a move that was seen to pressure market leader
America Movil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The approval raised eyebrows among competitors since the
low-ball bid for wireless spectrum was approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa and Nextel won after bidding $14 million for its
license, a fraction of the $400 million offered by rivals
America Movil (AMXL.MX)(AMX.N) and Telefonica SA (TEF.MC) for
another slice of the mobile spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ruling prevents the telecommunications ministry from
handing the companies the broadcast frequency they seek.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock underwriting is down so far this year as investors have proved less willing to take risks amid an uncertain economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan nabbed the top spot among banks, globally, for equity capital markets underwriting in the first three quarters of 2010, but it hauled in less than half of what it did a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank kept its No.1 ranking but brought in proceeds of just $39.5 billion compared with $80.07 billion a year earlier. The bank underwrote 224 offerings compared with 290 a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data at the close of U.S. markets on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global equity capital markets activity has increased 5.6 percent to 2,817 deals compared with a year earlier but proceeds have decreased 9 percent to $496.14 billion. Equity capital markets data includes underwriting of initial public offerings, follow-on offerings and other equity-related securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slow economic recovery may have affected companies' quarterly results and valuations, meaning that IPOs in the pipeline may not be able to fetch top dollar, said Frank Maturo, co-head of equity capital markets for the Americas at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, along with an attractive debt market, may have caused some companies to wait, Maturo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to lagging global ECM activity, global mergers and acquisitions activity has risen as improved financing options and substantial war chests have allowed corporate and private equity buyers to pursue deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide MA has totaled $1.678 trillion so far this year, up 21 percent from a year earlier, according to preliminary data from Thomson Reuters.ID: nN23242528&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the third quarter saw a handful of landmark ECM deals. China's AgBank (1288.HK) 60288.SS IPO in July raised $22.1 billion. Last Thursday, Brazilian state oil company Petrobras sold $70 billion in shares at a higher-than-expected price, making it the world's biggest ever offering.ID: nN2499993&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, Morgan Stanley is in the No. 2 spot (194, $38.64 bln) on the global equity capital markets league table and Goldman Sachs is third (149, $36.34 bln). Bank of America Merrill Lynch is fourth (179, $33.42 bln), and UBS fifth (171, $25.32 bln).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Data points for how robust the IPO markets are post-Labor Day are still to be determined," Maturo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMPROVED OUTLOOK?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlook for equity capital markets globally could be improving. In the U.S., for example - where top U.S. automaker General Motors could raise as much as $20 billion in November - a strong stock market could buoy investors' optimism. As of the close of markets on Friday the SP 500 was up 9.47 percent so far in September, its strongest monthly gain since March 2000 when it was up 9.67 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end of summer holidays and a lessening worry that the European sovereign debt crisis will spread could also help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will continue to be selective, deal by deal, and deals will be priced for their own, specific fundamentals, but on balance I think we're in a much more constructive phase of the market than we have been in some time," said Mark Hantho, global co-head of equity capital markets at Deutsche Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October the Asian life insurance business of American International Group Inc (AIG.N), AIA Group Ltd, could raise about $15 billion. The IPO comes after AIG failed to sell its Asian business earlier this year to Britain's Prudential Plc (PRU.L) for $35.5 billion. The British insurer had asked AIG to cut the price to $30.4 billion, but it was turned down, leading to the termination of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG, which is nearly 80-percent owned by the U.S. government, is disposing of assets to repay taxpayers who committed $182.3 billion to prop up the insurer during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, GM, another company bailed out by U.S. taxpayers is expected to have its IPO. The IPO, scheduled for directly after U.S. midterm Congressional elections will begin the process of repaying the U.S. government for its $50 billion bailout, after which it retained a 61-percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also a handful of large private equity-backed IPOs in the U.S. pipeline. Hospital operator HCA Inc has filed to raise up to $4.6 billion and Toys R Us Inc has filed to raise up to $800 million. Nielsen Holdings BV, best known for viewership ratings that often determine the fate of TV shows, hopes to raise $2.01 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly if the deals price well and trade well there will be follow through to that," Bank of America's Maturo said, when asked about a broader pickup in IPOs. He added that with the cheap cost of debt, the private equity-backed deals are not being forced into IPOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market has picked up substantially in September but valuations are not quite as attractive as some might like to see," he added. "It's possible we'll see a number of deals pushed to late 2010 or 2011."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Clare Baldwin, editing by Martin Golan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Billboard) - During Michael Eisner's 21 years as CEO of the Walt Disney Co., he transformed it from a rudderless operator of theme parks and a family-friendly film studio into a diversified media conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since stepping down as Disney's chief executive in 2005, Eisner has kept busy through Tornante, a firm he founded to invest in media and entertainment startup companies, including Internet video content studio Vuguru, trading card company Topps and now-shuttered streaming video site Veoh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After spending decades as a highly visible top executive at entertainment companies like Disney and Paramount Pictures, Eisner says he enjoys developing ideas in the relative seclusion of Tornante. "Doing stuff that I don't have to talk about because I'm not in a public company is fantastic," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Eisner is back in the public eye with his book "Working Together: Why Great Partnerships Succeed." Eisner and co-author Aaron R. Cohen examine the factors that contributed to 10 celebrated business tandems, ranging from Studio 54 co-founders Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell and former New York Yankees manager Joe Torre and bench coach Don Zimmer to Bill and Melinda Gates and film producer Brian Grazer and director Ron Howard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent media scuttlebutt said Eisner could become the next chairman of media firm the Tribune Company, which is in the midst of Chapter 11 reorganization. In an interview with Billboard, Eisner declined to comment on Tribune, but was eager to discuss his book and the challenges facing entertainment companies as they move online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billboard: Why write a book about business partnerships?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Eisner: I had never read a book about partnerships. Everybody is taught individuality -- take that football across the goal line and do a dance; you're alone celebrating your individual victory. You start off as a little kid and your parents tell you to share. By the time you're in the fourth grade, they're telling you, "Succeed on your own." I think sharing is actually more important to a 40-year-old than a 4-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billboard: What did you take away from the interviews and research you did for the book?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner: If I had read it when I was 20, I would have sought partners more aggressively and appreciated them better. I thought this would be good for other people going into business. I believe in synergy -- I made it a business strategy for Disney. I didn't see it at some of the other companies I worked at. Synergy really is about being able to be partners with other people in the organization. Maybe somebody will read this and say, "This is for me. I think it works."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that stood out was how selfless all these partners were in how they shared profits, in how they were able to get rid of the petty things, the jealousies. Warren Buffett practically became an agent for this project because he so much wanted (longtime associate) Charlie Munger to get the credit he thought he deserved after all these years of working together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billboard: In creative industries, how can artists and business people benefit from partnerships?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner: It's much more than complementary skills. It's being able to share. Some people can and some people can't. I love where Warren Buffett talks about the seven deadly sins and how the only one you feel badly about would be envy. Envy is never good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billboard: You invested in Veoh, which Universal Music Group unsuccessfully sued for copyright infringement. What did you like about that company?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner: I'm glad I invested in that. I did it to introduce myself to Internet video. It was very early. YouTube was already positioned as the first mover. I was hopeful that we could do it in a slightly different way. We got extremely wide distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Record labels) were trying to put their finger in a dam that was unstoppable. They went after Veoh, which was completely legal in all areas. I think they probably went after the wrong company, but they went after every company. I think that was quite silly of them. Litigation was a profit center for them in the old days, and that culture was probably still (there).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Veoh) may have not worked anyway. Who knows? But it was a very good, relatively inexpensive education which we're now benefiting from in other things we're doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billboard: How should media companies approach online video?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner: Not only can you not run away from it, there's a fantastic opportunity. You have to be a forward-thinking executive who understands the economics and protects, to a degree, (traditional) pieces of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at all these media companies, they're still making all their cash flow from their "rust belt" assets -- movie companies, theme park companies, broadcast companies, even newspaper companies -- record companies to a lesser degree. So, the production of television series that find their way onto television, cable, satellite and streaming networks is great. You just have to make sure the model you're working on does not undersell your product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a fine line between what would characterize you as a troglodyte and what would characterize you as a brilliant, avant-garde, forward-thinking genius. There's some middle ground. If you're going to run with these companies, you've got to be smart about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billboard: What do you think about the NBC-Fox-ABC streaming video joint venture Hulu?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner: I think they've done a great job. The interface is great, the look is great. They certainly have a lot of product on there. Their instinct to go to a paid model is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a partnership between three studios that is going to hinge on the very nature of agreeing in that partnership. As we all know from growing up as kids, three is not a great number. So I hope they're able not to have two of them gang up on the third, beat him up on the playground and have the whole thing disintegrate. It's got to be a good partnership to make that work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billboard: Can online entertainment ventures move forward without government regulation or changes in copyright law? Or will the market eventually take care of itself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner: I certainly believe in net neutrality, if that's where you're going. I've never liked the idea of a gatekeeper being able to exclude people dealing in a creative marketplace. That's been a concern of mine for my entire career. So I'd hate to see telephone companies or cable companies being able to favor one service over another. On the opposite side of that, I don't think that these companies should be allowed to say, "We have no responsibility for what travels over our distribution. The First Amendment made me do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a complicated issue as to what the government's role is, but I believe a government role is important to keep a level playing field and not allow a financial interest in a certain service to dominate the thinking of a ubiquitous distributor. I believe the present administration agrees with that, and I hope that prevails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billboard: How should the entertainment industry fight piracy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner: Piracy has always been dealt with. If you supply a quality product at a fair price, piracy is generally limited, at least in the developed world, to 5 percent or 10 percent. If you preclude content from appearing on accessible technology and you think you're going to be able to hold back the future, you tend to be shortsighted. It's intelligent compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(please visit our entertainment blog via www.reuters.com or on blogs.reuters.com/fanfare/)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PERTH, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Villagers in Papua New Guinea
attacked Exxon Mobil's liquefied natural gas project late last
week, burning heavy machinery and using high-powered weapons to
damage construction equipment, a newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The attack took place on Friday night at Kaiam, Papua New
Guinea, near the project's Kopi LNG facility, Papua New
Guinea's The National paper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The attacks were part of ongoing land disputes within the
footprint of the $15 billion PNG LNG project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Residents of the area have been frustrated by what they see
as their exclusion from participating in the initial stages of
construction of PNG LNG's 6.6 million tonne per year processing
plant that began earlier this year, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one was wounded in the attacks, which took place at the
worksite of Australia-based Clough Curtain joint venture,
according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Media reports have suggested that the project could be
delayed due to landowner disputes with the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil officials could not immediately be reached for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At a conference in Singapore last week, Papua New Guinea's
minister of planning and development, Paul Tiensten, said there
was "infighting" among the landowners affected by the project,
but said the project was still expected to stay within the
original cost estimate and start exporting LNG in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tiensten said some of the approximately 60,000 landowners
affected by the project question the division of benefits from
the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LNG benefit-sharing negotiations late last year resulted in
violence in Port Moresby and earlier this year, a fatal
gunbattle erupted between tribal groups arguing over a share of
the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Papua New Guinea government holds equity in the
project, while Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) is the majority stakeholder.

(STO.AX), and Japan's Nippon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PNG LNG has long-term supply agreements with China's
Sinopec (0386.HK), Japan's TEPCO (9501.T) and Osaka Gas

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Will Silicon Valley digerati shape the destiny of Walt Disney Co's ABC News?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the question that Anne Sweeney, president of Disney-ABC Television Group, faces as the quest to reinvent the network news business and find a leader for ABC News has taken her outside media and even as far afield as the U.S. tech capital, said industry sources familiar with ABC's process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network is replacing David Westin, a corporate lawyer with little background in news before he took over in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At ABC, tapping talent from outside the news business is part of its playbook. Westin, who will leave by the end of the year, succeeded TV legend Roone Arledge, a sportscaster with little news experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with U.S. broadcast news viewership declining to a fraction of what it was three decades ago because of cable news and the Web, the demand for a leader with roots in technology and an understanding of changes buffeting the news business has expanded the applicant pool, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney has begun meeting with candidates and is expected to announce a successor sometime this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ABC News will have to expand beyond the narrow base of the broadcast television industry quickly in order to manage a decade-or-so-long transition to a world where its content is distributed on TV, online, on tablet screens, on cellphones... and on media we have never dreamed of," said TV news analyst Andrew Tyndall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC's decision to search beyond the usual assortment of media talent marks a new path compared to other networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNN pushed out its U.S. chief Jonathan Klein last Friday and replaced him with another media executive from sister channel HLN. Comcast Chief Operating Officer Steve Burke will replace Jeff Zucker as the head of NBC Universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Disney is also considering internal candidates to replace Westin, who was recently forced to slash more than 300 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include Senior Vice President Kate O'Brian, who oversees news gathering; Paul Slavin, who runs ABC News' digital operations; and John Banner, executive producer for "World News with Diane Sawyer," according to the industry sources familiar with the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC is looking for other ways to strengthen itself. It has held talks with Bloomberg to collaborate on news gathering, sources said, comparing them to on- and off-again discussions between CBS and Time Warner Inc's CNN. The talks are no longer happening, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether Disney will even keep ABC has been a topic of persistent speculation in the media business, though one ABC insider said ABC News is profitable and it could be more so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the network must change in other ways, said Media Valuation Partners principal Larry Gerbrandt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to look at it from a fresh perspective and reinvent 21st century news for the 21st century viewers," Gerbrandt said.

&lt;p&gt; * Sutent not seen prolonging overall survival&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * No new or unexpected safety issues uncovered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)
discontinued a late stage study of its Sutent for advanced
prostate cancer after it became clear that the drug was
unlikely to improve overall survival, the company said on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move was the latest setback in the world's largest
drugmaker's efforts to expand uses and sales of the cancer
medicine known chemically as sunitinib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug was being tested in combination with the steroid
prednisone in men with advanced castration-resistant prostate
cancer that had progressed following treatment with a
docetaxel-based chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During a scheduled interim analysis of data from the Phase
III trial, the independent Data Monitoring Committee found that
the combination of Sutent and prednisone was unlikely to
improve overall survival when compared to prednisone alone,
Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No new or unexpected safety issues were identified by the
committee, Pfizer said, adding that data from the trial is
being analyzed and will be presented at an upcoming medical
meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sutent, which is approved to treat advanced kidney cancer
and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, is already a successful
drug with worldwide sales of $964 million in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is being tested against several cancers, including lung
cancer, but further expansion efforts for the franchise have
hit a series of roadblocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A late stage study of Sutent for liver cancer was halted in
April over safety issues, when the monitoring committee found a
high incidence of serious adverse events suffered by patients
taking the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug previously failed in a late stage study for use in
breast cancer.

&lt;p&gt;The fate of the JPMorgan traders and their peers at Wall Street rivals has been up in the air as the banks scramble to come to terms with the so-called Volcker rule restricting banks from betting with their own money, among a swathe of other regulatory changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person familiar with JPMorgan's changes said about 45 traders will move from its investment bank to a new unit within its asset management business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are confident that clients will benefit from their investment experience and insight," wrote investment bank and asset management heads Jes Staley and Mary Erdoes in the memo to employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Stewart, co-head of the investment bank's global emerging markets business, will run the new business, according to the memo. Stewart will work with Larry Unrein, head of private equity and hedge funds within asset management, in establishing the business, the memo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan expects to complete the transition over several years, according to the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan confirmed the contents of the memo, which was obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Jamie Dimon had said earlier this month the bank would remove some traders from its investment bank unit because of regulatory changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has complained about the scattershot nature of U.S. financial reform, which he says is making banking businesses more complicated rather than improving the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, also expects revenues to be hurt by new rules that limit the charges it can apply to credit card and current account customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares are down 6 percent this year, while the KBW Banks Index .BKX is up almost 8 percent since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNCERTAIN PROSPECTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prospects for similar groups of traders at Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) and other banks are uncertain and there have been reports that traders from these groups might leave for other companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some members of Goldman Sachs' New York Principal Strategies team are in talks with several groups including KKR, Perella Weinberg, BlackRock (BLK.N) and Carlyle Group CYL.UL, to possibly join one of the firms, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) is considering options for its proprietary trading desk that include a sale of the business, according to a Wall Street Journal report last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America said in July it was trimming staff from its private equity investment business in response to rules that cap that size of banks' investment in private equity.

&lt;p&gt; * About 45 traders will be affected&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Transition to take several years - memo
 (Adds comment from memo, background on other banks)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Co (JPM.N)
is starting a new alternatives unit in its asset management
business, formed from traders who are no longer allowed to
trade for the bank's own account under new U.S. rules,
according to a company memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fate of the JPMorgan traders and their peers at Wall
Street rivals has been up in the air as the banks scramble to
come to terms with the so-called Volcker rule restricting banks
from betting with their own money, among a swathe of other
regulatory changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A person familiar with JPMorgan's changes said about 45
traders will move from its investment bank to a new unit within
its asset management business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are confident that clients will benefit from their
investment experience and insight," wrote investment bank and
asset management heads Jes Staley and Mary Erdoes in the memo

uncertain and there have been reports that traders from these
groups might leave for other companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some members of Goldman Sachs' New York Principal

&lt;p&gt; * Disney ABC continues to search for ABC News chief&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Looks for person with technology experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Considers internal and external candidates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sue Zeidler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Will Silicon Valley
digerati shape the destiny of Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) ABC
News?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the question that Anne Sweeney, president of
Disney-ABC Television Group, faces as the quest to reinvent the
network news business and find a leader for ABC News has taken
her outside media and even as far afield as the U.S tech
capital, said industry sources familiar with ABC's process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The network is replacing David Westin, a corporate lawyer
with little background in news before he took over in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At ABC, tapping talent from outside the news business is
part of its playbook. Westin, who will leave by the end of the
year, succeeded TV legend Roone Arledge, a sportscaster with
little news experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with U.S. broadcast news viewership declining to a
fraction of what it was three decades ago because of cable news
and the Web, the demand for a leader with roots in technology
and an understanding of changes buffeting the news business has
expanded the applicant pool, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sweeney has begun meeting with candidates and is expected
to announce a successor sometime this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "ABC News will have to expand beyond the narrow base of the
broadcast television industry quickly in order to manage a
decade-or-so-long transition to a world where its content is
distributed on TV, online, on tablet screens, on cellphones...
and on media we have never dreamed of," said TV news analyst
Andrew Tyndall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABC's decision to search beyond the usual assortment of
media talent marks a new path compared to other networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CNN pushed out its U.S. chief Jonathan Klein last Friday
and replaced him with another media executive from sister
channel HLN. Comcast Chief Operating Officer  (CMCSA.O) Steve
Burke will replace Jeff Zucker as the head of NBC Universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To be sure, Disney is also considering internal candidates
to replace Westin, who was recently forced to slash more than
300 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They include Senior Vice President Kate O'Brian, who
oversees news gathering; Paul Slavin, who runs ABC News'
digital operations; and John Banner, executive producer for
"World News with Diane Sawyer," according to the industry
sources familiar with the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABC is looking for other ways to strengthen itself. It has
held talks with Bloomberg to collaborate on news gathering,
sources said, comparing them to on- and off-again discussions
between CBS (CBS.N) and Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) CNN. The
talks are no longer happening, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bloomberg declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether Disney will even keep ABC has been a topic of
persistent speculation in the media business, though one ABC
insider said ABC News is profitable and it could be more so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the network must change in other ways, said Media
Valuation Partners principal Larry Gerbrandt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You have to look at it from a fresh perspective and
reinvent 21st century news for the 21st century viewers,"
Gerbrandt said. "This is a time of profound change in
television and most of the historic fixes haven't worked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the most recently reported quarter, revenue at Disney's
media networks arm, home to sports cable network ESPN and ABC,
rose 19 percent to $4.7 billion. But the cable division drives
the business with healthy profit margins, while ABC has been
weighed down by costs and competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike rival General Electric's (GE.N) NBC, which has a
financial advantage by being able to spread costs around to
cable channels CNBC and MSNBC, ABC has no sister cable news
channels.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Apple Downgraded to Neutral

We downgrade Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) to Neutral from our previous Outperform
rating, given the European crisis, iPhone and iPad supply chain constraints and
a cannibalization effect from the iPad. 

Despite the impressive first nine months of 2010, which had beaten analysts`
expectations by a wide margin, Wall Street expects Apple's revenues and earnings
growth to slow down over the next few quarters. 

Wall Street analysts anticipate revenue growth of 37%, 30% and 16% for the first
three quarters of 2011, while earnings per share growth is expected to fall 33%,
16% and 14%, respectively, over the same period. This could be the result of
intense competition from Google Inc.`s (Nasdaq: GOOG) Android-based phones and
tablet PCs that could hurt margins and lower Apple`s market share. 

Although the smartphone market is primarily dominated by Apple`s iPhone,
increased popularity of Google`s Android mobile operating system poses a threat
to Apple. According to a recent report by IDC, Apple's iPhone market share is
expected to drop from the 14.7% previously expected to 10.9% by 2014 due to the
growing threats of high-subscription fees and stiff competition from
lower-priced Android handsets that will take up 24.6% market share by then. 

Apple`s operating expenses have been steadily going up (increased 12.6% in
fiscal 2009), which we fear could hurt earnings growth in the near term. Apple`s
investment in research and development (3.1% of total revenue in 2009 versus
3.0% of total revenue in 2008) grew on a dollar basis by 20.2% in 2009 over 2008
levels. 

However, compared with its competitors such as Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT),
Research in Motion (Nasdaq: RIMM) and Motorola Corp. (NYSE: MOT), Apple has
invested less in R We expect Apple to profoundly increase its selling and R
expenses, going forward, in order to maintain its technology lead, thus hurting
margins. 

Third Quarter Highlights

Apple`s strong third quarter 2010 results, given out in July, beat the Zacks
Consensus Estimate. The upbeat quarter results were fueled by strong iPhone
sales, record Mac sales, increased iPad sales and success of new product
launches. 

Earnings in the quarter were a record at $3.51 per share, easily exceeding the
Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.08 and surpassing the company`s own guidance of
$2.28 to $2.39 per share. Earnings shot up 74.6% from $2.01 per share reported
in the year-ago quarter. Net income soared to $3.25 billion in the quarter, a
substantial growth of 78% from $1.83 billion in the year-ago quarter. 

Strong earnings were attributable to record sales in the quarter, which leaped
61.3% year over year to $15.70 billion. The quarter generated highest quarterly
revenues in the company`s history. This mammoth revenue growth was driven by an
increased momentum in Mac shipments and strong iPhone sales, in addition to
better-than-expected sales of iPad. 

Estimates Move in Both Directions

Although analysts estimate have moved in both positive and negative direction,
the overall Consensus remains positive. Of the 41 analysts covering the stock, 8
have revised their estimates upward, while 2 have made a downward revision to
their estimates in the last 30 days for the fourth quarter of 2010. 

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, Apple expects earnings to come at
approximately $3.44 per share compared with $1.82 per share in the year-ago
quarter, as provided during the last earnings release. The Zacks Consensus
Estimate for the fourth quarter is $3.97 per share. Over the last 60 days (since
the company released its third quarter results), analysts have reduced their
estimates by 1 cent from $3.98 per share. 

We expect future growth to come from the success of iPhone 4 and iPad and
increased Mac shipments. With a loyal customer base, international expansion
into new markets, competitive pricing strategy and new product launches, we
remain positive on its long-term growth. We remain upbeat on Apple`s unrelenting
efforts to revamp its product line. 

We remain optimistic on Apple`s ability to post stronger results in 2011. While
Apple has various positive attributes, we believe these have been already priced
into the shares leaving little room for an upside.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/cf888a/south_africa_telec) has
announced the addition of the "South Africa Telecommunications Report Q4 2010"
report to their offering. 

The South Africa Telecommunications Report provides industry professionals and
strategists, corporate analysts, telecommunication associations, government
departments and regulatory bodies with independent forecasts and competitive
intelligence on South Africa's telecommunications industry. 

BMI's latest update on South Africa's telecommunications market contains revised
forecast figures for the country's fixed-line telephony and broadband subscriber
markets. Our new fixed-line forecast revisions are based on Q409 and Q110 data
published by South Africa's incumbent telecoms operator Telkom SA. Meanwhile,
our broadband forecast has been updated to include mobile broadband subscribers.
These are customers who use devices such as USB sticks, smartphones and netbooks
with built-in broadband modems to connect to the internet via a 3G/HSPA mobile
broadband network. 

Our newly revised fixed-line forecast for South Africa envisages a total decline
of 3% in 2010. The accelerated loss of fixed lines compared with our previous
forecast is based on new data suggesting that Telkom is losing fixed-line
customers at a faster pace. In its results for the financial year ending March
31 2010, the South African incumbent reported a decline in demand for prepaid
PSTN lines; in previous months, this had been an important growth area for the
operator. 

Meanwhile, our new broadband subscriber forecast envisages South Africa with
around 1.12mn broadband subscribers at the end of 2009; this is equivalent to a
penetration rate of 4.3%. During 2009, the South African broadband subscriber
base expanded by over 185%. Much of this growth was based on the rapid increase
in the number of mobile broadband customers. By the end of the year, mobile
broadband customers accounted for 70% of the total market. Our new broadband
forecast for South Africa anticipates nearly 50% growth in 2010; this will
enable the penetration rate to reach 6.4% by the end of the year. 

Although we made some minor changes to our 3G subscriber forecast for South
Africa, our forecast for the mobile market on the whole remains unchanged this
quarter. The last set of operational figures from the country's two largest
mobile operators, Vodacom and MTN, relates to the end of March 2010. By the time
of our next update, new data should be available for the first half of 2010. In
the meantime, we maintain our belief that the sector will see only limited
growth of 1.7% in 2010. This trend will partly be a reflection of moves by the
operators to deduct inactive prepaid customers from their reported totals.
Recent developments of note within the mobile market include the news that South
Africa's smallest mobile operator Cell C is preparing to sell its 50% stake in
Virgin Mobile South Africa, the country's only MVNO. According to media reports
in July, the deal was all but done. Virgin South Africa began life in 2006, as
an equal joint venture between Cell C and Richard Branson's Virgin Group. It is
understood that Virgin Mobile will continue to use Cell C's network even if a
sale goes ahead, and hopes to utilise the 3G/HSPA network which Cell C is
currently rolling out.

&lt;p&gt;- Pfizer Ventures invests $5 million increasing total Series C funding to $37
million -
MALVERN, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals, a biopharmaceutical company developing novel small
molecule drugs to treat cancer, today announced that Pfizer Ventures has joined
the syndicate of Series C investors with an investment of $5 million, increasing
the amount of the Series C financing to $37 million. The initial Series C
financing closing of $32 million was announced by TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals on
August 10, 2010. The Series C financing was led by Clarus Ventures and included
new investor Hatteras Venture Partners and existing investors Amgen Ventures,
HealthCare Ventures, Latterell Venture Partners, Novitas Capital, Quaker
BioVentures and the Vertical Group. 

Proceeds from the financing will be used to advance clinical development of
TL32711, TetraLogic`s lead drug candidate for the treatment of cancer. TL32711
is a SMAC mimetic that neutralizes the activity of inhibitor of apoptosis
proteins (IAPs) that block tumor cell death. TL32711 is being evaluated in a
Phase 1 study as a single agent in patients with solid tumors and lymphoma
refractory to standard therapies. 

"This investment is part of Pfizer Ventures` overall strategy to finance
emerging companies discovering and developing promising treatments for unmet
medical needs, so we`re very pleased to join TetraLogic and its investors to
support its efforts to advance SMAC mimetics as potential new treatments for
cancer," said Elaine Jones, Ph.D., Executive Director of Pfizer Ventures. 

"The addition of Pfizer Ventures as a new investor further complements our
financing syndicate," said John Gill, TetraLogic`s President and Chief Executive
Officer. "We have the ideal combination of institutional and corporate investors
to support and advance our SMAC mimetics development program." 

About TL32711

TL32711 is a small molecule peptidomimetic of SMAC (an endogenous regulator of
apoptotic cell death) that selectively antagonizes multiple inhibitor of
apoptosis proteins (IAPs). Apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death, is the
primary way that cancer cells are destroyed by standard therapies and also by
the body`s biological responses to cancer. IAPs enable cancer cells to resist
being destroyed. SMAC mimetics in preclinical studies have been shown to
neutralize IAPs, and thus, overcome resistance and enable cancer cell
destruction. TL32711 has demonstrated preclinical anti-tumor activity that
supports its clinical development for solid tumor and hematological malignancies
as a monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies. 

About TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals

TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals is a privately held biopharmaceutical company that
discovers and develops small molecule drugs that modulate programmed cell death
pathways to treat debilitating diseases and conditions. The Company`s most
advanced SMAC mimetics neutralize selected IAPs to treat cancer. Earlier
programs are focused on discovering and developing SMAC mimetics to treat
certain autoimmune and inflammation related diseases and conditions. 

TetraLogic`s investors include Amgen Ventures, Clarus Ventures, Hatteras Venture
Partners, HealthCare Ventures, Kammerer Associates, Latterell Venture Partners,
Novitas Capital, Pfizer Ventures, Quaker BioVentures and the Vertical Group. For

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co won approval from the United States and Canada to buy the North American operations of its largest bottler on the condition that it safeguards rival Dr Pepper Snapple Group's confidential business information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Canadian Competition Bureau both approved the deal, the world's largest soft drink maker said on Monday. The next step would be for shareholders of the bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc, to approve the deal in a vote scheduled for Oct 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg said he expects the deal to close as soon as next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke announced the deal in February, just as archrival PepsiCo Inc was closing a similar deal of its own. At that time, the FTC reached a similar decision for PepsiCo regarding Dr Pepper's business information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North American bottlers of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo bottle and distribute some Dr Pepper Snapple soft drinks, and both companies renegotiated deals with Dr Pepper to continue doing so. They also agreed to restrict certain employees' access to confidential competitive information about Dr Pepper brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Enterprises shares were up 38 cents, or 1.3 percent, at $30.58 on the New York Stock Exchange, where Coca-Cola was up 11 cents at $58.73.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diane Bartz, additional reporting by Martinne Geller; editing by Gerald E.

 (Adds source dates for Enel IPO)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Tracy Rucinski and Greg Roumeliotis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MADRID/AMSTERDAM, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Spanish power company
Endesa (ELE.MC) has agreed to sell 80 percent of its gas grid to
Goldman Sachs (GS.N) funds for 800 million euros ($1.1 billion)
to help its Italian parent Enel (ENEI.MI) cut debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enel, Europe's most indebted utility, has tabled a series of
disposals to cut its net debt to 45 billion euros end 2010 from
51 billion euros end 2009, including a minority stake in its
renewable unit in what could be Europe's biggest IPO this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Endesa, 92 percent-owned by the Italian company, said on
Monday the sale of the Spanish grid to two Goldman Sachs
infrastructure funds, which it hoped to finalise before the end
of the year, would boost pretax profit by 450 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It included Gas Natural's (GAS.MC) 35 percent stake in Gas
Aragon, Endesa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Ahead of the IPO (initial public offering) of Enel Green
Power (EGP), this is another important step in (Enel's
2009-2010) 10 billion euros disposal programme," Bank of America
Merrill Lynch analysts wrote in a note. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enel aims to raise at least 3 billion euros from the sale of
a minority stake in EGP. [ID:nLDE67L07Y]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enel, Europe's No. 2 utility in terms of installed capacity,
is expected to launch the IPO on Oct. 18 with a roadshow in
Milan the same day, sources close to the deal said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The research reports of the IPO banking consortium analysts
will be published on Oct. 4 after which pre-marketing will begin
to Oct. 15, one of the sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The launching of the offer is conditional on market watchdog
Consob clearing the IPO, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enel declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Endesa and Enel closed down 0.33 percent at 19.845
euros and 0.19 percent at 3.91 euros, respectively. The STOXX
Europe 600 utilities index .SX6P was down 0.16 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COPY/PASTE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry sources said the sale of Endesa's grid, whose gas
distribution network spans 3,800 km and transport tubes run for
600 km, involved "copying and pasting" the structure that Enel
implemented when it sold an Italian gas network to AXA Private
Equity and infrastructure fund F2i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agreed in May 2009, Enel pocketed 515.7 million euros from
the deal by selling 80 percent of the Italian grid and asking
for a call option after five years, as it has done with Endesa's
gas grid. AXA's infrastructure fund was also one of the bidders
for Endesa's gas network. [ID:nLDE68N0OT]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Endesa said the deal valued the assets at around 1 billion
euros, implying an enterprise value (EV) to 2009 earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) ratio of
close to 17 times based on an EBITDA of 58.4 million euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Energias de Portugal SA (EDP) (EDP.LS) announced in
July it was increasing its stake in Spanish gas distribution and
transmission company Naturgas, it said the 2009 EV/EBITDA
multiple implicit in this transaction was 9.4 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, analysts said Endesa's deal also carried capital
expenditure obligations, possibly up to 300 million euros,
complicating any comparison in valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Infrastructure funds attract investments from long-term
investors such as pension funds and insurance companies and in
turn invest in regulated assets such as gas grids due to the
stable, predictable cash flows that they generate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman sponsors the $6.5 billion GS Infrastructure Partners
I fund and the $3.1 billion GS Infrastructure Partners II fund.
The second fund completed its fundraising earlier this year
after failing to hit its original $7.5 billion target.
[ID:nLDE6211EY]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is not the first time infrastructure funds have shown
an interest in Spanish gas assets. A Morgan Stanley fund joined
Galp Energia (GALP.LS) to buy gas distribution pipelines from
Gas Natural in Madrid for 800 million euros in December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This deal confirms the appetite of infrastructure funds to
bet on regulated businesses in Iberia," BPI analysts wrote in a
note, adding that Galp Energia could gain some 400 million euros
in an upcoming gas distribution sale in Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Galp said in August it had mandated two investment banks to
explore the sale of a minority stake in its natural gas
distribution assets, as it looked for cash to finance investment
and reduce net cash outflow. [ID:nLDE67I1HV]

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) today announced that the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission and Canadian Competition Bureau have both cleared the Company`s
proposed acquisition of the North American operations of Coca-Cola Enterprises
(NYSE: CCE), subject to certain firewall protective measures with respect to its

aligned business system, with increased operating effectiveness and efficiency.
Upon close, we will be well positioned to best serve the unique needs of our

&lt;p&gt; * Deal price not disclosed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Blade specializes in data center switches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Rivalry heating up with HP, Oracle, Cisco&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - IBM plans to buy Blade
Network Technologies, a privately-held company that specializes
in data center switches, as large technology vendors compete to
offer broader and more advanced technologies for corporate data
centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) did not
disclose the price of the deal, which follows the company's
announcement a week earlier that it was offering $1.7 billion
for data analytics company Netezza Corp NZ.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monday's announcement comes as IBM and rivals like
Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), Oracle Corp ORCL.O, and Cisco
Systems Inc (CSCO.O) are developing or acquiring new
technologies in response to clients' demands for better and
cheaper ways to manage their data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While IBM has long competed with HP and Oracle, its rivalry
with network equipment maker Cisco is relatively new. Cisco's
recent entry into servers has prompted HP and IBM to retaliate
by buying or forming close partnerships with networking firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blade, spun off from Nortel Networks in 2006, sells
networking devices and software that route data to and from
servers in the data center. It has been an IBM sales partner
since 2002, and they already have thousands of joint clients,
IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said in May that it planned to spend about $20 billion
in acquisitions through 2015. Its shares were up 26 cents,
around 0.2 percent, at $134.41 in early trade.

&lt;p&gt; * Institutions look to Asia for returns&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Alternatives allocations at the expense of equity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - British institutions increased
investments in hedge funds, private equity and property by a
third in the past three years at the expense of equities, JP
Morgan Asset Management said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A study based on 125 corporate and public pension funds as
well as institutions including endowments, showed allocations to
these so-called alternative investments have risen to 28 percent
of portfolios on average, against 21 percent three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This trend is expected to continue with respondents to the
survey indicating they expect their allocation to alternatives
to rise to 31 percent over the next two to three years, at the
expense of equities," JP Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Institutions have been shifting away from equity to avoid
high volatility since the credit crisis, seeking more stable but
comparable returns from alternative asset classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pension funds invest about 20 percent of their portfolios
into alternative asset classes, and hedge funds make up 8.2
percent of that, up from 6.1 percent in 2007. Pension funds
expect to increase this allocation to an average of 9.2 percent
over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The study showed real estate is still popular among
investors, with more than half of respondents either holding
assets or intending to, but this has fallen from more than 70
percent three years ago. Some blamed disappointing returns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors in British commercial real estate have seen the
value of their properties plunge 44 percent from the market's
peak in 2007, and while British prices have started to recover
since mid-2009, rentals remain depressed, further dampening
returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; British institutions, in particular pension schemes, expect
the strongest returns in alternative assets to come from
emerging countries in Asia. The region is especially favoured by
private equity investors, with 18 percent of respondents saying
they plan to buy in this area over the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The positive outlook for emerging Asia shows that investors
are increasingly confident in seeking opportunities further away
from home," said Peter Ball, head of British institutional
business at JP Morgan Asset Management.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Panduit, a global leader in Unified Physical Infrastructure (UPI) based
solutions, is partnering with IBM to bring large modular, plug and play data
centres to market. 

Enterprise Modular Data Centres (EMDC) are large modular data centres designed
in smaller, standardised modules with the capability to plug in additional
capacity over time as needed, such as power and cooling. 

This approach enables clients to bring new, highly-scalable data centres online
three-to-six months sooner than a custom-designed version. 

Panduit`s UPI-based solutions leverage an optimised physical infrastructure as
the foundation to enable convergence across communication, computing, control,
power and security systems. 

These end-to-end solutions drive operational and financial advantages across the
enterprise, allowing businesses to improve reliability, reduce costs, heighten
agility and support sustainability initiatives. 

Panduit shares IBM`s vision that data centres can be constructed in a flexible
way with the ability to scale on-demand and significantly reduce initial capital
and operating costs. 

By teaming with IBM on the EMDC initiative, Panduit is helping enterprises
deploy sustainable technology infrastructures that meet evolving business
requirements with a flexible and scalable on-demand data centre solution that
defers up to 40 percent of the capital expense and 50 per cent of the
operational expense until capacity is required. 

"Panduit and IBM share a similar vision to help organisations optimise their
power, cooling, and space needs within the data centre environment," said
Vineeth Ram, Panduit VP of Global Strategic Marketing. 

"By supporting IBM`s family of data centre solutions, such as EMDC, with our own
UPI-based solutions that optimise the physical infrastructure, together we can
make that vision a reality." 

"More than 60 per cent of CIOs around the world are expecting significant change
brought by soaring data volumes, increasingly complex analyses and ever larger
populations of users," said Steven Sams, IBM VP of Global Site and Facilities
Services. 

"With today`s announcements IBM and partners like Panduit demonstrate our
ability to lead data centre innovation to meet changing requirements with a very
flexible plug and play approach, allowing data centre capabilities to be added -
and paid for - when and where they are needed." 

Panduit has established long-term collaborative relationships with global
industry leaders such as IBM to develop and integrate innovative, holistic
solutions for its customers. The company continually invests in relationships
and resources for solving its customers` greatest business challenges.

&lt;p&gt;New Commercial Laundry Program Features Industry-First Technology to Rejuvenate,
Protect and Prolong Linen Life
CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Procter &amp; Gamble Professional&#174;, the away-from-home division of Procter &amp; Gamble
(NYSE:PG), today announced the launch of the Tide&#174; Professional Whiteness
Enhancer, a non-bleach rinse aid designed to enable whiteness rejuvenation,
whiteness longevity and fabric strength, and help provide noticeably whiter
linens in a single cycle.1 This new addition to the Tide Professional Laundry
System can help improve customers` bottom line by reducing linen replacement
cost due to worn fabrics by up to 55 percent,1 while keeping linens whiter and
stronger for longer.2

"The enhanced Tide Professional Laundry System ensures that our customers are
getting the most out of every laundry dollar spent," said Eric Hetrick, P
Professional North America Commercial Director. "Our newly formulated products
can actually bring new life to older linens and our near-neutral pH system can
help preserve fabric fibers instead of breaking them down like standard alkaline
laundry products. Considering how important linens are to the guest experience,
this improved system is an investment in the bottom line for our customers." 

In a recent survey,3 95 percent of travelers surveyed said that they are
concerned about the cleanliness of their room`s towels and beddings.
Specifically, 89 percent agreed with the statement that "soft bright whites make
them believe towels and bedding are clean," and 83 percent agreed that "rough
dingy whites make them believe towels and bedding are dirty." In fact, when
asked what their reaction would be if they enter a hotel or motel guestroom with
"dingy" or "not bright white" towels and bedding, an overwhelming 89 percent
responded that they would take some action, including "request new towels and
bedding" (66 percent), "call the front desk and complain" (58 percent), and/or
"request to be moved to a new room" (42 percent). 

P Professional`s enhanced Tide Professional Laundry System was developed to
improve the performance of on-premise laundry operations by incorporating new
cleaning technologies. The system encompasses four professional-strength
products:

* Tide Professional Whiteness Enhancer - A non-bleach rinse aid that uses Triple
Action Whiteness Technology to rejuvenate white linens. 
* Tide 2x Professional Detergent - Laundry detergent that uses proprietary
enzymatic technology to deliver Tide`s signature clean. 
* Downy&#174; Professional Fabric Softener - Dye- and perfume-free fabric softener. 
* Clorox&#174; Bleach - Laundry bleach that eliminates residual color from stains.

The Tide Professional Laundry System also features powerful specialty stain aids
designed to remove a variety of stains, including those from grease and rust, to
keep linens looking their best. 

The introduction of the Tide Professional Whiteness Enhancer addresses two
primary cost drivers in on-premise laundry operations: labor and linen
replacement. Labor costs constitute almost half (46 percent) of laundry
operation costs, and linen replacement accounts for almost a quarter (22
percent).1 The Tide Professional Laundry System, featuring the Tide Professional
Whiteness Enhancer, rejuvenates, protects and extends the life of linens,
resulting in fewer replacement costs and more efficient laundry operations over
time. Laboratory tests underscore the improvements compared to standard alkaline
commercial programs:

* Whiteness Rejuvenation - The Tide Professional Whiteness Enhancer features
Triple Action Whiteness Technology that immediately starts rejuvenating old,
dingy linens. In tests, dingy and yellowed linens looked noticeably whiter in
just a single cycle.1
* Whiteness Longevity - The Tide Professional Laundry System featuring the Tide
Professional Whiteness Enhancer ensures that linens continue looking white and
bright even with age. The system helps protect the integrity of linen fibers
over time, prolonging their whiteness and maximizing their time in use.2
* Fabric Strength - Alkaline detergents can actually damage linen fibers, making
them weaker over time. The Tide Professional Laundry System is a non-corrosive
near-neutral pH formula, which prevents fiber damage. Linens washed with the
Tide Professional Laundry System are up to 1.5 times stronger compared to
traditional alkaline systems,2 and helps increase linen life and reduce
premature linen replacement.

Over time, the use of Tide Professional Whiteness Enhancer as part of the Tide
Professional Laundry System can result in a 55 percent cost savings in
replacement due to worn fabrics, and a 33 percent cost savings in replacement
due to yellowing or graying of fabrics.1 New customers can realize up to a 15
percent savings in linen replacement budgets by reclaiming and rejuvenating old
linens.1

"We love the new Tide Professional Laundry System. It`s definitely whiter and
brighter in our rooms. Our inspector noticed it as well on our towels and
linens," said Chrissy Manne, Hampton Inn. "Our linens were very, very white. We
couldn`t tell the difference between the old and the new linens!" 

Now available to property owners and managers nationwide, the new P
Professional Tide Professional Laundry System, featuring the Tide Professional
Whiteness Enhancer, is another example of the Procter &amp; Gamble commitment to
improve the quality and operation of commercial and professional customers
through product innovation. For more information on P Professional`s Tide
Professional Laundry System, please visit TideProfessional.com.

&lt;p&gt; * Aiming for output 2.325 mln bpd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Current production 200,000-250,000 bpd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Will drill handful of new wells this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Exxon to lead multi-bln dollar water injection plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DOHA, Sept 27 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil (XOM.N) and its partner
Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) plan to more than double the number
of new wells in Iraq's West Qurna Phase One to reach its
projected production target, an Exxon executive said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon aims to drill two to three times the current 370 wells
in the field as part of its development plan for West Qurna to
reach plateau output of 2.325 million barrels per day, said
ExxonMobil Iraq Vice President James Adams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In order to reach the output target, we need to drill two
to three times the number of wells that are already there,"
Adams told reporters on the sidelines of an industry event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked how many wells the firm will be able to drill this
year, he said, "a handful", adding that at this stage the
companies are still evaluating the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current production is from 200,000 to 250,000 barrels per
day, he said. In July, Adams told Reuters the consortium aimed
to raise production by 10 percent by the end of the first
quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The initial development plan agreed by Exxon and its
partners for the West Qurna Phase One oilfield includes drilling
eight new wells and overhauling up to 50 wells this year, an
Iraqi oil official said in May. [ID:nLDE64N1FB]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adams also said Exxon was taking the lead among
international oil companies in managing a multibillion-dollar
water injection scheme, which could help raise extraction rates
in Iraq's southern oilfields such as West Qurna, Majnoon,
Zubair, Rumaila, Gharaf and Halfaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government made the decision to require that this
[water injection project] be done on a communal basis. They
invited us to take the lead," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Exxon-Shell contract to develop the 8.7-billion-barrel
West Qurna Phase One project was one of a series that Iraq has
signed with international oil companies to develop its vast
reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the projects all turn out as planned, Iraq could
quadruple its oil output capacity to Saudi levels of 12 million
barrels per day, potentially giving it the billions of cash it
needs to rebuild after decades of war, sanctions and neglect.

&lt;p&gt;COPENHAGEN, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Novo
Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) said on Monday U.S. rival Pfizer (PFE.N) had
in July filed a lawsuit against it in a British court over a
patent related to an injection pen under development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "They claim the patent is invalid. We disagree with the
claim," Novo Nordisk spokesman Mike Rulis said, declining to
comment on the possible timeframe for an outcome of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The patent is for a feature of the pen's dosage system,
which could be used for injecting growth hormones, insulin and
other drugs, Rulis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer spokesman Andrew Thomas confirmed it had sued Novo in
July over the patent.

&lt;p&gt; * Bank to increase headcount by 40 pct in region&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
plans to triple its private banking assets in Asia over the
next five years, a company spokesman confirmed on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Douglas Wurth, JPMorgan's chief executive of international
private banking, discussed those plans with Bloomberg in an
interview published on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's private bank employs 400 people in Asia, and
plans to increase that headcount by 40 percent this year and
next, especially in India and China, Wurth told Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which currently generates about 20 percent of
its non-U.S. business from Asia, wants to increase that portion
to about 50 percent, Wurth said in the interview. The bank
manages more than $700 billion of assets globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, like many other international private banks, is
trying to boost its business in Asia, encouraged by the sharp
rebound of economies in a region that is outpacing growth in
the United States and Europe. Wurth relocated to Hong Kong from
New York earlier this year.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

U.S. Bank Failures Inch to 127

Bank failures continue unabated as the U.S. regulators closed down two more
banks in Florida and Washington on Friday, pushing up the figure to 127 so far
in 2010. This compares with a total number of 140 bank failures in 2009, 25 in
2008 and just 3 in 2007. 

While the bigger banks benefited greatly from the various programs launched by
the government, many smaller banks are still weak. Tumbling home prices, soaring
loan defaults and a high unemployment rate continue to take their toll on such
institutions. Failure of both residential and commercial real estate loans as a
result of the credit crisis has primarily hurt banks. 

With the industry absorbing bad loans made during the credit explosion, the
trouble in the banking system has worsened, increasing the possibility of more
bank failures. Economic threats emanating from the impact of tighter regulations
under the new financial reform law and weak economic growth data further add to
the concerns. 

The failed banks are:

* Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida-based Haven Trust Bank Florida, with total assets
of about $148.6 million and total deposits of about $133.6 million. 
* Arlington, Washington-based North County Bank, with about $288.8 million in
total assets and $276.1 million in total deposits.

These bank failures represent another blow to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) fund meant for protecting customer accounts, as it has been
appointed receiver for the bank. 

The FDIC insures deposits in 7,830 banks and savings associations in the country
and promotes the safety and soundness of these institutions. When a bank fails,
the FDIC reimburses customers for deposits of up to $250,000 per account. 

Though the FDIC managed to shore up its deposit insurance fund during the last
couple of quarters, the outbreak of bank failures has tested its limits. As of
June 30, 2010, the fund remained in the red, with a deficit of $15.2 billion. 

The failed Haven Trust Bank is expected to cost the FDIC about $31.9 million and
North County Bank will cost about $72.8 million. 

Boca Raton, Florida-based First Southern Bank has assumed all of the assets and
deposits of Haven Trust Bank Florida. First Southern Bank did not pay the FDIC a
premium for the deposits of the failed bank. Additionally, the FDIC and First
Southern Bank have agreed to share losses on $127.3 million of Haven Trust
Bank's assets. 

Coupeville, Washington-based Whidbey Island Bank will assume all of the assets
and deposits of North County Bank. Whidbey Island Bank will pay the FDIC a
premium of 2.0% to assume all of the deposits of the failed bank. Additionally,
the FDIC and Whidbey Island Bank have agreed to share losses on $221.9 million
of North County Bank's assets. 

In the second quarter of 2010, the number of banks on the FDIC's list of problem
institutions grew to 829 from 775 in the previous quarter and 416 in the
year-ago quarter. This is the highest since the savings and loan crisis in the
early 1990s. 

Banks that feature on the problem list are most likely to fail, though some may
still scrape through. As of now, only about 13% of banks on the FDIC's problem
list have actually failed. What is interesting is that this percentage is likely
to change; though the problem list is growing at a slower pace, bank failures
are accelerating. 

Increasing loan losses on commercial real estate are expected to cause hundreds
more bank failures in the next few years. The FDIC expects bank failures to cost
about $60 billion over the next four years. 

The failure of Washington Mutual in 2008 was the largest in U.S. banking
history. It was acquired by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM). The other major
acquirers of failed institutions since 2008 include U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB),
Zions Bancorp (Nasdaq: ZION), PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (NYSE: PNC) and
Regions Financial Corp. (NYSE: RF).

programme, les avantages indirects devant toucher plus de 475 000 personnes dans
les deux prochaines ann&#233;es. 

Ce nouvel engagement va aider les innovateurs &#224; am&#233;liorer les technologies
profitant &#233;conomiquement aux femmes, technologies identifi&#233;es gr&#226;ce au
partenariat entre ExxonMobil et Changemakers d`Ashoka dans le challenge Women |
Tools | Technology:Building Opportunities &amp; Economic Power Challenge (Femmes |
Outils | Technologie : Promouvoir le d&#233;veloppement des femmes dans
l`&#233;conomie),lanc&#233; &#224; l`occasion de la CGI de l`ann&#233;e derni&#232;re. Le nouveau soutien
financier d`ExxonMobil va contribuer &#224; fournir de l`assistance-conseil,
faciliter les relations des innovateurs avec d`autres entrepreneurs sociaux,
entreprises et experts techniques et identifier les meilleures pratiques. 

&#171; Les programmes identifi&#233;s lors de notre engagement en 2009 utilisent la
technologie pour am&#233;liorer le niveau de vie des femmes dans les pays en voie de
d&#233;veloppement &#187;, a confi&#233; Suzanne M. McCarron, directrice g&#233;n&#233;rale de la
communication et des relations institutionnelles d`ExxonMobil. &#171; En soutenant
encore plus ces programmes, nous ferons avancer des technologies qui g&#233;n&#232;rent
plus d`opportunit&#233;s &#233;conomiques pour les femmes et qui, de ce fait, renforcent
leur influence. &#187;

Une barri&#232;re importante &#224; la progression &#233;conomique est le manque d`acc&#232;s &#224;
l`&#233;nergie. On estime &#224; 1,6 milliard le nombre d`individus dans le monde n`ayant
pas acc&#232;s &#224; l`&#233;lectricit&#233; et environ 2,4 milliards d`individus d&#233;pendant des
&#233;nergies issues de la biomasse (bois, charbon de bois ou d&#233;jections animales,
par ex.) pour la cuisine et le chauffage. Ce manque d`acc&#232;s &#224; l`&#233;nergie fait
baisser le niveau de productivit&#233;, d`&#233;ducation, de sant&#233; et de s&#233;curit&#233; de cette
population, dont 70 % sont des femmes et des jeunes filles. 

Les subventions ExxonMobil seront vers&#233;es &#224; une s&#233;lection d`innovateurs qui
misent sur des technologies visant &#224; faciliter l`acc&#232;s &#224; l`&#233;nergie par le biais
de nouveaux projets. Ces technologies aident les femmes &#224; &#234;tre plus productives
et &#224; participer plus efficacement &#224; l`&#233;conomie. On peut citer parmi les
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires : Kopernik, Solar Electric Light Fund, Solar Sister, Productive
Agricultural Linkages and Marketing Systems (P.A.L.M.S) et smallsolutions. 

&#171; Mon pays progressera quand plus de femmes auront acc&#232;s &#224; la technologie &#187;, a
d&#233;clar&#233; quant &#224; elle Leticia Brenyah, une innovatrice ghan&#233;enne qui b&#233;n&#233;ficie du
soutien d`ExxonMobil et qui s`est exprim&#233;e &#224; la r&#233;union CGI dans le cadre du
domaine d`intervention Empowering Girls and Women (donnons du pouvoir aux jeunes
filles et aux femmes). &#171; Lorsque les femmes r&#233;ussissent &#233;conomiquement, elles
am&#233;liorent leur qualit&#233; de vie, celle de leur famille et font progresser
leurpays. &#187;

Dans le cadre du soutien aux programmes identifi&#233;s par le biais de Women | Tools
| Technology, ExxonMobil collaborera avec ses partenaires Changemakers d`Ashoka,
le Centre international pour la recherche sur les femmes et le laboratoire
Thunderbird sur les march&#233;s. Cette collaboration permettra de soutenir un
certain nombre de concepts favorisant l`utilisation de technologies innovantes
et facilitera l`acc&#232;s des femmes &#224; l`&#233;nergie de fa&#231;on progressive et durable. 

Le TEM Lab va d&#233;ployer sur le terrain des &#233;quipes de conseil qui vont aider &#224;
diagnostiquer les probl&#232;mes et les opportunit&#233;s &#233;conomiques avec comme objectif
de renforcer l`efficacit&#233; du programme. 

&#171; Nous sommes enthousiastes de devenir partenaires d`un programme aussi
pertinentqui tire parti de l`expertise commerciale et technologique afin de
permettre aux innovateurs d`am&#233;liorer leur comp&#233;tence&#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Angel Cabrera,
pr&#233;sident de la Thunderbird School of Global Management. 

Les innovateurs auront l`occasion d`entrer en relation avec des experts de CGI
et d`utiliser le cadre de d&#233;couverte (Discovery Framework) de Changemakers
d`Ashoka afin de mieux appr&#233;hender les enjeux et les opportunit&#233;s du
d&#233;veloppement de leurs concepts. 

&#171; La passion et les nouvelles id&#233;es propres aux solutions identifi&#233;es lors de
notre engagement de l`ann&#233;e derni&#232;repuis lors du challenge Women | Tools |
Technology: Building Opportunities &amp; Economic Power Challenge symbolisent une
nouvelle force pour d&#233;velopper, &#224; l`&#233;chelle mondiale, des opportunit&#233;s
&#233;conomiques pour les femmes &#187;, a expliqu&#233; Bill Drayton, PDG d`Ashoka. &#171; Je me
r&#233;jouis non seulement de l`influence importante et sur le long terme de ces
leaders, mais aussi de la source d`inspirationqu`ils vont susciter pour les
futures g&#233;n&#233;rations &#171;d`initiateurs de changementtout au long de leur parcours&#187;.

Women, ICRW), a apport&#233; des explications sur la fa&#231;on dont la technologie
pouvait contribuer &#224; faire progresser les femmes &#233;conomiquement. L`ICRW
continuera &#224; apporter son soutien pour &#233;valuer et superviser les activit&#233;s
d`engagement. 

&#171; Cela fait plaisir de voir comment les innovateurs ont mis les bonnes
intentions en pratique au bout d`un an avec des actions qui dans les faits
int&#232;grent les femmes dans diverses &#233;tapes de la technologie en leur donnant les
outils dont elles ont besoin pour se d&#233;velopper &#187;, a confi&#233; Sarah Degnan Kambou,
pr&#233;sidente de l`ICRW.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - British singer Pete Doherty was charged on Tuesday with possessing cocaine in connection with an inquiry into the suspected overdose death of heiress Robyn Whitehead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 31-year-old Babyshambles frontman and former partner of supermodel Kate Moss was one of four people questioned after the January death of the filmmaker, who had been working on a documentary of Doherty at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of Doherty's friends were also charged -- Peter Wolfe, 42, for supplying and possessing cocaine, and Alan Wass, 29, for possessing cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfe was widely reported to have been staying at the flat in east London where Whitehead died aged 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three are on bail and due to appear at Thames Magistrates' Court on October 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitehead was the granddaughter of the late Teddy Goldsmith, founder of The Ecologist magazine, and daughter of 1960s filmmaker Peter Whitehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mike Collett-White; Editing by Steve Addison)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * "Serious criminal act" took place Sept. 24-Exxon

 * Project in early stages of development-Exxon

 * No one hurt or injured-Exxon
 (Adds comment from Exxon)  

 PERTH, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Villagers in Papua New Guinea
attacked Exxon Mobil's liquefied natural gas project late last
week, burning heavy machinery and using high-powered weapons to
damage construction equipment, a newspaper reported.

 The attack took place on Friday night at Kaiam, Papua New
Guinea, near the project's Kopi LNG facility, Papua New
Guinea's The National newspaper reported.

 The attacks were part of ongoing land disputes within the
footprint of the $15 billion PNG LNG project.

 Residents of the area have been frustrated by what they see
as their exclusion from participating in the initial stages of
construction of PNG LNG's 6.6-million-tonne-per-year processing
plant that began this year, the paper said.

 No one was wounded or directly threatened in the attacks,
which took place at a quarry site of the Australia-based Clough
Curtain joint venture, Exxon said.

 "It was a serious criminal act but did not involve a large
group," the oil company said in a statement sent by email.

 Exxon declined to provide any additional details, citing an
ongoing police investigation.

 The project is at an early stage of a four-year
construction period, with activities under way in design,
pre-mobilization and early site work, Exxon said.

 Media reports have suggested that the project could be
delayed due to landowner disputes with the government.

 At a conference in Singapore last week, Papua New Guinea's
minister of planning and development, Paul Tiensten, said there
was "infighting" among the landowners affected by the project,
but said the project was still expected to stay within the
original cost estimate and start exporting LNG in 2014. 
  Tiensten said some of the 60,000 landowners affected by the
project question the division of benefits from the project.

 LNG benefit-sharing negotiations late last year resulted in
violence in Port Moresby and this year a fatal gunbattle
erupted between tribal groups arguing over a share of the
project.

 The Papua New Guinea government holds equity in the
project, while Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) is the majority stakeholder.
Other equity holders include Oil Search (OSH.AX), Santos
(STO.AX), and Japan's Nippon.

 PNG LNG has long-term supply agreements with China's
Sinopec (0386.HK), Japan's TEPCO (9501.T) and Osaka Gas
(9532.T), and Taiwan's CPC.

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Indonesia's anti-monopoly
commission (KPPU) has fined Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and four units
125 billion rupiah ($13.97 million) for price-fixing and cartel
practices, a commissioner said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MANILA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) today renewed its strong commitment to the
Philippines with a pledge to increase investments in this important country by
US$1 billion over five years. The commitment was conveyed by Coca-Cola Pacific
Group President Glenn Jordan directly to the President of the Philippines,
Benigno Aquino, Jr., during a meeting in New York while President Aquino, Jr.
was in the United States to attend the United Nations General Assembly and to
attract foreign investors to the Philippines. 

"Our new commitment to invest US$1 billion in our business over five years will
strengthen production, distribution and help development of new products to
refresh Filipino consumers," said Mr. Jordan following his meeting with
President Aquino, Jr. 

"This investment is a proof point of our strong commitment to the Philippines,
our confidence in the prospects of the Filipino economy and the continued growth
of a broader and more affluent middle class in the Philippines." 

During the meeting with President Aquino, Jr., Mr. Jordan shared some of the
positive developments of Coca-Cola`s operations in The Philippines, including
the ongoing construction of a mega bottling facility in Misamis Oriental. The
plant, scheduled to begin operations next year, will be one of the largest
plants in the region and is expected to generate significant employment
opportunities in the area.

The Coca-Cola Company - which operates 23 plants and 42 sales offices with over
7,800 direct employees across The Philippines - will focus its new investment on
strengthening marketing execution and enhancing system logistics and delivery
capabilities in order to better serve the Company`s expanding customer and
consumer base. 

"Part of the new investment will also help expand the reach of our corporate
social responsibility initiatives benefitting the local communities. We fully
realize that as we grow our business, it is important that local communities
grow as well," Mr. Jordan added. 

The Coca-Cola Company has built more than 80 Little Red Schoolhouses in remote
areas of the Philippines, with the first opening in 1997. More than 40,000
students have since completed their studies at the schools. In addition, and in
partnership with the WWF, Coca-Cola supports several environmental programs in
the Philippines. A project between the of Departments of Science, Technology and
Education and Coca-Cola aims at minimizing iron deficiency among schools kids
through the distribution of a nutritional juice. 

Coca-Cola has been present in the Philippines since the start of the 20th
century and has been locally produced since 1912. The Philippines received the
first Coca-Cola bottling and distribution franchise outside North America. The
Philippines bottling operation is among the biggest 10 Coca-Cola bottlers

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Joins Continua as the Alliance Increases Momentum and Continues to
Drive the Creation of an Ecosystem of Interoperable Personal Connected
Healthcare Products
BEAVERTON, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Continua Health Alliance, the non-profit, open industry coalition of leading
healthcare and technology companies, today announced the release of its 2010
Design Guidelines. The new Guidelines now complete the pathway for full
end-to-end solutions based on Continua-certified products and services. The
recently updated certification program ensures products are interoperable and
communicate effectively to provide the best user experience possible. 

The 2010 release of the Guidelines is a milestone in Continua`s mission to
establish an ecosystem of interoperable personal connected healthcare products
that empower individuals and organizations to better manage their health and
wellness. The updated design guidelines outline industry standards and
specifications selected by the Alliance for devices, services and communication
standards to ensure interoperability, elaborate on Continua-specific
implementations and seek to advance interoperability by clarifying options in
underlying standards or specifications. They are available to members, allowing
them first-hand access to the international technology standards that the
Alliance is founded upon. 

"We joined Continua because of Ascension Health`s dedication to providing

healthcare products that Continua certifies allow continual access to accurate
information that is needed to do so. Continua`s updated design guidelines will
increase interoperability, expanding access to this necessary data to further
assist us in continuing to serve all persons with special attention to those who
are poor and vulnerable." 

In addition to the currently released Guidelines, the Continua 2010 Guidelines
incorporate the following:

* Addition of the Wide Area Network (WAN) interface, which takes data from an
aggregation or hub device, such as a PC, mobile phone or health appliance, and
sends it on through a standardized model for remote monitoring servers or

&lt;p&gt;Net-Net Session Director SBCs deployed in Verizon Business` IP Trunking
offeringsuccessfully completes third party testing for Microsoft
interoperability program
BEDFORD, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Acme Packet (NASDAQ: APKT), the leader in session border control solutions,
today announced that its integrated session border controller (SBC), the Net-Net
Session Director (SD), has achieved interoperability qualification with
Microsoft Office Communications Server (OCS) 2007 R2 when used in conjunction
with Verizon Business` IP Trunking service. The qualification testing was
conducted by tekVizion Labs, Microsoft's Unified Communication Open
Interoperability Program (UC OIP) testing partner. 

UC OIP is Microsoft`s qualification program for SIP/PSTN gateways, IP PBXs and
SIP trunking services. Successful UC OIP qualification ensures that enterprise
SIP trunking customers experience seamless setup, support, and use of qualified
telephony infrastructure and services with Microsoft's unified communications
(UC) software and Microsoft Office Communications Online. The testing performed
by tekVizion Labs demonstrated that with Acme Packet SBCs, enterprises can
deploy Microsoft Office Communications Server SIP trunking with Verizon Business
IP Trunking services. 

Verizon Business` IP Trunking service, which is also UC OIP-qualified,
consolidates voice and other unique features such as a burstable enterprise
shared trunking capability, onto a SIP-based network, thereby controlling or
eliminating the costs associated with maintaining traditional TDM local lines,
trunks, and dedicated PRI circuits. Acme Packet`s Net-Net SBCs can be deployed
in Verizon Business` IP Trunking between the OCS Mediation Server and Verizon`s
Private IP or Internet Dedicated Access networks. The Net-Net SBC can also be
deployed at enterprises that integrate both OCS 2007 R2 and IP PBX solutions as
part of Verizon Business` IP trunking. 

Because of Acme Packet`s proven experience, with over 1100 customers and 10,000
systems deployed worldwide, many leading SIP trunking service providers specify
Acme Packet SBCs into their offerings. Acme Packet`s UC OIP qualification now
provides small, medium and large enterprise customers with the increased
confidence to deploy Acme Packet SBCs in conjunction with Verizon Business` IP
Trunking services. 

"Acme Packet SBCs play a critical role for many of our IP Trunking customers,"
stated Thomas Dalrymple, product management director of global voice solutions
with Verizon Business. "The ability for our VoIP service to work in an
integrated fashion with Acme Packet SBCs gives our customers in the U.S. and
Europe greater flexibility when designing Verizon IP Trunking with Microsoft
Office Communications Server 2007 R2." 

"With Office Communications Server 2007 R2, Microsoft has successfully extended
the power of unified communications to embrace desktop voice communications,"
stated Seamus Hourihan, Acme Packet`s executive vice president of marketing and
product management. "Acme Packet is now taking this offering one step further by
giving Verizon Business IP Trunking customers the flexibility to implement
Microsoft OCS with our industry-leading Net-Net SBC."

PHILADELPHIA &amp; GLENDALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Dreams do come true, especially for women who grew up dreaming of a fairy tale
wedding modeled after their favorite Disney Princess character. Alfred Angelo
and Disney will debut their first collection of bridal gowns, Disney Fairy Tale
Weddings by Alfred Angelo, at the National Bridal Market in Chicago on October
2, 2010. Marking their first collaboration, the bridal gown collection is
inspired by the essence, style and personality of seven iconic Disney Princess
characters: Ariel, Aurora (Sleeping Beauty), Belle, Cinderella, Jasmine, Snow
White and Tiana. 

The Disney Fairy Tale Weddings by Alfred Angelo collection will be available in
sizes 0 to 30W, at all Alfred Angelo Signature stores and select Alfred Angelo
wholesale Partner Bridal Boutiques in 2011. All gowns will be priced $599 to
$1,199. Sneak peek footage of the gowns can be seen in this new behind the
scenes YouTube video from Disney Living at

fashion and home, Disney Consumer Products. 

Acclaimed Alfred Angelo designer Michael Shettel designed the Disney Fairy Tale
Weddings by Alfred Angelo gowns. Michael has a keen eye for trends and the
ability to translate that vision into beautiful gowns. As a result, Michael
sought to capture every girl`s fantasy of feeling like a princess on her wedding
day, while being inspired by the magic and identity of each Disney Princess.
With each gown, brides can showcase their personal style. The collection
includes classic, grand ball gowns in layers of tulle and sparkle net, updated
fit and flare styles to highlight curves and movement, and pleated and wrapped
bodices to flatter the bride`s figure.

* The treasures of the sea inspired Ariel`s gown. The mermaid silhouette
features re-embroidered lace, pearl beading, and sequin sparkles. 
* Sleeping Beauty`s gown is romantic with a dreamy, willowy skirt for this
slumbering princess. 
* Belle`s wedding dress, with a draped waistline is inspired by the iconic
ballroom dance scene from the film and focuses on making a grand entrance. 
* Cinderella`s gown radiates with sparkle as its inspiration is the fairy tale`s
enchanted glass slipper. 
* Jasmine`s wedding dress conveys freedom and individuality and as a result her
shimmering soft satin gown is exotic with a bejeweled neckline and low cut back.

* Snow White`s dress is inspired by nature, beauty and grace like the Disney
Princess character herself 
* The regal, one-shoulder taffeta gown for our newest princess, Tiana, reflects
her independent spirit with an asymmetric bodice and ruched skirt.

&lt;p&gt;YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK, Russia, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The launch of
a new field at ExxonMobil (XOM.N) led Sakhalin-1 will keep the
Pacific offshore project's output roughly steady next year as
production at an older field declines, ExxonMobile Vice
President John Sandlin said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sandlin said the older Chayvo field would produce at a rate
of 125,000 barrels per day next year, down from 150,000 barrels
per day this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Exxon-led consortium, which includes Russia's Rosneft
(ROSN.MM), India's ONGC (ONGC.BO) and Japan's Sodeco, is due to
launch the 30,000 barrel-per-day Odoptu field on Tuesday.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co made overtures to two senior executives from rival IBM in its search for a new chief executive, but was rebuffed, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early stages of a closely watched CEO hunt, now into its sixth week, HP reached out to Steve Mills, who leads IBM's software and systems group, according to two sources with knowledge of the approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virginia Rometty, who oversees sales, marketing and strategy for IBM and ranked by Fortune as being among America's most powerful businesswomen, was also approached, one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive search firm Spencer Stuart is leading the effort to replace Mark Hurd, who was popular with Wall Street but ousted in an abrupt and controversial manner in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP has said it was looking externally and internally for candidates to helm the world's top technology company by sales, but the company is under some pressure to name a new chief quickly to fill its leadership vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP's board may be looking to attract a marquee name as it aims to convince investors it can drive future growth.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co made overtures to two senior executives from rival IBM in its search for a new chief executive, but was rebuffed, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early stages of a closely watched CEO hunt, now into its sixth week, HP reached out to Steve Mills, who leads IBM's software and systems group, according to two sources with knowledge of the approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virginia Rometty, who oversees sales, marketing and strategy for IBM and ranked by Fortune as being among America's most powerful businesswomen, was also approached, one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive search firm Spencer Stuart is leading the effort to replace Mark Hurd, who was popular with Wall Street but ousted in an abrupt and controversial manner in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP has said it was looking externally and internally for candidates to helm the world's top technology company by sales, but the company is under some pressure to name a new chief quickly to fill its leadership vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP's board may be looking to attract a marquee name as it aims to convince investors it can drive future growth. But both declined to be considered for the job, the sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives from HP and IBM declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HP's board's search committee is led by John Hammergren, and includes directors Marc Andreessen, Laurence Babbio Jr., and Joel Hyatt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading internal candidates include Todd Bradley, who leads HP's high-volume but low-margin PC division.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Industrial and Commercial Bank

investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) remains a strategic partner
to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ICBC, the world's largest lender by market value, said there
is no change to its strategic partnership with Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC's statement came after Reuters reported on Wednesday
that Goldman was selling up to $2 billion worth of shares of its
stake in ICBC, 16 months since its last selldown of the world's

&lt;p&gt; * Televisa, Nextel Mexico clear legal hurdle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Government says court challenges dismissed
 (Recasts with government comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Mexico's government will
hand over a license to broadcaster Televisa and partner Nextel
Mexico by next week that will allow them to deploy a wireless
phone network in the country, an official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nextel Mexico and Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX), the world's
largest Spanish-language content producer, won a chunk of
spectrum in a government auction in July but their claim has
been held up in the courts, with competitors challenging their
winning bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, a senior transport ministry official told
Reuters the courts had dismissed the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gerardo Sanchez, who heads the ministry's legal division,
said the license would be handed over "early next week at the
latest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies offered around $14 million for the
nationwide license, the lowest bid allowed by the auction's
rules, causing a stir in the industry. Rivals America Movil
(AMXL.MX) (AMX.N) and Telefonica (TEF.MC) paid $400 million for
another slice of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nextel Mexico said earlier in the day it would continue
fighting lawsuits from companies owned by tycoon Ricardo
Salinas, who challenged the rulings because of the wide gap in
prices paid for access to spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa has committed to buying 30 percent of Nextel
Mexico, a unit of NII Holdings, for $1.44 billion once the
license is granted. They plan to develop a 3G data services
network across the country to better compete with America Movil
and Telefonica.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 60 Russians linked to the death of an anti-corruption lawyer would be barred from the United States and its financial markets under a bill introduced in the Congress on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measure says that sanctions would be lifted only after Russia brings to justice those responsible for the 2009 death of Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer for what was once Russia's top equity fund, Hermitage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bill, introduced by Senator Benjamin Cardin and Representative James McGovern, both Democrats, faces a steep climb to get passed before Congress completes its work for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human rights activists charge that Russian authorities subjected Magnitsky to conditions amounting to torture in a failed bid to force him to testify in their favor in a battle with Hermitage over a $234 million tax fraud scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnitsky died after being repeatedly denied medical treatment in pre-trial detention. He had accused Russian officials of stealing the millions of tax dollars paid by his client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Democratic aide said the bill has drawn bipartisan interest and lawmakers might get to it when they return to Washington after the November 2 congressional election for what is expected to be a final few weeks of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nearly a year after Sergei's death, the leading figures in this scheme remain in power in Russia," said Cardin, who also chairs the human rights monitoring U.S. Helsinki Commission, an independent federal agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we expect any measure of justice in this case, we must act in the United States," said Cardin. "At the least, we can and should block these corrupt individuals from traveling and investing their ill-gotten money in our country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Xavier Briand)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs is selling up to $2 billion worth of shares of its stake in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, 16 months since its last selldown of the world's largest bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Block sales of this nature rarely come with an explanation. Goldman would not comment on the sale and ICBC could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of Goldman's stake before this share sale was more than $10 billion, well above the original $2.58 billion the New York investment bank invested in ICBC in 2006, when the Chinese bank was just coming off a government bailout and about to go public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is selling a batch of 2.75 billion shares ahead of ICBC's upcoming rights offering. Rights offerings help companies raise money, but the shares that are sold are always at a discount, and dilute existing shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman pledged early in 2009 to keep 80 percent of its ICBC stake until April 2010. Under an earlier lockup agreement, Goldman would have been permitted to sell half of its stake in the state-controlled bank in April 2009 and the rest that October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICBC's $6.6 billion rights offering is expected to arrive in November. German insurer Allianz Group and U.S. credit card company American Express also have significant stakes in ICBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a term sheet obtained by Reuters, the shares are being sold as of Wednesday are priced at HK$5.70-HK$5.79 per share, or a 3-4.5 percent discount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2009, Goldman sold around $1.9 billion worth of shares in ICBC, the world's largest bank by market capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That selldown came amid a string of divestitures that Western banks made in their Chinese partners to raise cash in the wake of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The selldowns by UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland and others, while key to their capital raisings, were not well received in Beijing at the time, where officials were expecting longer term relationships with their Western counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Goldman, the bank made a point to say that it would remain a shareholder despite what other financial investors were doing in China post crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's original purchase was for 4.9 percent of ICBC. As of Wednesday's sale, that stake is now 3.1 percent, or 10.4 billion shares of ICBC's Hong Kong listed unit.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Fiona Lau and Michael Flaherty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is
selling up to $2 billion worth of shares of its stake in

16 months since its last selldown of the world's largest bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Block sales of this nature rarely come with an explanation.

      in convenient, secure and reliable fingerprint authentication solutions, 
      today announced it has attained Gold Certified Partner status in the 
      Microsoft Partner Program with competencies in ISV/Software Solutions 
      and OEM Hardware Solutions, recognizing Validity&#8217;s expertise and impact 
      in the technology marketplace. As a Gold Certified Partner, Validity has 
      demonstrated expertise with Microsoft technologies and proven ability to 
      meet customers&#8217; needs. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners receive a rich 
      set of benefits, including access, training and support, giving them a 
      competitive advantage in the channel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Validity&#8217;s fingerprint solutions are currently integrated into many 
      Notebook PC models from several Tier 1 OEMs and have future application 
      in mobile phones and other consumer devices. Validity&#8217;s fingerprint 
      sensing area is formed on plastic and is completely decoupled from the 
      silicon drive chip, making the sensors durable, cost-effective, higher 
      performance, smaller form factor, lower power, and with multiple 
      customization options.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are extremely pleased to have attained Gold Certified Partner status 
      in the Microsoft Partner Program. This allows us to clearly promote our 
      expertise and relationship with Microsoft to our customers,&#8221; said Mariel 
      van Tatenhove, VP of Marketing and Business Development at Validity. 
      &#8220;The benefits provided through our Gold Certified Partner status will 
      allow us to continue to enhance the offerings that we provide for 
      customers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the gap 
      between their business demands and technology capabilities,&#8221; said 
      Allison Watson, vice president of the Worldwide Partner Sales and 
      Marketing Group at Microsoft Corp. &#8220;They need to trust in a company that 
      can act as an expert adviser for their long-term strategic technology 
      plans. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners, which have certified expertise 
      and direct training and support from Microsoft, can build a positive 
      customer experience with our technologies. Today, Microsoft recognizes 
      Validity as a new Gold Certified Partner for demonstrating its expertise 
      providing customer satisfaction using Microsoft products and technology.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner status, 
      Validity had to declare a Microsoft Competency. Microsoft Competencies 
      are designed to help differentiate a partner&#8217;s capabilities with 
      specific Microsoft technologies to customers looking for a particular 
      type of solution. Each competency has a unique set of requirements and 
      benefits, formulated to accurately represent the specific skills and 
      services that partners bring to the technology industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ISV/Software Solutions Competency recognizes the skill and focus 
      partners bring to a particular solution set. Microsoft Gold Certified 
      Partners that have obtained this competency have a successful record of 
      developing and marketing packed software based on Microsoft technologies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Solutions competencies are an important way for Microsoft to better 
      enable ISVs to meet customer needs,&#8221; said Sanjay Parthasarathy, 
      corporate vice president of the Developer  Platform Evangelism Group at 
      Microsoft. &#8220;They allow ISVs to keep and win customers through their deep 
      knowledge of solutions-based Microsoft platform technologies. Microsoft 
      has a long history of working closely with ISV partners to help them 
      deliver compelling solutions and applications to our mutual customers, 
      and the Microsoft Competencies are an important step in continuing to 
      enhance vital relationships with ISVs worldwide.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The OEM Hardware Solutions Competency is intended for partners that 
      build and deliver desktop or server hardware systems, and those that 
      design and manufacture hardware devices used as computer parts, 
      peripherals or accessories. Partners that attain the OEM Hardware 
      Solutions Competency are recognized for their expertise in delivering 
      high-quality hardware solutions and are provided with information and 
      tools needed to expand their market opportunities and maintain a 
      competitive advantage in the industry. Specializations within the 
      competency include System Building and Device Manufacturing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Partners that acquire the OEM Hardware Solutions Competency have 
      demonstrated expertise and have a track record of building high-quality 
      hardware solutions that are designed and configured with Microsoft 
      technologies according to customer needs and supported to ensure 
      customer satisfaction,&#8221; said Kurt Kolb, vice president of Worldwide 
      System Builder Channel and License Compliance at Microsoft. &#8220;These 
      partners are able to closely engage with Microsoft and have access to 
      specialized resources to help them meet and even surpass customer 
      expectations.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Microsoft Partner Program was launched in October 2003 and 
      represents Microsoft&#8217;s ongoing commitment to the success of partners 
      worldwide. The program offers a single, integrated partnering framework 
      that recognizes partner expertise, rewards the total impact that 
      partners have in the technology marketplace, and delivers more value to 
      help partners&#8217; businesses be successful.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Sourcefire, Inc. (Nasdaq: FIRE), the creator of Snort&#174; and a leader in 
      intelligent cybersecurity 
      solutions, today announced that Matt Watchinski, Senior Director of the 
      Sourcefire Vulnerability Research TeamTM (VRT), discovered a 
      critical vulnerability which Microsoft disclosed as Microsoft 
      Security Bulletin MS10-062, CVE-2010-0818.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Leveraging the MPEG-4 Codec vulnerability an attacker could compromise 
      Windows Media Player through an infected video file or architected 
      content stream. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a 
      user opens a specially crafted media file or receives specially crafted 
      streaming content from a website or any application that delivers Web 
      content. An attacker who exploits this vulnerability could gain the same 
      user rights as the user, allowing them to open local files and access 
      networked systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

			StoredIQ&#8217;s eDiscovery Solution Offers the Most Comprehensive Support 
      for Microsoft SharePoint
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Includes Support for Content Beyond SharePoint Libraries and Provides 
      Simplified Navigation for Review
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			StoredIQ, 
      a leading provider of&#160;information 
      management and&#160;eDiscovery
			solutions, 
      today announced that its&#160;Intelligent 
      Information Management Platform integration with Microsoft 
      SharePoint has been enhanced and extended to provide the most 
      accessible, robust, and complete support for SharePoint on the market 
      today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SharePoint presents complex and unusual challenges for eDiscovery 
      because of its collaborative nature and its ability to support a myriad 
      of data objects. Current eDiscovery solutions for SharePoint needlessly 
      collect and copy mountains of data prior to providing analysis of the 
      content. And, these solutions are limited in their visibility and scope 
      to just SharePoint Libraries and a subset of metadata. In 
      contrast, the StoredIQ solution fully supports all core SharePoint 
      object types including Blog Posts, Comments, Discussion Board, 
      Calendar, Tasks, Project Tasks, Contacts, Wiki Pages, Issue Tracker, 
      Announcements, Survey, Links, Document Libraries, Picture Libraries, and 
      Records Center, and all associated metadata. The updated integration 
      also uniquely supports nested SharePoint content. For example, StoredIQ 
      will find, index, and collect blogs, threaded comments, and their 
      attachments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, this expanded integration with SharePoint leverages novel 
      technology for presenting SharePoint content to legal reviewers. Using a 
      proprietary embedded viewer, the entire hierarchical structure of 
      SharePoint is displayed, providing complete context for reviewers when 
      navigating complex SharePoint instances. And, to further simplify the 
      legal review process, SharePoint navigation can be scoped to &#8220;user 
      views&#8221; to mimic the access of custodians-of-interest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With the growing popularity of using SharePoint beyond document 
      collaboration, there&#8217;s a significant legal imperative to provide a more 
      comprehensive view and control of SharePoint content,&#8221; said Keith 
      Zoellner, CTO of StoredIQ. &#8220;This new functionality will give inside 
      counsel confidence that they have found and captured all pertinent 
      information associated with each matter.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;SharePoint presents eDiscovery challenges because there is so much rich 
      information beyond just document libraries, which most SharePoint 
      solutions have focused on,&#8221; remarked Barry Murphy, founding principal of 
      eDiscovery Journal. &#8220;StoredIQ&#8217;s SharePoint solution goes beyond just 
      document libraries to address metadata capture and collection of new 
      content types such as wikis and blogs so they can be intelligible to the 
      legal reviewer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The updated connector is available immediately with the release of 
      StoredIQ 6.1.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said
on Tuesday that unplanned flaring on Monday at its 150,000
barrel per day (bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery in Torrance,
California, did not impact production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The flaring was caused by extra pressure on the refinery's
vapor recovery system," Exxon spokeswoman Aarti Ramachandran
said in a statement. "There was no impact to production. The
refinery is operating normally today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The refinery reported the flaring on Tuesday in a notice to
California pollution regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither the Exxon statement nor the regulatory notice said
what units were involved in the flaring.

		&lt;p&gt;
			ExxonMobil Announces Odoptu Production Startup at Sakhalin-1 Project 
      in Russia
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Field to Produce up to 11 Million Barrels of Oil in 2011
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today the startup of 
      production from the Odoptu field at the Sakhalin-1 project offshore 
      northeastern Russia. ExxonMobil subsidiary Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL) 
      is operator on behalf of the five-company international Sakhalin-1 
      Consortium.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Odoptu field is expected to add up to 11 million barrels (1.5 
      million tons) to Sakhalin-1 oil production in 2011. The startup is on 
      schedule and within development cost expectations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is yet another milestone in Sakhalin-1 project achievements,&#8221; said 
      Neil W. Duffin, president of ExxonMobil Development Company. &#8220;The 
      Sakhalin-1 project is one of the largest energy investments in Russia 
      and is a testament to international cooperation."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The project applies industry-leading technology to successfully operate 
      in a safe and environmentally responsible manner in one of the most 
      challenging sub-arctic environments in the world, while providing 
      important economic benefits to Russia,&#8221; said Duffin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Development of the Odoptu field has included world-class performance in 
      the drilling and completion of seven extended-reach wells. The 
      Sakhalin-1 project employs one of the world's most powerful land-based 
      rigs, which drilled horizontally under the Sea of Okhotsk to the Odoptu 
      oil reservoir over five miles (nine kilometers) offshore.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional activities in the development of Odoptu included the 
      construction of a new onshore oil and gas treatment facility and 
      flowline connection to the existing Chayvo onshore processing facility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Sakhalin-1 project includes the phased development of the Chayvo, 
      Odoptu and Arkutun-Dagi fields, with an estimated total resource of 2.3 
      billion barrels (307 million tons) of oil and 17 trillion cubic feet 
      (485 billion cubic meters) of natural gas. The Chayvo field, which was 
      the initial phase of the Sakhalin-1 project, began production in 2005.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Future project phases call for the development of the Arkutun-Dagi field 
      as well as expanded gas production and sales from the Chayvo field. 
      These later project developments will sustain production well into the 
      future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since startup, the Sakhalin-1 project has produced over 270 million 
      barrels (35.4 million tons) of oil for export to world markets. It also 
      has been a key supplier of over 210 billion cubic feet (6 billion cubic 
      meters) of associated natural gas to customers in Khabarovsk Krai, in 
      far eastern Russia, to heat homes and meet growing energy needs. The 
      project will continue to help meet future natural gas demand in this 
      region.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Sakhalin-1 Consortium includes ENL (30 percent interest); Sakhalin 
      Oil and Gas Development Co. Ltd. (SODECO, 30 percent); affiliates of 
      Rosneft, the Russian state-owned oil company, RN-Astra (8.5 percent), 
      Sakhalinmorneftegas-Shelf (11.5 percent) and Oil and Natural Gas 
      Corporation (ONGC) Videsh Ltd. (20 percent).
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Esri Joins Microsoft Effort to Improve Workflows for the Oil and Gas 
      Sector
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Esri is now participating in the Microsoft 
      Upstream Reference Architecture initiative, an endeavor to enhance 
      applications integration and interoperability for the upstream oil and 
      gas sector.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The initiative supports Microsoft's ongoing effort to enable 
      collaborative workflows and multivendor data accessibility across the 
      full exploration and production business life cycle. Esri will provide a 
      spatial foundation for geoscience applications interoperability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Esri's geographic information system (GIS) platform is used by petroleum 
      companies and vendors throughout the world, and Esri has established a 
      long track record of providing the spatial data management foundation 
      for oil and gas users. In collaborating with other Microsoft Upstream 
      Reference Architecture solution providers, Esri brings its geospatial 
      expertise and GIS capabilities to the initiative.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Management of the oilfield life cycle demands complete integration from 
      subsurface interpretation to production," said Ali Ferling, managing 
      director of Worldwide Oil and Gas Industry at Microsoft. "A flexible and 
      open IT foundation is critical in delivering a common, integrated 
      approach to digital oilfield operations. With its sole focus on 
      providing spatial data management capability, Esri will play an 
      important role in the realization of the Microsoft Upstream Reference 
      Architecture initiative, bringing the capability for full GIS 
      integration to initiative-enabled operations and production systems."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The initiative will provide participating organizations with an 
      invaluable road map to streamlining the implementation of integrated, 
      workflow-oriented, smart field operations technologies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Esri welcomes the growing Microsoft Upstream Reference Architecture 
      initiative and is pleased to join its ranks," said Geoff Wade, Esri's 
      global petroleum industry manager. "We look forward to providing a solid 
      spatial data 
      management foundation for the integrated upstream solutions platform 
      of tomorrow. Esri's ArcGIS system, the leading GIS platform in the 
      industry, will provide the stability and performance for initiative 
      participants to leverage with ease. We are confident that this 
      groundbreaking initiative will allow a more flexible, open approach to 
      integrating cloud-capable, domain-specific applications, and by so 
      doing, considerably improve operational workflows."

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer didn't get his maximum bonus for the last fiscal year, despite notching the company's highest ever sales, as he took a hit for missteps on phones and not moving fast enough to counter Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, 54, got a cash bonus of $670,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, equal to his salary, but only half of the maximum bonus payout, according to a filing with securities regulators on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company commended Ballmer for increasing sales 7 percent to a record $62.5 billion, cutting costs, launching the latest versions of Windows and Office, and pushing along cloud computing and gaming efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a discussion of Ballmer's pay in the company's annual proxy filing also referenced the "unsuccessful launch of the Kin phone, loss of market share in the company's mobile phone business, and the need for the company to pursue innovations to take advantage of new form factors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Kin -- a feature phone aimed at teenagers -- flopped this year and was dropped less than three months after launch with poor sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its Windows mobile phone software has been losing share sharply over the last few years to Apple's iPhone, Google Inc's (GOOG.O) Android and Research in Motion Ltd's RIM.TORIMM.O BlackBerry. It is now fourth in the U.S. market for smartphone operating systems with less than 12 percent, according to research firm comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has also been in the spotlight for the lack of any quick response to Apple's iPad -- a revolution in what the industry calls "form factor" -- which has sold more than 3 million since launching earlier this year. Ballmer said in July that slates and tablets running Windows would appear as soon as they are ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his bonus, Ballmer got a total direct pay package of $1.34 million for fiscal 2010, only about 6 percent higher than $1.26 million the year before. Microsoft froze base salaries for its top executives in the last fiscal year due to the uncertain economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft no longer issues stock options for employees, and at his own request, Ballmer gets no stock awards. He already owns 408 million shares, or 4.75 percent of the company, worth about $10 billion. He is the 16th richest American, according to Forbes magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

increasing sales 7 percent to a record $62.5 billion, cutting
costs, launching the latest versions of Windows and Office, and
pushing along cloud computing and gaming efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a discussion of Ballmer's pay in the company's annual
proxy filing also referenced the "unsuccessful launch of the
Kin phone, loss of market share in the company's mobile phone
business, and the need for the company to pursue innovations to
take advantage of new form factors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's Kin -- a feature phone aimed at teenagers --
flopped this year and was dropped less than three months after
launch with poor sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its Windows mobile phone software has been losing share
sharply over the last few years to Apple's iPhone, Google Inc's
(GOOG.O) Android and Research in Motion Ltd's RIM.TORIMM.O
BlackBerry. It is now fourth in the U.S. market for smartphone
operating systems with less than 12 percent, according to
research firm comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has also been in the spotlight for the lack of
any quick response to Apple's iPad -- a revolution in what the
industry calls "form factor" -- which has sold more than 3
million since launching earlier this year. Ballmer said in July
that slates and tablets running Windows would appear as soon as
they are ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With his bonus, Ballmer got a total direct pay package of
$1.34 million for fiscal 2010, only about 6 percent higher than
$1.26 million the year before. Microsoft froze base salaries
for its top executives in the last fiscal year due to the
uncertain economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft no longer issues stock options for employees, and
at his own request, Ballmer gets no stock awards. He already
owns 408 million shares, or 4.75 percent of the company, worth
about $10 billion. He is the 16th richest American, according
to Forbes magazine.

			Energizer&#8217;s Hostile Bid
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to a Bloomberg report, Energizer Holdings Inc. (NYSE: ENR), 
      a leading manufacturer and marketer of batteries, lighting and personal 
      care products, plans to acquire American Safety Razor Co. for $301 
      million in cash in a competitive bidding process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based in New Jersey, privately held American Safety Razor Co., a primary 
      competitor of Energizer, had gone bankrupt and filed for Chapter 11 
      (bankruptcy) in July as a result of increased competition in its shaving 
      products category.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      American Safety Razor sells shaving razors to drug stores such as Walgreen 
      Co. (NYSE: WAG) 
      under the store's own brand. The company was hard hit by the loss of an 
      important customer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) 
      in 2009. The company pointed out that under its current restructuring 
      efforts, it has accepted to sell its assets to its first-lien lenders, 
      led by UBS AG (NYSE: UBS), 
      for an undisclosed amount to call off the $244 million debt owned by the 
      company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Energizer&#8217;s offer price was made during a testimony in the U.S. 
      Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware . Energizer will be present at 
      the court hearing but management remained unavailable for any immediate 
      comment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      American Safety Razor pointed out that Energizer had breached its 
      previously signed non-disclosure agreement between the two parties. 
      According to American Safety, Energizer&#8217;s bid was too low and the 
      acquisition could attract antitrust issues. American Safety is seeking 
      permission by the court to reject Energizer&#8217;s bid in favor of a lower, 
      debt- for-equity offer from lenders, as per the Bloomberg report.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Acquisitions are an integral part of Energizer&#8217;s growth strategy. 
      Energizer Holdings has generated top-line growth through strategic 
      expansions (organic growth in the razor blade and battery businesses and 
      a number of acquisitions in personal care).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We remain upbeat about Energizer&#8217;s personal care division, which grew 
      entirely from acquisitions. The March 2003 acquisition of 
      Schick-Wilkinson Sword (SWS) business from Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), 
      the second largest global manufacturer of wet shave products for men and 
      women, was a major growth driver for the company. The acquisition helped 
      the company increase wet shave sales to $1.12 billion in 2009 from just 
      $625 million in 2002, a CAGR of 8.7%.

			Vorsite Announces New Cloud Service: vorApps for Microsoft SharePoint 
      Online
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Commercially Available Cloud Service from Vorsite Leverages the Power 
      of Microsoft
				SharePoint Online and Provides Users with 
      Email Enabled Information Management
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today&#8217;s ever-changing marketplace requires organizations to increase 
      efficiencies and react swiftly to opportunities and challenges. Many 
      companies are held back by their reliance on manual processes to store 
      and share information, resulting in lost productivity and delayed 
      results. A trusted cloud service that allows information flow and 
      real-time collaboration with co-workers and decision-makers is the most 
      sought after solution in business today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Evolution of Information Storage
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      vorApps for SharePoint Online delivers a cloud-based email enabled 
      information management solution leveraging the power of Microsoft 
      SharePoint Online. Through simple automation, knowledge can be 
      captured, searched, and accessed through Microsoft SharePoint. Instantly 
      your workers create an alternate secure location to shared inboxes. 
      Whether team members are in the next room or on the next continent, the 
      powerful combination of automation and storage drives business 
      efficiencies and builds a more agile organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Information Interaction at your Fingertips
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      vorApps makes everyday tasks easy and efficient. Public folders have 
      been around a long time and employees are used to interacting with them. 
      Imagine storing your communications in a public folder experience 
      directly from your e-mail solution. Imagine sending a fax directly to 
      Microsoft SharePoint instead of information going directly to your 
      desktop or lost in a shared inbox.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      vorApps for SharePoint Online features the ability to store incoming and 
      outgoing emails from familiar Microsoft SharePoint lists and document 
      libraries. This means when a team member receives or sends an email it 
      is instantly stored within Microsoft SharePoint and securely accessed by 
      anyone on the team. vorApps streamlines processes, provide document 
      security and promotes collaboration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About vorApps
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      vorApps delivers common sense cloud solutions which interact with 
      critical business applications. By utilizing the best combination of the 
      Microsoft Cloud Technologies and Vorsite 
      solutions, Vorsite is at the forefront of delivering cloud applications 
      that solve the challenges businesses face today.

			Arrow ECS Launches Skill Builder for IBM Resellers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Arrow Enterprise Computing Solutions, a business segment of Arrow 
      Electronics Inc. [NYSE: ARW], has launched an online training tool that 
      enables resellers to track their firm&#8217;s &#8211; and individual team members&#8217; &#8211; 
      progress toward gaining skills and obtaining certifications to sell more 
      IBM solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dubbed the Skill Builder, the tool features a comprehensive curriculum 
      of step-by-step instructions for becoming an IBM reseller, gaining 
      certifications to sell and configure IBM technology, selling into 
      specific vertical markets and other areas of expertise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Skill Builder provides a roadmap for the certification and training 
      courses that are available to resellers,&#8221; said Mark Taylor, vice 
      president of Arrow ECS&#8217; IBM group. &#8220;In addition, this tool makes it 
      easier for resellers to track their team&#8217;s progress toward completing 
      courses and building their skills.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The curriculum includes not only sales and technical coursework but also 
      resources for marketing, business development, financing and other 
      functional areas. Additional curriculum, such as industry-specific 
      training to assist resellers with increasing their expertise in 
      verticals including health care, finance, manufacturing, services and 
      retail, will be continually added.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The coursework is self-paced and can be completed wherever and whenever 
      an Internet connection is available. The tracking feature enables both 
      individual staff and team managers to monitor progress toward completing 
      the coursework for use with evaluating personnel performance and 
      identifying the team&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re intensely focused on helping resellers deepen their skills and 
      competencies as a key source of competitive advantage and growth,&#8221; said 
      Ayman Antoun, vice president, business partners and midmarket, North 
      America, IBM. &#8220;The Arrow ECS Skill Builder tool delivers targeted 
      learning for users based on specific platforms, levels and solution 
      areas, providing additional opportunities for resellers to build skills 
      and deliver increased value to clients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;One of the most important tasks for us has been building training plans 
      for multiple programs involving multiple employees, as well as tracking 
      and maintaining coordination between our internal team&#8217;s progress and 
      IBM&#8217;s records,&#8221; said Diana Hales, director, vendor relations and 
      enablement, InfoSystems Inc. &#8220;Skill Builder enables us to not only build 
      plans for each team member, but also look at our company as a whole to 
      ensure we are meeting the goals set in our IBM Partner Plan &#8211; all in one 
      place.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Skill Builder not only enables InfoSystems to build training plans, but 
      assists in every step, from planning our strategy for enablement through 
      to coordination and communication of meeting or exceeding program 
      requirements,&#8221; Hales said. &#8220;Better enablement within our team &#8216;on their 
      terms&#8217; has permitted us to attain certifications and IBM Partner Points 
      more quickly. Skill Builder&#8217;s reporting has also allowed better 
      communication with the IBM teams regarding our skill sets, strengths and 
      market focus.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Skill Builder is just one of the many valuable tools, such as SmartCart, 
      solutions labs and the MPower program, offered to help Arrow ECS 
      resellers grow their business. Visit http://ecs.arrow.com/ibmgroup/

Electric Company, Intel Corp., Nokia Corp. and Sprint Nextel Corp.

    As its parent company's pending merger with NBC Universal continues at a
languid pace, the recently reorganized Comcast Interactive Media is
continuing to shift executives into new roles. There is a lively debate
occurring about how seriously to take Intel's efforts to expand beyond
its core market for personal computer chips into chips and software for
handheld and other devices. Doubts that Intel will succeed in the newer
and faster-growing field could keep its stock down. Nokia has started
shipping the Nokia N8 after receiving a record number of online
pre-orders for its latest smartphone. Clearwire Corp. said the three
Sprint Nextel Corp. executives serving on its board have stepped down,
potentially clearing the path for Clearwire to strike a deal.

			Coca-Cola Bottler will Expand in Bishopville, SC
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Plans to Invest $4.5 Million
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      South Atlantic Canners, today announced that they will expand operations 
      in Lee County. The company expects to invest $4.5 million in the course 
      of its expansion. South Atlantic Canners is the largest Coca-Cola 
      production facility in South Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The addition to our warehouse is important to our business and I am 
      excited to begin this expansion,&#8221; said Charles Ingram, chairman of South 
      Atlantic Canners Board of Directors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;During these difficult economic times, I am grateful for an investment 
      of this magnitude from our company. This expansion reinforces the 
      commitment Coca-Cola has to Lee County and South Carolina. It is my hope 
      that this warehouse addition will have a positive impact on future 
      economic development,&#8221; said Troy Santoscoy, plant manager of South 
      Atlantic Canners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      South Atlantic Canners&#8217; expansion of its Bishopville facility will bring 
      the factory&#8217;s total square footage to 300,000, increasing the warehouse 
      capacity by 50 percent. The company expects to begin preliminary work on 
      the expansion in the fourth quarter of this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This expansion is positive news for Lee County and demonstrates South 
      Atlantic Canner&#8217;s commitment to the Pee Dee region. The company&#8217;s 
      decision to invest in its Lee County operations with equipment upgrades 
      will increase the competitiveness of this facility. As well, our state&#8217;s 
      focus on the business fundamentals, such as low regulatory and tax 
      burdens, provides a business-friendly climate that will help South 
      Atlantic Canner over the long-term. We congratulate South Atlantic 
      Canners and wish the company much success,&#8221; said Joe Taylor, Secretary 
      of Commerce.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are grateful for Coke&#8217;s decision to expand in Lee County. We value 
      and appreciate what Coke has done, is doing and will do in Lee County 
      and look forward to their continued growth in our community,&#8221; said Lee 
      County Councilman Gordon Eckley.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      South Atlantic Canners has operated for more than 25 years, with its 
      original Lee County plant opening in 1974. The company has expanded 
      several times since then, and has partnered with Charlotte-based 
      Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated. The plant now has four production 
      lines making Coke products in cans, 10 oz. bottles, 20 oz. bottles, 
      half-liter bottles and two-liter bottles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated is the second largest Coca-Cola 
      bottler in the United States. The company is a leader in manufacturing, 
      selling, and distributing soft drinks. With corporate offices in 
      Charlotte, N.C., the company does business in the Southeastern United 
      States. Consolidated has one of the highest per capita soft drink 
      consumption rates in the world and manages franchise territories with a 
      consumer base of more than eighteen million people. Coca-Cola Bottling 
      Co. Consolidated makes, sells, and delivers carbonated and noncarbonated 
      beverages, primarily products of The Coca-Cola Company. For more

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates Alameda JPA, California's Lease Rev Bonds 'AA-'; Upgrades 
      Outstanding Lease Rev Bonds
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to Alameda County Joint 
      Powers Authority, California:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$320 million lease revenue bonds (multiple capital projects), 2010 
      series A (taxable), B (taxable), and C (tax-exempt) 'AA-'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bonds are to be sold via negotiation during the week of Oct. 11, 
      2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Fitch has upgraded the following ratings:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$136.8 million Alameda County Joint Powers Authority, California lease 
      revenue bonds, series 2004D (juvenile justice facility) and 2008A 
      (juvenile justice facility) to 'AA-' from 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$47.8 million California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank 
      (I-Bank) revenue bonds, series 2004 (Alameda County Department of Social 
      Services Administration Building) to 'A+' from 'A'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is revised to Stable from Positive.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING RATIONALE:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The upgrade reflects Alameda County's ongoing enhancement of its very 
      strong general fund balances and reserves, protection of its high 
      property development fund level, and commitment to balanced budgets 
      despite current economic pressures. Additional financial flexibility is 
      maintained in large reserves outside the general fund but available, if 
      needed, to support operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The county benefits from a large, diverse economy with very low 
      taxpayer concentration, an affluent tax base, and relatively resilient 
      property tax base.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Its debt burden is expected to remain low to moderate in the future as 
      debt is issued for the county's Highland Hospital replacement project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --While the county routinely makes its annually required pension 
      contributions, the county is not directly liable for pension system debt 
      and its employees' other post-employment benefits are subject to funding 
      availability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --While the county relies heavily on federal and state funding, both of 
      which are under pressure, it takes a conservative budgeting approach to 
      these funding sources to minimize the impacts of state budget 
      uncertainty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The lease revenue bonds are secured by essential assets under a 
      standard lease structure with good bondholder protections.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The one-notch rating distinction between the I-Bank revenue bonds and 
      the Joint Powers Authority lease revenue bonds acknowledges that the 
      county will not own the social services administration building at the 
      end of its lease term, thereby reducing the incentive to meet fully its 
      lease rental payment obligations. Nevertheless, strong incentives to 
      continue meeting its full lease rental payment obligations remain by the 
      essential nature of the services provided in the social services 
      administration building.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Maintenance of financial strength in the face of ongoing economic as 
      well as federal and state funding pressures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Economic stability in the near term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SECURITY:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The lease revenue bonds are secured by the county's lease rental 
      payments to the authority, subject to annual appropriation by the 
      county. The I-Bank revenue bonds are secured by the county's operating 
      rental payments to the North County Center for Self Sufficiency 
      Corporation, subject to annual appropriation by the county.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CREDIT SUMMARY:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The series 2010 bonds will finance some of the costs associated with the 
      Alameda County Medical Center Highland General Hospital rebuild project 
      ($668 million, completion due 2017). They will be repaid by the county's 
      general fund lease rental payments for use and occupancy of 39 existing 
      essential facilities valued at approximately $343 million. Highland 
      Hospital is not part of the current lease and the county's obligation to 
      make lease rental payments is not subject to project completion. The 
      county covenants to budget and appropriate the lease rental payments. 
      Good bondholder protections include a debt service reserve, earthquake 
      and rental interruption insurance, no right to terminate the leases, and 
      re-entry and re-letting provisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The I-Bank bonds are repaid by the county via operating rental payments 
      to the North County Center for Self Sufficiency Corporation for the 
      30-year operating lease of the county's social services delivery 
      facility and headquarters. The county has covenanted to budget and 
      appropriate annually for its operating rental payments, all of which 
      have been made directly to the trustee without impairment as scheduled. 
      The asset is essential and has been occupied by the county since 
      November 2005, and there is a low likelihood of the county ceasing to 
      lease it due to the cost and difficulty of building an alternative urban 
      facility. The non-traditional lease structure uses an operating lease 
      and modified gross payment to maximize federal subvention payments. 
      While the county will not own the facility upon retirement of all debt, 
      it can opt to purchase the facility at any time. Bondholders have the 
      deed of trust, the right to re-enter and re-let the property, and in the 
      event of non-payment, the ability to sue the county for unpaid rent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Alameda County is the largest county in the San Francisco Bay Area, with 
      a population of approximately 1.6 million and a large, diverse economic 
      base. While the county has experienced economic contraction, income 
      levels remain above-average and its tax base has proven relatively 
      resilient, reflecting less of a run-up in values than other Californian 
      counties. The county's very stable board and administration has remained 
      committed to conservative financial management policies and practices. 
      Consequently, even during the recent economic contraction, the county 
      has continued to build up its general fund balances and reserves. At 
      June 30, 2009, the county had a high unreserved general fund balance of 
      $618.2 million (34% of spending) and reserves of $246.4 million. These 
      figures are estimated to have grown to $630 million and $300 million, 
      respectively, at June 30, 2010. The county has also demonstrated fiscal 
      discipline, carefully protecting its property development fund ($311.8 
      million at Aug. 31, 2010), using only that fund's interest earnings for 
      debt repayment. While the county is vulnerable to state funding impacts, 
      its conservative budget practices ensure that it typically does not have 
      to reopen its budget to accommodate state funding decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The county's pension system is operated by a separate organization, the 
      Alameda County Employees' Retirement Association (ACERA), which is 
      approximately 81% funded. The county always fully funds its 
      ACERA-determined annually required pension contributions and believes 
      projected pension contribution increases will be manageable. Other 
      post-employment benefits are subject to available funding and are not 
      regarded as vested benefits by either the county or ACERA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net direct debt is a low $736 per capita, or 0.6% of market valuation. 
      Overall net debt is a moderate $4,395 per capita, or 3.4% of market 
      valuation. The planned $450 million in Highland Hospital project debt 
      issuances over the next five years will not significantly alter the per 
      capita debt ratios. Debt amortization is slow, in part because of 
      backloading the series 2010 bonds to take maximum advantage of federal 
      Build America Bond and recovery economic development bond subsidies and 
      historically low long-term interest rates to hedge against future higher 
      borrowing costs. Based on the current financing plan, subsequent debt 
      issuances will backfill with shorter maturities.

      environments. &#8220;The additional backup application and data source 
      capabilities further expand the range of environments and 
      industry-leading applications supported by ExaGrid,&#8221; said Marc Crespi, 
      ExaGrid VP of Product Management. &#8220;An even broader range of customers 
      can now achieve their backup goals with the fastest, most scalable disk 
      appliance while also integrating quickly and easily with their existing 
      infrastructures.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fabrice Tourre, a central figure in a controversial Goldman Sachs Group Inc transaction, asked a judge to throw out a U.S. regulator's fraud lawsuit against him, 2-1/2 months after the bank settled its part of the case for $550 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citing a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Tourre said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission case must be dismissed because the 2007 "Abacus" transaction, which involved collateralized debt obligations tied to subprime mortgages, took place outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court, in the case Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd, ruled in June that Australian shareholders who bought that bank's stock outside the United States could not raise securities fraud claims in U.S. courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several judges have since applied the ruling to bar U.S. lawsuits in other scenarios, including where the plaintiffs are not foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC lawsuit accused Goldman and Tourre, a vice president, of misleading investors about Abacus by failing to reveal that the hedge fund Paulson  Co helped choose the underlying securities and bet against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a filing late Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, Tourre said Abacus did not involve a purchase or sale in the United States or a security listed on a U.S. exchange, as required under Morrison's "transactional test."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing 10 million pages of documents the SEC turned over in August and September, he said the CDOs were not listed on any exchange, and their sole investor was Germany's IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, which invested overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Morrison ruling "makes clear that the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws can be applied if, and only if, the securities transaction at issue takes place in the United States," Tourre said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The complaint fails," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Nester declined to discuss the filing. He said the agency plans to file a response within 14 days. Pamela Chepiga, a partner at Allen  Overy LLP who represents Tourre, declined to comment, her assistant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre remains a Goldman employee but is on paid leave, spokesman Michael DuVally said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman settled with the SEC on July 16 without admitting wrongdoing. U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones approved that accord and is handling the Tourre case. Tourre is the only Goldman employee sued individually by the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs  Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Buyout firm CVC CVC.UL is poised to receive preliminary bids for Mivisa MIVIS.UL, the Spanish food-can maker which it hopes will fetch 1 to 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 to $1.6 billion), people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential sale underscores an improving market for the sale of industrial companies exposed to swings in the economy. First-round bids are due on Friday, the people said, and are likely to come from both rival private equity firms and competing packaging companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Mivisa touted as a candidate for an initial public offering (IPO) earlier this year, it also highlights a trend of private equity firms opting to sell portfolio companies rather than brave rocky public markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity suitors could include major U.S. firms such as Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), the Carlyle Group CYL.UL and Apollo Management LP APOLO.UL, some of the people said. Apollo earlier this year lost out in a bidding war for Pactiv Corp PTV.N, the U.S. maker of Hefty trash bags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackstone, Carlyle and CVC declined to comment. Apollo and Mivisa could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mivisa's listed peers include Silgan Holdings Inc (SLGN.O), based in Woodland Hills, California, which says it is the largest metal food-can supplier in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGH-YIELD BONDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based in Murcia in south-eastern Spain, Mivisa does not disclose financial information. However, one of the people familiar with the matter said it had an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin of more than 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current EBITDA is about 125 to 130 million euros, this person said -- meaning CVC is seeking somewhere between 7.7 and 9.6 times this earnings number. Last year's sales totaled $691.45 million, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of the potential deal comes days after Doughty Hanson  Co DOUHA.UL agreed to sell metal-packaging firm Impress, which it had owned since 1997, to privately owned Irish glassmaker Ardagh Glass ARDG.UL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ardagh, whose biggest shareholder is chairman Paul Coulson, has immediately moved to refinance the 1.7 billion euro deal with high-yield bonds in dollars and euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mivisa, founded by Spain's Vivancos family in 1972, has already spent nearly a decade in private equity hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was acquired by Impala Capital Partners in 2001, who later brought in PAI Partners. The duo then sold Mivisa to CVC in 2005 in a deal that placed an enterprise value of 527 million euros on the company, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007 Mivisa took out new loans totaling 662 million euros, Thomson Reuters Loan Pricing Corp (LPC) data show, to fund a dividend payment to CVC and further growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May Dow Jones reported CVC had put Mivisa up for sale but said it had not abandoned listing plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Alasdair Reilly with Andres Gonzalez and Judy MacInnes in Madrid; Editing by David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.7362 Euro)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * SEC to file response within 14 days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Goldman settled with SEC in July for $550 million&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Fabrice Tourre, a central

not foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC lawsuit accused Goldman and Tourre, a vice
president, of misleading investors about Abacus by failing to
reveal that the hedge fund Paulson  Co helped choose the
underlying securities and bet against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a filing late Wednesday in Manhattan federal court,
Tourre said Abacus did not involve a purchase or sale in the
United States or a security listed on a U.S. exchange, as
required under Morrison's "transactional test."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citing 10 million pages of documents the SEC turned over in
August and September, he said the CDOs were not listed on any
exchange, and their sole investor was Germany's IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG IKBG.DE, which invested overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Morrison ruling "makes clear that the antifraud
provisions of the federal securities laws can be applied if,
and only if, the securities transaction at issue takes place in
the United States," Tourre said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The complaint fails," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEC spokesman John Nester declined to discuss the filing.
He said the agency plans to file a response within 14 days.
Pamela Chepiga, a partner at Allen  Overy LLP who represents
Tourre, declined to comment, her assistant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tourre remains a Goldman employee but is on paid leave,
spokesman Michael DuVally said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman settled with the SEC on July 16 without admitting
wrongdoing. U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones approved that
accord and is handling the Tourre case. Tourre is the only
Goldman employee sued individually by the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs  Co et al, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-03229.

&lt;p&gt; * First-round bids said to be due Friday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Blackstone, Carlyle, "strategic" bidders seen circling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds detail on earnings and sales, previous owners, loans)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Quentin Webb and Simon Meads&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Buyout firm CVC [CVC.UL] is
poised to receive preliminary bids for Mivisa [MIVIS.UL], the
Spanish food-can maker which it hopes will fetch 1 to 1.2
billion euros ($1.4 to $1.6 billion), people familiar with the
matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The potential sale underscores an improving market for the
sale of industrial companies exposed to swings in the economy.
First-round bids are due on Friday, the people said, and are
likely to come from both rival private equity firms and
competing packaging companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Mivisa touted as a candidate for an initial public
offering (IPO) earlier this year, it also highlights a trend of
private equity firms opting to sell portfolio companies rather
than brave rocky public markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity suitors could include major U.S. firms such
as Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), the Carlyle Group [CYL.UL] and
Apollo Management LP [APOLO.UL], some of the people said. Apollo
earlier this year lost out in a bidding war for Pactiv Corp
PTV.N, the U.S. maker of Hefty trash bags.
 Blackstone, Carlyle and CVC declined to comment. Apollo and
Mivisa could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mivisa's listed peers include Silgan Holdings Inc (SLGN.O),
based in Woodland Hills, California, which says it is the
largest metal food-can supplier in North America.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HIGH-YIELD BONDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based in Murcia in south-eastern Spain, Mivisa does not
disclose financial information. However, one of the people
familiar with the matter said it had an earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin of
more than 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current EBITDA is about 125 to 130 million euros, this
person said -- meaning CVC is seeking somewhere between 7.7 and
9.6 times this earnings number. Last year's sales totalled
$691.45 million, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News of the potential deal comes days after Doughty Hanson 
Co [DOUHA.UL] agreed to sell metal-packaging firm Impress, which
it had owned since 1997, to privately owned Irish glassmaker
Ardagh Glass [ARDG.UL].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ardagh, whose biggest shareholder is chairman Paul Coulson,
has immediately moved to refinance the 1.7 billion euro deal
with high-yield bonds in dollars and euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mivisa, founded by Spain's Vivancos family in 1972, has
already spent nearly a decade in private equity hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was acquired by Impala Capital Partners in 2001, who
later brought in PAI Partners. The duo then sold Mivisa to CVC
in 2005 in a deal that placed an enterprise value of 527 million
euros on the company, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2007 Mivisa took out new loans totalling 662 million
euros, Thomson Reuters Loan Pricing Corp (LPC) data show, to
fund a dividend payment to CVC and further growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In May Dow Jones reported CVC had put Mivisa up for sale but
said it had not abandoned listing plans.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co made overtures to two senior executives from rival IBM in its search for a new chief executive, but was rebuffed, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early stages of a closely watched CEO hunt, now into its sixth week, HP reached out to Steve Mills, who leads IBM's software and systems group, according to two sources with knowledge of the approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virginia Rometty, who oversees sales, marketing and strategy for IBM and ranked by Fortune as being among America's most powerful businesswomen, was also approached, one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive search firm Spencer Stuart is leading the effort to replace Mark Hurd, who was popular with Wall Street but ousted in an abrupt and controversial manner in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP has said it was looking externally and internally for candidates to helm the world's top technology company by sales, but the company is under some pressure to name a new chief quickly to fill its leadership vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP's board may be looking to attract a marquee name as it aims to convince investors it can drive future growth. But both declined to be considered for the job, the sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives from HP and IBM declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HP's board's search committee is led by John Hammergren, and includes directors Marc Andreessen, Laurence Babbio Jr., and Joel Hyatt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading internal candidates include Todd Bradley, who leads HP's high-volume but low-margin PC division. He is viewed as a strong operational manager, but some board members are worried about his strategic vision, one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source added that others were concerned because Hurd had been seen as major supporter of Bradley's, one of Hurd's first hires when he came onboard in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ann Livermore, the enterprise chief and 30-year HP veteran whose name has been floated also for the CEO job, is seen as a less likely candidate. She was passed over twice for the top job, which went to first Carly Fiorina in 1999 and then Hurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And analysts say Dave Donatelli, who runs HP's servers, storage and networking business, is considered a rising star at HP but may not yet be experienced enough to run the entire company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP has been criticized by some investors and analysts for its poor handling of Hurd's exit, for overspending in an acquisition spree, and not allocating enough on research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, HP issued a fiscal 2011 forecast that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company used its analyst meeting to emphasize its growth prospects and the investments its making in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in HP closed up 2.2 percent at $42.53 on Wednesday but are still down about 8 percent since Hurd resigned in early August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gabriel Madway, Ritsuko Ando and Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Kenneth Li, Edwin Chan and Lincoln Feast.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Electronics said on Thursday it had signed a partnership deal with Microsoft on cloud computing and virtualization, hot IT technologies aimed at helping business cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the pact, LG will introduce monitors integrated with Microsoft software. The monitors will function as virtual computers, allowing multiple users to run programs off a single standard PC, LG said. Virtualization refers to technology that allows one computer to perform the work of many machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alliance will primarily target the market for virtualization solutions for educational institutions, aiming to become a leader in the segment with a 25 percent share in 2012. The segment is expected to grow by more than 50 percent every year, reaching 6 million units in 2012 and 20 million units in 2015, LG said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LG and Microsoft will also team up to introduce monitors for cloud computing, a technology that allows users to access data and software over the Internet.

&lt;p&gt;   * Regulatory risks seen a concern for investors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * ICBC says Goldman remains strategic partner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * ICBC HK shares drop 3 pct to 3-week low&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Goldman upsized sell-down - term sheet
 (Adds details of stake sale, analyst quotes, share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Victoria Bi and Sui-Lee Wee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' $2.3
billion stake reduction in ICBC comes amid a shaky outlook for
the Chinese lender, whose shares have slumped this year with no
immediate signs of a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (1398.HK) attempted
to build confidence on Thursday, saying the Wall Street titan
remained a strategic partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale comes after a lock-up restriction expired in April
and after a roughly 10 percent decline in ICBC's stock this
year, underperforming Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index
.HSI, which has risen about 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulatory risks, coupled with ICBC's upcoming rights
offering, also underscore the factors behind Goldman's
selldown, which is expected to continue in chunks over the next
few years, having sold down $2 billion stakes twice in the last
16 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chinese regulators could raise the minimum amount banks
must keep in reserve against future losses to 15 percent from
10 percent now and investors fear such a move could prompt
another round of fundraising, said Patrick Pong, analyst with
Mirae Asset Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Potentially, there could be some more disposals next
year," said Pong of Goldman's ICBC stake. "If you look at the
fundamentals of ICBC, there are some issues with the outlook."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's sale cuts its stake in ICBC (601398.SS) to around
3 percent from 3.9 percent. German insurer Allianz (ALVG.DE)
Group and U.S. credit card company American Express (AXP.N)
also have significant stakes in ICBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, Hong Kong-listed shares of ICBC fell 3 percent
to HK$5.79, a three-week low. It was the second-biggest loser
on the benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI, which was flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest bank by market capitalisation was the
most actively traded stock in Hong Kong, with 530 million
shares changing hands at 2.3 times their 30-day average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The overhang on the stock will continue. There are some
policy risks," said Mirae's Pong, adding, however, that ICBC's
valuation looks attractive on a price-to-earnings and
price-to-book basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STRATEGIC PARTNER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stake sale -- the second for Goldman after one in June
2009 -- comes ahead of ICBC's upcoming rights offering, in
which shares will be sold at a discount and will dilute the
holdings of existing shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 2.75 billion shares that were being sold as of
Wednesday were priced at HK$5.70-HK$5.79 each, a 3-4.5 percent
discount, according to a term sheet obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The offering was upsized to 3.04 billion shares, which was
quickly snapped up at a 3.9 percent discount of HK$5.74 per
share, according to another term sheet obtained by Reuters on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC said on Thursday there was no change to its strategic
partnership with Goldman, which, along with ICBC International
Capital, served as a financial adviser to ICBC in the
privatisation of its Asia unit in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ICBC investment for Goldman has been hugely profitable.
The value of Goldman's stake before the share sale was more
than $10 billion, well above the original $2.58 billion the New
York investment bank invested in 2006, when the Chinese bank
was just coming off a government bailout and was about to go
public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the sale, Goldman still holds 10.4 billion shares in
ICBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early in 2009, Goldman pledged to keep 80 percent of its
ICBC stake until April 2010. Under an earlier lockup agreement,
Goldman would have been permitted to sell half of its stake in
the state-controlled bank in April 2009 and the rest that
October.

      Healthy Kids, Healthy Families! Disney Launches Magic of Healthy 
      Living
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Innovative Campaign Expands on Disney&#8217;s Partnership With Parents
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walt Disney Company today launched Disney Magic of Healthy Living 
      &#8211; a national multimedia initiative designed to partner with parents 
      in their quest to raise healthy, happy kids. The initiative, which 
      includes public service announcements featuring First Lady Michelle 
      Obama and young Disney stars, builds on the Company&#8217;s commitment to a 
      healthier generation of kids begun in 2006 with the announcement of 
      landmark nutritional guidelines associating Disney brands and characters 
      with a more nutritionally balanced range of foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Disney Magic of Healthy Living takes that commitment to the next 
      level enlisting many of the Company&#8217;s assets and platforms to inspire 
      kids and help reinforce the work of parents. New content showcases fun, 
      easy ways that healthy living practices can be woven into the fabric of 
      everyday life.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are very proud to take the next step in our long-term commitment to 
      helping families achieve healthier lifestyles, and are 
      especially&#160;gratified to work with the First Lady on the Let&#8217;s 
      Move! campaign,&#8221; said Disney President and CEO Bob Iger. &#8220;The health 
      of our kids is critically important and we are pleased to be doing our 
      part to encourage smart eating and exercise.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am thrilled to join Disney&#8217;s Magic of Healthy Living effort 
      and support the work these young people are doing to reach out to their 
      peers and communicate this powerful message,&#8221; said First Lady Michelle 
      Obama. &#8220;Earlier this year, I launched&#160;Let&#8217;s Move!&#160;with the 
      goal of reducing childhood obesity rates in a generation, and through 
      this Disney program, we are able to carry that goal directly to kids &#8211; 
      the key stakeholders in this effort. I hope through programs like the Magic 
      of Healthy Living, young people are inspired to take control of 
      their own health, fitness and nutrition and engage their families, 
      schools and communities to do the same.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights of Disney Magic of Healthy Living include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        A year-long series of inspirational television public service 
        announcements featuring Mrs. Obama and Disney Channel stars including 
        Nick Jonas (&#8220;JONAS L.A.&#8221; and &#8220;Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam&#8221;) and Brenda 
        Song (&#8220;The Suite Life On Deck&#8221; and &#8220;Pass the Plate&#8221;) among others. The 
        PSAs will be presented daily on Disney Channel, Disney XD, Radio 
        Disney and Disney.com. They will also be featured on ABC in addition 
        to being distributed through the Ad Council&#8217;s network of 1,700 
        broadcast, network, and local cable stations for use in donated media.*
      
			
        Two new web sites from Disney: one to engage and activate kids about 
        healthy living (Disney.com/healthyfun) 
        and another to provide ideas and resources for parents (Family.com/healthymagic).
      
			
        A national essay contest calling on kids to write about ideas for 
        living a healthy life at home, at school or in their communities. The 
        contest will open for entries next month and will culminate in a
				special 
        Disney Magic of Healthy Living &#8211; The Weekend event at Walt 
        Disney World Resort for 50 winners from across the U.S. For more 
        information, visit Disney.com/healthyfun.
      
		
		
			
        A $1 million grant from Disney will help to build play spaces and 
        gardens in 10 underserved communities nationwide. Disney will be 
        working closely with KaBOOM!, a renowned non-profit 
        organization whose vision it is to have a great place to play within 
        walking distance of every child.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Magic of Healthy Living is a great example of putting 
      behavioral research into action to inspire children and families to make 
      small, incremental lifestyle changes to improve their health and 
      well-being,&#8221; said Dr. James O. Hill, Professor of Pediatrics and 
      Medicine and Director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the 
      University of Colorado. &#8220;With this initiative, Disney has shown 
      commitment to the health of our children. And best of all, who better 
      than Disney to make it fun!&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Through the Magic of Healthy Living, Disney continues building 
      on the leadership of its landmark nutrition guidelines by illustrating 
      how national health goals can be translated into simple and fun 
      activities that can be embraced for a lifetime,&#8221; said Dr. Keith Ayoob, 
      Associate Clinical Professor of Pediatrics at the Albert Einstein 
      College of Medicine. &#8220;The program celebrates Disney&#8217;s ongoing commitment 
      to helping parents and children truly enjoy healthy living by offering 
      them a wide variety of activities and tools, empowering them to find 
      those that work best for their family. That&#8217;s the best way to make a 
      healthy lifestyle last forever.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since 2006, Disney&#8217;s nutritional guidelines have been implemented across 
      all Disney-branded businesses. Company progress to date includes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        A growing portfolio of &#8220;better for you&#8221; Disney-branded foods at 
        grocery retailers including more than 1.3 billion servings of fruits 
        and vegetables sold in the United States alone.
      
			
        Embedded healthy lifestyle themes in Disney Channel and Disney XD 
        programming (available in 99 million and 77 million homes respectively 
        across the U.S.
				and to millions of viewers on Disney Channels 
        around the world).
      
			
        Healthier food options to choose from in Disney parks including fruits 
        for snacking, the elimination of added trans fats** and healthier 
        default sides and beverages that families opt for in nearly 60% of 
        kids&#8217; meals.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to working with First Lady Michelle Obama in support of her Let&#8217;s 
      Move! initiative, Disney consulted with leaders in the fields of 
      nutrition, health care and fitness to help develop Disney Magic of 
      Healthy Living. These include: The Advertising Council, The 
      Institute of Medicine and Produce for Better Health Foundation. Dr. 
      Keith Ayoob and Dr. James O. Hill, top child health and wellness 
      specialists that helped develop Disney&#8217;s 2006 Food Guidelines, were also 
      consulted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
