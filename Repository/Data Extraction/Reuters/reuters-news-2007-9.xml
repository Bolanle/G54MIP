&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds Sondex CFO, GE comment, detail, shares)    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By John Bowker &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. conglomerate General Electric Co. (GE.N) has agreed to buy British maker of oilfield services equipment Sondex Plc SDX.L for 288.7 million pounds &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($583.1 million) in cash, the two companies said on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    General Electric, whose interests span technology, media, energy and financial services, will pay 460 pence a share for Sondex, which designs, makes and markets electro-mechanical based equipment for oilfield service companies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    That is 35.5 percent above Sondex's closing share price on Aug. 30, the day before it announced it was in takeover talks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sondex shares were up 7.5 percent at 454.25 pence by 0752 GMT.  Sondex Finance Director Chris Wilks told Reuters that he and Chief Executive Martin Perry would be staying with the company, and would urge GE to make additional acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "GE buys 100 companies a year -- it's pretty acquisitive -- and we want to convince them to spend more money in our space," he said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He added that the company would also look to expand its presence in China, where it has around 10 staff but GE has far more. "We can use GE's resources world-wide to tackle market penetration," he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    GE is buying Sondex through its U.S.-based Optimization and Control business -- an oilfield-services specialist -- which generates turnover of about $1.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A spokesman for GE in Europe said this was the division's first venture outside the United States, but would not comment on whether it was a one-off or the start of an acquisition run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    GE said it had irrevocable undertakings and non-binding letters of intent in favour of the bid from 44.2 percent of shareholders, and Chris Wilks said he would be surprised if another bid came in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He said the group had originally received two separate approaches -- including the one from GE -- and had sounded out other potential buyers before agreeing the 460 pence deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Of the small group we approached, GE was the highest -- not by a massive margin but still the highest. Will another party that we didn't approach come forward? You never say never but I would be surprised," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sondex's share price has risen to the offer level of 460 pence from a flotation price of just 100 pence in 2003 -- but Wilks denied the company was unjustly blocking shareholders from the next phase of growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Yes, we could have continued that level of growth into the future but with growth like that there is risk. This is a discount to that risk," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    GE's Optimization and Control unit is part of GE Energy, which contributed around $12 billion of the $163.4 billion sales generated by the group in total last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  ((Editing by Quentin Bryar; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Reuters Messaging: rm://john.bowker.reuters.com@reuters.net &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tel: +44 20 7542 7717, Fax: +44 20 7542 8454)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ($1=.4951 Pound)   Keywords: SONDEX GENERAL ELECTRIC/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has lost a vote to have its Office Open XML document format approved as an international standard, dashing the company's hopes of wider adoption of the standard by public-sector organisations.  The result of the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) ballot was hailed as a victory for open standards by supporters of the rival Open Document Format, who argued the Microsoft format was not open, but a ploy to lock in users.  Microsoft's Office Open XML (OOXML) is the default file-saving format in Microsoft Office 2007. The widely used Open Document Format (ODF) is already an international standard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft argues that its format has higher specifications and is more useful than ODF, while opponents say Open XML's 6,000 pages of code compared with ODF's 860 pages make it artificially complicated and untranslatable into other formats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The ISO said in a statement on Tuesday that 53 percent of the votes cast by national standards bodies were in favour of Microsoft, missing the necessary two-thirds majority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Twenty-six percent of national votes cast were against approving Open XML in the five-month ballot process, in which 104 national member bodies were entitled to vote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Comments that national bodies submitted with their votes will now be discussed at a meeting in February 2008, at which the parties will try to find a consensus on modifications that may encourage members to change their mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    If the necessary two-thirds majority is not met after that the proposal, which was submitted under a fast-track procedure will be judged to have failed. Microsoft may still resubmit under the normal procedural rules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The ODF Alliance said in a statement on Tuesday that the large number of "no" votes "demonstrates the depth of concern around the world over OOXML's interoperability and openness." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Microsoft has every right to seek the ISO label for OOXML, but, as the ballot results show, it has a long way to go before it earns it and can be considered a truly open, interoperable document format," it said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Georgina Prodhan, editing by Leslie Gevirtz; Frankfurt newsroom +4969 7565 1265; georgina.prodhan@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: georgina.prodhan.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: MICROSOFT FORMAT/VOTE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds more comments from Mount, updates shares) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Tuesday that it is "not unreasonable" for the company to introduce a mobile phone combined with features of its Zune digital music player to compete with Apple Inc.'s (AAPL.O) iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Zune phone, a topic of speculation for months since Microsoft introduced its first digital music player last year, could be driven by consumer demand for one multimedia device to make phone calls, play music and take pictures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    To date, the focus of Microsoft's mobile phone business has been providing its Windows Mobile software to handset manufacturers, but the company said an integrated business model of making both device and software could make sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It wouldn't be unreasonable to think at some point there might some integrated thing," Mindy Mount, chief financial officer of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division, told investors at Citigroup's global technology conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft has sent mixed signals about the Zune phone. At the time it introduced the Zune last year, the company said a Zune phone was definitely part of its future plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier this year, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said at a CEO forum that the Zune phone is not a concept that Microsoft would ever pursue. But he then said it could easily add music or gaming functionality to its Windows Mobile platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Windows Mobile is one of Microsoft's fastest growing businesses with license sales expected to nearly double this fiscal year to more than 20 million copies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It remains a product largely targeted at office workers, but Mount expects that to change as consumers push to combine work and personal needs onto one handset. She said she was not making any specific announcements about its future products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mount declined to comment on rumors that Microsoft may buy BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion Ltd. RIM.TO RIMM.O, but said the company is happy with its future in mobile right now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "What I would ask people is what (RIM) really gets you. A lot of their money is coming from the hardware business and they are going after a very particular segment," said Mount, whose division also oversees the Xbox game console and Zune music player business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mount also said the mobile strategy of the two companies is quite different. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft has been focused on building scale by rolling out Windows Mobile to as many different devices and operators as possible while RIM, according to Mount, has been focused on being profitable with its limited number of handsets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Microsoft rose 33 cents to $29.06 in afternoon Nasdaq trade, while RIM shares touched a new high of $85.88 on the Nasdaq before dropping back to $85.55, up 14 cents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ((Editing by Paul Thomasch, Reuters Messaging: daisuke.wakabayashi.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 206 652 2326)) Keywords: MICROSOFT MOBILE/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;ABERDEEN (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) is in discussions with Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) about the sale of gas from the next phase of Sakhalin-1, Robert Olsen, chairman and production director at Exxon Mobil said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, an operator of the Sakhalin-1 project, established the first oil production from it at the end of 2005 and hit its plateau production in March this year, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next phase is a significant expansion of gas production from the first stage of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're in discussions with a variety of parties as to how best that might be done, no decisions have been made, no options ruled out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olsen, who was speaking to journalists at the OffshoreEurope oil industry conference, said Exxon Mobil currently sells some gas into the domestic market on the mainland of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has looked at selling some of the gas to China and also Japan and India as liquefied natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom, which has monopoly right to export Russian gas, asked the government in June to block these plans, saying they would create a shortage on the Russian domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been well chronicled that Gazprom has an interest in participating in one form or another in how that gas is disposed and handled," Olsen said. "And we are in discussions with Gazprom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom last year obtained control over nearby Sakhalin-2 project, forcing the previous operator Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) to cede after months of state pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)

 Sept 4 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities changed its
ratings on nine European property stocks, initiated one, and
cut its price target on 29 companies by an average of 17
percent based on an anticipated 35 basis point rise in the
weighted average cost of capital.

 The brokerage retained its "underweight" stance on real
estate and said while the sector has performed poorly
year-to-date, it is not offering an attractive risk-reward
profile yet.

 Analyst Harm Meijer said in a note that among the upgrades,
Derwent London (DLN.L), Segro (SGRO.L) and Alstria (AOXG.DE)
have the highest potential upside to price target.

 Meijer added that he would proceed with caution on the
sector and believed the top picks - Derwent London, Segro and
Unibail Rodamco UNBP.PA - offer an attractive combination of
upside and security.

 J.P. Morgan said its other preferred stocks were Brixton
BXTN.L, British Land (BLND.L), and Land Securities (LAND.L),
as those have the best combination of upside to price target
and defensive characteristics.

 The brokerage started coverage of Spanish property firm
Realia (RLIA.MC) with a "neutral" rating and a price target of
6.80 euros.

 Following are some of the rating and price target changes

&lt;p&gt;YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK, Russia, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Russia's gas
export monopoly Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said on Tuesday it needs gas
from Exxon Mobil's Sakhalin-1 project for domestic use, mounting
pressure on the U.S. major to drop plans to export gas to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Gazprom, which controls another major gas project,
Sakhalin-2, off the Russian Pacific coast, said Exxon should
take into account Russia's priority to supply the domestic
market first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given that nearly all the gas from the Sakhalin-2 project
has already been sold under long-term contracts, and other
Sakhalin projects are not expected to start production in the
middle term, the gas from Sakhalin-1 can be the only source for
domestic supplies until at least 2015," said Vladimir Kozlov,
head of Gazprom's Sakhalin office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking at the annual oil and gas conference in the
island's capital of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Kozlov said the growing
domestic demand for gas in Russia's four Far Eastern regions
will reach 13.1 billion cubic metres by 2010 and further grow to
16.0 and 19.2 bcm by 2015 and 2020 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sakhalin-1 alone can supply the regions with 3.2 bcm of gas
by 2010, and 11.4 bcm from 2015 to 2020, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in discussions with Gazprom and have regular
meetings with them to explore various options and find ways of
mutual cooperation," said James Taylor, Executive Vice President
of Exxon Neftegas, Exxon Mobil's subsidiary in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sakhalin-1 is a production sharing agreement, which excludes
the project from Gazprom's legal monopoly on gas exports. It
gives Exxon the right to sell the gas to a consumer of its
choice, like China, with which the U.S. major reached a
preliminary agreement in 2004 on annual supplies of 8 bcm of
gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our main principle is economic profitability. So far, we
consider the Chinese direction to be the most attractive from
the economic point of view," said Margarita Tsoy, the firm's
government and public affairs manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom's influence in the region has significantly grown
since last year, when the gas firm bought control of Sakhalin-2
from Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and its Japanese partners, who
were obliged to sell after a campaign of criticism from Russian
officials and threats of crippling licence withdrawals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sakhalin-1 partners also include Russian
state-controlled oil company Rosneft (ROSN.MM), India's ONGC
(ONGC.BO) and the Japanese consortium Sodeco.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp introduced on Wednesday a suite of Windows Live online services bundled into a single download in its latest effort to compete with Google Inc's growing array of applications delivered over the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released a test, or "beta," version of a free online software package available in a single download that includes versions of e-mail, instant messaging, photo gallery, blogging software and a security program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suite of Web services -- available at get.live.com/wl/all -- will also automatically update with improvements or new versions of those applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said this lays the foundation for other integrated Windows Live services due out in the "coming months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker aims to extend its dominance in desktop software running on computer hard drives into a new world of services delivered through a Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it faces a nimble and deep-pocketed rival in Google, which is also attempting to deliver an integrated experience using a single log-in to offer e-mail, calendar, productivity software and other services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VIENNA (Reuters) - Patients switching from Pfizer's branded cholesterol pill Lipitor to Merck  Co's Zocor -- now available as a cheap generic -- are more likely to have a heart attack or die, according to a Pfizer-backed study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings, which were based on observations from a primary case database in Britain, were presented at the annual European Society of Cardiology congress on Wednesday and will fuel controversy about drug switching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British drug industry said in July it planned to launch a legal challenge to moves by the state-run National Health Service to switch large numbers of patients onto cheap generics. Drugmakers argue such schemes are potentially unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's study covered records from 1997 to 2005 and compared outcomes for 2,511 patients who took Lipitor for six months and then switched to simvastatin -- the generic name for Zocor -- with 9,009 who stayed on Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion was that switching was associated with a 30 percent increase in the relative risk of major cardiovascular events, including heart attacks, strokes and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons for switching were not given and patients were not randomly assigned to each arm of the study, limiting its significance. Nonetheless, Pfizer said it raised concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Lansberg of the University of Amsterdam's Academic Medical Centre, one of the investigators, said the difference was not surprising since Lipitor was known to be more potent at lowering levels of harmful cholesterol in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - JPMorgan's (JPM.N) China asset management venture is considering raising $1 billion to $2 billion for its first overseas investment fund, a product key for diversifying its business risks, the venture's head said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China International Fund Management Co won official approval early last month to launch the fund under China's Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme, which is aimed at easing upward pressure on the country's currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked how much the Shanghai-based firm aims to raise for the QDII fund, Chief Executive Mandy Wang told the Reuters China Century Summit: "$1 billion to $2 billion will be manageable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is one of a handful of China-based fund houses to receive approval to launch such funds, which can invest in financial markets around the world. The China International fund will focus on Asia, excluding Japan and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang said the QDII scheme would help her company and its clients to diversify their risks because investors so far were predominantly exposed to the country's A-share market, which has risen five-fold in the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REDEMPTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are concerns in China's 2 trillion yuan ($265 billion) mutual fund sector that a sharp A-share correction could trigger massive redemptions, as many of China's millions of fund buyers are first-time investors with little investment experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The QDII product is of crucial importance to us. If we only focus on just one market, it will be hugely risky for our clients as well as the company itself," she said at the summit, held at the Reuters office in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which manages more than 70 billion yuan from more than 3 million customers, is 49 percent owned by JPMorgan Asset Management (UK) Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we want is a stable and sustainable business. We don't want a roller-coaster ride," Wang said. She added, however, that she did not expect the A-share market would collapse soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conditions are ripe for QDII to take off in China, Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Domestic investors have started to realize that there is a need to diversify risks because they have made a lot of profit from the A-share market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent customer survey conducted by her firm, 24 percent of respondents said they would buy its QDII fund to diversify risks while another 25 percent said they would join as they expect high returns from the product, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund would target relatively sophisticated investors and a large portion of them would come from the company's existing client base, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minimum subscription for each investor would be set at more than 1,000 yuan, which is the threshold announced by China Southern Fund Management for its planned $2 billion QDII fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DARK HORSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan-born Wang said 20-fold growth in her company's assets under management over the past two years had created heavy pressures, driving the need to further standardize investment processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which has applied to regulators to launch a domestic balanced fund, has been seeking to cut its reliance on individual fund managers and shift its focus to teamwork to boost and sustain investment returns, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lu Jun, a top Chinese fund manager known for his stock-picking skills, resigned as chief investment officer of the company last month. In May, the company fired fund manager Tang Jian over an official probe into stock trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you are running a 1 billion yuan fund, you need to find dark horses so that you can significantly boost your net asset value," Wang said. "But when your funds grow to 10 billion yuan or more, dark horses won't help much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=7.548 Yuan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds more details, analysts' quotes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jiwon Chung&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said
on Wednesday it will go ahead with building a multi-billion
dollar second petrochemical complex in Singapore to start in
early 2011, adding to a wave of new projects to meet global
demand for plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new plant will come onstream after a host of
export-oriented petrochemical crackers in the Middle East. But
analysts said Exxon will absorb most of the petrochemicals
produced, relieving the market of excess stocks, while the U.S.
major will soak up rising supplies of feedstock naphtha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon is a conservative system, and I think they are
looking at this new plant as a supplier to their global system
rather than just for the Southeast Asian region," said Tony
Regan, a Singapore-based consultant at Nexant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project by unit ExxonMobil Chemical, which had been
widely expected to proceed, will include a 1 million tonnes per
year (tpy) ethylene steam cracker, as well as two 650,000 tpy
polyethylene units and a 450,000 tpy polypropylene unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon did not give an exact cost, but said it will be a
multi-billion dollar project. It will be integrated with
Exxon's existing 900,000 tpy cracker on Singapore's Jurong
Island petrochemical hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project will come after four new Saudi plants and one
in Kuwait add 4.5 million tpy of ethylene production capacity
by the end of 2008, and similar volumes to be added between
2009 and 2010 in the Middle East, said petrochemical consultant
CMAI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have said the overall extra supplies could weigh
on petrochemical margins -- currently around $600 a tonne -- by
the end of the decade, despite Asian demand growth of 6 percent
a year for products such as ethylene and propylene, used as
building blocks to make plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They said the new Exxon plant could absorb rising supplies
from India of oil product naphtha, used as a feedstock, helping
support regional market prices and margins for refining
naphtha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The plant is huge, and it will take a lot of naphtha
supplies plus other feedstocks," said Victor Shum, a
Singapore-based analyst at energy consultancy Purvin  Gertz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petrochemical producers usually consume three times more
naphtha than their ethylene capacity, meaning the proposed
plant may have to use up to 3 million tonnes of naphtha per
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said it had awarded the design, engineering,
procurement and construction contract for the steam cracker
recovery unit to U.S.-based Shaw Group Inc SGR.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The engineering contract for the steam cracker furnaces has
been awarded to Japan's Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding
(7003.T) and Heurtey Petrochemical (ALHPC.PA) of France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It awarded engineering contracts for the polypropylene and
specialty elastomers units to Mitsui Engineering and
Shipbuilding, and contracts for the two polyethylene units to
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (7011.T).

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), seeking to 
preserve the dominance of its Windows franchise, launched a new 
software application that takes aim at VMware Inc. (VMW.N), the 
leader in "virtualization" technology that allows a single 
computer server to operate like many machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Systems Center Virtual Machine Manager 2007, introduced on 
Thursday, allows companies to deploy virtualization technology, 
centralize management and convert machines running VMware to a 
Microsoft format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move is considered one of Microsoft's first major 
efforts to cut into the lead held by VMware -- which went 
public this summer in the hottest technology IPO in years -- 
and thus undercut a potential threat to Windows server 
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The sleeping beast has awoken," said Stephen Elliot, 
research director at IDC. "Microsoft's been a little slow to 
the game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Windows accounts for about two-thirds of the market for 
computer-server operating systems, by shipments, but Microsoft 
is considered a laggard in virtualization to allow servers to 
run Linux or Unix operating systems alongside its own software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Virtualization is one of the fastest-growing segments of 
the technology industry since it enables technology departments 
to use servers more efficiently, cutting the need for machines 
and reducing electricity costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also allows companies more flexibility on how data 
centers are managed and simplifies the implementation of new 
software applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VMware, an affiliate of data storage firm EMC Corp (EMC.N), 
holds more than 70 percent of the virtualization market and its 
sales have doubled year-on-year for the past several quarters.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TAKING ON VMWARE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's main weapon against VMware is expected to be a 
piece of software, code-named Viridian, that will be included 
as a feature of its next generation of Windows Server software. 
Viridian will act as a "hypervisor" or extra layer that sits 
between the hardware and the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Redmond, Washington-based company has experienced some 
delays in bringing Viridian to market. It now expects Viridian 
to be available six months after the release of Windows Server 
2008, which is due for completion before the end of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Microsoft pointed to industry analyst figures that 
forecast virtualization-enabled Windows Servers to surpass 10 
million units by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry analysts see virtualization as both a threat and 
an opportunity for Microsoft. On one hand, it may weaken 
Microsoft's grip on the server market and may force it to share 
space on single machines with other operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if it executes properly, analysts think, Microsoft 
could become a platform upon which all virtualization is done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first step starts with Systems Center Virtual Machine 
Manager 2007. It integrates with Microsoft's existing software 
tools into a single suite of applications to manage both 
virtualized and non-virtualized servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also said that once Viridian becomes available, 
the software tools will work with other virtualization software 
including ones from VMware and XenSource Inc., a company 
recently acquired by Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft sees virtualization as more pervasive than the 
prevailing view that the technology is limited to servers, 
saying customers also want their desktop computers and 
individual applications to take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For example, a company may want one of its computers 
running Microsoft's new Windows Vista operating system to run 
an older version of Windows on the same machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think the impact of virtualization is much broader than 
how VMware is defining it," said David Greschler, a Microsoft 
director of integrated virtualization strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China International Fund Management Co won official approval early last month to launch the fund under China's Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme, which is aimed at easing upward pressure on the country's currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked how much the Shanghai-based firm aims to raise for the QDII fund, Chief Executive Mandy Wang told the Reuters China Century Summit: "$1 billion to $2 billion will be manageable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is one of a handful of China-based fund houses to receive approval to launch such funds, which can invest in financial markets around the world. The China International fund will focus on Asia, excluding Japan and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang said the QDII scheme would help her company and its clients to diversify their risks because investors so far were predominantly exposed to the country's A-share market, which has risen five-fold in the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REDEMPTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are concerns in China's 2 trillion yuan ($265 billion) mutual fund sector that a sharp A-share correction could trigger massive redemptions, as many of China's millions of fund buyers are first-time investors with little investment experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The QDII product is of crucial importance to us. If we only focus on just one market, it will be hugely risky for our clients as well as the company itself," she said at the summit, held at the Reuters office in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which manages more than 70 billion yuan from more than 3 million customers, is 49 percent owned by JPMorgan Asset Management (UK) Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we want is a stable and sustainable business. We don't want a roller-coaster ride," Wang said. She added, however, that she did not expect the A-share market would collapse soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conditions are ripe for QDII to take off in China, Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Domestic investors have started to realize that there is a need to diversify risks because they have made a lot of profit from the A-share market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent customer survey conducted by her firm, 24 percent of respondents said they would buy its QDII fund to diversify risks while another 25 percent said they would join as they expect high returns from the product, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund would target relatively sophisticated investors and a large portion of them would come from the company's existing client base, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minimum subscription for each investor would be set at more than 1,000 yuan, which is the threshold announced by China Southern Fund Management for its planned $2 billion QDII fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DARK HORSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan-born Wang said 20-fold growth in her company's assets under management over the past two years had created heavy pressures, driving the need to further standardize investment processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which has applied to regulators to launch a domestic balanced fund, has been seeking to cut its reliance on individual fund managers and shift its focus to teamwork to boost and sustain investment returns, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lu Jun, a top Chinese fund manager known for his stock-picking skills, resigned as chief investment officer of the company last month. In May, the company fired fund manager Tang Jian over an official probe into stock trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you are running a 1 billion yuan fund, you need to find dark horses so that you can significantly boost your net asset value," Wang said. "But when your funds grow to 10 billion yuan or more, dark horses won't help much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=7.548 Yuan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
has hired the former head of Europe's biggest asset-backed
securities underwriting business, Deutsche Bank AG's (DBKGn.DE)
Jeff Stolz, a person familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The New York-based firm, which lagged rivals in beefing up
its mortgage business, is bulking up at a time when mortgage
markets are in turmoil. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stacey Coglan, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, confirmed
that Stolz had left the bank last month. Stolz left along with
more junior executives Paul Weitzkorn and Peter Speicher.
Deutsche Bank has not yet named replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three will report to Pablo Salame, Goldman's
London-based co-head of credit and mortgages trading, and
Daniel Sparks, the bank's New York-based head of mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the past year Goldman told analysts it intended to
expand its mortgage business, which was small in relative terms
compared with much bigger commitments by Lehman Brothers
LEH.N and Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N. More recently Morgan
Stanley (MS.N) and Merrill Lynch MER.N began to ramp up their
business by acquiring lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman acquired a tiny origination business, designed to
generate loans that could be packaged into bonds. But that
caution paid off after a slowdown in U.S. housing market
triggered a meltdown in the subprime markets and fueled losses
for banks and investment funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Joseph Giannone and Olesya Dmitracova in

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Rapid-fire U.S. energy
policy changes are not promoting energy security, Rex
Tillerson, Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) chief executive, said on
Friday as he called for the United States to focus on boosting
its domestic supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Speaking at a business roundtable at the Spruce Meadows
equestrian facility south of Calgary, Tillerson said U.S.
policy makers need a long-term view if the world's largest
energy consumer is to ensure secure supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson said the 2005 U.S. energy policy was designed to
improve the oil industry's access to domestic resources.
However, he said, new policies being pushed through Congress
will reverse that position and make acquiring new reserves more
difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Square that with energy security for me and you're a
smarter person than I am," Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Policies to encourage alternative fuels, carbon capture and
sequestration, and to improve energy supply take a decade or
more to bear fruit, he told the business audience, a span well
beyond the electoral cycles of a president, senator or a
representative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If energy policies are to work, the U.S. government must
commit to a stable policy framework and not change positions
with every election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Policy has to be durable and the U.S. government
has to be committed to put that policy in place and let it play
out," he said. "We've never been able to do that. We put it in
place and two years later we change it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. needs to loosen access to supplies within its
borders because of changing international energy politics,
Tillerson said. Higher oil prices, nationalist pressures in
oil-exporting nations and the rise of national oil companies
restricting access to new reserves, and mixing energy and
foreign policy no longer works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our energy policy has been to use our foreign policy to
tell everybody else to develop all your natural resources and
send them to us at a low price and we're just going to not
bother with ours," he said. "That's been the U.S. energy policy
for the last 25 years and now that's come to the end of the
string."

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds Congressional activity, closing prices) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), which has one of the largest U.S. student lending businesses, said on Friday it will hire up to 150 Indianapolis-based workers from Nelnet Inc (NNI.N) to expand its loan-origination operations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The third-largest U.S. bank said its Chase Education Finance unit has signed a letter of intent to offer jobs to the workers and will also sublease Nelnet offices in Indianapolis. It expects to add the employees late this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nelnet, a student loan company, announced plans on Thursday to cut 400 jobs, or 12 percent of its work force, citing expected changes in lending laws that could reduce lenders' profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Both houses of Congress voted overwhelmingly on Friday to cut government subsidies to student lenders such as JPMorgan, Nelnet and Sallie Mae SLM.N and use the money to boost student aid by $20 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The White House has said President George W. Bush will sign the bill into law. The bill is expected to shake up an $85 billion annual business following months of scandals involving kickbacks and conflicts of interest implicating lenders and college officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan said it oversees more than $12 billion of student loans. In Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, JPMorgan shares closed down 69 cents at $43.52, while Nelnet shares fell 35 cents to $17.77. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by Kevin Drawbaugh in Washington, D.C.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by John Wallace/Andre Grenon; Reuters Messaging: jon.stempel.reuters.com@reuters.net +1 646 223 6317)) Keywords: JPMORGANCHASE NELNET/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, quotes, updates oil price; figures in U.S.
dollars)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Oil market fundamentals do not
justify a crude oil price as high as $70 a barrel, which is
below today's level, Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) top executive
said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I cannot explain why we have $70 oil. The fundamentals
behind supply and demand do not support $70 oil. The
fundamentals support something much less," Exxon Mobil CEO Rex
Tillerson told a business roundtable at the Spruce Meadows
equestrian facility on the outskirts of Calgary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil
company, produces about 2.5 million barrels of oil a day and
its refineries use 6 million barrels a day, requiring it to go
into global markets to buy the remainder, Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company and others in the industry have little trouble
buying the crude they need on a daily basis, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil prices rose 40 cents on Friday to close at $76.70 a
barrel and traders cited tight supplies for the gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's something else going on there that I don't get,"
Tillerson said, speaking to an audience of business and
political leaders about energy security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said he believes Saudi Arabia has the oil resources and
technological ability to boost its daily output capacity to
12.5 million barrels. However, he did not give a timeframe for
such an increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Extracting new crude will be a more expensive proposition
than producing oil from the current fields. Development would
cost C$1.50 to $2 a barrel versus about 50 cents for today's
output, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saudi Arabia, the top OPEC oil source, produced about 8.7
million barrels a day in August. Its capacity has been pegged
above 11 million and it has set plans to increase it 12.5
million by 2009.

Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO), Canada's biggest oil producer and
refiner, Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson said on

firms are partners in numerous energy projects and proposals,
including the Kearl oil sands development in Alberta and
Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline plan in the far North.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Questions about Exxon's intentions with Imperial emerged in
the past year after Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) bought out
the 22 percent of Shell Canada Ltd that it did not already own
in a bid to gain more control over its vast oil sands
holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil's 100 percent-owned Canadian unit and Imperial
share many administrative functions and have joint operating
agreements, but Exxon has not taken the next step and absorbed
Calgary-based Imperial, known for its national chain of Esso
gas stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imperial shares were down 68 Canadian cents at C$46.81 on
the Toronto Stock Exchange amid a broad-based market retreat.
Exxon shares were down $1.69 at $85.80 in New York.

business roundtable in Calgary, Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil has a 69.6 percent stake in Imperial and both
firms are partners in numerous energy projects and proposals,
including the Kearl oil sands development in Alberta and
Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline plan in the far North.

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil's (XOM.N) top
official said on Friday that oil market fundamentals did not
justify a crude oil price as high as $70 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Oil prices CLc1 on Friday were above $76 a barrel on the

resources and technology to boost its oil production capacity
to 12.5 million barrels per day.

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects Salame's job title to add that he is the global
co-head of credit, mortgages and emerging markets trading)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
has hired the former head of Europe's biggest asset-backed
securities underwriting business, Deutsche Bank AG's (DBKGn.DE)
Jeff Stolz, a person familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-based firm, which lagged rivals in beefing up
its mortgage business, is bulking up at a time when mortgage
markets are in turmoil. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stacey Coglan, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, confirmed
that Stolz had left the bank last month. Stolz left along with
more junior executives Paul Weitzkorn and Peter Speicher.
Deutsche Bank has not yet named replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three will report to Pablo Salame, Goldman's
London-based global co-head of credit, mortgages and emerging
markets trading, and Daniel Sparks, the bank's New York-based
head of mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the past year Goldman told analysts it intended to
expand its mortgage business, which was small in relative terms
compared with much bigger commitments by Lehman Brothers
LEH.N and Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N. More recently Morgan
Stanley (MS.N) and Merrill Lynch MER.N began to ramp up their
business by acquiring lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman acquired a tiny origination business, designed to
generate loans that could be packaged into bonds. But that
caution paid off after a slowdown in U.S. housing market
triggered a meltdown in the subprime markets and fueled losses
for banks and investment funds.

&lt;p&gt;TARR is trading up ~130% after announcing it has closed the sales of two of its Florida rental properties for $69.25 mln and has reached agreement with its largest creditor, General Electric Capital Corporation (G.E.C.C.), on the terms, which Tarragon expects to be satisfied early next week, under which G.E.C.C. will reinstate all loans that it has made to Tarragon and/or its affiliates. The proceeds from the sale of the two Florida properties have allowed Tarragonto satisfy approximately $50 mln of outstanding indebtedness, bring current all debt service that had been owed to G.E.C.C. and to establish certain cash and other reserves. Further, in addition to the property sales announced today, Tarragon also has accepted offers or entered into contracts to sell additional properties in Florida and Tennessee over the next 30 days. Such sales, if completed, would generate approximately $35 mln in net proceeds while reducing Tarragon's outstandingdebt by about $270 mln.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) made $300 million last month from the rescue of one of its hedge funds, the Financial Times reported in its online edition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman on Aug. 13 said it would put $2 billion into the Global Equity Opportunities hedge fund, while investors including former American International Group Inc (AIG.N) Chairman Maurice "Hank" Greenberg would invest $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Both Global Equity and another fund, Global Alpha, fell 23 percent for the month as a whole, the FT said, citing investors briefed on the results.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Even as market turmoil batters
its hedge funds and threatens to scuttle buyouts, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc (GS.N) is raising a new fund to exploit
distressed-debt bargains, people familiar with the matter
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The largest U.S. investment bank has raised more than $1.5
billion for the past few weeks for Goldman Sachs Liquidity
Partners III, the sources said. The fund, previously reported
to target about $1 billion, will purchase a broad range of
distressed assets, including mortgages and buyout loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman previously raised Liquidity Partners funds in 1998,
the year of Asia's debt crises and the collapse of Long Term
Credit Management, and in 2001, after the technology and
telecom bubble burst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment bank's efforts come as a number of hedge
fund and private equity investment shops solicit capital for
new distressed debt funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mortgages and asset-backed securities, for example, have
fallen in price after the subprime market melted down earlier
this year. That fueled turmoil in other debt markets and
corporate finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks worldwide must sell more than $300 billion of debt
intended to fund a record volume of leveraged buyouts announced
in the first half. Most of this credit was extended in better
times but now faces a market demanding higher yields and more
protective terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under pressure to move loans off their balance sheets, even
at lower prices, banks are expected to suffer losses. But that
may create an opportunity for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than a dozen distressed funds have raised $23 billion
through August, topping the $18 billion raised for such funds
last year, according to research firm Private Equity
Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MatlinPatterson raised a $4.5 billion fund last month and
Newport Global Advisors, a unit of Providence Equity Partners,
raised a $500 million fund in August. Goldman rival Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N is preparing a $2 billion fund, a
person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), seeking to preserve the dominance of its Windows franchise, launched a new software application that takes aim at VMware Inc. (VMW.N), the leader in "virtualization" technology that allows a single computer server to operate like many machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems Center Virtual Machine Manager 2007, introduced on Thursday, allows companies to deploy virtualization technology, centralize management and convert machines running VMware to a Microsoft format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move is considered one of Microsoft's first major efforts to cut into the lead held by VMware -- which went public this summer in the hottest technology IPO in years -- and thus undercut a potential threat to Windows server software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sleeping beast has awoken," said Stephen Elliot, research director at IDC. "Microsoft's been a little slow to the game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows accounts for about two-thirds of the market for computer-server operating systems, by shipments, but Microsoft is considered a laggard in virtualization to allow servers to run Linux or Unix operating systems alongside its own software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtualization is one of the fastest-growing segments of the technology industry since it enables technology departments to use servers more efficiently, cutting the need for machines and reducing electricity costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also allows companies more flexibility on how data centers are managed and simplifies the implementation of new software applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware, an affiliate of data storage firm EMC Corp (EMC.N), holds more than 70 percent of the virtualization market and its sales have doubled year-on-year for the past several quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAKING ON VMWARE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's main weapon against VMware is expected to be a piece of software, code-named Viridian, that will be included as a feature of its next generation of Windows Server software. Viridian will act as a "hypervisor" or extra layer that sits between the hardware and the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company has experienced some delays in bringing Viridian to market. It now expects Viridian to be available six months after the release of Windows Server 2008, which is due for completion before the end of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Microsoft pointed to industry analyst figures that forecast virtualization-enabled Windows Servers to surpass 10 million units by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts see virtualization as both a threat and an opportunity for Microsoft. On one hand, it may weaken Microsoft's grip on the server market and may force it to share space on single machines with other operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if it executes properly, analysts think, Microsoft could become a platform upon which all virtualization is done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step starts with Systems Center Virtual Machine Manager 2007. It integrates with Microsoft's existing software tools into a single suite of applications to manage both virtualized and non-virtualized servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said that once Viridian becomes available, the software tools will work with other virtualization software including ones from VMware and XenSource Inc., a company recently acquired by Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sees virtualization as more pervasive than the prevailing view that the technology is limited to servers, saying customers also want their desktop computers and individual applications to take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a company may want one of its computers running Microsoft's new Windows Vista operating system to run an older version of Windows on the same machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think the impact of virtualization is much broader than how VMware is defining it," said David Greschler, a Microsoft director of integrated virtualization strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Friday it may take decades to tackle software piracy in large emerging economies despite some recent progress and called on Asian governments to invest more in policing the practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are realistic in recognizing that we have to work diligently over periods, that are really a decade or two, to make real progress in a number of these environments," Craig Mundie, Microsoft chief research and strategy officer, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mundie, one of two successors to Microsoft founder Bill Gates next year, said progress had been made in countries like China and Vietnam in recent years to tackle software pirates, which cost the company billions of dollars each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he said more needed to be done to police the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of the Asian countries have the laws, some of the regulations - they probably need tuning up - but the biggest weakness is very few of them have made the necessary investment on the enforcement side," Mundie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has made progress in China where the piracy rate has dropped to 82 percent this year from 94 percent four years ago, he said. The piracy rate is a measure of the level of pirated software in the country. China President Hu Jintao last year pledged to crack down on software piracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mundie was speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of a meeting of the 21 Asia Pacific leaders, some of whom have pledged flexibility in trade talks which have dragged for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As business people we certainly find it encouraging that the Doha Round could get completed and trade can go to the next level," said Mundie, who earlier addressed a forum of business leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Microsoft expected to continue to grow its workforce and research and development capability in countries outside its dominant United States market, such as India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software company has been expanding beyond its Windows and office software businesses, saying Web services and consumer devices are key to the company's future. Its software products like the Windows operating system and Office productivity software account for most of the company's profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Siemens (SIEGn.DE) will join forces to develop in-car entertainment and navigation products that should make it easier for consumers to connect devices such mobile phones and music players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two companies said on Friday the first Siemens products based on Microsoft software should go into production in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market for automotive infotainment products is set to grow to about $54 billion by 2012 from $38 billion currently, according to research group iSuppli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of portable media players and content downloadable from the Internet is forcing carmakers and their suppliers to rethink their offerings, which have until recently centered on standalone audio systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siemens automotive unit VDO, which is being bought by car-parts maker Continental (CONG.DE) for 11.4 billion euros ($15.6 billion), said using the Microsoft Auto platform would give it more room to concentrate on its core competencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siemens VDO also makes driver-assistance and safety systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In addition, Siemens VDO will also be able to actively help shape Microsoft Auto and license platform-compliant applications, such as navigation functions, for third-party suppliers," a joint statement from the two companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies said their first milestone would be a multimedia platform that would make it possible to integrate consumer-electronic functions and portable devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consequently, new solutions in consumer electronics will be adapted for in-vehicle use more quickly and easily, since it will only be necessary to add individual software components," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This helps close the gap between the short development cycles in communications and information technology and the comparatively long product cycles in automotive engineering."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with company confirmation, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Fayen Wong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Chevron (CVX.N) said on Friday
it has received final approval from the Western Australian
state government for its multi-billion dollar Gorgon liquefied
natural gas (LNG) project, removing a major hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Confirming an earlier Reuters report, Chevron said the
approval came with stringent conditions, which the project
partners, Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc
(RDSa.L) (RDSb.L), were reviewing as they finalise project
details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, the third-largest U.S. oil company by market
value, still needs Australian national government approval
before the project can start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also said its key Japanese customers, including Tokyo
Gas (9531.T), Chubu Electric Power (9502.T) and Osaka Gas
(9532.T), could take minority equity in the Gorgon project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are working with three Japanese customers and there are
provisions for equity participation as well as the purchase of
LNG (from Gorgon)," Jay Johnson, managing director of Chevron
Australia, told reporters on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation meeting in Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnson declined to comment when asked about the cost of
the project, saying that the joint venture partners were still
finalising details and it would be premature to give an
estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry analysts have suggested that construction costs
for Gorgon, which contains 40 trillion cubic feet of gas
resources, could double to A$20 billion ($17 billion) from
Chevron's estimate of A$11 billion three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnson reiterated that the partners remain committed to
the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The final investment decision is one which each company
has to take. But I can say that we have a common set of
interests and we are well-aligned going forward," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is the operator of the project and holds a 50
percent stake. Exxon Mobil and Shell each have 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shell has suggested that the joint venture partners could
increase the scale of the project to 15 million tonnes per
annum (mtpa) from an initial plan of 10 mtpa. But Chevron said
that optimisation studies were still continuing and the scope
of the project remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project was first expected to deliver gas in 2010, but
analysts now say a 2015-2016 timeframe would be a more likely
should Chevron be able to make a final investment decision on
the project in the next one or two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron had scrapped a 2006 deadline for approving the
Gorgon project after environmental groups protested against
plans for an LNG plant to handle the project's gas on Barrow
Island, a nature reserve off Western Australia which is home to
a rare species of turtle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An industry source told Reuters that Chevron has already
made plans to build a construction camp on Barrow Island to
house over 2,000 workers and was expanding port facilities in
preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is no doubt that the project is going ahead. They
have drilled a data well for carbon storage and have done
geotechnical work for the proposed pipeline route," the source
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Australia, which aims to be the world's second-largest LNG
exporter after Qatar, has six proposed LNG projects along its
northwest coast, led by companies including Woodside Petroleum
Ltd. (WPL.AX), Chevron and Japan's Inpex Holdings (1605.T).

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Vanessa Hudgens, the star of the 
wholesome, made-for-kids TV movie hit "High School Musical," 
apologized on Friday for a nude photo of her on the Web and 
Walt Disney Co. said it was sticking by the performer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Some parents of her young fans voiced dismay over the 
photo, which shows Hudgens, 18, smiling and standing naked 
directly in front of the camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I want to apologize to my fans, whose support and trust 
means the world to me," Hudgens said in a statement issued 
about a day after the photo surfaced. "I am embarrassed over 
this situation and regret having ever taken these photos. I am 
thankful for the support of my family and friends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a statement, Disney said it hoped Hudgens had learned a 
valuable lesson. "Vanessa has apologized for what was obviously 
a lapse in judgment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Disney representative said the photo would not affect its 
decision to cast Hudgens in the third film of the "High School 
Musical" franchise and that negotiations for the cast and 
creative team were continuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier on Friday, a representative for Hudgens confirmed 
the image was of Hudgens but said it "was taken privately."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is a personal matter and it is unfortunate that this 
has become public," the representative said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hudgens has starred in "High School Musical" and "High 
School Musical 2" as Gabriella, the sweet, innocent science 
geek whose romance with athlete Troy, played by Zac Efron, is 
chronicled in the two hugely popular made-for-television movies 
on the squeaky-clean Disney Channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hudgens and Efron, who date in real life, were so chaste on 
screen they did not even kiss until the end of the second film, 
a climactic moment marked by fireworks going off behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two movies form the cornerstone of one of Disney's most 
lucrative franchises for preteen girls and a third is planned 
for release to theaters next year. The second film debuts on 
Disney Channels in other countries this weekend.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'VERY PRIVATE PERSON'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a Teen magazine interview released earlier this week, 
Hudgens described herself as "a very private person" with "very 
good morals" who enjoyed serving as a role model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I've been brought up with very good morals and I'm not 
going to go out and do something I don't want other kids to 
do," she said in the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But some parents of young fans were outraged by the photo, 
saying it tarnished Hudgens' image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "She's damaged," Renee Rollins-Greenberg, a Los Angeles 
mother of two, told Reuters. "She's got this teeny-bop 
audience, young preteens and younger, who are admiring her and 
thinking she's this wonderful, pure innocent person. Eighteen 
is awfully young for this kind of display."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm devastated because I have an 8-year-old for which I 
now have to have an explanation," said another Los Angeles-area 
mother, Rosie Konkel. "She's always looked at this character as 
a very smart and proper young lady."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "High School Musical 2" debuted on Disney Channel last 
month to a record audience of 17.2 million viewers to become 
the most-watched individual program in cable TV history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show's soundtrack debuted at No. 1 on national album 
sales charts, where it has remained for the past three weeks, 
selling nearly 1.2 million copies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's top drug lord, who earned the title "boss of bosses" for smuggling hundreds of tonnes of cocaine to the United States, was captured on Monday, the country's biggest narcotics arrest in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soldiers surrounded Diego Montoya, also known as Don Diego, in a farmhouse where he was hiding with his mother and several other people near the western coffee town of Armenia, capping a more than 7-year manhunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was on the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted" list in the United States and was the subject of a $5 million reward. He is expected to be extradited to the United States for trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This shows our commitment to the fight against drug trafficking, which is a matter of national security in Colombia," Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bearded 230-pound (104 kg) Montoya, known for his burly physique and links to right-wing paramilitary militias, was turned over to law enforcement officials after arriving in the capital city Bogota in a military plane wearing a black T-shirt, gray pants and handcuffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He helped found the Norte del Valle cartel, the only Colombian gang that still controls all areas of the business from the cultivation of coca plants, to production of cocaine and its exportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santos said Montoya's private army of assassins, called Los Machos, have killed 1,500 people in his campaign to maintain leadership of the Norte del Valle organization, which has a hand in exporting 70 percent of the cocaine that leaves Colombia for the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TURF WAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capture comes amid a scandal in which high level military officers are accused of taking bribes to protect Montoya, who led bloody battles against rival gangs for control of smuggling routes leading to Colombia's Pacific coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He consolidated his empire using paramilitaries to brutally control rural areas used to produce and transport cocaine. The "paras" have committed some of the worst massacres and other atrocities of this Andean country's four-decade-old war between left-wing guerrillas and the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the days of Pablo Escobar, head of the once mighty but now defunct Medellin cartel in the 1980s, Colombia's cocaine trade has mainly splintered into smaller groups specializing in different parts of the production and exportation chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the country remains the world's biggest maker of the drug, exporting more than 600 metric tons every year despite billions of dollars in U.S. aid aimed at stamping out the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of Montoya's arrest plus the August capture of a drug lord known as "Lollipop" and the July extradition of another one known as "Scratch," is the hardest blow against the drug trade since Escobar was killed in 1993, said Rafael Nieto, a political commentator and former deputy justice minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Montoya's arrest will certainly initiate a fight for control of what is left of the Norte del Valle organization," Nieto said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Pfizer statement, closing stock price, details on drug's
use, cancer risk)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Lisa Richwine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - A potential human
carcinogen has been found in batches of Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N)
AIDS drug, Viracept, U.S. officials and the drugmaker said on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pregnant women and children who are starting HIV therapy
should not be given the drug until further notice, Pfizer and
the Food and Drug Administration said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tests detected the presence of ethyl methanesulfonate, or
EMS, a chemical formed during manufacturing, Pfizer said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EMS is a "potential human carcinogen," the FDA and Pfizer
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studies suggest EMS may cause cancer and birth defects in
animals, but no data for humans exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EMS levels were "substantially lower" than those that
prompted Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX) to recall the same drug in
Europe, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viracept, known generically as nelfinavir, belongs to a
class of AIDS drugs called protease inhibitors. It is a key
part of many drug cocktails used to suppress the HIV virus that
causes AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer is working with the FDA to prospectively limit EMS
levels in Viracept, while still considering the immediate needs
of patients on therapy," a company statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a letter to doctors, Pfizer said manufacturing changes
would reduce EMS levels so the theoretical increased cancer
risk for adults over a lifetime would be less than 1 case per
100,000 people exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pediatric patients who are stable on Viracept-containing
regimens may continue to be treated with the drug, the company
said. Pregnant women currently taking Viracept should be
switched to an alternative medicine until the manufacturing
changes are made, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For pregnant women with no alternative treatment options,
"FDA and Pfizer agree that the risk-benefit ratio remains
favorable for the continued use of Viracept," the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In August, authorities suspended Roche's license to market
Viracept in the European Union because of the EMS finding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares fell 1.2 percent to close at $23.96 on the
New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds FACTBOX tag to headline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The Microsoft (MSFT.O) decision on Sept. 17 by the European Court of First Instance may reshape and limit the European Commission's antitrust powers, but likely will not be the last word on the subject. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The decision can be appealed on points of law to the EU's highest court, the European Court of Justice. European antitrust law is only decades old but draws on U.S. jurisprudence stretching back nearly a century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Some important past cases: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    -- Standard Oil: The United States Supreme Court ruled for the government in 1911, ending a long antitrust case and opening the way for the break-up of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil. The resulting companies actually increased the value of the stock, making Rockefeller even richer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    -- Aluminum Co of America: A 1945 case that the government fought through World War II to end Alcoa's aluminium monopoly. In the end, the government sold aluminium war production plants to Reynolds Aluminum and Kaiser Aluminum, creating a competitive market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    -- AT Corp: The case ran from 1974 to 1982, when AT agreed to break up the company. The government said AT had monopolised the market for local and long-distance telephone service, along with equipment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    -- International Business Machines Corp: Lasting from 1969 to 1982 as the longest-running and probably largest U.S. antitrust case, it was eventually dropped as outdated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    However, IBM and the European Commission reached a settlement on the matter in 1984. IBM agreed to provide specifications so rivals could sell devices interoperating with IBM machines. Interoperability is key in the EU/Microsoft battle, and the IBM case is sometimes cited as a model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    -- U.S. Microsoft case: A U.S. appeals court found in 2001 that Microsoft had violated antitrust law by hurting a rival maker of Internet browsers, but overturned a judge's plan to break up the company. After that, the Bush administration came into power and backed away from aggressively pursuing the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In the European Microsoft case, one issue turns on the interpretation of two cases cited by both sides. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Magill case, decided by the European Court of Justice in 1995, specifies circumstances in which a company must share copyrighted materials. The court reinforced that in April 2004 in its decision on IMS Health, which tracks sales of pharmaceutical and healthcare products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The court said a dominant company can refuse to licence a copyright to a rival when there are "objective considerations". But it cannot stand in the way of competition by refusing to licence a rival that wants to offer a new, potentially sought-after product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Commission ordered Microsoft to share interoperability information with competitors, so their server software could connect smoothly to Microsoft Windows desktop machines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft says its competitors' products are not new but the same as Microsoft's and fall outside the court's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Commission says the court's list is not exhaustive and does not cover the situation, in which Microsoft stopped providing information to rivals when it decided to build its own work group server and introduced updated products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The best-known competition cases also include a decision by the Court of First Instance in 2005 to uphold the Commission's ban on a merger between General Electric and Honeywell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In the same year, the high court upheld a nullification by the Court of First Instance of a Commission decision to stop package maker Tetra Laval from buying packaging equipment firm Sidel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For preview story, click on [nL10398398] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For factbox on EU sanctions, click on [nL01748323] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For factbox on Microsoft's legal troubles: [nL01147732] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For chronology, click on: [nL10758987] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by David Lawsky, editing by Dale Hudson/Quentin Bryar; Reuters  messaging david.lawsky.reuters.com@reuters.net; e-mail  david.lawsky@reuters.com; +322-287-6811.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Vanessa Hudgens, the star of the wholesome, made-for-kids TV movie hit "High School Musical," apologized Friday for a nude photo of her on the Web and Walt Disney Co. said it was sticking by the performer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some parents of her young fans voiced dismay over the photo, which shows Hudgens, 18, smiling and standing naked directly in front of the camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to apologize to my fans, whose support and trust means the world to me," Hudgens said in a statement issued about a day after the photo surfaced. "I am embarrassed over this situation and regret having ever taken these photos. I am thankful for the support of my family and friends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Disney said it hoped Hudgens had learned a valuable lesson. "Vanessa has apologized for what was obviously a lapse in judgment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Disney representative said the photo would not affect its decision to cast Hudgens in the third film of the "High School Musical" franchise and that negotiations for the cast and creative team were continuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier Friday, a representative for Hudgens confirmed the image was of Hudgens but said it "was taken privately."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a personal matter and it is unfortunate that this has become public," the representative said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudgens has starred in "High School Musical" and "High School Musical 2" as Gabriella, the sweet, innocent science geek whose romance with athlete Troy, played by Zac Efron, is chronicled in the two hugely popular made-for-television movies on the squeaky-clean Disney Channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudgens and Efron, who date in real life, were so chaste on screen they did not even kiss until the end of the second film, a climactic moment marked by fireworks going off behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two movies form the cornerstone of one of Disney's most lucrative franchises for preteen girls and a third is planned for release to theaters next year. The second film debuts on Disney Channels in other countries this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'VERY PRIVATE PERSON'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Teen magazine interview released earlier this week, Hudgens described herself as "a very private person" with "very good morals" who enjoyed serving as a role model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been brought up with very good morals and I'm not going to go out and do something I don't want other kids to do," she said in the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some parents of young fans were outraged by the photo, saying it tarnished Hudgens' image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She's damaged," Renee Rollins-Greenberg, a Los Angeles mother of two, told Reuters. "She's got this teeny-bop audience, young preteens and younger, who are admiring her and thinking she's this wonderful, pure innocent person. Eighteen is awfully young for this kind of display."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm devastated because I have an 8-year-old for which I now have to have an explanation," said another Los Angeles-area mother, Rosie Konkel. "She's always looked at this character as a very smart and proper young lady."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"High School Musical 2" debuted on Disney Channel last month to a record audience of 17.2 million viewers to become the most-watched individual program in cable TV history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show's soundtrack debuted at No. 1 on national album sales charts, where it has remained for the past three weeks, selling nearly 1.2 million copies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - When a European court hands down its landmark Microsoft (MSFT.O) antitrust decision next Monday, at stake will be nothing less than the power of the European Commission to regulate the high-tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision by the 13-judge Grand Chamber of the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg will determine whether the European Union's executive arm ruled properly in 2004 that Microsoft used its near-monopoly Windows system to push rivals out of the marketplace. Competitive products must perch on that platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies around the world are waiting for a decision that could cut into the Commission's power, as it considers antitrust cases and complaints involving Microsoft, Intel (INTC.O), Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Rambus (RMBS.O) and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we lose this one, we're in deep (trouble). It would put in question our ability to regulate competition in high-tech industries," a Commission official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission held that Microsoft skewed the scales by taking advantage of the fact that more than 95 percent of the world's laptops and desktops run on Windows. Microsoft says the EU executive is interfering with its ability to design software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Union judges have taken an agonizing 15 months to decide the case since they conducted public hearings, leading to speculation the verdict may be long, complex and nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most obviously, the court will decide whether to slice the Commission-imposed record 497 million euro ($685.4 million) fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that is pocket money to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sides care far more about sanctions the Commission ordered on Microsoft's business practices in two major areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One part of the decision involves streaming media software used to watch Google's (GOOG.O) YouTube, download Apple (AAPL.O) iTunes or listen to Webcasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RealNetworks' (RNWK.O) RealPlayer once dominated the field. The Commission found Microsoft illegally built its own Windows Media Player into every copy of Windows sold in order to disadvantage companies such as Real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real won a $761 million settlement from Microsoft in a U.S. case involving the same issue in 2005. The Commission ordered Microsoft sell an additional version of Windows without Media Player, which the company did. Almost no one bought it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court could endorse that order, or it may throw out the remedy, giving Microsoft a partial win. It could go yet further by throwing out the remedy and telling the Commission it was mistaken to tell Microsoft how to design software, cutting the heart out of Commission authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NON-COMPLIANCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second aspect of the case covers connections between desktops and central computers, called servers, used to print documents, access files and sign on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It used to be that Microsoft did not build servers, but gave outside server producers the information they needed to connect with Windows. Microsoft eventually entered the server market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, rivals complained that when Microsoft offered new versions of its operating system, it stopped providing information they needed to interconnect. Microsoft's market share jumped and big competitors quit, the Commission found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission ordered Microsoft to make better interconnect information available. It says Microsoft has yet to comply adequately and fined it an additional 280.5 million euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft says it spent vast resources to comply but that the Commission has never given it clear instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At issue are whether companies can improve their products by developing new features, and whether a successful company must hand over its valuable intellectual property to competitors," Microsoft has argued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Lawyers wonder if the European court deciding the Microsoft antitrust decision next Monday will rely on explicit internal Microsoft (MSFT.O) memos quoting Bill Gates, first offered as evidence but later withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2004 European Commission decision found that Microsoft illegally bundled its own streaming media into the Windows operating system to damage rivals such as RealNetworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A special 13-member Grand Chamber of the European Union's Court of First Instance will rule whether the Commission was right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RealNetworks (RNWK.O) offered as evidence internal Microsoft memos from 1997 to show Microsoft's intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A memo by Microsoft's Jim Durkin recalled a meeting by Gates and other executives in which Gates said of RealNetworks: "This is a strategic area, and we need to win it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same memo dated June 5, 1997, quotes another senior Microsoft executive, Robert Muglia, as saying that RealNetworks is "like Netscape, the only difference is we have a chance to start this battle earlier in the game".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had its own legal troubles with Netscape. In 2001, a U.S. appeals court ruled Microsoft's successful tactics against Netscape constituted a serious violation of the basic U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RealNetworks charged later in a private antitrust suit that Microsoft had also employed tactics against it that violated the Sherman Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Microsoft settled the case and paid RealNetworks $761 million. RealNetworks, which had intervened in the European case on the side of the Commission, then dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RealNetworks withdrew its evidence -- which included memos, market data and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coalition of anti-Microsoft lawyers appeared before the court on April 24, 2006, during a week of hearings on the case, and presented the Durkin memo along and some of the other withdrawn evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is unclear whether the court is going to consider this part of the evidence because it was struck from the record," Maurits Dolmans, who formerly represented Real, told an antitrust conference in Fiesole, Italy, over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)

 Sept 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised its ratings on
three U.S. real estate investment trusts and downgraded three
others, and said it expected the credit markets to remain
choppy over the near term.

 The brokerage said it remained neutral on REITs and
continued to anticipate modest returns in 2007.

 In a research note, the brokerage said it did not see a
near-term catalyst as long as credit markets remained
distressed and lenders continued to take a cautious view of
commercial real estate.

 The brokerage said it favored the industrial, New York city
office and select retail names within the REIT universe.

 The brokerage changed its ratings on the following
companies. Company Name                        Current Rating

half of 2008 because of a robust physical market, stressed mine
output and reduced scrap supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has 95 percent of the operating system market for the world's 1 billion computers and servers. It has paid $5.6 billion in fines and settlements so far in private and public antitrust actions, but avoided any major forced changes in its business practices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- U.S. courts found in 2000 and 2001 that it abused its monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- The European Commission, finding in 2004 that Microsoft abused its dominance, ordered a change in business practices. It fined the company 497 million euros ($685.4 million) then in 2006 imposed an extra penalty of 280.5 million euros for not complying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Microsoft has paid more than $4.5 billion to settle private cases. That includes $750 million to AOL-Time Warner in 2003, $2 billion to Sun Microsystems JAVA.O, $440 million to InterTrust Technologies, $536 million to Novell NOVL.O, $20 million to the Computer  Communications Industry Association in 2004 and $761 million to RealNetworks (RNWK.O) in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- The South Korean Fair Trade Commission fined Microsoft $32 million in 2005 for blocking competition and ordered it to separate its instant messaging system from Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Hungary raided a Microsoft subsidiary this year on suspicion of abusing its market power in dealing with software distributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The European Commission
imposed two remedies and a fine against Microsoft (MSFT.O) in
March 2004 after judging the software giant competed unfairly.
The company challenged that decision at the Court of First
Instance in Luxembourg. The European Union's executive arm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; -- Fined Microsoft 497 million euros ($680.3 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -- Found Microsoft bundled its streaming audiovisual
software, Windows Media Player, with the Windows operating
system to displace others such as RealNetworks' (RNWK.O) Real
Player. It ordered Microsoft to offer a version of Windows
without the player. Microsoft did, but few people bought it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -- Found Microsoft failed to disclose needed information to
rival makers of work group server software used for printing,
signing on and keeping track of files. It said Microsoft must
provide interoperability information so rival servers would work
as well with desktop Windows as Microsoft's own product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission fined Microsoft 280.5 million euros in 2006
for failing to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For preview story, click on [ID:nL10398398]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For factbox on Microsoft's legal troubles: [ID:nL01147732]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For chronology, click on: [ID:nL10758987]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For run-down of past major antitrust cases: [ID:nL1042033]

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - On a cloudless summer day, Manish Prabhu stares out at a converted soccer field thousands of miles from his native India and watches a cricket ball skip past some fielders dressed in white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an unlikely place for a game of cricket, but Prabhu has spent hundreds of afternoons playing with the Microsoft Cricket Club on this bumpy turf near the company's campus in Redmond, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The chance to play so much cricket surprised me," said Prabhu, a senior program manager at Microsoft Corp.'s automotive business. "There is someone in almost every business team at Microsoft that I've played cricket with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's cricket program -- comprising four teams that compete against other local teams -- is not just a corporate softball team for the globalization era. It is a valuable tool in keeping the company's largest minority group happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competing against fast-growing technology companies in India offering jobs with handsome pay raises and quick promotions, Microsoft has to work harder these days to attract and retain the best and brightest Indian engineering talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Microsoft like many technology companies is being squeezed by U.S. immigration quotas limiting the number of work visas issued to foreign nationals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, as Microsoft has nearly quadrupled its workforce, it has hired scores of computer science graduate students from India who have stay on to work in the United States after finishing graduate school here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees of Indian descent estimate they make up about 15 percent of Microsoft's 35,000 workers in the greater Seattle area. The company does not keep track of such figures, but said it has made adjustments for changes in its workforce demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our programs and policies have changed given the diversity that has come into the company," said Mylene Padolina, a senior diversity consultant at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANGES IN REDMOND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veteran "Microsofties" have noticed the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hired by Microsoft in India in 1995, Sukhvinder Singh Gulati recalls visiting the Redmond campus early in his career and finding only a handful of Indians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you saw an Indian on campus, you would be jumping for joy," said Gulati, who is a senior lead program manager in Microsoft's unified communication division. "Today there are thousands and thousands of Indians working at Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now people can feel at home at work," he said. "The friendships you've made at work also transfer to friendships outside the work hours. That helps a lot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft celebrated major Indian holidays this year like Republic Day in January and Independence Day in August with on-campus events that included art displays, musical acts and special food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Microsoft opened two Indian food stalls that operate inside the company's cafeterias. It also increased vegetarian options to suit Indian dietary needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly noticeable to Microsoft veterans has been the increase of female Indian employees working in Redmond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ava Gupta, who joined the company two months ago, said she was surprised to see Indian women regularly come to work wearing a sari, traditional clothing worn in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Outside of the World Bank or the United Nations, how often do you see people in America show up for work in their traditional clothing?" said Gupta, who works as a market researcher. "Here, I feel encouraged to be Indian."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRICKET WORLD CUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Cricket World Cup in March and April, Microsoft broadcast tournament matches from the Caribbean via closed circuit. Staff could watch the games from any television on campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 500 employees gathered to watch India's matches, but most of those fans went home disappointed. The team lost in the first round, dropping matches to Bangladesh and eventual runner-up Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can tell you Microsoft saved a lot of work hours because India got knocked out early," said Prabhu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cricket may be a male-dominated sport in India, but Microsoft's female Indian employees are leading the way to spark the sport's growth in the greater Seattle area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A local women's cricket league has more than 100 members and around three-quarters of those players are from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's giving people like Sangita Jayaraman, a program manager at Microsoft, a chance to cash in on years of being a "couch cricketer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of us never really had the opportunity to play cricket back home," said Jayaraman. "There are probably more women playing cricket here than in all of India."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Vanessa Hudgens, the star of the wholesome, made-for-kids TV movie hit "High School Musical," apologized on Friday for a nude photo of her on the Web and Walt Disney Co. said it was sticking by the performer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some parents of her young fans voiced dismay over the photo, which shows Hudgens, 18, smiling and standing naked directly in front of the camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to apologize to my fans, whose support and trust means the world to me," Hudgens said in a statement issued about a day after the photo surfaced. "I am embarrassed over this situation and regret having ever taken these photos. I am thankful for the support of my family and friends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Disney said it hoped Hudgens had learned a valuable lesson. "Vanessa has apologized for what was obviously a lapse in judgment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Disney representative said the photo would not affect its decision to cast Hudgens in the third film of the "High School Musical" franchise and that negotiations for the cast and creative team were continuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Friday, a representative for Hudgens confirmed the image was of Hudgens but said it "was taken privately."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a personal matter and it is unfortunate that this has become public," the representative said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudgens has starred in "High School Musical" and "High School Musical 2" as Gabriella, the sweet, innocent science geek whose romance with athlete Troy, played by Zac Efron, is chronicled in the two hugely popular made-for-television movies on the squeaky-clean Disney Channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudgens and Efron, who date in real life, were so chaste on screen they did not even kiss until the end of the second film, a climactic moment marked by fireworks going off behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two movies form the cornerstone of one of Disney's most lucrative franchises for preteen girls and a third is planned for release to theaters next year. The second film debuts on Disney Channels in other countries this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'VERY PRIVATE PERSON'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Teen magazine interview released earlier this week, Hudgens described herself as "a very private person" with "very good morals" who enjoyed serving as a role model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been brought up with very good morals and I'm not going to go out and do something I don't want other kids to do," she said in the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some parents of young fans were outraged by the photo, saying it tarnished Hudgens' image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She's damaged," Renee Rollins-Greenberg, a Los Angeles mother of two, told Reuters. "She's got this teeny-bop audience, young preteens and younger, who are admiring her and thinking she's this wonderful, pure innocent person. Eighteen is awfully young for this kind of display."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm devastated because I have an 8-year-old for which I now have to have an explanation," said another Los Angeles-area mother, Rosie Konkel. "She's always looked at this character as a very smart and proper young lady."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"High School Musical 2" debuted on Disney Channel last month to a record audience of 17.2 million viewers to become the most-watched individual program in cable TV history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show's soundtrack debuted at No. 1 on national album sales charts, where it has remained for the past three weeks, selling nearly 1.2 million copies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds Congressional activity, closing prices) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), which has one of the largest U.S. student lending businesses, said on Friday it will hire up to 150 Indianapolis-based workers from Nelnet Inc (NNI.N) to expand its loan-origination operations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The third-largest U.S. bank said its Chase Education Finance unit has signed a letter of intent to offer jobs to the workers and will also sublease Nelnet offices in Indianapolis. It expects to add the employees late this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nelnet, a student loan company, announced plans on Thursday to cut 400 jobs, or 12 percent of its work force, citing expected changes in lending laws that could reduce lenders' profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Both houses of Congress voted overwhelmingly on Friday to cut government subsidies to student lenders such as JPMorgan, Nelnet and Sallie Mae SLM.N and use the money to boost student aid by $20 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The White House has said President George W. Bush will sign the bill into law. The bill is expected to shake up an $85 billion annual business following months of scandals involving kickbacks and conflicts of interest implicating lenders and college officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan said it oversees more than $12 billion of student loans. In Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, JPMorgan shares closed down 69 cents at $43.52, while Nelnet shares fell 35 cents to $17.77. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by Kevin Drawbaugh in Washington, D.C.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by John Wallace/Andre Grenon; Reuters Messaging: jon.stempel.reuters.com@reuters.net +1 646 223 6317)) Keywords: JPMORGANCHASE NELNET/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Singapore Petroleum Co.
(SPC) SPCS.SI and partner Chevron (CVX.N) expect to invest in
a clean fuels plant within the next six months, which may cost
up to US$200 million, The Business Times reported on Wednesday,
quoting a top SPC executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The plant will produce ultra-low sulphur gasoline at their
joint venture Singapore Refining Company (SRC) refinery, the
paper said, quoting Singapore Petroleum chief executive Koh Ban
Heng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two joint venture partners are also considering a coker
plant, the first by Singapore's refining industry, to upgrade
heavy fuel oil into more valuable products like gasoline and
diesel. This could cost $300-$400 million, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plans follow the start of construction for a $121

capability of the 285,000 barrels per day SRC refinery, even as
it focuses on growing its upstream exploration and production
(EP) activities to become a more integrated oil and gas
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We need to grow EP to balance our reliance on downstream
refining which is very volatile," Koh told the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "By 2010, we are targetting EP to contribute up to 30
percent of revenue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Business Times said the Singapore firm has a war-chest
of $650 million to $1 billion, which could be invested in more
exploration and production assets.

&lt;p&gt;LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's new visa requirement for U.S. citizens visiting the South American country will take effect on December 1, the Bolivian foreign minister said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measure was first announced in January by President Evo Morales, who said it was a matter of reciprocity because the United States required Bolivians to have a visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"U.S. citizens who come to the country as tourists won't be able to step onto Bolivian territory without a visa from December 1," Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca was quoted as saying by state news agency ABI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a few Latin American and Caribbean countries -- among them Brazil, Cuba and Paraguay -- require American tourists to have visas for short visits. Chile makes U.S. nationals pay an entry fee, but they do not have to apply for a visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choquehuanca said U.S. tourists will be able to obtain the visa at point of entry by paying $134, a similar amount to what Bolivians pay for a U.S. visa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)

 Sept 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded the U.S.
beverage sector to "attractive" from "neutral," saying U.S.
profit performance could be much stronger in 2008 with a more
benign commodity cost outlook and several recent product
additions.

 In a note dated Sept. 10, the brokerage said it upgraded
PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) to "buy" from "neutral." PepsiCo joined
Molson Coors Brewing Co (TAP.N), Hansen Natural Corp HANS.O
and Coca Cola Co (KO.N) as its top picks, it added.

 The brokerage raised its 2008 estimates for the U.S. soft
drink companies by 1 percent to 4 percent saying aluminum and
corn costs have moderately retreated and would be neutral for
2008 at current levels.

 Goldman Sachs said it continued to see Coca Cola
Enterprises Inc (CCE.N) as "dead money" as it was trading at a
premium to its Pepsi system peers despite more limited
international growth potential.

 The following table lists the companies with the new price
targets:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds Pfizer statement, closing stock price, details on drug's use, cancer risk) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Lisa Richwine &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    WASHINGTON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - A potential human carcinogen has been found in batches of Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) AIDS drug, Viracept, U.S. officials and the drugmaker said on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pregnant women and children who are starting HIV therapy should not be given the drug until further notice, Pfizer and the Food and Drug Administration said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tests detected the presence of ethyl methanesulfonate, or EMS, a chemical formed during manufacturing, Pfizer said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    EMS is a "potential human carcinogen," the FDA and Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Studies suggest EMS may cause cancer and birth defects in animals, but no data for humans exist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    EMS levels were "substantially lower" than those that prompted Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX) to recall the same drug in Europe, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Viracept, known generically as nelfinavir, belongs to a class of AIDS drugs called protease inhibitors. It is a key part of many drug cocktails used to suppress the HIV virus that causes AIDS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Pfizer is working with the FDA to prospectively limit EMS levels in Viracept, while still considering the immediate needs of patients on therapy," a company statement said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In a letter to doctors, Pfizer said manufacturing changes would reduce EMS levels so the theoretical increased cancer risk for adults over a lifetime would be less than 1 case per 100,000 people exposed.  Pediatric patients who are stable on Viracept-containing regimens may continue to be treated with the drug, the company said. Pregnant women currently taking Viracept should be switched to an alternative medicine until the manufacturing changes are made, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For pregnant women with no alternative treatment options, "FDA and Pfizer agree that the risk-benefit ratio remains favorable for the continued use of Viracept," the letter said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In August, authorities suspended Roche's license to market Viracept in the European Union because of the EMS finding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer shares fell 1.2 percent to close at $23.96 on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Mark Porter/Andre Grenon; Reuters Messaging: lisa.richwine.reuters.com@reuters.net +1 202 310 5691)) Keywords: PFIZER VIRACEPT/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

$750 million and another $350 million is needed to build a
380-kilometre pipeline, Vietnamese officials have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has also expressed interest in investing in power
plants in the area to use its offshore gas, a move that would
break its usual reluctance to invest outside of its core
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hanoi has been stepping up efforts to utilise its vast
offshore gas reserves to meet soaring energy demand, with
targets to double gas-fired power generation capacity to 7,000
megawatts by 2020.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said on 
Wednesday it is seeking arbitration to break a standoff with 
Venezuela over compensation for oil operations seized by 
Caracas earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company filed a request for arbitration with the 
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes on 
September 6, Exxon said in a filing with the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has not specified how much it wants for the 41.7 percent 
stake in the multi-billion dollar Cerro Negro project in 
Venezuela's Orinoco belt. Still, Exxon said its remaining net 
book investment in the project was about $750 million at the 
time the assets were expropriated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez pushed both Exxon 
Mobil and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) out of the country in June as 
part of a nationalization drive that also included utilities 
and telecommunications companies owned by international 
companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two oil companies lost their holdings in huge heavy oil 
projects in the Orinoco region. Four other oil majors -- 
Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Norway's Statoil (STL.OL), Britain's BP 
Plc (BP.L) and France's Total (TOTF.PA) -- signed pacts to 
stay, allowing Venezuela to take controlling interests in 
projects worth $30 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon Mobil has worked with the Venezuelan government to 
reach an agreement regarding compensation based on the fair 
market value of the assets," company spokesman Len D'Eramo said 
in an email. "We are disappointed these discussions have not 
been successful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips said it is still in talks with the 
Venezuelan government and hopes to resolve the dispute 
amicably. Venezuelan authorities declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The International Centre for Settlement of Investment 
Disputes is an autonomous international organization closely 
linked with the World Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has opted for arbitration two and a half months after 
the nationalization. The company has developed a reputation for 
taking a hard-line with countries that seek to change the terms 
of existing contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They do have a duty to their shareholders to preserve all 
value in the company. You can't take a three-quarter billion 
dollar write-off and just call it a day," said Dino Barajas, a 
partner at the Global Projects Group at Paul, Hastings, 
Janofsky  Walker LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's more than just a show of force, (Exxon Mobil is) 
signaling to the market that they are going to preserve their 
rights wherever in the world controversy arises."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon shares closed up 0.8 percent at $87.65 on the New 
York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, as oil prices hit a new 
record earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Brian Ellsworth in Caracas))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on
Wednesday a Canadian federal court found that a generic product
proposed by Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd would infringe its patent
covering a crystalline form of atorvastatin, the active
ingredient in Lipitor,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Canadian Federal Court in Toronto issued an order

order in connection with a second patent covering a process for
making amorphous atorvastatin, which expires in July 2016.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds quotes from California group attorney, Microsoft attorney) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - A group of states on Tuesday asked a federal judge overseeing Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) antitrust oversight agreement to extend sections of it to 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Attorney Stephen Houck, speaking for California and several other states, asked for an extension for a portion of the 2002 consent decree settlement that deals with middleware, the programs that connect software with the operating system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    That portion is set to expire in two months, but Houck asked for an additional five years "to make sure that Microsoft does in fact practice what it preaches." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Under the settlement, Microsoft was required to create a Microsoft Communications Protocol Program, or MCPP, to allow software created for Microsoft's Windows operating systems to also work on rival operating systems like Unix and Linux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Clearly this has not happened," Houck told the hearing in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. "None of the parties in their filings claim that the MCPP has been successful." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He also criticized Microsoft for delays in putting out documentation for MCPP, telling District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly that he did not know if the problem was Microsoft's "incompetence," "negligence" or "willfulness." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft's lawyer, Rick Rule, said any further extension of the court's MCPP oversight was premature as oversight of this portion of the agreement had already been extended from 2007 to 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The appropriate time to consider whether this should be extended is 2009," Rule told the judge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Kollar-Kotelly issued no immediate ruling. The parties are due to file written submissions next month with a further court hearing set for Nov. 6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Reporting by Diane Bartz) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Braden Reddall; Diane.Bartz@reuters.com; 202-898-8313)) Keywords: MICROSOFT/ANTITRUST  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;REYKJAVIK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and a Time
Warner executive are in late-stage talks on taking a combined
8.5 percent stake in Icelandic geothermal company Geysir Green
Energy for some $30 million, Geysir said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Such a deal would make Goldman (GS.N) the first foreign
player to invest in Iceland's burgeoning geothermal sector, a
development that has provoked protests from some Icelanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. investment bank and New York-based Time Warner
executive vice president Olafur Johann Olafsson are each looking
at investments in Geysir, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geysir Green Energy is a consortium founded earlier this
year to promote international projects using the earth's natural
heat to generate power. Its biggest shareholders are FL Group
FL.IC, Atorka Group and Glitnir Bank GLB.IC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm has holdings in Iceland Drilling, Enex (011090.KS),
Exorka International, Icelandic utility Hitaveita Sudurnesja and
North American energy firm Western GeoPower WGP.V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Since the company was founded, we have been aware of
interest from foreign companies who wanted to take part in what
we are doing," Geysir Chief Executive Asgeir Margeirsson told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We decided however to limit ourselves to partners that
could bring something of value for us to the table. Goldman
Sachs and Olafur Johann Olafsson fulfilled those criteria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SOARING DEMAND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Goldman's knowledge and connections would help
Geysir expand in North America, one of its focus markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global energy requirements are expected to soar in coming
years, with a growing proportion being met by sustainable
production rather than traditional carbon-based sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geysir said research on geothermal prospects in the United
States shows the energy source could potentially fill up to 20
percent of California's electricity demand, 60 percent of
Nevada's and 30 percent of Hawaii's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think the time for geothermal has come," Margeirsson
said. "We have laid the foundations for the continuous build up
for our expansion abroad. We want to show the world that we know
how to use geothermal energy and maximize its use."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The prospect of foreigners investing in Iceland's energy
sector has aroused some concern among residents, many of whom
believe such resources should stay in the hands of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry Minister Ossur Skarphedinsson said in a radio
interview on Wednesday he will keep a close eye on the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Opposition leaders have also voiced concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It seems to me that foreign companies are sneaking into
Icelandic energy resources via the back door," Gudni Agustsson,
chairman of the Progressive Party, one of three parties that
form the opposition, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Margeirson downplayed the concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is not our energy resources they are after, it is our
knowledge and our skills they want. We have successfully turned
our geothermal knowledge into export goods," he said.

are currently assessing the situation," said Exxon spokeswoman Prem Nair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's refineries in Baytown, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
were unaffected by the storm, Nair said.

is preparing for arbitration with ExxonMobil after failing to reach

&lt;p&gt; Exxon (XOM.N) said on Wednesday it had filed a request with the

contract for the nationalization of their multibillion dollar
Orinoco assets. Conoco said recently it could reach an amicable
solution with Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The nationalization of the Orinoco operations was part of a
drive by leftist President Hugo Chavez to seize more control of
assets including telecommunications and utilities companies in his
campaign to push Venezuela toward a socialist state.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats Sept 13 story)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi and Eric Auchard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Next week's
European antitrust ruling against Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is a
legacy of its past behavior, but competitors say the company's
current strategy is a sign of history repeating itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, faces a
decision on Monday from Europe's Court of First Instance on
whether the European Commission was justified in ruling the
desktop computer software leader abused its near monopoly to
push out rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ruling is the latest in a decade of antitrust cases
against the company and it comes two months before the November
expiration of most elements of the consent decree that settled
a landmark U.S. antitrust case five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That decree, under which Microsoft has been operating
since, covers the company's ties to computer makers, how its
software works in various categories of software and
enforcement to ensure it does not repeat past practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A new stable of competitors, who see ways to use the
Internet to break Microsoft's grip on desktop computing, say
the penalties from the antitrust rulings were ineffective and
have not changed the company's tactics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is not a revelation. They are a known quantity in
their business practices and ethics and their approach to
industry," said Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com
(CRM.N), a maker of Web-delivered business software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If it could, Microsoft would like to stop innovation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is an age-old criticism lobbed against Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A decade ago, it was rivals like Netscape, creators of
pioneering Web browser software, and Sun Microsystems JAVA.O,
inventor of Java software that is the primary programming
alternative to Microsoft's tools, who clashed with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those companies have given way to new competitors like Web
search leader Google Inc. (GOOG.O), Adobe Systems (ADBE.O), a
maker of graphic and Web design software, and Salesforce.com
who are looking to circumvent Microsoft's dominance on the
desktop by delivering software as "services" over the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said it has met the
requirements of its settlement with the U.S. government -- an
assessment supported by the U.S. Department of Justice -- and
new competitors have emerged as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While there are some companies who will use the press and
government processes to advance their interests and invoke
their view of competition law, I think we are working quite
well with most ... firms," said Dave Heiner, Microsoft deputy
general counsel who leads the company's compliance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He highlighted the growing ties between his company and old
adversaries such as Novell Inc NOVL.O in business software
and with Sun Microsystems, which this week said it planned to
more fully embrace Windows to run its own computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOOGLE VOICES CRITICISM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the past year, Google, now Microsoft's biggest rival,
has contested the software maker's move to embed its own method
of searching for documents inside the latest version of
Windows, known as Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In June, Microsoft agreed to change Vista in the operating
system's next major update to make it easier for users to
select other desktop search programs. Google was not satisfied
and asked for the consent decree to be extended indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It argued that Microsoft's desktop search cripples
competing products offered by Google, X1, Copernic, Yahoo Inc
(YHOO.O) and Ask from searching inside Vista computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given Microsoft's history of aggressively minimizing the
impact of court-ordered relief, it is appropriate for the court
to use its authority to extend the final judgment," attorneys
for Google wrote in a friend of the court filing in June to
federal Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A rival who declined to be identified because they do
business with Microsoft said the company is looking to wean
customers away from open Web standards in favor of software
optimized to run best on Microsoft servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new threats to industry competition are in technical
battles for standards governing security, multimedia, databases
and the interaction with Web servers, the competitor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The days when Microsoft could vanquish rivals by building
new features into its dominant desktop software, a practice
known as "bundling," may be over, according to one analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft has realized as a company that each individual
product is going to have to compete and be best-of-breed, or
close, or people will use something else," said Matt Rosoff,
analyst at independent research firm Directions on Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rosoff pointed to how even though Microsoft makes its own
Windows Live search engine the default option for its leading
Internet Explorer Web browser, it has failed to gain much
ground on Google, the dominant Web search service provider.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said on
Friday it was restarting units that had been shut earlier this
week at its Fawley refinery in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon closed several units after a power disruption resulted
in flaring on Wednesday at Britain's largest
326,000-barrels-per-day plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Electrical power to the units has been restored. We are now
restarting the units," Exxon said in a statement. "Our focus
remains on safely returning operations to normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon spokesman declined to specify which units had been
closed or when the plant would return to normal operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The units' closures came two months after the company was in
July forced to shut the Fawley refinery entirely and chemical
manufacturing sites after a fire broke out at a unit producing
steam to run other systems.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa said on Thursday it won approval 
of a registration statement from the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission, a key step in the world's largest credit 
card network's plan to go public by early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Visa first outlined plans last October to float a majority 
of the company, now owned by its 13,400 member banks, in an 
initial public offering to be held within 12 to 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a letter to the member banks, Chief Executive Joseph 
Saunders called approval of the registration statement 
"critical" to the restructuring and said Visa is pursuing an 
"aggressive timeline" to obtain approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The restructuring contemplates a new publicly traded 
entity, Visa Inc, that will combine Visa USA, Visa 
International and Visa Canada. Another affiliate, Visa Europe, 
will remain a membership association and take a minority stake 
in Visa Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; San Francisco-baed Visa has said it intends to use IPO

potentially hefty legal bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa and the smaller MasterCard Inc (MA.N), which is based 
in Purchase, New York, face a variety of antitrust lawsuits 
from rivals and retailers, some of which accuse them of price

Inc posted net income of $856.4 million, or $1.10 per share, on

June 30. Visa USA accounted for 71 percent of profit and 70 
percent of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa's roots date to 1958 when a Bank of America Corp 
(BAC.N) predecessor created the blue, white and gold 
BankAmericard, helping pave the way for the modern credit card 
business. That card has evolved into Visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MasterCard went public in May 2006 in a $2.4 billion IPO 
and its shares have since more than tripled. Morgan Stanley

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A European Union court will decide on Monday whether Microsoft abused its near-monopoly position on the world's 1 billion computers and servers to push smaller competitors out of the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission ruled in 2004 that Microsoft used its Windows operating system, running on 95 percent of the world's computers and servers, to choke off competition from rival makers of server software and streaming media software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft challenged that decision, asking a special 13-judge Grand Chamber of the Court of First Instance to throw out the Commission's finding. It said the Commission was interfering with its right to design software as it saw fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court will hand down its ruling on live television on Monday shortly after 9:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. EDT), focusing on five aspects of the Commission's 2004 decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the court will rule whether to cut the 497 million euro ($689.9 million) fine the Commission imposed on Microsoft. Any change would have mostly symbolic value because the penalty makes no difference to Microsoft's bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, it will decide whether to overturn sanctions imposed on Microsoft for illegally bundling its Windows Media Player with the Windows operating system. Microsoft was ordered to sell a version of Windows without Windows Media Player. Few bought it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, it will decide whether the underlying decision on bundling was incorrect, which would automatically cancel the sanctions. The Commission found Microsoft had bundled Windows Media Player to hurt such rivals as RealNetworks, which once dominated the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, media software is used to watch Google's YouTube, download Apple iTunes or listen to Webcasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the court will decide whether to throw out sanctions requiring Microsoft make its software run more smoothly with that of rival work group servers, the so-called "interoperability" issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission says Microsoft has yet to comply with this sanction and has fined it 280.5 million euros so far for failure to do so, with more threatened. If the sanctions are invalidated, that would put an end to the continuing enforcement and likely require a return of the fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the court will decide whether to throw out the interoperability decision itself, which would automatically invalidate the sanction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission says Microsoft, by making its own servers interoperate with desktop PCs better than those of its rivals, drove others from the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Commission's power is preserved, no matter whether the sanctions are thrown out, it will be able to press ahead against Microsoft on a series of other pending complaints. Otherwise, it may have to back off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies around the world are waiting to see whether the court will cut into the Commission's power. In addition to Microsoft, the Commission has pending antitrust cases and complaints involving Intel, Qualcomm, Rambus and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's Court of First Instance rules on Monday on a challenge by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) against a 2004 antitrust ruling by the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are profiles of some main players in the case, in which the Commission found Microsoft had abused its dominance of personal computer operating systems, hurting smaller competitors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BO VESTERDORF (b. 1945)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court of First Instance President Bo Vesterdorf of Denmark became a judge at the court in 1989 and its president in 1999. September 17 is his last day before retirement. Under his leadership the court has increasingly reversed European Commission decisions.

Gates plans to step down from a day-to-day role at Microsoft in 2008 and devote his time to his charitable foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Known for his boisterous promotion of Microsoft, Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000. Ballmer, whose personal wealth has been estimated at $15 billion by Forbes Magazine, has the task of finding new growth areas for Microsoft while protecting its traditional computer software business from an array of nimble and unafraid competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has 95 percent of the operating system market for the world's 1 billion computers and servers. It has paid $5.6 billion in fines and settlements so far in private and public antitrust actions, but avoided any major forced changes in its business practices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- U.S. courts found in 2000 and 2001 that it abused its monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- The European Commission, finding in 2004 that Microsoft abused its dominance, ordered a change in business practices. It fined the company 497 million euros ($685.4 million) then in 2006 imposed an extra penalty of 280.5 million euros for not complying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Microsoft has paid more than $4.5 billion to settle private cases.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Nextel Corp (S.N) said on Monday it would offer a new Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Web and local business search application on its phones using a technology that pinpoints a caller's location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting on Tuesday, the number-three U.S. wireless company will also offer customers a download of a new voice-recognition search product from Microsoft to allow users to find local businesses by simply speaking into a handset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first offering from a wireless carrier to use the speech technology and voice database Microsoft acquired when it bought Tellme Networks this year for about $800 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprint's upgraded offerings from Microsoft's Windows Live represent the next stage of their partnership to cash in on advertising from a budding mobile Internet search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The location-aware mobile search allows cell phone users to search for businesses close to their current location without typing in street addresses or zip codes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not single-handedly going to unlock the potential for local mobile search, but it's certainly a step in the right direction," said Greg Sterling, founding principal of research firm Sterling Market Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet heavyweights Google Inc (GOOG.O), Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) and Microsoft are racing to strike alliances with handset makers and carriers all around the world to provide a host of ad-supported services, including search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seeing how lucrative Web search has become, Internet companies are targeting the mobile search market because of the number of handsets in the world and the "relevance" -- crucial to how much advertisers will pay -- of advertising delivered to a device found in almost everyone's pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprint customers will find a new Windows Live search bar on Sprint's menu page when they access the Web. It will let users search the Internet, local businesses and Sprint's own network at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The location-aware search allows a user to type "coffee" to bring up a list of nearby coffee shops. Using voice search, a user can just say "coffee" and a list of results will appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprint finds the whereabouts of its customers using mobile phone towers to narrow down the user's location to within about 100 yards in densely populated areas. Sprint customers must first give permission before the feature is activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterling said the new search products from Sprint and Microsoft represent an accelerated improvement in terms of user experience, a key facet to building the necessary audience to drive advertisers to pay large sums for ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new services will be available on most Sprint phones and at no additional cost to Sprint data subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) and its investment banking partner in China may part ways, potentially raising questions about future control of the Wall Street firm's business there, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fang Fenglei, chairman of a joint venture called Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Co., has said he plans to start a private-equity fund that could raise as much as $2 billion, the Wall Street Journal said, citing "people familiar with the situation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman linked up with Fang nearly three years ago to underwrite offerings in the local Chinese market, the Wall Street Journal said. Goldman lent Fang $100 million to set up a brokerage with which the U.S. firm could ally, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether Fang will maintain a formal relationship with Goldman, and if he leaves, the Wall Street firm may not take a big hit, the newspaper said. It is also unclear how much business Fang has won for Goldman since the partnership began, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also not clear whether Fang's securities firm would want to maintain its share in the joint venture, and if so, it might try to exercise control against Goldman's will, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Wilchins)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects day of the week in paragraph 1 to Monday from
Tuesday)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Bookings at Walt Disney
Co's (DIS.N) theme parks are strong for the December quarter
and there is no evidence of a downturn caused by the U.S.
economy, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs also told an investor conference that bookings for
the fiscal first quarter were up over the year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "It seems to me ... the estimation of how exposed our
theme park business is to the economic cycle is probably a bit
high. It's overestimated," he said at the Merrill Lynch Media
and Entertainment Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I know there's a lot of concern about where the economy is
going now, and I don't have any predictions for you about the
economy," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I look out into the first quarter -- fiscal quarter for us
next year, fourth calendar quarter -- bookings are up over the
prior year so there's no current evidence of a downturn,"
Staggs added. He did not give a specific figure for bookings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In August, Disney said fiscal fourth-quarter domestic
attendance comparisons would be challenging given the company's
successful 50th anniversary celebration last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs noted that the last downturn Disney saw in its theme
parks came after Sept 11, 2001 attacks on New York and
Washington, which had a direct impact on travel and tourism.
"People were afraid to get on airplanes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said that historically, attendance figures may have been
impacted if consumer confidence went up or down for three
consecutive months, but it was difficult to say if that
connection still existed.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft suffered a decisive antitrust defeat on Monday when a European Union court upheld a landmark ruling that the world's largest software maker had abused its dominant market position to crush rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-highest EU court dismissed the company's appeal on all key points against the 2004 European Commission ruling and upheld a record 497 million euro ($689.9 million) fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A jubilant EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the ruling should lead to a "significant drop" in Microsoft's 95 percent market share. Microsoft's top lawyer said it would affect the way the company markets its products in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in the U.S. software giant were down 1.14 percent in morning New York trade after the Luxembourg-based court's ruling, suggesting investors were not overly concerned about the implications for Microsoft's successful business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which oversees more than $1 billion including Microsoft shares, for clients, said: "Although this is probably a setback for Microsoft's strategy going forward, it's not that big a deal for investors. The fines have already been accounted for, so none of the stuff announced today had bottom-line impact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition experts said the ruling had serious long-term implications for EU regulation of the hi-tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's clearly a major defeat for Microsoft. There is no doubt it will spur the Commission on to regulate Microsoft much more significantly," said UK competition lawyer Chris Bright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also gives Kroes a green light to pursue other antitrust cases and complaints involving Intel, Qualcomm and Rambus, and to issue draft antitrust guidelines that were put on ice pending the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSUMER CHOICE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court said Microsoft was unjustified in tying new applications to its Windows operating system in a way that squeezed out rivals and harmed consumer choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU's Kroes told a news conference: "The court has confirmed that Microsoft can no longer prevent the market from functioning properly and consumers are entitled to benefit from choice and more innovative products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An appeal against the ruling is possible only on points of law and not of fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked how the Commission would assess progress in the Microsoft case, Kroes said: "A market level of much less than 95 percent would be a way of measuring success ... You can't draw a line and say exactly 50 (percent) is correct, but a significant drop in market share is what we would like to see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her spokesman later clarified that a fall in market share would be a logical consequence of fairer competition. A lawyer for Microsoft's rivals in the case said it was the abuse of the company's position that was the problem, not its market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Microsoft, competing on the merits, achieves more dominance, then so be it," Thomas Vinje, lawyer for the European Committee for Interoperable Systems (ECIS), told journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"DISAPPOINTING"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court endorsed Commission sanctions against Microsoft's tying together of software and refusal to give rival makers of office servers information to enable their products to work smoothly with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission ordered the company to sell a version of Windows without the Windows Media Player application used for video and music, which few have bought, and to share information allowing rivals' office servers to work smoothly with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court annulled only the EU regulator's imposition of a Microsoft-funded trustee to monitor compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith called the ruling unprecedented and disappointing, saying it gave the Commission "quite broad power and quite broad discretion".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He promised the company would comply fully and said it had not decided whether to appeal to the European Court of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which had argued that it was entitled to protect its patents and copyright, has used every legal recourse in every case brought against it by governments and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm has weathered a series of defeats in high profile antitrust cases over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroes declined to discuss the implications of the ruling for a pending complaint from ECIS against the new Microsoft Vista on grounds that this operating system too had problems with interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECIS and other rivals welcomed the court verdict as setting the ground rules for the company's future behavior and as a signal that EU authorities will not allow Microsoft to pursue anti-competitive practices with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another winner was the Free Software Foundation, which makes free, open software for workgroup servers. "Microsoft can consider itself above the law no longer," said Georg Greve, president of the FSF Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judges ordered Microsoft to pay the lion's share of the costs of the Commission and of business rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the original decision, the Commission has fined Microsoft a further 280.5 million euros, saying it had failed to comply with the interoperability sanction. The EU regulator is considering a further fine for non-compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(additional reporting by Georgina Prodhan in Frankfurt, Jonathan Cable in London, Mark John and Michele Sinner in Luxembourg, William Schomberg, Darren Ennis, Dale Hudson and Huw Jones in Brussels)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Diane Bartz &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice, which has been overseeing an antitrust settlement with Microsoft for five years, said on Monday it was "concerned" about a European court's decision to uphold an antitrust ruling against Microsoft (MSFT.O). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The European Court of First Instance (CFI), Europe's second-highest court, affirmed on Monday a 2004 European Commission ruling that Microsoft abused its overwhelming market position to crush competitors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are ... concerned that the standard applied to unilateral conduct by the CFI, rather than helping consumers, may have the unfortunate consequence of harming consumers by chilling innovation and discouraging competition," said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Thomas Barnett. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "U.S. courts recognize the potential benefits to consumers when a company, including a dominant company, makes unilateral business decisions, for example to add features to its popular products or license its intellectual property to rivals, or to refuse to do so," Barnett said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The European court also upheld a lower court's 497 million-euro ($690 million) fine. EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said she expected Microsoft's market share -- now about 95 percent -- to drop significantly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Department of Justice has been overseeing a 2002 settlement with Microsoft designed to stop it from using anticompetitive behavior to retain market share. Microsoft was found to have unlawfully used its monopoly in personal computer operating systems to discourage computer manufacturers from loading non-Microsoft software on their machines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Most of that settlement is scheduled to expire later this year but a group of states led by California has asked for big sections of it to be extended to 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    On Capitol Hill, a Florida Democrat expressed concern that the European ruling could trigger new antitrust cases and said he would hold hearings to discuss the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It would be disastrous if the court's decision against Microsoft leads to a deluge of new antitrust cases in Brussels, which appears to already be starting," said Rep. Robert Wexler, chairman of the Europe subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Intel (INTC.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Qualcomm (QCOM.O) were other possible EU targets, Wexler said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He said in a statement that he would call hearings to review the Microsoft ruling as well as the European Union's use of antitrust laws. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Braden Reddall; Diane.Bartz@reuters.com, 202-898-8313)) Keywords: MICROSOFT EU/USA &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment, byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Daisuke Wakabayashi &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SEATTLE, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Wall Street on Monday shrugged off Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) defeat in a European Union court, which upheld a landmark antitrust ruling against the world's largest software maker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts and investors said the decision by the second-highest EU court to dismiss Microsoft's appeal on all key points was not a surprise, and the lack of additional punitive damages was somewhat positive for the company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Microsoft were down 31 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $28.73 in afternoon trade on Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "They didn't hoist anything more on Microsoft," said Kim Caughey, a senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which oversees more than $1 billion, including Microsoft shares, for clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Although this is probably a setback for Microsoft's strategy going forward, it's not that big of a deal for investors. The fines have already been accounted for so none of the stuff announced today had bottom-line impact," said Caughey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier on Monday, the Luxembourg-based EU court dismissed Microsoft's appeal on all key points against a 2004 European Commission ruling and upheld a record 497 million euro ($689.9 million) fine.    Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said it has not yet decided whether to appeal to the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court. In the past, the company has taken its antitrust battles as far as it can go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The EU hasn't been favorable to Microsoft or any other company with a near-monopoly position so it wasn't expected that Microsoft would get anything too favorable," said Andy Miedler, senior technology analyst at Edward Jones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In the 2004 ruling, the European Commission ordered Microsoft to sell a version of its Windows operating system without the Windows Media Player application used for watching video and listening to music. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It was also ordered to share information to help rivals' computer servers to work smoothly with Windows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Neelie Kroes, Europe's top competition regulator, said  after Monday's ruling she would like to see a significant drop in market share of the Windows operating system, which sits on about 95 percent of the world's personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Morningstar analyst Toan Tran was surprised by Kroes' comment. "It's a little disconcerting that a regulator would say something like that, but ultimately people are going to vote with their wallets." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tran said the version of Windows without the Media Player, made specifically for the European market, does not sell well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A spokesman for Kroes later said a fall in market share would be a logical consequence of fairer competition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Gerald E.

of opportunity in time to drill a few wells for the first oil
to flow in the third quarter of next year, up to six months
before the original start plan for Frade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Patricia Pradal, business development director at
Chevron Brasil, said the additional ship rig would only be
available by mid-2008, after the end of its current contract.
The world market for drilling equipment is red-hot with oil
prices near record highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She said Chevron rented Noble Corp's (NE.N) "Leo Segerius"
rig for Frade. "With this contract, Chevron seeks to guarantee
full fulfillment of the expected schedule to obtain first oil
in early 2009," Pradal said in a written reply to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rig is now working off Brazil's coast on a contract for
state oil company Petrobras (PETR4.SA)(PBR.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The original Sedco-706 rig rented by Chevron for Frade from
Transocean Inc (RIG.N) should arrive in the third quarter of
2008 after its upgrade into a dynamic-positioning rig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A dynamic positioning system allows to automatically
maintain a vessel's position and heading by using its own
propellers and thrusters, where mooring or anchoring is not
possible as is often the case with deep-sea oil works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 100,000 barrels per day floating production storage and
offloading (FPSO) rig for Frade is being built in Dubai and 
is expected to arrive in July or August 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron expects to produce 20,000 barrels per day at Frade,
of which it owns 51.74 percent, in 2009. Output of heavy oil
averaging 18 on the API grade should peak at 80,000 bpd of oil
in 2011. Frade has about 250 million barrels of gross expected
reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brazil is one of the main areas of oil output growth in the
Americas and many foreign companies are looking for oil here.
Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Repsol-YPF (REP.MC) and Devon
Energy Corp (DVN.N) are already producing crude in Brazil.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - America's aging energy
infrastructure will require massive investment in order to make
much needed efficiency improvements, former Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) Chief Executive Lee Raymond said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "It's not enough to just look at solar cells or windmills
or whatever. You also have to get your head around the
infrastructure that's required to have those things be
effective and involved in the energy system," Raymond said,
speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's huge physically, without even debating where those
things are going to be built. It's huge financially, and it
takes a long time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raymond is now the chair of the U.S. National Petroleum
Council, a high-level board of U.S. oil company executives. The
group released a report this summer saying that while the world
is not running out of oil and natural gas, there are
accumulating risks to securing global supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report, entitled "Facing the Hard Truths About Energy,"
was a study to determine whether the world is running out of
oil. But it also addressed other obstacles the energy industry
is facing, including political risks, decaying infrastructure
and the possible effects of policies aimed at reducing
greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Raymond said the infrastructure problem extends across
both the oil and and power industries -- from pipelines to the
electric grid. He said it is important that government
understand the issue because it means any changes to the
nation's energy policy will require years of effort before any
benefits are felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we decide to do something, we have to stick with it for
a long, long period of time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raymond helmed Exxon Mobil for an eventful 12 years,
steering the company through the consolidation of the industry
and the start of the current bull market for oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares more than tripled while he was CEO,
but Raymond was a top target of environmentalists, who felt he
was overly skeptical of global warming and not supportive of
renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raymond declined to directly discuss climate change, but
did address the possibility of carbon constraints and the
necessity of improved energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He spoke out against raising gasoline taxes to lower
demand, saying they would restrict economic growth. He also
said the idea was unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Whoever passed that tax in Washington wouldn't be there
the next term," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Michael Erman)

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Wall Street on Monday mostly shrugged off Microsoft Corp's defeat in a European Union court, which upheld a landmark antitrust ruling against the world's largest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts and investors said the decision by the second-highest EU court to dismiss Microsoft's appeal on all key points was not a surprise, and the lack of additional punitive damages was somewhat positive for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft were down 36 cents, or 1.24 percent, to $28.68 in afternoon Nasdaq trade, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They didn't hoist anything more on Microsoft," said Kim Caughey, a senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which oversees more than $1 billion, including Microsoft shares, for clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although this is probably a setback for Microsoft's strategy going forward, it's not that big of a deal for investors. The fines have already been accounted for, so none of the stuff announced today had bottom-line impact," said Caughey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Monday, the Luxembourg-based EU court dismissed Microsoft's appeal on all key points against a 2004 European Commission ruling and upheld a record 497 million euro ($689.9 million) fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said it has not yet decided whether to appeal to the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court. In the past, the company has taken its antitrust battles as far as it can go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The EU hasn't been favorable to Microsoft or any other company with a near-monopoly position, so it wasn't expected that Microsoft would get anything too favorable," said Andy Miedler, senior technology analyst at Edward Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2004 ruling, the European Commission ordered Microsoft to sell a version of its Windows operating system without the Windows Media Player application used for watching video and listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also ordered to share information to help rivals' computer servers work smoothly with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A few years ago, Microsoft may have put some resources into coming out with a version of Windows without the Media Player, but those costs are largely behind it," said Miedler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst on share reaction, rivals' lawyer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By David Lawsky and Sabina Zawadzki&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) suffered a
decisive antitrust defeat on Monday when a European Union court
upheld a landmark ruling that the world's largest software maker
had abused its dominant market position to crush rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-highest EU court dismissed the company's appeal
on all key points against the 2004 European Commission ruling
and upheld a record 497 million euro ($689.9 million) fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A jubilant EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the
ruling should lead to a "significant drop" in Microsoft's 95
percent market share. Microsoft's top lawyer said it would
affect the way the company markets its products in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in the U.S. software giant were down 1.14 percent in
morning New York trade after the Luxembourg-based court's
ruling, suggesting investors were not overly concerned about the
implications for Microsoft's successful business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group,
which oversees more than $1 billion including Microsoft shares,
for clients, said: "Although this is probably a setback for
Microsoft's strategy going forward, it's not that big a deal for
investors. The fines have already been accounted for, so none of
the stuff announced today had bottom-line impact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Competition experts said the ruling had serious long-term
implications for EU regulation of the hi-tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's clearly a major defeat for Microsoft. There is no
doubt it will spur the Commission on to regulate Microsoft much
more significantly," said UK competition lawyer Chris Bright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also gives Kroes a green light to pursue other antitrust
cases and complaints involving Intel (INTC.O), Qualcomm (QCOM.O)
and Rambus (RMBS.O), and to issue draft antitrust guidelines
that were put on ice pending the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONSUMER CHOICE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The court said Microsoft was unjustified in tying new
applications to its Windows operating system in a way that
squeezed out rivals and harmed consumer choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EU's Kroes told a news conference: "The court has
confirmed that Microsoft can no longer prevent the market from
functioning properly and consumers are entitled to benefit from
choice and more innovative products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An appeal against the ruling is possible only on points of
law and not of fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked how the Commission would assess progress in the
Microsoft case, Kroes said: "A market level of much less than 95
percent would be a way of measuring success ... You can't draw a
line and say exactly 50 (percent) is correct, but a significant
drop in market share is what we would like to see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her spokesman later clarified that a fall in market share
would be a logical consequence of fairer competition. A lawyer
for Microsoft's rivals in the case said it was the abuse of the
company's position that was the problem, not its market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If Microsoft, competing on the merits, achieves more
dominance, then so be it," Thomas Vinje, lawyer for the European
Committee for Interoperable Systems (ECIS), told journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "DISAPPOINTING"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The court endorsed Commission sanctions against Microsoft's
tying together of software and refusal to give rival makers of
office servers information to enable their products to work
smoothly with Windows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission ordered the company to sell a version of
Windows without the Windows Media Player application used for
video and music, which few have bought, and to share information
allowing rivals' office servers to work smoothly with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The court annulled only the EU regulator's imposition of a
Microsoft-funded trustee to monitor compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith called the ruling
unprecedented and disappointing, saying it gave the Commission
"quite broad power and quite broad discretion".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He promised the company would comply fully and said it had
not decided whether to appeal to the European Court of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which had argued that it was entitled to protect
its patents and copyright, has used every legal recourse in
every case brought against it by governments and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm has weathered a series of defeats in high profile
antitrust cases over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kroes declined to discuss the implications of the ruling for
a pending complaint from ECIS against the new Microsoft Vista on
grounds that this operating system too had problems with
interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ECIS and other rivals welcomed the court verdict as setting
the ground rules for the company's future behaviour and as a
signal that EU authorities will not allow Microsoft to pursue
anti-competitive practices with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another winner was the Free Software Foundation, which makes
free, open software for workgroup servers. "Microsoft can
consider itself above the law no longer," said Georg Greve,
president of the FSF Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges ordered Microsoft to pay the lion's share of the
costs of the Commission and of business rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the original decision, the Commission has fined
Microsoft a further 280.5 million euros, saying it had failed to
comply with the interoperability sanction. The EU regulator is
considering a further fine for non-compliance.

&lt;p&gt;Smith said the ruling was unprecedented and would have implications for future products of the world's biggest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The decision is not what we would have hoped for.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Mario Monti, who took the European Commission's antitrust action against Microsoft in 2004, said Monday's court ruling upholding the decision vindicated his rejection of a settlement with the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monti also praised his successor, European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, for her determination in carrying through the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By telephone from Milan, where he is now president of Bocconi University, Monti recalled that before his decision in March 2004 that Microsoft was abusing its market dominance, Microsoft President Steve Ballmer visited him in Brussels and offered a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although I was very tempted, I did not agree on the settlement proposed by Mr Ballmer," Monti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had Monti agreed to the deal the Commission would have lost control of new issues that could arise the in future, he said at the time. Less than one week after turning down the settlement idea, the landmark decision was issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal would have been "a nice way out, much less risky for the Commission" but would have failed to provide legal certainty, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monti said the precedent set by the ruling in the Court of First Instance (CFI) on Monday empowered the European Commission to act more quickly in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some critics have said the ruling comes too late. The Commission acknowledges that Microsoft's tactics long ago eliminated most of the competition that the Commission decision of 2004 meant to promote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the legal certainty generated by the ruling is necessary for the Commission to act as new instances of abuse of dominance arise in the high-tech industry, Monti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Microsoft appeals, he said, there is still much more legal certainty than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Italian was strong in his praise of Kroes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She displayed remarkable, continuing determination and vigor in pursuing the implementation of the decision", he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the decision is also a vindication for Monti's leadership. Monti rebuilt the confidence of his department after court setbacks in 2002, and the CFI also backed his decision to turn down a merger of General Electric and Honeywell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his time in Brussels, Monti sponsored a major overhaul of the antitrust and merger rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monti said although the European Union approach diverges from the views of the Justice Department of President George W. Bush, it matches those of the Justice Department under former President Bill Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton's Justice Department successfully won a major Sherman Act antitrust suit against Microsoft but the Bush administration accepted weak remedies that several states recently criticized as ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monti noted that there is no similar divergence between the states of the EU and Brussels, because the European Commission has clear authority in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A market level of much less than 95 percent would be a way of measuring success," European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told a news conference, referring to the market share of Microsoft's Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't draw a line and say exactly 50 (percent) is correct, but a significant drop in market share is what we would like to see," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft suffered a big defeat earlier when the EU's second-highest court, the Court of First Instance, backed a European Commission ruling from 2004 that the U.S. software giant illegally abused its market power to thwart competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission had decided Microsoft pushed out rivals by bundling Windows Media Player with its operating system and failed to give enough information to makers of server software for their products to run smoothly on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroes' spokesman, clarifying her comments, said abuse of a dominant market position, rather than dominance itself, was against the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once illegal abuse has been removed and competitors are free to compete on the merits, the logical consequence of that would be to expect Microsoft's market share to fall," spokesman Jonathan Todd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroes also said it was too early to see whether the judgment would affect the Commission's position on Microsoft's new Vista operating system, as well as other cases or complaints such as one involving chipmaker Intel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A spokesman for European Commissioner Neelie Kroes clarified her remarks on Microsoft on Monday, saying abuse of a dominant market position, rather than dominance itself, is against the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A European Union court backed the European Commission's landmark 2004 antitrust ruling against the software giant earlier in the day. After that, Kroes said she hoped to see a lowering of Microsoft's 95 percent market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly, holding a dominant market position is not a problem under antitrust law. Abuse of that dominance is," said spokesman Jonathan Todd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said what Kroes meant was that "once the illegal abuse has been removed and competitors are free to compete on the merits, the logical consequence of that would be to expect Microsoft's market share to fall".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co gives the following statement regarding the European Court of First Instance's judgment in the EU/Microsoft case: "We'll study this decision carefully, and if there are additional steps that we need to take in order to comply with it, we will take them. It will take us a little bit of time, at least over the next few hours, to read the decision carefully, but certainly that is one of our strongest convictions as we go forward... In addition, there's obviously a lot of work that has gone into our efforts to comply with the Commission's terms with respect to communications protocols and our duty to license them, a duty that obviously was reaffirmed by the court's decision today. We've made a lot of progress in that regard, and yet we all have to acknowledge that there are some issues that do remain open. As we read today's decision more carefully, we're hopeful that some aspects of it may add some clarity that will help us all implement these remaining parts of the decision. And as I said, if we need to take additional steps in order to comply with today's decision, we will do so."

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's Court of First Instance rules on Monday on a challenge by Microsoft Corp. against a 2004 antitrust ruling by the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are profiles of some main players in the case, in which the Commission found Microsoft had abused its dominance of personal computer operating systems, hurting smaller competitors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BO VESTERDORF (b. 1945)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court of First Instance President Bo Vesterdorf of Denmark became a judge at the court in 1989 and its president in 1999. September 17 is his last day before retirement. Under his leadership the court has increasingly reversed European Commission decisions. In Denmark, he headed the administrative law division in the Justice Ministry and served as a temporary judge in the court of appeal. He was also a university lecturer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARIO MONTI (b. 1943)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mario Monti of Italy, now the president of Bocconi University, was European Union competition commissioner from 1999 to 2004 and led the investigation into Microsoft. Monti tried to settle the case but concluded he would not. He had served as internal-market commissioner from 1995 to 1999. Monti now also serves as chairman of Bruegel, a European think tank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEELIE KROES (b. 1941)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neelie Kroes of the Netherlands succeeded Monti as competition commissioner in 2004 and pursued the Microsoft case. She had been on the boards of a number of large companies, before which she served as Dutch minister of transport, public works and telecommunications. She was also president of Nyenrode University and taught economics at Erasmus University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BILL GATES (b. 1955)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates founded the company with childhood friend Paul Allen and built it from a developer of niche software for hobbyist computer fans to a technology titan that is a player in everything from video games to Web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates' business savvy and technical acumen helped drive Microsoft's stratospheric rise during the 1990s, which made him one of the world's richest men and inspired a generation of technology entrepreneurs. Gates plans to step down from a day-to-day role at Microsoft in 2008 and devote his time to his charitable foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. He will remain the company's chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Ballmer (b. 1956)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Steve Ballmer joined Microsoft in 1980 after Gates, a former classmate at Harvard University, persuaded him to drop out of Stanford University business school to become the company's first business manager. Known for his boisterous promotion of Microsoft, Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000. Ballmer, whose personal wealth has been estimated at $15 billion by Forbes Magazine, has the task of finding new growth areas for Microsoft while protecting its traditional computer software business from an array of nimble and unafraid competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

Microsoft (MSFT.O), backed by a court ruling on Monday, sets a
precedent for the way dominant companies must behave.

 "That decision set an important precedent in terms of the
obligations of dominant companies to allow competition, in
particular in high-tech industries," EU Competition Commissioner
Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

 "The court ruling shows that the Commission was right to
take its decision. Microsoft must now comply fully with its
legal obligations to desist from engaging in anti-competitive
conduct. The Commission will do its utmost to ensure that
Microsoft complies swiftly," she said.

&lt;p&gt;Following is a statement released by the Court of First Instance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE ESSENTIALLY UPHOLDS THE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COMMISSION'S DECISION FINDING THAT MICROSOFT ABUSED ITS DOMINANT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; POSITION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Court has annulled certain parts of the decision relating to the appointment of a monitoring trustee, which have no legal basis in Community law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 23 March 2004 the European Commission adopted a decision finding that Microsoft had infringed Article 82 of the EC Treaty by abusing its dominant position by engaging in two separate types of conduct. The Commission also imposed a fine of more than 497 million euros on Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first type of conduct found to constitute an abuse consisted in Microsoft's refusal to supply its competitors with 'interoperability information' and to authorize them to use that information to develop and distribute products competing with its own products on the work group server operating system market, between October 1998 and the date of adoption of the decision. By way of remedy, the Commission required Microsoft to disclose the 'specifications' of its client/server and server/server communication protocols to any undertaking wishing to develop and distribute work group server operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second type of conduct to which the Commission took exception was the tying of Windows Media Player with the Windows PC operating system. The Commission considered that that practice affected competition on the media player market. By way of remedy, the Commission required Microsoft to offer for sale a version of Windows without Windows Media Player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to assist the Commission in monitoring Microsoft's compliance with the decision, the decision provided for a monitoring trustee to be appointed by the Commission from a list of persons drawn up by Microsoft. The monitoring trustee's primary responsibility would be to issue opinions, upon application by a third party or by the Commission, or on his own motion, on whether Microsoft was complying with the decision and on any issue that might be of interest with respect to the enforcement of the decision. He was to have access to Microsoft's assistance, information, documents, premises and employees and to the source code of the relevant Microsoft products. All the costs associated with the monitoring trustee, including his remuneration, were to be borne by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 7 June 2004 Microsoft brought an action before the Court of First Instance for annulment of the decision or for annulment or a substantial reduction of the fine imposed on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The refusal to supply the interoperability information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the Court confirms that the necessary degree of interoperability required by the Commission is well founded and that there is no inconsistency between that degree of interoperability and the remedy imposed by the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Court then observes that the Commission defined interoperability information as a detailed technical description of certain rules of interconnection and interaction that can be used within Windows work group networks to deliver work group services. The Court notes that the Commission emphasized that Microsoft's abusive refusal to supply concerned only the specifications of certain protocols and not the source code and that it was not its intention to order Microsoft to disclose its source code to its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Court also considers that the aim pursued by the Commission is to remove the obstacle for Microsoft's competitors represented by the insufficient degree of interoperability with the Windows domain architecture, in order to enable those competitors to offer work group server operating systems differing from Microsoft's on important parameters. In that connection, the Court rejects Microsoft's claims that the degree of interoperability required by the Commission is intended in reality to enable competing work group server operating systems to function in every respect like a Windows system and, accordingly, to enable Microsoft's competitors to clone or reproduce its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As to the question of the intellectual property rights covering the communication protocols or the specifications, the Court considers that there is no need to adjudicate on that question in order to determine the case. It observes that in adopting the decision the Commission proceeded on the presumption that Microsoft could rely on such rights or, in other words, it considered that it was possible that the refusal at issue was a refusal to grant a license to a third parties, thus opting for the solution which, according to the case-law, was the most favorable to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As regards the refusal to supply the interoperability information, the Court recalls that, according to the case-law, although undertakings are, as a rule, free to choose their business partners, in certain circumstances a refusal to supply on the part of a dominant undertaking may constitute an abuse of a dominant position. Before a refusal by the holder of an intellectual property right to license a third party to use a product can be characterized as an abuse of a dominant position, three conditions must be satisfied: the refusal must relate to a product or service indispensable to the exercise of an activity on a neighboring market; the refusal must be of such a kind as to exclude any effective competition on that market; and the refusal must prevent the appearance of a new product for which there is potential consumer demand. Provided that such circumstances are satisfied, the refusal to grant a license may constitute an abuse of a dominant position unless it is objectively justified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present case, the Court finds that the Commission did not err in considering that those conditions were indeed satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Court considers that the Commission was correct to conclude that the work group server operating systems of Microsoft's competitors must be able to interoperate with Windows domain architecture on an equal footing with Windows operating systems if they are to be capable of being marketed viably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absence of such interoperability has the effect of reinforcing Microsoft's competitive position on the market and creates a risk that competition will be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Court observes that the circumstance relating to the appearance of a new product must be assessed under Article 82(b) of the Treaty. It considers that the Commissions finding that Microsoft's refusal limits technical development to the prejudice of consumers within the meaning of that provision is not manifestly incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, the Court rejects Microsoft's arguments to the effect that the refusal is objectively justified because the technology concerned is covered by intellectual property rights. The Court notes that such justification would render ineffective the principles established in the case-law which are referred to above. The Court further considers that Microsoft has failed to show that if it were required to disclose the interoperability information that would have a significant negative effect on its incentives to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - An EU court ruling confirming Microsoft (MSFT.O) had abused its near-monopoly in computer operating systems sets the principles for the company's behavior, a lawyer for Microsoft's rivals said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Court of First Instance upheld a landmark 2004 European Commission antitrust decision that the software giant had abused its 95 percent share of the market in personal computer operating systems to elbow aside and damage smaller rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decision establishes principles for the behavior of this company. Microsoft should now finally comply with the Commission decision on operability," lawyer Thomas Vinje said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - A European Union court upheld a landmark 2004 European Commission antitrust decision against Microsoft (MSFT.O) on Monday in a crucial victory for the European competition regulator over the U.S. software giant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court dismissed Microsoft's appeal on all substantive points, throwing a small bone to the U.S. company by reversing the Commission on the creation and funding of a monitoring trustee to ensure implementation of one of the remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Court of First Instance essentially upholds the Commission's decision finding that Microsoft abused its dominant position," a court statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU executive, which has wide-ranging antitrust and merger control powers, found in 2004 that Microsoft had used its 95 percent share of the market in personal computer operating systems to elbow aside and damage smaller rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It ordered the company to sell a version of its ubiquitous Windows platform without its Windows Media Player application used to play video and music, and to share with rivals key information allowing their office servers to work smoothly with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling of the CFI on facts is final, but matters of law may be appealed to the European Union's highest court, the European Court of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a revealing detail, the court ordered Microsoft to pay most of the costs including some of its business rivals' which had supported the Commission's case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Microsoft's allies were forced to bear their own costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling was made by the 13-judge Grand Chamber of the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, the first time such a matter has been broadcast on live television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court upheld a record 497 million euro ($689.9 million) fine imposed on Microsoft as part of the original decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission had later said Microsoft failed to comply with its order on interoperability and fined the company an additional 280.5 million euros. It is considering a further fine for non-compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; LUXEMBOURG, Sept 17 (Reuters) - A European Union court
upheld most of a landmark 2004 European Commission antitrust
decision against Microsoft (MSFT.O) on Monday in a crucial
victory for the European competition regulator against the U.S.
software giant.

 The EU's Court of First Instance dismissed Microsoft's

on the creation of a monitoring trustee to ensure implementation
of one of the remedies.

 The European Commission found in 2004 that Microsoft had
used its dominance in personal computer operating systems to
damage smaller rivals.

&lt;p&gt; By Sabina Zawadzki

 BRUSSELS, Sept 17 (Reuters) - A European Union court rules
on Monday whether Microsoft abused its near-monopoly on computer
operating systems to push out rivals, in a protracted case that
has major implications on the EU's power to enforce antitrust
policy.

 The executive European Commission decided in 2004 that
Microsoft (MSFT.O) used its Windows operating system, running on
95 percent of the world's computers and servers, to choke off
competing makers of server and streaming media software.

 The Commission fined the software giant a record 497 million
euros ($690 million) and ordered it to change its business
practices. Microsoft appealed, so a special 13-judge panel at
the Court of First Instance will decide who was right.

 The bloc's second-highest court, based in Luxembourg, will
hand down its ruling on live television on Monday shortly after
9:30 a.m. (0730 GMT).

 It will rule whether the Commission was right to say
Microsoft could not bundle its Windows Media Player with its
Windows operating system because it was aimed at hurting rivals
such as RealNetworks (RNWK.O), once dominant in the field.

 It will also decide whether the Commission was wrong to
order Microsoft to produce a version of Windows without the
player software. Few bought that version of Windows.

 Today, media software is used to watch Google's (GOOG.O)
YouTube, download Apple (AAPL.O) iTunes or listen to Webcasts.

 The court will also rule whether Microsoft has to make
available information to rival server software makers so that
their software runs as smoothly on Windows.

 The Commission ordered Microsoft to do that and has fined it
an additional 280.5 million euros because it says the company is
not yet in compliance with that decision.

 Finally, the court will rule whether to cut the Commission's
original fine on Microsoft.

 If the Commission's power is preserved, no matter whether
the sanctions are thrown out, it will be able to press ahead
against Microsoft on a series of other pending complaints.

 Companies around the world are waiting to see whether the
court will cut into the Commission's power.

 If the court's ruling criticises the Commission's work in
this complex, high-tech case, the Commission will have to
rethink its strategy in cases and complaints involving Intel
(INTC.O), Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Rambus (RMBS.O) and others.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N)
Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said on Tuesday he was
disappointed by some studios' recent decision to back the HD
DVD high-definition technology format and accused them of
taking "easy money" for their decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Iger did not name the studios to which he was referring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney backs Sony Corp's (6758.T) Blu-Ray Disc, which had
appeared to be pulling ahead of Toshiba Corp's (6502.T) HD DVD
in the format war before Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks
Animation SKG Inc DWA.N signed exclusivity deals in August to
distribute next-generation films on HD DVD for the next 18
months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe it's a no-brainer ... that the industry should
be behind Blu-ray," Iger told investors at the Goldman Sachs
Communacopia Conference, noting that a decision by certain
"entities" was disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think those studios were likely taking easy money. We
haven't taken any money because we believe it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viacom's VIAb.N Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks
Animation were not available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shortly after the two studios announced their decision to
back HD DVD, the New York Times reported that Viacom executives
with knowledge of the deals said both Paramount and DreamWorks
would receive about $150 million in financial incentives for
their commitment to HD DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The standards war is reminiscent of the battle 30 years ago
between the VHS and Betamax formats for home video recording.
At stake is what is expected to be a multi-billion dollar
industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has sent a traveling road show to the top eight U.S.
shopping malls to promote Blu-Ray players to those looking to
upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DreamWorks Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg said at
another conference earlier on Tuesday that price was a key
factor in the studio's decision to back HD DVD. HD DVD players
and discs are cheaper than Blu-Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that Toshiba and HD DVD has finally provided an
affordable option," he said at the Merrill Lynch Media and
Entertainment Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viacom also defended its decision to back HD-DVD on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We felt that HD DVDs had lower price hardware, which in
our view is important for consumer acceptance," Viacom Chief
Executive Philippe Dauman told the Goldman conference ahead of
Iger's comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We like the technical quality of it. So, we felt it was
important for us to commit to a platform," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, Yoshihide Fujii, chief executive of
Toshiba's Digital Network Co, told Consumer Electronics Daily
at an industry conference in Berlin that reports that Toshiba
paid the studios $150 million for their support were "totally
wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did say, however, that Toshiba promised Paramount and
DreamWorks Animation "some money" to cover costs "to jointly
promote" their titles in a deal for the studios to support HD
DVD and not Blu-ray.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp wants video gamers to "finish the fight" when the last chapter of its "Halo" trilogy comes out next week, but a carefully crafted merchandising strategy will make sure Master Chief lives on for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Halo" is crucial to the success of Microsoft's Xbox video game business, which has lost billions of dollars since it was started in 2001 as a way to counter Sony Corp's growing dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hailed by some as the "Star Wars" for Generation Xbox, the "Halo" franchise has spawned a mini-empire of licensed toys, clothing and tie-ins. The game features a space marine called Master Chief trying to save humanity from an alien army known as the Covenant,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a company expected to post $57 billion in revenue this year, such licensing deals are little more than a rounding error. Yet Microsoft is driving to make the games division profitable this fiscal year, so every penny counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"'Halo' merchandise is a logical way to earn some extra revenue and they are trying to collect on as many fronts as they can to turn Xbox into a profitable business," said Matt Rosoff, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important effect of new "Halo"-branded products, however, is to make people more aware of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We make money and making money is great because this is a business. But we want long-term money that satisfies the fan base, not money today," said Steve Schrek, director of franchise development at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also hopes "Halo" will help it "finish the fight" against Sony, whose PlayStation 3 console has struggled in the United States since it made its debut nearly a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PS3's high price -- still $500 after a July cut -- is the biggest factor behind its woes, but Sony has also failed to deliver a true "system seller" -- a game so good that people will buy a particular console just to play it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Halo 3" is just such a title and Microsoft has kicked off an advertising blitz that includes evocative TV spots featuring live actors recalling events that happen in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transmuting "Halo" from geek spectacle to the mainstream is a challenge for a company more used to pitching operating systems and word-processing software than building consumer entertainment products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is wary of watering down "Halo," meaning it would rather walk away from deals for Master Chief pajamas or Covenant sippy cups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a balancing effort to be very, very careful that we don't over saturate and piss off our 15 million fans," said Brian Jarrard, franchise lead at Bungie, the game studio within Microsoft that created "Halo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are obviously looking to broaden 'Halo' and make it accessible ... while at the same time, we want to keep feeding our core audience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had little experience in talking to toy makers and others about how to transfer an on-screen experience to real objects. But such experts exist in the licensing arms of movie studios, so Microsoft partnered with 20th Century Fox to act as the main licensing agent for the "Halo" brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Items that did not make the cut were a "Halo"-themed lottery ticket, lingerie modeled after a female hologram character and toy guns based the game's weapons. Instead, fans can expect high-quality action figures from McFarlane Toys, a tabletop game from WizKids Inc and replica weapons for mature buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're very clear with them that this is not about running out and carpet-bombing everything. This is figuring out how in 5 years we're hitting new customers as opposed to in 5 years nobody cares," Schrek added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Bookings at Walt Disney Co's theme 
parks are strong for the December quarter and there is no 
evidence of a downturn caused by the U.S. economy, Chief 
Financial Officer Tom Staggs said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Staggs also told an investor conference that bookings for 
the fiscal first quarter were up over the year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It seems to me ... the estimation of how exposed our theme 
park business is to the economic cycle is probably a bit high. 
It's overestimated," he said at the Merrill Lynch Media and 
Entertainment Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I know there's a lot of concern about where the economy is 
going now, and I don't have any predictions for you about the 
economy," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I look out into the first quarter -- fiscal quarter for us 
next year, fourth calendar quarter -- bookings are up over the 
prior year so there's no current evidence of a downturn," 
Staggs added. He did not give a specific figure for bookings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In August, Disney said fiscal fourth-quarter domestic 
attendance comparisons would be challenging given the company's 
successful 50th anniversary celebration last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs noted that the last downturn Disney saw in its theme 
parks came after Sept 11, 2001 attacks on New York and 
Washington, which had a direct impact on travel and tourism. 
"People were afraid to get on airplanes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said that historically, attendance figures may have been 
impacted if consumer confidence went up or down for three 
consecutive months, but it was difficult to say if that 
connection still existed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Sue Zeidler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Diane Bartz &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice, which has been overseeing an antitrust settlement with Microsoft for five years, said on Monday it was "concerned" about a European court's decision to uphold an antitrust ruling against Microsoft (MSFT.O). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The European Court of First Instance (CFI), Europe's second-highest court, affirmed on Monday a 2004 European Commission ruling that Microsoft abused its overwhelming market position to crush competitors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are ... concerned that the standard applied to unilateral conduct by the CFI, rather than helping consumers, may have the unfortunate consequence of harming consumers by chilling innovation and discouraging competition," said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Thomas Barnett. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "U.S. courts recognize the potential benefits to consumers when a company, including a dominant company, makes unilateral business decisions, for example to add features to its popular products or license its intellectual property to rivals, or to refuse to do so," Barnett said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The European court also upheld a lower court's 497 million-euro ($690 million) fine. EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said she expected Microsoft's market share -- now about 95 percent -- to drop significantly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Department of Justice has been overseeing a 2002 settlement with Microsoft designed to stop it from using anticompetitive behavior to retain market share. Microsoft was found to have unlawfully used its monopoly in personal computer operating systems to discourage computer manufacturers from loading non-Microsoft software on their machines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Most of that settlement is scheduled to expire later this year but a group of states led by California has asked for big sections of it to be extended to 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    On Capitol Hill, a Florida Democrat expressed concern that the European ruling could trigger new antitrust cases and said he would hold hearings to discuss the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It would be disastrous if the court's decision against Microsoft leads to a deluge of new antitrust cases in Brussels, which appears to already be starting," said Rep. Robert Wexler, chairman of the Europe subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Intel (INTC.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Qualcomm (QCOM.O) were other possible EU targets, Wexler said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He said in a statement that he would call hearings to review the Microsoft ruling as well as the European Union's use of antitrust laws. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Braden Reddall; Diane.Bartz@reuters.com, 202-898-8313)) Keywords: MICROSOFT EU/USA &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Bookings at Walt Disney Co's theme 
parks are strong for the December quarter and there is no 
evidence of a downturn caused by the U.S. economy, Chief 
Financial Officer Tom Staggs said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Staggs also told an investor conference that bookings for 
the fiscal first quarter were up over the year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It seems to me ... the estimation of how exposed our theme 
park business is to the economic cycle is probably a bit high. 
It's overestimated," he said at the Merrill Lynch Media and 
Entertainment Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I know there's a lot of concern about where the economy is 
going now, and I don't have any predictions for you about the 
economy," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I look out into the first quarter -- fiscal quarter for us 
next year, fourth calendar quarter -- bookings are up over the 
prior year so there's no current evidence of a downturn," 
Staggs added. He did not give a specific figure for bookings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In August, Disney said fiscal fourth-quarter domestic 
attendance comparisons would be challenging given the company's 
successful 50th anniversary celebration last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs noted that the last downturn Disney saw in its theme 
parks came after Sept 11, 2001 attacks on New York and 
Washington, which had a direct impact on travel and tourism. 
"People were afraid to get on airplanes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said that historically, attendance figures may have been 
impacted if consumer confidence went up or down for three 
consecutive months, but it was difficult to say if that 
connection still existed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Sue Zeidler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment, byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Daisuke Wakabayashi &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SEATTLE, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Wall Street on Monday shrugged off Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) defeat in a European Union court, which upheld a landmark antitrust ruling against the world's largest software maker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts and investors said the decision by the second-highest EU court to dismiss Microsoft's appeal on all key points was not a surprise, and the lack of additional punitive damages was somewhat positive for the company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Microsoft were down 31 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $28.73 in afternoon trade on Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "They didn't hoist anything more on Microsoft," said Kim Caughey, a senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which oversees more than $1 billion, including Microsoft shares, for clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Although this is probably a setback for Microsoft's strategy going forward, it's not that big of a deal for investors. The fines have already been accounted for so none of the stuff announced today had bottom-line impact," said Caughey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier on Monday, the Luxembourg-based EU court dismissed Microsoft's appeal on all key points against a 2004 European Commission ruling and upheld a record 497 million euro ($689.9 million) fine.    Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said it has not yet decided whether to appeal to the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court. In the past, the company has taken its antitrust battles as far as it can go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The EU hasn't been favorable to Microsoft or any other company with a near-monopoly position so it wasn't expected that Microsoft would get anything too favorable," said Andy Miedler, senior technology analyst at Edward Jones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In the 2004 ruling, the European Commission ordered Microsoft to sell a version of its Windows operating system without the Windows Media Player application used for watching video and listening to music. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It was also ordered to share information to help rivals' computer servers to work smoothly with Windows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Neelie Kroes, Europe's top competition regulator, said  after Monday's ruling she would like to see a significant drop in market share of the Windows operating system, which sits on about 95 percent of the world's personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Morningstar analyst Toan Tran was surprised by Kroes' comment. "It's a little disconcerting that a regulator would say something like that, but ultimately people are going to vote with their wallets." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tran said the version of Windows without the Media Player, made specifically for the European market, does not sell well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A spokesman for Kroes later said a fall in market share would be a logical consequence of fairer competition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) suffered a decisive 
antitrust defeat on Monday when a European Union court upheld a 
landmark ruling that the world's largest software maker had 
abused its dominant market position to crush rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The second-highest EU court dismissed the company's appeal 
on all key points against the 2004 European Commission ruling 
and upheld a record 497 million euro ($689.9 million) fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A jubilant EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said 
the ruling should lead to a "significant drop" in Microsoft's 
95 percent market share. Microsoft's top lawyer said it would 
affect the way the company markets its products in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in the U.S. software giant were down 1.14 percent in 
morning New York trade after the Luxembourg-based court's 
ruling, suggesting investors were not overly concerned about 
the implications for Microsoft's successful business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, 
which oversees more than $1 billion including Microsoft shares, 
for clients, said: "Although this is probably a setback for 
Microsoft's strategy going forward, it's not that big a deal 
for investors. The fines have already been accounted for, so 
none of the stuff announced today had bottom-line impact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Competition experts said the ruling had serious long-term 
implications for EU regulation of the hi-tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's clearly a major defeat for Microsoft. There is no 
doubt it will spur the Commission on to regulate Microsoft much 
more significantly," said UK competition lawyer Chris Bright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also gives Kroes a green light to pursue other antitrust 
cases and complaints involving Intel (INTC.O), Qualcomm 
(QCOM.O) and Rambus (RMBS.O), and to issue draft antitrust 
guidelines that were put on ice pending the ruling.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONSUMER CHOICE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The court said Microsoft was unjustified in tying new 
applications to its Windows operating system in a way that 
squeezed out rivals and harmed consumer choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EU's Kroes told a news conference: "The court has 
confirmed that Microsoft can no longer prevent the market from 
functioning properly and consumers are entitled to benefit from 
choice and more innovative products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An appeal against the ruling is possible only on points of 
law and not of fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked how the Commission would assess progress in the 
Microsoft case, Kroes said: "A market level of much less than 
95 percent would be a way of measuring success ... You can't 
draw a line and say exactly 50 (percent) is correct, but a 
significant drop in market share is what we would like to see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her spokesman later clarified that a fall in market share 
would be a logical consequence of fairer competition. A lawyer 
for Microsoft's rivals in the case said it was the abuse of the 
company's position that was the problem, not its market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If Microsoft, competing on the merits, achieves more 
dominance, then so be it," Thomas Vinje, lawyer for the 
European Committee for Interoperable Systems (ECIS), told 
journalists.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "DISAPPOINTING"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The court endorsed Commission sanctions against Microsoft's 
tying together of software and refusal to give rival makers of 
office servers information to enable their products to work 
smoothly with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission ordered the company to sell a version of 
Windows without the Windows Media Player application used for 
video and music, which few have bought, and to share 
information allowing rivals' office servers to work smoothly 
with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The court annulled only the EU regulator's imposition of a 
Microsoft-funded trustee to monitor compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith called the ruling 
unprecedented and disappointing, saying it gave the Commission 
"quite broad power and quite broad discretion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He promised the company would comply fully and said it had 
not decided whether to appeal to the European Court of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which had argued that it was entitled to protect 
its patents and copyright, has used every legal recourse in 
every case brought against it by governments and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm has weathered a series of defeats in high profile 
antitrust cases over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kroes declined to discuss the implications of the ruling 
for a pending complaint from ECIS against the new Microsoft 
Vista on grounds that this operating system too had problems 
with interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ECIS and other rivals welcomed the court verdict as setting 
the ground rules for the company's future behavior and as a 
signal that EU authorities will not allow Microsoft to pursue 
anti-competitive practices with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another winner was the Free Software Foundation, which 
makes free, open software for workgroup servers. "Microsoft can 
consider itself above the law no longer," said Georg Greve, 
president of the FSF Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges ordered Microsoft to pay the lion's share of the 
costs of the Commission and of business rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the original decision, the Commission has fined 
Microsoft a further 280.5 million euros, saying it had failed 
to comply with the interoperability sanction. The EU regulator 
is considering a further fine for non-compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (additional reporting by Georgina Prodhan in Frankfurt,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N)  and its investment banking partner in China may part ways, potentially raising questions about future control of the Wall Street firm's business there, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Fang Fenglei, chairman of a joint venture called Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Co., has said he plans to start a private-equity fund that could raise as much as $2 billion, the Wall Street Journal said, citing "people familiar with the situation." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman linked up with Fang nearly three years ago to underwrite offerings in the local Chinese market, the Wall Street Journal said.  Goldman lent Fang $100 million to set up a brokerage with which the U.S. firm could ally, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It is unclear whether Fang will maintain a formal relationship with Goldman, and if he leaves, the Wall Street firm may not take a big hit, the newspaper said. It is also unclear how much business Fang has won for Goldman since the partnership began, the Journal said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It's also not clear whether Fang's securities firm would want to maintain its share in the joint venture, and if so, it might try to exercise control against Goldman's will, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Dan Wilchins) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ((Reuters Messaging: dan.wilchins.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6320)) Keywords: GOLDMANSACHS FANGFENGLEI/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates data on Morgan Stanley results)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Herbert Lash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers and Morgan
Stanley posted impressive results this week despite their
exposure to the subprime mortgage meltdown, suggesting profits
at Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns may be better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A credit squeeze and subprime-related activity will likely
impact earnings at Goldman (GS.N), but results to be released
on Thursday could top analysts' lowered expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same is true for Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N, also set to
release results on Thursday, although its exposure to the
mortgage industry may have left it worse off than Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman will have a more positive outlook, because they
benefit more from market volatility. They depend more on
trading," said Lee Norton, a banking analyst at JS Asset
Management in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And Bear is not as diversified, so they probably won't do
as well. They rely more on the U.S. fixed-income markets than
Goldman," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The big Wall Street investment banks make money from their
trading, underwriting and advisory fees, but the question is
how much that is being offset by credit losses, Norton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diversification by geography, client and product could be
the silver lining for the investment banks, said James Ellman,
a portfolio manager at hedge fund Seacliff Capital in San
Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Thus a downturn in one market or one product area would
not be as painful to (the investment banks') earnings stream as
in the past," said Ellman, whose firm owns brokerage shares.
"They have much more diversification."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares ended up $4.93, or 2.5 percent, at $205.50
in Wednesday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares
traded as low as $157.30 last month on concerns about the
industry's exposure to rising defaults on home loans and to
leveraged buyout deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benefits of diversification and increased overseas
operations should boost share valuations over time and could
lead investors to gauge the sector by its price-to-earnings --
traditionally low -- instead of price to book, Ellman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Results this week from Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Morgan
Stanley (MS.N) have been impressive considering the beating
they've taken from subprime-related ills and the collapse in
LBO debt markets, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley said on Wednesday third-quarter income from
continuing operations fell 7 percent to $1.47 billion and the
investment bank wrote off $940 million in bad loans because of
a squeeze in mortgage and corporate loan markets. That figure
excludes its Discover Card operations which were spun off at
the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman Brothers on Tuesday also posted a decline in
quarterly earnings as it wrote down about $700 million in
mortgage and leveraged loan assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both banks also provided analysts a fair amount of detail
about their businesses -- a sore point in the past -- on
conference calls with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "More detail, more disclosure is very helpful and these
companies have been woefully poor in disclosure in the past,"
Ellman said. "That's been fine when markets were good. Now it's
time if they want to support their share prices and keep their
borrowing costs low to give more disclosure."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Cogentrix Energy Inc, a unit
of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), has sold an 80 percent stake
in 14 power plants to Energy Investors Funds, a buyout investor
that specializes in U.S. energy and power assets, for
undisclosed terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; EIF's United States Power Fund III LP is buying 80 percent
of Cogentrix' interest in 14 power projects totaling 2,336 net
megawatts of generating capacity. Cogentrix will retain a 20
percent stake in the projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We look forward to working  as a team with EIF in

Ed Canaday, a spokesman for Goldman and Cogentrix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EIF said the deal is expected to close by the end of
December and subject to closing conditions and regulatory
approvals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs, the largest investment bank in terms of
market value, acquired Cogentrix in December 2003 for $2.4
billion. The purchase provided stakes in 26 plants that could
support its industry leading energy trading business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the past two years, Goldman has pared down its
portfolio as the value of power assets recovered. Owning
physical assets is viewed as less critical for traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman in May put most of its 18 power generation assets
up for sale, as first reported by Reuters, although it plans to
retain Charlotte, North Carolina-based Cogentrix as a
subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York investment bank, began building up a portfolio
of power plants in 2003, a time when distressed energy
companies such as Enron, Dynegy Inc (DYN.N) and El Paso Corp
EP.N were shedding power plants at fire-sale prices to stay
afloat.

the brief shutdown, said spokesman Rod Spackman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A hydrocracker uses hydrogen under high pressure and high

of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The process makes a little jet and a little gasoline,"
Spackman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Chevron's Web site about the El Segundo
refinery, Isomax is the name for Chevron's patented
hydrocracking process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The catalyst in the Isomax is designed to crack heavy
material into jet fuel," according to the website. "The Chevron
El Segundo Refinery supplies nearly 40 percent of the jet fuel
used at Los Angeles International Airport."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jet fuel differentials were running between 1 cent per
gallon over and 2 cents per gallon under NYMEX heating oil,
according to West Coast traders.

&lt;p&gt;Assistant Attorney General Thomas Barnett said after the Court of First Instance (CFI) ruled against the world's biggest software maker on Monday that its decision could chill innovation and discourage competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is totally unacceptable that a representative of the U.S. administration criticized an independent court of law outside its jurisdiction," Kroes told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The European Commission does not pass judgment on rulings by U.S. courts, and we expect the same degree of respect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroes's statement raised the stakes in a split over the Microsoft case between the Bush administration and the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission has a history of cooperation with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department since patching up differences over an EU decision in 2001 to block General Electric's takeover of Honeywell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the CFI in Luxembourg upheld a landmark 2004 Commission decision that the U.S. giant abused the near-monopoly power of its Windows operating system to damage competitors, along with a 497 million euro ($695 million) fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroes has defended the order by her predecessor, Mario Monti, that Microsoft sell a version of Windows without its Media Player audiovisual software, and share information to enable rival makers of servers to operate smoothly with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnett, the Justice Department's top antitrust official, disparaged the EU's policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are ... concerned that the standard applied to unilateral conduct by the CFI, rather than helping consumers, may have the unfortunate consequence of harming consumers by chilling innovation and discouraging competition," he said in a written statement on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnett said the United States protects competition, not competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of Microsoft's main U.S. competitors complained to the European Commission. Other U.S. rivals sparked a similar antitrust case against Microsoft in the United States by complaining to the Justice Department in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Court of Appeals found in 2001 that Microsoft violated the Sherman Act antitrust law. Since then, some states have criticized the Justice Department for backing off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroes said Microsoft may appeal against the EU decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the parties to a case are unhappy with the Court of First Instance ruling, they can appeal to the Court of Justice, and that is well known by those parties," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not said if it will do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N), having just raised a $20 billion buyout fund, plans to pursue smaller deals, such as capital injections and private investments in public equity, or PIPEs, its private equity chief said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the credit crunch pinching lending at investment banks, Goldman's buyout arm will focus more on rescue financings and minor stakes in companies, Rich Friedman said, speaking at the Dow Jones Private Equity Analyst conference in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That strategy is a stark contrast to the large leveraged buyouts Goldman has pursued over the last several years. However, Friedman said it was too early to judge whether the era of big deals is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman said he was not concerned about the credit crunch impinging on Goldman's merchant banking approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a multi-strategy investment business model," he said. "I'm not worried about investment pace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman expected the new fund to last four to five years, he said, but it's looking more like it will last two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman said that in the current environment, Goldman will try to execute pending deals, focus on its portfolio and make "selective investments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The credit crunch was a shock to the private equity system, he said on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's like the train conductor pulled the emergency stop," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman added that with private equity firms hamstrung by the credit markets, more buyout groups would seek exits of their companies through the IPO market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Flaherty)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Sue Zeidler &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said on Tuesday he was disappointed by some studios' recent decision to back the HD DVD high-definition technology format and accused them of taking "easy money" for their decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Iger did not name the studios to which he was referring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney backs Sony Corp's (6758.T) Blu-Ray Disc, which had appeared to be pulling ahead of Toshiba Corp's (6502.T) HD DVD in the format war before Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc DWA.N signed exclusivity deals in August to distribute next-generation films on HD DVD for the next 18 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We believe it's a no-brainer ... that the industry should be behind Blu-ray," Iger told investors at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia Conference, noting that a decision by certain "entities" was disappointing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I think those studios were likely taking easy money. We haven't taken any money because we believe it," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Viacom's VIAb.N Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Animation were not available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shortly after the two studios announced their decision to back HD DVD, the New York Times reported that Viacom executives with knowledge of the deals said both Paramount and DreamWorks would receive about $150 million in financial incentives for their commitment to HD DVD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The standards war is reminiscent of the battle 30 years ago between the VHS and Betamax formats for home video recording.  At stake is what is expected to be a multi-billion dollar industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney has sent a traveling road show to the top eight U.S. shopping malls to promote Blu-Ray players to those looking to upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    DreamWorks Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg said at another conference earlier on Tuesday that price was a key factor in the studio's decision to back HD DVD. HD DVD players and discs are cheaper than Blu-Ray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We believe that Toshiba and HD DVD has finally provided an affordable option," he said at the Merrill Lynch Media and Entertainment Conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Viacom also defended its decision to back HD-DVD on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We felt that HD DVDs had lower price hardware, which in our view is important for consumer acceptance," Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman told the Goldman conference ahead of Iger's comments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We like the technical quality of it. So, we felt it was important for us to commit to a platform," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier this month, Yoshihide Fujii, chief executive of Toshiba's Digital Network Co, told Consumer Electronics Daily at an industry conference in Berlin that reports that Toshiba paid the studios $150 million for their support were "totally wrong." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He did say, however, that Toshiba promised Paramount and DreamWorks Animation "some money" to cover costs "to jointly promote" their titles in a deal for the studios to support HD DVD and not Blu-ray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Toni Reinhold; Reuters Messaging: susan.zeidler.reuters.com@reuters.net; E-mail: susan.zeidler@reuters.com; Tel +213-955-6748)) Keywords: DISNEY BLURAY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects spelling of "unacceptable" in second paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, Sept 19 (Reuters) - EU Competition Commissioner
Neelie Kroes shot back on Wednesday against criticism from the
United States of a European court ruling this week that
Microsoft (MSFT.O) broke antitrust laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think it is totally unacceptable that a representative of
the U.S. administration criticises an independent court of law

by a U.S. court and we expect the same level of respect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Justice Department said on Monday it was "concerned"
about the Court of First Instance's "unilateral" decision on to
uphold a European Commission antitrust ruling against Microsoft,
saying it could hurt consumers and discourage innovation.

&lt;p&gt;Results from a Phase III clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of risedronate 150 mg once monthly for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis were presented at the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) 29th Annual Meeting. In the non-inferiority study comparing risedronate 150 mg once monthly to risedronate 5 mg daily [Actonel (risedronate sodium tablets)] increases in bone mineral density (B.M.D) were similar for patients taking either the monthly or daily dosing regimens. In the study, B.M.D was measured at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and femoral trochanter. There were no statistically significant differences in B.M.D increases between the risedronate 150 mg once monthly and the 5 mg daily dose groups at 12 months. In the study, the tolerability and safety profiles were also similar for the monthly and daily dosing regimens of risedronate.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) wants video gamers to "finish the fight" when the last chapter of its "Halo" trilogy comes out next week, but a carefully crafted merchandising strategy will make sure Master Chief lives on for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Halo" is crucial to the success of Microsoft's Xbox video game business, which has lost billions of dollars since it was started in 2001 as a way to counter Sony Corp's (6758.T) growing dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hailed by some as the "Star Wars" for Generation Xbox, the "Halo" franchise has spawned a mini-empire of licensed toys, clothing and tie-ins. The game features a space marine called Master Chief trying to save humanity from an alien army known as the Covenant,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a company expected to post $57 billion in revenue this year, such licensing deals are little more than a rounding error. Yet Microsoft is driving to make the games division profitable this fiscal year, so every penny counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"'Halo' merchandise is a logical way to earn some extra revenue and they are trying to collect on as many fronts as they can to turn Xbox into a profitable business," said Matt Rosoff, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important effect of new "Halo"-branded products, however, is to make people more aware of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We make money and making money is great because this is a business. But we want long-term money that satisfies the fan base, not money today," said Steve Schrek, director of franchise development at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also hopes "Halo" will help it "finish the fight" against Sony, whose PlayStation 3 console has struggled in the United States since it made its debut nearly a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PS3's high price -- still $500 after a July cut -- is the biggest factor behind its woes, but Sony has also failed to deliver a true "system seller" -- a game so good that people will buy a particular console just to play it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Halo 3" is just such a title and Microsoft has kicked off an advertising blitz that includes evocative TV spots featuring live actors recalling events that happen in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transmuting "Halo" from geek spectacle to the mainstream is a challenge for a company more used to pitching operating systems and word-processing software than building consumer entertainment products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is wary of watering down "Halo," meaning it would rather walk away from deals for Master Chief pajamas or Covenant sippy cups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a balancing effort to be very, very careful that we don't over saturate and piss off our 15 million fans," said Brian Jarrard, franchise lead at Bungie, the game studio within Microsoft that created "Halo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are obviously looking to broaden 'Halo' and make it accessible ... while at the same time, we want to keep feeding our core audience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had little experience in talking to toy makers and others about how to transfer an on-screen experience to real objects. But such experts exist in the licensing arms of movie studios, so Microsoft partnered with 20th Century Fox to act as the main licensing agent for the "Halo" brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Items that did not make the cut were a "Halo"-themed lottery ticket, lingerie modeled after a female hologram character and toy guns based the game's weapons. Instead, fans can expect high-quality action figures from McFarlane Toys, a tabletop game from WizKids Inc and replica weapons for mature buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're very clear with them that this is not about running out and carpet-bombing everything. This is figuring out how in 5 years we're hitting new customers as opposed to in 5 years nobody cares," Schrek added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two Wall Street investment banks had dramatically different success in weathering market turbulence triggered by a subprime mortgage meltdown, as results at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) easily exceeded expectations, while Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N fell far short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter profit at Goldman, the largest securities firm by market value, soared 79 percent to $2.85 billion, or $6.13 per share, from $1.59 billion, or $3.26 per share, a year earlier, as bets against mortgages helped boost revenue from fixed-income trading to a record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns profit plunged to a five-year low, sinking 61 percent to $171.3 million, or $1.16 per share, from $438 million, or $3.02. Results were hurt by subprime mortgage write-downs, an 88 percent slide in fixed-income trading revenue and $200 million of costs from the collapse of two of its hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average expected profit per share of $4.37 at Goldman and $1.78 at Bear Stearns, Reuters Estimates said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman had a stellar performance, no question about it," said Mark Batty, an analyst at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia, which invests $77 billion. "Bear had a challenging quarter. They have more exposure to the mortgage business, and they suffered for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks this week turned in mixed results after investors this summer stopped buying a wide variety of securities they no longer considered safe, including subprime mortgages and high-yield debt to fund leveraged buyouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results topped forecasts at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N and fell short at Morgan Stanley (MS.N). Profit at both fell. Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N reports results next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares closed down $1.97 at $203.53, while those of Bear Stearns fell 18 cents to $115.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns' shares was buffered by comments from the company's chief financial officer, Sam Molinaro, who said on a conference call: "The worst is largely behind us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A seizing up of credit and capital markets and the nation's housing slowdown helped push the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday to cut the federal funds rate by half a percentage point to 4.75 percent, more than many economists had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are taking a breath and realizing that it will be a while before banks show sustainable growth," said Henry Asher, president of the Northstar Group in New York. "The (earnings) numbers are not horrific but it will take some time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIVERSITY HELPS GOLDMAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Goldman, Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein oversaw a 71 percent increase in revenue from fixed income, currencies and commodities to $4.89 billion, despite $1.48 billion of losses related to write-downs of non-investment-grade credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was partly offset by a $900 million gain from the sale of power company Horizon Wind Energy LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking revenue rose 67 percent to $2.15 billion, helped by higher fees from advising on mergers. Overall net revenue rose 63 percent to $12.33 billion, the second-highest ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It demonstrates how diverse Goldman is both in terms of its product range, as well as its geographic diversity," said Camilla Petersen, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. "Who would have thought they would put out $1.4 billion in advisory fees?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call, David Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, said the subprime meltdown is "closer to the bottom" than three months ago. He also said Goldman may have a chance to buy mortgage assets at low, distressed prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the medium to longer term, there's still pretty good economic growth," he said. "That causes us to be optimistic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARKET TURNS FOR BEAR STEARNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Bear Stearns, Chief Executive James Cayne said results suffered from "extremely difficult" securitization markets and high volatility across asset classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, long a leader in packaging home loans into mortgage-backed bonds, said fixed-income revenue fell to $118 million from $945 million a year earlier. Total net revenue slid 37.5 percent to $1.33 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bear Stearns is a big fixed-income shop and when things got frothy in those markets, they weren't ready for things to turn," said Adam Compton, an analyst at RCM Global Investors in San Francisco, which invests $150 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collapse of two structured credit funds hurt results in the company's wealth management unit, which posted a $226.5 million pre-tax loss, compared with an $18 million profit a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brighter spots included revenue increases of 53 percent from equity trading and 30 percent from global clearing services, which includes fees from hedge fund clients. Investment banking revenue fell 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares are up 2 percent this year, while Bear Stearns shares are down 29 percent. The Amex Securities Broker Dealer Index .XBD, which includes both companies, is down 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Jonathan Stempel; Additional reporting by Kristina Cooke, Jessica Hall and Dan Wilchins)&lt;/p&gt;

its hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average expected profit per share of $4.37 at
Goldman and $1.78 at Bear Stearns, Reuters Estimates said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman had a stellar performance, no question about it,"
said Mark Batty, an analyst at PNC Wealth Management in
Philadelphia, which invests $77 billion. "Bear had a
challenging quarter. They have more exposure to the mortgage
business, and they suffered for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street banks this week turned in mixed results after
investors this summer stopped buying a wide variety of    
securities they no longer considered safe, including subprime
mortgages and high-yield debt to fund leveraged buyouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Results topped forecasts at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc
LEH.N and fell short at Morgan Stanley (MS.N). Profit at both
fell. Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N reports results next
month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares closed down $1.97 at $203.53, while those of
Bear Stearns fell 18 cents to $115.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear Stearns' shares was buffered by comments from the
company's chief financial officer, Sam Molinaro, who said on a
conference call: "The worst is largely behind us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A seizing up of credit and capital markets and the nation's
housing slowdown helped push the U.S. Federal Reserve on
Tuesday to cut the federal funds rate by half a percentage
point to 4.75 percent, more than many economists had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People are taking a breath and realizing that it will be a
while before banks show sustainable growth," said Henry Asher,
president of the Northstar Group in New York. "The (earnings)
numbers are not horrific but it will take some time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DIVERSITY HELPS GOLDMAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Goldman, Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein oversaw a 71
percent increase in revenue from fixed income, currencies and
commodities to $4.89 billion, despite $1.48 billion of losses
related to write-downs of non-investment-grade credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was partly offset by a $900 million gain from the sale
of power company Horizon Wind Energy LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment banking revenue rose 67 percent to $2.15
billion, helped by higher fees from advising on mergers.
Overall net revenue rose 63 percent to $12.33 billion, the
second-highest ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It demonstrates how diverse Goldman is both in terms of
its product range, as well as its geographic diversity," said
Camilla Petersen, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London.
"Who would have thought they would put out $1.4 billion in
advisory fees?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a conference call, David Viniar, Goldman's chief
financial officer, said the subprime meltdown is "closer to the
bottom" than three months ago. He also said Goldman may have a
chance to buy mortgage assets at low, distressed prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the medium to longer term, there's still pretty good
economic growth," he said. "That causes us to be optimistic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MARKET TURNS FOR BEAR STEARNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Bear Stearns, Chief Executive James Cayne said results
suffered from "extremely difficult" securitization markets and
high volatility across asset classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, long a leader in packaging home loans into
mortgage-backed bonds, said fixed-income revenue fell to $118
million from $945 million a year earlier. Total net revenue
slid 37.5 percent to $1.33 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Bear Stearns is a big fixed-income shop and when things
got frothy in those markets, they weren't ready for things to
turn," said Adam Compton, an analyst at RCM Global Investors in
San Francisco, which invests $150 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The collapse of two structured credit funds hurt results in
the company's wealth management unit, which posted a $226.5
million pre-tax loss, compared with an $18 million profit a
year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brighter spots included revenue increases of 53 percent
from equity trading and 30 percent from global clearing
services, which includes fees from hedge fund clients.
Investment banking revenue fell 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares are up 2 percent this year, while Bear
Stearns shares are down 29 percent. The Amex Securities Broker
Dealer Index .XBD, which includes both companies, is down 4
percent.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds CFO comments, detail and background throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) said on Thursday that quarterly profit surged 79
percent, blowing away expectations with its second-highest
revenue even as rivals were set back by turbulent loan and
mortgage markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results included significant gains from mergers and
acquisitions, trading, investments and -- in contrast with many
of its Wall Street peers -- betting against mortgage bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For example, Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N, a smaller investment
bank with the biggest exposure to troubled mortgage markets,
said on Thursday its profit fell 61 percent to its lowest level
in five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's net revenue rose 63 percent to $12.3 billion in
the quarter ended Aug. 31 and net income rose to $2.85 billion,
or $6.13 a share, from $1.59 billion, or $3.26, a year earlier.
The earnings beat analyst forecasts by 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results included record revenue in many businesses and
offset $2.4 billion of losses on leveraged buyouts financing,
with a net loss after fees of $1.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is standout performance ... that reinforces its
leadership among U.S. investment banking players in terms of
its ability to adapt and profit from changing environments,"
Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares, which had rallied more than 12 percent in
the past five days, slipped half a percent even as the broker
dealer sector index .XBD was down 4.2 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Punk Ziegel  Co analyst Dick Bove warned that while the
fourth-quarter outlook is strong, many of the gains of the
third quarter won't be easily repeated. "Next year is another
story. All core businesses are expected to slow," Bove said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results beat analyst expectations for the seventh
straight period and sparkled in comparison to rivals Lehman
Brothers Holdings Corp LEH.N and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which
reported lower quarterly earnings this week despite their
presence across different businesses and regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They were stunningly good in a cruddy environment," said
Adam Compton, co-head of global financial services research at
RCM Global Investors in San Francisco. RCM, which manages about
$150 billion of assets, owns Goldman shares but not Bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WHAT MELTDOWN?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For months, investors and analysts worried that the
meltdown in U.S. mortgages, sparked by subprime losses, and the
apparent shutdown of corporate debt markets would end Wall
Street's long run of rapidly rising profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's fixed-income trading revenue rose 71 percent amid
what some rivals called one of the worst markets in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's currency and interest rate trading were
significantly higher, while credit and commodities revenue
rose. Gains from timely bets against troubled U.S. mortgage
markets more than offset its losses on subprime loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank also recorded a $900 million gain on its sale of
wind power company Horizon Energy, and a nearly $300 million
gain from its own long-term debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said Goldman's presence in other businesses and
regions boosted performance. About 53 percent of revenue was
from outside the United States, where many markets are growing
faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It demonstrates how diverse Goldman is both in terms of
its product range as well as its geographic diversity," said
Camilla Petersen, an analyst covering U.S. financial stocks for
Atlantic Equities in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Equities trading revenue doubled from last year, fueled by
derivatives, customer activity and from proprietary trades.
Goldman's $2 billion investment in Global Equity Opportunities,
a hedge fund beaten down during the summer stock sell-off, rose
16 percent through the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; INVESTMENT BANKING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment banking net revenue rose by two-thirds to an
all-time high of $1.4 billion, as merger advisory fees doubled.
Underwriting rose just 8 percent as lower demand for leveraged
debt offset a strong quarter for equities offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's leveraged loan commitments for buyouts ended the
quarter at $42 billion, down from $51 billion.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said the backlog of
pending investment banking fees decreased during the quarter,
mostly reflecting the slowdown in leveraged finance. He was
sanguine about the outlook for deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Strategic buyers and sellers continue to be active, and
financial sponsors, while unlikely in the near term to pursue
the megadeals we have seen in the recent past, still have a lot
of equity to invest," Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One source of concern was asset management. Revenue rose 31
percent to $1.2 billion, but the volatile summer markets did
take a bite out of Goldman's hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The flagship Global Alpha fund lost 30 percent of its value
during the quarter, Viniar said. Goldman expects $1.6 billion
of redemptions, he added, which will shrink Global Alpha to as
little as $4.5 billion -- or less than half its size at the
start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looking ahead, Viniar expressed some optimism that mortgage
markets were closer to hitting bottom, while corporate lending
would rebound over the next few months. The overall business
environment and global economy, he said, were healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the medium to long term, there's still pretty good
economic growth," Viniar said. "That causes us to be
optimistic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs shares fell $1.10 to $204.40 in afternoon
trading. Goldman stock had fallen 12 percent over the past
three months amid worries the credit crunch would force
crippling write-downs and sap earnings.

significantly faster than other enterprise networking
companies, the brokerage said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ShoreTel's 100 percent internally developed approach to
design has produced a system that is easier to set up, use,
maintain and scale than most other offerings, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This, coupled with the company's strong customer

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N), which has a small exposure to the mortgage business
relative to rivals, continues to look into potential
investments and acquisition among lenders and beaten-down debt
assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We think that there are going to be opportunities in the
mortgage business. There are certainly going to be
opportunities to buy distressed assets," Chief Financial
Officer David Viniar said on a conference call on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Timing is going to be very important, and it is something
we are certainly looking at right now. We'll continue to look
at it and consider it over time," Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which reported a 79 percent rise in third-quarter
earnings earlier Thursday, made a profit by shorting mortgages
and related securities. U.S. mortgage markets have been under
pressure all year as rising defaults among the riskiest
borrowers triggered a broader sell-off.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several Goldman Sachs Group's (GS.N) hedge funds suffered major quarterly losses, the bank's chief financial officer said on a conference call on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Viniar said the Goldman Global Alpha fund was down about 30 percent for the second quarter, while its Global Equity Opportunities fund was down about 20 percent in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said the Alpha fund has had over $1.6 billion in redemption requests, or demands for a return of investor capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global Alpha currently has a net asset value of about $6 billion, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The markets for corporate loans and mortgages will remain challenging in the near term, but Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said he's optimistic the environment is improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, those same markets have done some real harm to Goldman's hedge fund business, he told reporters in a briefing on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subprime mortgage meltdown that triggered a broad sell-off across financial markets this summer "is closer to the bottom" than it was at the start of the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many corporate loans, meanwhile, are good assets beaten down amid a supply imbalance that should work itself out in as soon as "a few months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's always hard for me to give an outlook for the current quarter, but certainly in the medium-to-longer term, there's still pretty good economic growth.

Viniar said its unfunded leveraged finance commitments fell to $42 billion from $51 billion during the quarter ended August 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REDEMPTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upheaval in stock and credit markets, though, have put a dent in Goldman's asset management business. The bank's flagship Global Alpha fund, which has lost more ground this year, faces at least $1.6 billion in customer redemptions, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would reduce a hedge fund that had more than $10 billion in assets at the start of the year down to as little as $4.5 billion, he said. Global Alpha currently has a net asset value of about $6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said the bank did not plan to invest more of its own cash into Global Alpha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the Global Equity Opportunities fund, into which Goldman and some outside investors pumped $300 million, rose 16 percent after the infusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier Thursday Goldman trounced expectations by reporting a 79 percent surge in third-quarter profit, confounding experts who only a few weeks ago had worried that the broad credit crunch and market swoon would generate crippling losses for Wall Street's big investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to its rivals, Goldman reported earnings that rose from the second quarter and from the year-ago. In an environment where other banks have cut back mortgage staff, and where there has been speculation of more layoffs, Viniar said he does not expect a slowdown in Goldman's headcount growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;((Editing by Derek Caney;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RMe:joseph.giannone.reuters.com@reuters.net;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tel:+1 646 223 6184&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of most U.S. employment-related companies slumped in early trading on Thursday after Goldman Sachs cut its ratings on several of them because of concerns about a slowing U.S. economy and the prospect for downward earnings revisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman downgraded three stocks -- Hudson Highland Group Inc HHGP.O, Kelly Services Inc (KELYA.O), and Spherion Corp (SFN.N) -- to "sell" from "neutral," citing their exposure to the most economically sensitive segments of the temporary staffing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudson dropped 6.9 percent to $13.62, Kelly fell 3.1 percent to $21.27, and Spherion was down 4.6 percent at $9.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also cut two other companies, MPS Group Inc MPS.N and executive recruiter Korn/Ferry International (KFY.N), to "neutral" from "buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Korn/Ferry was down 1.3 percent to $17.22, while MPS lost 4 percent to $12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not expect the staffing stocks to rally for long on the back of Fed rate cuts because we believe that such cuts intensify the debate surrounding the health of the labor market," analyst David Feinberg said in a research note issued before the market opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday cut interest rates by half a percentage point to ease the impact of a housing slump on the broader economy. Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported a surprise drop in August nonfarm payrolls, which helped feed speculation that a recession might be around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman kept its "buy" rating on two other stocks, CDI Corp (CDI.N) and Kforce Inc. (KFRC.O), where confidence about earnings prospects are higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand for professional temporary staff in fields like information technology and accounting remains strong compared with clerical and industrial staffing, Goldman said, which plays to CDI and Kforce's strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDI fell 1.5 percent to $28.88, while Kforce gained 7 cents to $13.79.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nick Zieminski)&lt;/p&gt;

but remained in the red on Thursday after U.S. investment bank
Goldman Sachs (GS.N) reported forecast-beating quarterly
results, easing fears over the impact of the credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; At 1210 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top
European shares was down 0.7 percent at 1,538.01 points, after
losing nearly 1 percent earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs said that quarterly earnings surged 79 percent
as revenue from investment banking and trading increased despite
turbulent summer markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European banks remained the biggest laggards, hit by
Deutsche Bank's (DBKGn.DE) CEO warning that the liquidity crisis
would take its toll on third-quarter profits at Germany's
biggest bank.
Deutsche was down 2.6 percent, while troubled British lender
Northern Rock NRK.L tumbled 22 percent.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with reaction to Goldman Sachs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures trimmed
losses on Thursday after Goldman Sachs (GS.N) posted earnings
that beat Wall Street estimates, calming concerns about the
impact of the credit crisis on the financial services sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc2 were down 1.80 points, but above
fair value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing by
taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to
expiration on the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc2 were down 31
points, and Nasdaq 100 NDc2 futures fell 6 points.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded two U.S.
airlines and raised its rating on one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage downgraded American Airlines AMR.N to
"sell" from "neutral" and cut its price target to $22 from $25,
on valuation and pressures in the international market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs also downgraded Alaska Airlines (ALK.N) to
"sell" from "neutral" and cut its price target to $24 from $25,
saying it expected the company's shares to underperform in
coming months given a slowing U.S. economy and the company's
focus on the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) to
"neutral" from "sell" and maintained its price target of $15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs raised its price target on United Airlines
UAUA.O to $47 from $39 and reiterated a "neutral" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said in a research note that its enthusiasm
for airline equities remained tempered despite recent weakness
in the shares, owing largely to expected slowing in the U.S.
economy, risks to certain global economies and growing
oil-related risk.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Updates data on Morgan Stanley results) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Herbert Lash &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley posted impressive results this week despite their exposure to the subprime mortgage meltdown, suggesting profits at Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns may be better than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A credit squeeze and subprime-related activity will likely impact earnings at Goldman (GS.N), but results to be released on Thursday could top analysts' lowered expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The same is true for Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N, also set to release results on Thursday, although its exposure to the mortgage industry may have left it worse off than Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Goldman will have a more positive outlook, because they benefit more from market volatility. They depend more on trading," said Lee Norton, a banking analyst at JS Asset Management in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "And Bear is not as diversified, so they probably won't do as well. They rely more on the U.S. fixed-income markets than Goldman," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The big Wall Street investment banks make money from their trading, underwriting and advisory fees, but the question is how much that is being offset by credit losses, Norton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Diversification by geography, client and product could be the silver lining for the investment banks, said James Ellman, a portfolio manager at hedge fund Seacliff Capital in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Thus a downturn in one market or one product area would not be as painful to (the investment banks') earnings stream as in the past," said Ellman, whose firm owns brokerage shares. "They have much more diversification." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman shares ended up $4.93, or 2.5 percent, at $205.50 in Wednesday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares traded as low as $157.30 last month on concerns about the industry's exposure to rising defaults on home loans and to leveraged buyout deals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The benefits of diversification and increased overseas operations should boost share valuations over time and could lead investors to gauge the sector by its price-to-earnings -- traditionally low -- instead of price to book, Ellman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Results this week from Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) have been impressive considering the beating they've taken from subprime-related ills and the collapse in LBO debt markets, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Morgan Stanley said on Wednesday third-quarter income from continuing operations fell 7 percent to $1.47 billion and the investment bank wrote off $940 million in bad loans because of a squeeze in mortgage and corporate loan markets. That figure excludes its Discover Card operations which were spun off at the end of June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Lehman Brothers on Tuesday also posted a decline in quarterly earnings as it wrote down about $700 million in mortgage and leveraged loan assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Both banks also provided analysts a fair amount of detail about their businesses -- a sore point in the past -- on conference calls with analysts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "More detail, more disclosure is very helpful and these companies have been woefully poor in disclosure in the past," Ellman said. "That's been fine when markets were good. Now it's time if they want to support their share prices and keep their borrowing costs low to give more disclosure." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Dan Wilchins) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Richard Satran and Gary Crosse; Reuters Messaging: herb.lash.reuters.com@reuters.net; e-mail: herb.lash@reuters.com; +1-646-223-6019)) Keywords: USA BROKERS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - A $2.25 billion debt vehicle set
up by Germany's SachsenLB is to gain breathing space after new
owner Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg (LBBW) proposed an interim
financing plan to allow it time to restructure.
"The move will ... give the vehicle room to breathe so it
can return to its day-to-day operations and try to pursue a
permanent restructuring," credit analysts at Royal Bank of
Scotland said in a note to clients on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The vehicle -- Sachsen Funding I -- is a so-called SIV-lite,
a structure that uses short-term and medium-term funding to
invest in longer-term securities, in this case U.S. residential
mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These structures have suffered in recent weeks as their
funding costs have soared and the prices for the assets they
hold has fallen sharply as contagion from the U.S. subprime
mortgage crisis has spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Sachsen Funding said in a statement issued on Wednesday
that its portfolio -- made up of 74 securities with a face value
of $2.25 billion -- of was overwhelmingly rated triple-A, with
only a small amount of double-A rated paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said it had been informed that without the interim
financing, it would continue to breach tests on its funding and
portfolio, forcing it into early liquidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said selling its assets under current market conditions
would likely lead to losses that would wipe out the mezzanine
and capital notes it had issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LBBW will provide a 90-day facility to facilitate a
restructuring, Sachsen said.
 "This does put a little bit more pressure on LBBW's balance
sheet and would surely not be the bank's preferred option, but
when it chose to buy LB Sachsen on the cheap a month or so ago
it was always going to be on the hook for this," RBS's analysts
wrote.

&lt;p&gt;Eduardo Garcia has reported for Reuters from Bolivia for a year. In the following story, he describes having his future read by a soothsayer high in the Andes. Garcia is a Spaniard who has also lived and reported in Guatemala and Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Eduardo Garcia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EL ALTO, Bolivia (Reuters) - Inside her booth, as small and dingy as a garden shed, gold-toothed soothsayer Felipa Quispe places a handful of coca leaves on an intricately patterned Tari cloth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So what would you like the coca leaves to tell you? Love, money, career?" she asks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had come up the steep hill from the city of La Paz high in the Andes to the sprawling El Alto slum to have an Aymara shaman read my future in coca leaves, a plant central to Bolivian indigenous culture and religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Love," I say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She places two coca leaves on the Tari and scatters a dozen more leaves around. "I can see someone in your life. It'll go alright between you two, although she's grumpy sometimes. But you can be too full of yourself. It all depends," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We move on to my career. Quispe throws more leaves over the Tari and says, "I can see a pay rise coming up for you. But it all depends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder what it all depends on, and suspect it will mean shelling out more money. I am right. "If you really want the future to swing your way, you need to make an offering to the Pachamama (earth goddess)," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we buy ingredients for my offering: sugary candies shaped like a couple holding hands, dollar signs and airplanes as well as herbs, sulphur, coca leaves, llama wool, silver glitter and feathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quispe arranges them neatly on a saucer, pours alcohol over it and takes it outside before lighting it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She starts swaying and chanting in Aymara, but I can make out a few phrases in Spanish: "Everything will go well with Senor Eduardo's loved one. Senor Eduardo's bosses will give him a raise. Fortune will come to Senor Eduardo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She charges $20 for the offering plus $2 for the fortune telling, a lot in the poorest country in South America, where most families struggle on just a few dollars a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the dozen or more saucers already burning in the morning air suggest many are willing to pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SACRED LEAF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Bolivians are of indigenous descent and even in urban areas such as El Alto -- 13,000 feet above sea level -- people preserve pre-Christian beliefs in witchdoctors who perform spells and heal people with traditional medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indians used coca as an anesthetic centuries before Western scientists developed the leaf into cocaine, and they still chew it to ward off hunger and fight altitude sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca leaves are revered as sacred and are present at important moments from marriage proposals to funerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the coca leaf, Indians know their past, know their present, know their future and know about death," says Sdenka Silva, director of the Coca Museum in La Paz. "A Bolivian shaman must know how to read coca leaves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fortune tellers' booths advertise the ability to bring back a loved one, heal disease or reverse a curse. Nearby stores offer bags of coca leaves, dried llama fetuses, amulets, owl feathers and medicinal plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca is also a symbol of political struggle in Bolivia, the world's third largest cocaine producer after Colombia and Peru. Growers defend traditional uses of the plant and have fought previous U.S.-backed campaigns to wipe out their crops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They led street protests that ousted two presidents in 2003 and 2005, paving the way for former coca farmer Evo Morales' election as the country's first Indian president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Morales, government officials ostentatiously chew coca in public and last year he famously brandished a coca leaf at a U.N. forum while decrying the leaf's "criminalization".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quispe says that an offering like the one she just made for me contributed to Morales' rise to power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did a ritual for Evo Morales and see, now he's president," says Quispe. "If you have faith, it can work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(You can read more Reuters Witness stories by clicking on the URL here or by typing it into the address bar of your browser)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - The prolonged U.S. housing market slump has forced many a homeowner to sell for less than they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to that list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker disclosed in a regulatory filing on Friday that it suffered a loss of up to $2 million in the sale of a home once owned by Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell. The sale price of the home was not given in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft hired Liddell in 2005, moved him from Connecticut, and bought his home on the East Coast for a price based on independent appraisals when the property did not sell within an allotted period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft sold the home in its 2007 fiscal year on the open market -- for significantly less than it paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real estate loss was included in a $2 million "relocation expense" for Liddell.

generic-drug makers did not infringe its patent on gabapentin,
the active ingredient in Neurontin, a shingles-pain treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said the ruling will allow it to seek a judgment of
infringement and, if successful, pursue full compensation for
the damage it suffered from the 2004 launch of generic versions
of Neurontin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the New
Jersey Federal District Court should not have granted summary
judgment to the generic-drug makers, and that a full trial
should be held on Pfizer's allegations of patent infringement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prior to the launch of the generics, Pfizer's sales of
Neurontin were more than $2 billion a year, Pfizer said. The
patent is set to expire in 2017.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) (GS.N) has already set aside more for compensation than
it did for all of last year, contrary to speculation that Wall
Street earnings and bonuses would be squeezed by the summertime
credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which trounced expectations with a 79 percent
increase in third-quarter earnings, said it reserved $16.9
billion in the first nine months of its fiscal year, up 21
percent from last year's period and exceeding the $16.5 billion
set aside in all of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 2007 reserves -- which average out to $565,000 per
employee -- will go toward salaries and employee benefits. The
bulk of the compensation is paid out in bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a briefing with reporters Thursday, Goldman Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said headcount, which rose 17
percent from last year and 7 percent during the quarter, would
continue to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We don't have a slowdown," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rising fortunes of Goldman's employees reflect the
bank's rising revenue and profit at a time when corporate
loans, volatile stocks and swooning mortgage markets made this
summer the most challenging in years. Goldman's third-quarter
net revenue rose 63 percent to $12.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bonuses track growth at Wall Street firms, which typically
pay out half their revenue to employees. A disproportionate
share is concentrated among the high executives and top
performers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Firms each quarter set aside what they estimate they will
pay out after the end of the fiscal year, so fourth quarter
accruals remain a real wild card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rivals Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N, Morgan Stanley
(MS.N) and Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N all reported lower
earnings this week, and several investment banks have announced
job cuts in struggling businesses. Morgan and Lehman, though
they haven't exceeded last year's accruals, are on pace to
boost compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Morgan Stanley set aside $13.4 billion for the first nine
months, up 25 percent, well on its way to matching the $14.4
billion Morgan paid out in 2006. But the per-employee average
compensation this year works out to $280,000 per employee, or
half that of Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman Brothers, meanwhile, set aside $7.33 billion, up 14
percent from the year-earlier period, or $255,000 per employee.
Last year Lehman paid out $8.67 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The exception to the trend is Bear Stearns, where
nine-month compensation fell 6 percent to $3.10 billion, or
$199,730 an employee, as the mortgage meltdown inflicted losses
on its trading, financing and hedge fund businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear paid out $4.34 billion in salary and bonuses last
year.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 21 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said an appeals
court has overturned a lower court ruling that several generic
manufacturers did not infringe its patent for stabilized
formulations of gabapentin, the active ingredient in Neurontin,
a shingles-pain treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said the ruling will allow it to seek a judgment of
infringement and, if successful, pursue full compensation for
the damage it suffered due to the 2004 at-risk launch of
generic versions of Neurontin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prior to such launch, Pfizer's sales of Neurontin were more
than $2 billion a year, and the patent does not expire until
2017, the drug maker said.

&lt;p&gt;Co says that an appeals court has overturned a lower court ruling that several generic manufacturers did not infringe the company's patent for stabilized formulations of gabapentin, the active ingredient in Neurontin. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the New Jersey federal district court should not have granted summary judgment to the generic manufacturers, and that a full trial should be held on Pfizer's allegations of patent infringement.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Daisuke Wakabayashi &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Sept 20 (Reuters) - The mission of Master Chief, the protagonist in the popular "Halo" trilogy of video games, is to save humanity from an army of aliens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    If that's not enough to thrust upon one person, he's got another task: rescue Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Xbox video game business from six years of losses and post its first-ever profit, and keep Wall Street off the backs of management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Halo 3" hits stores on Tuesday and Microsoft projects first-day sales of the game to eclipse the $125 million mark set by its predecessor, saying it will be the biggest opening for any entertainment product ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The last two "Halo" installments sold a combined 14.8 million units at more than $50 a game, turning the original Xbox into a must-have machine for many gamers and making the game extremely profitable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    This is a make-or-break year for the Xbox business. It has lost roughly $5 billion since Microsoft entered the video game console business in 2001 as a way to stem the rise of Sony Corp's (6758.T) PlayStation game console. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Xbox 360, the successor to the original Xbox, made its debut about a year ahead of other next-generation game consoles, building a lead over Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS hugely popular Wii with an installed base of more than 11.6 million units. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This is certainly a huge game for Microsoft in order to maintain the momentum with the Xbox 360 having the lead over Sony," said Alan Davis, analyst at D.A. Davidson &amp; Co. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Anyone who wants to play "Halo 3," a futuristic shooter game featuring a space marine called Master Chief fighting an alien army called the Covenant, will have to buy an Xbox 360, since Microsoft makes the software only for its own machine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft hopes that is just the incentive shoppers need ahead of the holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are in the stage of the console life cycle where content becomes king and people are going to buy the platform that has the games they want," Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division, told investors at the company's analyst meeting in July. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We feel like that (Halo) gives us a significant leg up and really will help drive the business." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft projects the entertainment and devices division, home to the Xbox video game console and loss-making Zune digital music player, to post a profit in the 2008 fiscal year ending in June after last year's $1.9 billion loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It expects segment revenue to increase between 10 percent and 19 percent this year from last year's $6.08 billion, 12 percent of Microsoft's total revenue of $51 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    WINDOW TO CONSUMERS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Like most console makers, Microsoft loses money on the sales of the Xbox 360 with the goal of making it back and then some over the life of the product with software sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It is a business model accepted by investors, but Microsoft introduced an unexpected loss in fiscal 2007 when it took a $1.06 billion charge to fix problems with the Xbox 360. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    That loss strengthened the argument made by some investors who think Microsoft should stay out of consumer businesses such as the Zune and Xbox and focus on its profit-rich core software products such as its Windows operating system and Office suite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft argues the Xbox and Zune are important in a world where people consume content in new and different ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Xbox 360 is central to Microsoft's strategy of "connected entertainment," a vision of a world where people can consume the media they want any place, any time and on any device. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The market is not a patient place and it's not very patient with Microsoft in this respect," said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran. "It's going to be an important milestone for the game division to finally turn a profit this year." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Since Microsoft officially entered the game business in November 2001 with the North American release of the Xbox,  Microsoft shares have fallen 16 percent. During that period, the Nasdaq has risen 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Halo 3" is expected to play a big part in improving Microsoft's bottom line, because it is a "first party" title -- a game developed by Microsoft's own game maker not another publisher such as Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft can make about $10 to $12 per game from "third party" titles, but "first party" games such as "Halo 3" and "Gears of War" -- a popular shooter game released by Microsoft last year -- can bring in several times that amount. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Andre Grenon; Reuters Messaging: daisuke.wakabayashi.reuters.com@reuters.net +1 206 652 2326)) Keywords: MICROSOFT HALO/FINANCIALS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Writes through with Chevron, Eni, Kazakh economy minister)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Maria Golovnina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALMATY, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Chevron (CVX.N) secured crucial
backing from the Kazakh president over its huge Tengiz oil
project on Friday, but foreign investors remained wary as a row
over another major Western oil project remained unsolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron CEO Dave O'Reilly flew to Kazakhstan on Friday for
talks with President Nursultan Nazarbayev, a day after a Kazakh
parliamentarian urged the government to halt Chevron's venture
developing the Tengiz oil deposit due to ecological violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly quoted Nazarbayev as telling him that "Tengiz is an
excellent example of how the government and a foreign investor
can work together successfully", according to the Kazakhstan
Today news agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today during our meeting both the president of Kazakhstan
and the prime minister expressed support for our company's
activities," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakhstan's recent assertiveness in its dealings with
foreign oil companies has alarmed investors, jittery in the wake
of the government's row with an Eni-led consortium developing
another huge Caspian Sea deposit, Kashagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakh officials suspended Kashagan operations last month,
also accusing it of environmental breaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakhstan says Kashagan is an isolated case stemming from
the project's continuous start-up delays and cost overruns, and
denies it is part of a wider campaign against foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking on Friday in Italy, Eni CEO Paolo Scaroni, who came
to Kazakhstan last week to try to resolve the issue, said it was
difficult to predict when the dispute would end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The talks involve many parties, it is difficult to make
forecasts," Scaroni said. "We will tackle the talks with the
best spirit and the Kazakh government will do the same. There
are no reasons for pessimism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TENGIZ AND KASHAGAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just like Kashagan, Chevron's Tengiz project is one of the
world's biggest oilfields and its expansion is at the centre of
Kazakhstan's ambition to become a global energy powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a further parallel with Kashagan, Tengiz came under fire
earlier this year when officials threatened to halt its licence
if it did not produce a plan to deal with sulphur stocks. The
case was eventually dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, concerns about investment climate rose again last
week when Kazakh lawmakers started considering draft legislation
that would allow the government to break the terms of contracts
with oil investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakh Economy Minister Bakhyt Sultanov, speaking to
reporters in Astana, defended the law on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think it will negatively affect investment climate
because everyone must understand that every state must have a
legal basis to take into account its economic interests and
national security," he said.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's largest drug maker, said on Friday it is in talks with investors about spinning off its Japanese research and development laboratory, albeit as a much smaller organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its drug discovery research centre in Nagoya, central Japan, is set to close by April next year as part of major restructuring by Pfizer that means about 10,000 job cuts worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that closure of the lab, which has some 380 employees, will go ahead, investors are interested in funding a new company of 80 people, centered around its top researchers, Hiromitsu Iwasaki, chief executive of Pfizer Japan, told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S, European and Japanese investors, which include banks and funds, have shown interest although that level varies greatly depending on Pfizer's potential stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have some investors who say they think the company will do much better if is independent and any Pfizer stake is small and we have others who say they would be more comfortable with bigger Pfizer participation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly reborn laboratory would initially focus on discovering drugs for pain-related and gastro-intestinal diseases but also move on to clinical trials later, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the laboratory said it may take on developing dormant patents on Pfizer drugs for the Japanese markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer had come under much criticism in Japan for closing the lab, with industry executives saying the company might find it hard to attract top people in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)

 Sept 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded the European
automobile sector to "attractive" from "neutral," saying the
sector performed robustly in the recent market correction and
delivered restructuring, despite the market's initial
skepticism.

 The brokerage said its European Portfolio Strategy Team
also upgraded its view on the autos sector to "overweight" from
"neutral." The team believes the restructuring that took place
in the sector will continue to be reflected in positive
earnings revisions.

 Goldman Sachs upgraded Volvo to "buy" and added it to the
conviction list. The other conviction buys are Fiat and
Renault.

 The brokerage said it is unimpressed with PSA
Peugeot-Citroen's restructuring prospects and concerned by the
industrial challenges it faces. It retained PSA on its
Conviction Sell list.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments, updates shares) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Joseph A. Giannone and Tim McLaughlin &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Two Wall Street investment banks had dramatically different success in weathering summer market turbulence as results at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) easily exceeded expectations, while those at Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N fell far short. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Third-quarter profit at Goldman, the largest securities firm by market value, soared 79 percent to $2.85 billion, or $6.13 per share, from $1.59 billion, or $3.26 per share, a year earlier, as bets against mortgages helped boost revenue from fixed-income trading to a record. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    At Bear Stearns, profit plunged to a five-year low, sinking 61 percent to $171.3 million, or $1.16 per share, from $438 million, or $3.02. Results were hurt by write-downs of subprime mortgages, an 88 percent slide in fixed-income trading revenue, and $200 million of costs from the collapse of two of its hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts on average expected profit per share of $4.37 at Goldman and $1.78 at Bear Stearns, Reuters Estimates said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Goldman had a stellar performance, no question about it," said Mark Batty, an analyst at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia, which invests $77 billion. "Bear had a challenging quarter. They have more exposure to the mortgage business, and they suffered for it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In afternoon trading, shares of Goldman rose $2.22 to $207.72, while Bear Stearns shares rose $2.61 to $118.25. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bear Stearns recovered early losses after Chief Financial Officer Sam Molinaro said on a conference call: "The worst is largely behind us." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Wall Street banks this week turned in mixed results after simmering trouble in the subprime mortgage market came to a boil over the summer, causing investors to reduce their risk tolerance for a wide variety of securities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Results topped forecasts at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N and fell short at Morgan Stanley (MS.N). Profit at both fell. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co MER.N reports results next month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A seizing up of credit and capital markets and the nation's housing slowdown helped push the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday to cut the federal funds rate by half a percentage point to 4.75 percent, more than many economists had expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    DIVERSITY HELPS GOLDMAN &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    At Goldman, Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein oversaw a 71 percent increase in revenue from fixed income, currencies and commodities to $4.89 billion, despite $1.48 billion of losses related to write-downs of non-investment-grade credits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    That was partly offset by a $900 million gain from the sale of power company Horizon Wind Energy LLC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Investment banking revenue, meanwhile, rose 67 percent to $2.15 billion, helped by merger advisory fees. Overall net revenue rose 63 percent to $12.33 billion, the second-highest ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It demonstrates how diverse Goldman is both in terms of its product range as well as its geographic diversity," said Camilla Petersen, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. "Who would have thought they would put out $1.4 billion in advisory fees?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    On a conference call, David Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, said the subprime meltdown is "closer to the bottom" than three months ago. He also said Goldman may have a chance to buy mortgage assets at low, distressed prices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "In the medium to longer term, there's still pretty good economic growth," he said. "That causes us to be optimistic." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    MARKET TURNS FOR BEAR STEARNS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    At Bear Stearns, Chief Executive James Cayne said results suffered from "extremely difficult" securitization markets and high volatility across asset classes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company, long a leader in packaging home loans into mortgage-backed bonds, said fixed-income revenue fell to $118 million from $945 million a year earlier. Total net revenue slid 37.5 percent to $1.33 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Bear Stearns is a big fixed-income shop, and when things got frothy in those markets, they weren't ready for things to turn," said Adam Compton, an analyst at RCM Global Investors in San Francisco, which invests $150 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The collapse of two Bear Stearns structured credit funds hurt results in the wealth management unit, which posted a $226.5 million pre-tax loss, compared with an $18 million profit a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Brighter spots included revenue increases of 53 percent from equity trading and 30 percent from global clearing services, which includes fees from hedge fund clients. Investment banking revenue fell 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Through Wednesday, Goldman shares were up 3.1 percent this year, while Bear Stearns shares were down 29 percent. The Amex Securities Broker Dealer Index .XBD, of which both banks are members, was down 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Writing by Jonathan Stempel; Additional reporting by Kristina Cooke and Dan Wilchins) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Deborah Cohen and Steve Orlofsky; Reuters messaging: joseph.giannone.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6184; tim.mclaughlin.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6033)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: INVESTMENTBANKS RESULTS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

Goldman and $1.78 at Bear Stearns, Reuters Estimates said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman had a stellar performance, no question about it," 
said Mark Batty, an analyst at PNC Wealth Management in 
Philadelphia, which invests $77 billion. "Bear had a 
challenging quarter. They have more exposure to the mortgage 
business, and they suffered for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street banks this week turned in mixed results after 
investors this summer stopped buying a wide variety of 
securities they no longer considered safe, including subprime 
mortgages and high-yield debt to fund leveraged buyouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Results topped forecasts at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc 
LEH.N and fell short at Morgan Stanley (MS.N). Profit at both 
fell. Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N reports results next 
month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares closed down $1.97 at $203.53, while those of 
Bear Stearns fell 18 cents to $115.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear Stearns' shares was buffered by comments from the 
company's chief financial officer, Sam Molinaro, who said on a 
conference call: "The worst is largely behind us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A seizing up of credit and capital markets and the nation's 
housing slowdown helped push the U.S. Federal Reserve on 
Tuesday to cut the federal funds rate by half a percentage 
point to 4.75 percent, more than many economists had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People are taking a breath and realizing that it will be a 
while before banks show sustainable growth," said Henry Asher, 
president of the Northstar Group in New York. "The (earnings) 
numbers are not horrific but it will take some time."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DIVERSITY HELPS GOLDMAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Goldman, Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein oversaw a 71 
percent increase in revenue from fixed income, currencies and 
commodities to $4.89 billion, despite $1.48 billion of losses 
related to write-downs of non-investment-grade credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was partly offset by a $900 million gain from the sale 
of power company Horizon Wind Energy LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment banking revenue rose 67 percent to $2.15 
billion, helped by higher fees from advising on mergers. 
Overall net revenue rose 63 percent to $12.33 billion, the 
second-highest ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It demonstrates how diverse Goldman is both in terms of 
its product range, as well as its geographic diversity," said 
Camilla Petersen, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. 
"Who would have thought they would put out $1.4 billion in 
advisory fees?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a conference call, David Viniar, Goldman's chief 
financial officer, said the subprime meltdown is "closer to the 
bottom" than three months ago. He also said Goldman may have a 
chance to buy mortgage assets at low, distressed prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the medium to longer term, there's still pretty good 
economic growth," he said. "That causes us to be optimistic."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MARKET TURNS FOR BEAR STEARNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Bear Stearns, Chief Executive James Cayne said results 
suffered from "extremely difficult" securitization markets and 
high volatility across asset classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, long a leader in packaging home loans into 
mortgage-backed bonds, said fixed-income revenue fell to $118 
million from $945 million a year earlier. Total net revenue 
slid 37.5 percent to $1.33 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Bear Stearns is a big fixed-income shop and when things 
got frothy in those markets, they weren't ready for things to 
turn," said Adam Compton, an analyst at RCM Global Investors in 
San Francisco, which invests $150 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The collapse of two structured credit funds hurt results in 
the company's wealth management unit, which posted a $226.5 
million pre-tax loss, compared with an $18 million profit a 
year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brighter spots included revenue increases of 53 percent 
from equity trading and 30 percent from global clearing 
services, which includes fees from hedge fund clients. 
Investment banking revenue fell 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares are up 2 percent this year, while Bear 
Stearns shares are down 29 percent. The Amex Securities Broker 
Dealer Index .XBD, which includes both companies, is down 4 
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Writing by Jonathan Stempel; Additional reporting by

&lt;p&gt;Northern Rock called on its top relationship banks just after it offered a profit warning on June 27, but it opted to reject the offer of help from JPMorgan, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the offer was for funding of 500 million pounds, citing sources close to Northern Rock, but it said the loan would have been part of a wider funding solution proposed by the U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment, and Northern Rock could not immediately be reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Rock has been engulfed in a funding and customer confidence crisis since the Bank of England stepped in as a "lender or last resort" a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALMATY, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Kazakh Prime Minister Karim
Masimov met top Chevron (CVX.N) executives on Friday, a day
after a Kazakh official urged the government to suspend an oil
project led by the U.S. company in the Central Asian state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The government said in a statement Masimov and Chevron
officials "discussed development of Kazakh deposits" and other
energy issues during a meeting in the capital, Astana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gani Kasymov, a president-appointed member of the upper
house of parliament, on Thursday accused the Tengizchevroil
(TCO) venture developing the field of violating environmental
laws and urged the government to suspend it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were no immediate signs the government would follow
Kasymov's recommendation. But the move put further pressure on
foreign investors in Kazakhstan, wary following the
government's earlier row with a separate group of Western oil
majors developing another oilfield.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, Sept 25 (Reuters) - China's securities regulator
has approved JP Morgan's (JPM.N) plan to set up a joint venture
to provide futures execution and clearing in China, the U.S.
investment bank said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Approval by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC)
means JP Morgan and its Chinese partner, Zhongshan Futures Co
Ltd, can give clients access to Chinese commodity futures
exchanges, the bank said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is an exciting and important milestone, not only for
our business, but also for our clients and the local Chinese
market," Richard Berliand, chairman of the JP Morgan's futures
and options business said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It demonstrates JP Morgan's long-term commitment to China
and to offering our clients unparalleled access to new and
emerging markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's Shanghai Futures Exchange (SFE) already offers
copper, aluminium, zinc, natural rubber and fuel oil futures and
wants to launch steel futures. This month it got the CSRC's
permission to offer gold futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under futures trading management rules that went into effect
in April, non-futures bourses can offer futures trading, with the
approval of China's State Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry sources have said that China is likely to launch
stock index futures in November, following a meeting of its
Communist party leadership. The stock scheme was postponed
earlier this year for fear of destablising the stock market.

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI/LONDON (Reuters) - Walt Disney's international 
television arm said on Monday it would let viewers of Finnish 
commercial broadcaster Nelonen pay to watch hit shows on the 
Internet four days after their U.S. release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney-ABC International said the deal with Nelonen, part 
of SanomaWSOY group, marks the first time the company has 
introduced multiple network series to non-U.S. markets so soon 
after release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shows being offered include series such as "Ugly Betty," 
"Grey's Anatomy," "Desperate Housewives" and "Lost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each episode will cost 3 euros ($4.2), and viewers can 
watch it up to 10 times within the next 24 hours of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finland was particularly attractive to Disney, given the 
country's relatively high broadband penetration and viewers' 
appetite for legally downloading and paying to watch shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We and Disney have a learning perspective here. Finnish 
people easily take up new technologies. As a relatively small, 
homogeneous market, Finland is a good test bed for consumer 
behavior," Finnish Nelonen's channel head, Pirjo Airaksinen, 
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but 
other Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) services that provide 
television programming via broadband cables often involve a fee 
being paid by the broadcaster and revenue sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has made much over the past year of its desire to 
pursue new business models in growing markets outside the 
United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the Finnish agreement also reflects efforts by 
major studios and networks to get movies and television shows 
released faster to help combat piracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arash Amel, a senior analyst at media research company 
Screen Digest in London, said the speed with which viewers in 
the U.S. could load television shows onto their computers and 
then circulate them on file-sharing or user-generated sites 
meant the broadcasting industry was moving faster towards 
simultaneous release for big shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "(Uploading such shows) is happening on a mass scale, and 
it means the windowing problems studios have for movies is now 
visiting the television sector," Amel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amel said the growing threat of piracy meant companies were 
having to work faster and experiment more with getting shows to 
as many markets internationally as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nelonen said it had approached Disney-ABC to launch the 
service and the shows would now become available up to a year 
ahead of their screening on Nelonen's terrestrial channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traditionally, it has taken anywhere between three and six 
months for U.S. shows to appear on European television screens, 
but that gap has been narrowing sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is an old-fashioned model of doing business, which is 
all about content owners, networks and broadcasters controlling 
what viewers watch and when and in the era of Internet that 
model has crumbled," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move to reduce the gap was underscored in January when 
British-based satellite operator BSkyB began showing "Lost," 
one of the world's most popular TV shows, to UK viewers four 
days after it had aired in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nelonen said the service may include commercials as it 
evolves further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It remains to be seen if it will eventually be the 
consumer or advertiser who pays (for the shows)," Nelonen's 
Airaksinen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nelonen reaches 2.1 million viewers a day with its 
TV-channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is in
talks to buy up to 5 percent of Facebook in a deal that could
value the fast-growing online social network company at $10
billion or more, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move could give maturing Microsoft more access to young
users and let Facebook get closer to a major software maker at
a time when its growth is increasingly tied to a proliferation
of small applications from independent developers on its site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citing people familiar with the matter, the Journal said
the world's largest software company sought to buy a stake of
up to 5 percent in Facebook for $300 million to $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook, led by its 23-year-old founder and Chief
Executive Mark Zuckerberg, may insist on a valuation as high as
$15 billion and is considering raising up to $500 million in
cash to expand its operations, according to the Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such a deal could help Microsoft better compete against Web
search leader Google Inc (GOOG.O) for a growing base of online
advertising and put one of the Internet's hottest names in
Microsoft's camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook, which already has an advertising deal with
Microsoft, would benefit from closer ties with developers as it
seeks to turn its site into a full-fledged Web platform where
users can play games, interact and read news about each other,
said Forrester analyst Charlene Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you are building a business around building a platform
there is one company that has done it better than anybody else
-- and that is Microsoft," she said. "People have been just
assuming that Google would be the best partner and that is not
necessarily the case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google has also expressed an interest in investing in
Facebook, the Journal report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It would probably be pretty good for Microsoft since it
has not had the best success in creating really hip,
young-people-grabbing stuff on the Web," said Kim Caughey, a
senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which oversees more
than $1 billion, including Microsoft shares, for clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representatives for Microsoft and Facebook declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zuckerberg has repeatedly said his company wants to remain
independent and is seen as preparing to float itself on the
stock market eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook has grown to 39 million members, up nearly 63
percent from 24 million in late May, and is quickly gaining
ground on larger rival MySpace, which was taken over by News
Corp NWSa.N in 2005 for what is now seen as a bargain price
of $580 million. MySpace has more than 200 million users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook's explosion popularity has also drawn increased
scrutiny, including a 50-state investigation into the company
by attorneys general concerned about Web sexual predators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said on Monday his
office had subpoenaed Facebook and accused it of not keeping
young users safe. Facebook said it was preparing a statement
about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft already has an
exclusive agreement until 2011 to broker display advertisements
for Facebook. The Journal said Microsoft and Facebook are
discussing expanding that agreement beyond the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After relinquishing an early advantage in the lucrative
paid search market to Google and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), Microsoft
is trying to catch up by clinching deals to broker display
advertising to some of the leading names in "Web 2.0."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo and Google are also maneuvering. Earlier this year,
for instance, News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch said he had
discussed swapping MySpace for a 25 percent stake in Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Web 2.0 is a catch-phrase for a new generation of Internet
services that run on interactive software and typically rely on
content generated by users to attract more visitors. Microsoft
also has an agreement with popular news site Digg.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares rose 1.5 percent to $29.08 on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;Local police officer Eustaquio Arredondo told reporters no casualties had been found but one person who was apparently on board the aircraft had been arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV images showed 132 military-style black bags containing around 3.3 metric tons of cocaine lined up in rows next to chunks of the wrecked plane, which came down near the municipality of Tixkokob, a three-hour drive west of the Cancun beach resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexican army planes had been tracking the aircraft since it was spotted entering Mexican air space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug planes packed with South American cocaine -- often with passenger seats ripped out to make space -- frequently fly through Mexico and Central America en route for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some unload their cargo at clandestine airstrips south of the border where traffickers send it on by road or sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Felipe Calderon has deployed thousands of troops against Mexican drug gangs.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Video game aficionados lined up before dawn on Monday for the midnight release of "Halo 3," the acclaimed alien shooter game that Microsoft Corp hopes will widen its lead over Sony Corp in the battle for industry dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equivalent of a new "Harry Potter" book or "Star Wars" film for the $30 billion video game industry, "Halo 3" has drawn wide praise from reviewers for its lush settings, cinematic story and breadth of features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive buzz about the science-fiction game -- in which players try to save humanity from an army of aliens -- pushed Microsoft shares up as much as 3.35 percent, their biggest one-day gain since April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is counting on "Halo 3" to push its money-losing entertainment unit into profitability. The game is the final chapter in a trilogy that began in 2001 with the launch of the software giant's original Xbox game console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was caught between buying the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but there are certain games like 'Madden '08' and this one that pushed me to Xbox 360," said Darnell Jefferson, 25, who was second in line at a Best Buy store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Halo 3" will enjoy the absence of another blockbuster game, "Grand Theft Auto IV," whose October debut has been delayed by publisher Take-Two Interactive Software Inc until the some time between February and April 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is backing its game with a marketing blitz that includes celebrity-studded midnight sales events at some 10,000 retailers across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaming retail chain GameStop Corp said the title set a record for advance orders, while Microsoft expects initial demand to surpass that for 2004's "Halo 2," which racked up $125 million in its first 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uchendu Nwachukwu, 28, a freelance Web designer who was first in line at the Best Buy store, said buying the game was not as important as experiencing what will probably be a major media event when the doors open at midnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are going to make it a big event, lots of celebrities out here, concerts and prizes, all sorts of craziness," said Nwachukwu, who claimed his space at 6:30 p.m. on Sunday, nearly 30 hours before the launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it was just about the game," he said, "I would have gone on Tuesday to the store and got it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two "Halo" games have sold a combined 15 million copies and cemented Microsoft as a serious player in a video game industry that was dominated by Sony Corp's PlayStation 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft hopes "Halo 3" will work similar magic for its Xbox 360. The console debuted in late 2005 and has enjoyed stronger sales than PlayStation 3, which is more expensive and so far lacks any "system-seller" games like "Halo 3."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Halo 3" is targeted firmly at the Xbox's core audience of young males, for whom realistic combat games are a staple. It does little to widen the machine's appeal to a more casual audience that is being courted with tremendous success by Nintendo Co Ltd's Wii console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title is "not necessarily going to move a lot of new systems like the first 'Halo' did," said Dan Hsu, editor-in-chief of the EGM gaming magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the same time, with all the marketing blitz and hype, consumers will be out there," Hsu said, "and if they are thinking video games, they are thinking one of two things: 'Halo' or the Wii."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft rose 68 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $29.33 at mid-afternoon on Nasdaq, after earlier hitting a high of $29.61.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Scott Hillis in San Francisco)&lt;/p&gt;

Drug planes packed with South American cocaine -- often with passenger seats ripped out to make space -- frequently fly through Mexico and Central America en route for the United States. Some unload their cargo at clandestine airstrips south of the border where traffickers send it on by road or sea. President Felipe Calderon has deployed thousands of troops against Mexican drug gangs. The murder rate from cartel turf wars has calmed down since March but killings still number around 2,000 people so far this year.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Daisuke Wakabayashi &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Sept 20 (Reuters) - The mission of Master Chief, the protagonist in the popular "Halo" trilogy of video games, is to save humanity from an army of aliens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    If that's not enough to thrust upon one person, he's got another task: rescue Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Xbox video game business from six years of losses and post its first-ever profit, and keep Wall Street off the backs of management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Halo 3" hits stores on Tuesday and Microsoft projects first-day sales of the game to eclipse the $125 million mark set by its predecessor, saying it will be the biggest opening for any entertainment product ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The last two "Halo" installments sold a combined 14.8 million units at more than $50 a game, turning the original Xbox into a must-have machine for many gamers and making the game extremely profitable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    This is a make-or-break year for the Xbox business. It has lost roughly $5 billion since Microsoft entered the video game console business in 2001 as a way to stem the rise of Sony Corp's (6758.T) PlayStation game console. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Xbox 360, the successor to the original Xbox, made its debut about a year ahead of other next-generation game consoles, building a lead over Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS hugely popular Wii with an installed base of more than 11.6 million units. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This is certainly a huge game for Microsoft in order to maintain the momentum with the Xbox 360 having the lead over Sony," said Alan Davis, analyst at D.A. Davidson &amp; Co. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Anyone who wants to play "Halo 3," a futuristic shooter game featuring a space marine called Master Chief fighting an alien army called the Covenant, will have to buy an Xbox 360, since Microsoft makes the software only for its own machine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft hopes that is just the incentive shoppers need ahead of the holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are in the stage of the console life cycle where content becomes king and people are going to buy the platform that has the games they want," Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division, told investors at the company's analyst meeting in July. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We feel like that (Halo) gives us a significant leg up and really will help drive the business." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft projects the entertainment and devices division, home to the Xbox video game console and loss-making Zune digital music player, to post a profit in the 2008 fiscal year ending in June after last year's $1.9 billion loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It expects segment revenue to increase between 10 percent and 19 percent this year from last year's $6.08 billion, 12 percent of Microsoft's total revenue of $51 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    WINDOW TO CONSUMERS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Like most console makers, Microsoft loses money on the sales of the Xbox 360 with the goal of making it back and then some over the life of the product with software sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It is a business model accepted by investors, but Microsoft introduced an unexpected loss in fiscal 2007 when it took a $1.06 billion charge to fix problems with the Xbox 360. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    That loss strengthened the argument made by some investors who think Microsoft should stay out of consumer businesses such as the Zune and Xbox and focus on its profit-rich core software products such as its Windows operating system and Office suite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft argues the Xbox and Zune are important in a world where people consume content in new and different ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Xbox 360 is central to Microsoft's strategy of "connected entertainment," a vision of a world where people can consume the media they want any place, any time and on any device. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The market is not a patient place and it's not very patient with Microsoft in this respect," said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran. "It's going to be an important milestone for the game division to finally turn a profit this year." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Since Microsoft officially entered the game business in November 2001 with the North American release of the Xbox,  Microsoft shares have fallen 16 percent. During that period, the Nasdaq has risen 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Halo 3" is expected to play a big part in improving Microsoft's bottom line, because it is a "first party" title -- a game developed by Microsoft's own game maker not another publisher such as Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft can make about $10 to $12 per game from "third party" titles, but "first party" games such as "Halo 3" and "Gears of War" -- a popular shooter game released by Microsoft last year -- can bring in several times that amount. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Andre Grenon; Reuters Messaging: daisuke.wakabayashi.reuters.com@reuters.net +1 206 652 2326)) Keywords: MICROSOFT HALO/FINANCIALS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI/LONDON (Reuters) - Walt Disney's international television arm said on Monday it would let viewers of Finnish commercial broadcaster Nelonen pay to watch hit shows on the Internet four days after their U.S. release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney-ABC International said the deal with Nelonen, part of SanomaWSOY group, marks the first time the company has introduced multiple network series to non-U.S. markets so soon after release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shows being offered include series such as "Ugly Betty", "Grey's Anatomy", "Desperate Housewives" and "Lost".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each episode will cost 3 euros ($4.2), and viewers can watch it up to 10 times within the next 24 hours of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finland was particularly attractive to Disney, given the country's relatively high broadband penetration and viewers' appetite for legally downloading and paying to watch shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We and Disney have a learning perspective here. Finnish people easily take up new technologies. As a relatively small, homogeneous market, Finland is a good test bed for consumer behavior," Finnish Nelonen's channel head, Pirjo Airaksinen, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but other Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) services that provide television programming via broadband cables often involve a fee being paid by the broadcaster and revenue sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has made much over the past year of its desire to pursue new business models in growing markets outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Finnish agreement also reflects efforts by major studios and networks to get movies and television shows released faster to help combat piracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arash Amel, a senior analyst at media research company Screen Digest in London, said the speed with which viewers in the U.S. could load television shows onto their computers and then circulate them on file-sharing or user-generated sites meant the broadcasting industry was moving faster towards simultaneous release for big shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(Uploading such shows) is happening on a mass scale, and it means the windowing problems studios have for movies is now visiting the television sector," Amel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amel said the growing threat of piracy meant companies were having to work faster and experiment more with getting shows to as many markets internationally as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelonen said it had approached Disney-ABC to launch the service and the shows would now become available up to a year ahead of their screening on Nelonen's terrestrial channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, it has taken anywhere between three and six months for U.S. shows to appear on European television screens, but that gap has been narrowing sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is an old-fashioned model of doing business, which is all about content owners, networks and broadcasters controlling what viewers watch and when and in the era of Internet that model has crumbled," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move to reduce the gap was underscored in January when British-based satellite operator BSkyB began showing "Lost", one of the world's most popular TV shows, to UK viewers four days after it had aired in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelonen said the service may include commercials as it evolves further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It remains to be seen if it will eventually be the consumer or advertiser who pays (for the shows)," Nelonen's Airaksinen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelonen reaches 2.1 million viewers a day with its TV-channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's
largest drugmaker, said on Monday the European Commission had
approved its AIDS drug Celsentri, the first in a new class of
oral HIV medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The drug -- which is known generically as maraviroc and as
Selzentry in the United States -- is the first designed to keep
the HIV virus that causes AIDS from entering healthy immune
cells. Older AIDS medicines attack the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It works by blocking the CCR5 co-receptor that serves as a
main doorway for the HIV virus into immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The green light from the European authorities had been
expected after a panel of EU experts recommended the product in
July. The medicine was also cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Celsentri is approved for use in patients who have tried
other medicines and for whom a diagnostic test has confirmed
their HIV strain is linked to the CCR5 receptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York-based Pfizer is counting on new medicines such as
Celsentri to help drive profits as several blockbusters lose
patent protection and its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol
treatment faces strong competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry analysts have projected annual Celsentri sales of
about $500 million by 2011.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Joseph A. Giannone &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) (GS.N) has already set aside more for compensation than it did for all of last year, contrary to speculation that Wall Street earnings and bonuses would be squeezed by the summertime credit crunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman, which trounced expectations with a 79 percent increase in third-quarter earnings, said it reserved $16.9 billion in the first nine months of its fiscal year, up 21 percent from last year's period and exceeding the $16.5 billion set aside in all of 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The 2007 reserves -- which average out to $565,000 per employee -- will go toward salaries and employee benefits. The bulk of the compensation is paid out in bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In a briefing with reporters Thursday, Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said headcount, which rose 17 percent from last year and 7 percent during the quarter, would continue to expand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We don't have a slowdown," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The rising fortunes of Goldman's employees reflect the bank's rising revenue and profit at a time when corporate loans, volatile stocks and swooning mortgage markets made this summer the most challenging in years. Goldman's third-quarter net revenue rose 63 percent to $12.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bonuses track growth at Wall Street firms, which typically pay out half their revenue to employees. A disproportionate share is concentrated among the high executives and top performers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Firms each quarter set aside what they estimate they will pay out after the end of the fiscal year, so fourth quarter accruals remain a real wild card. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rivals Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N all reported lower earnings this week, and several investment banks have announced job cuts in struggling businesses. Morgan and Lehman, though they haven't exceeded last year's accruals, are on pace to boost compensation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     Morgan Stanley set aside $13.4 billion for the first nine months, up 25 percent, well on its way to matching the $14.4 billion Morgan paid out in 2006. But the per-employee average compensation this year works out to $280,000 per employee, or half that of Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Lehman Brothers, meanwhile, set aside $7.33 billion, up 14 percent from the year-earlier period, or $255,000 per employee. Last year Lehman paid out $8.67 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The exception to the trend is Bear Stearns, where nine-month compensation fell 6 percent to $3.10 billion, or $199,730 an employee, as the mortgage meltdown inflicted losses on its trading, financing and hedge fund businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bear paid out $4.34 billion in salary and bonuses last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sept 21 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said a federal appeals court overturned a lower court ruling that several generic-drug makers did not infringe its patent on gabapentin, the active ingredient in Neurontin, a shingles-pain treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said the ruling will allow it to seek a judgment of infringement and, if successful, pursue full compensation for the damage it suffered from the 2004 launch of generic versions of Neurontin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the New Jersey Federal District Court should not have granted summary judgment to the generic-drug makers, and that a full trial should be held on Pfizer's allegations of patent infringement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Prior to the launch of the generics, Pfizer's sales of Neurontin were more than $2 billion a year, Pfizer said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Family Dollar Stores Inc (FDO.N) shares fell 4 percent on Friday after JP Morgan downgraded the discount retailer, saying it is facing an uphill battle from a macroeconomic and competitive standpoint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The brokerage cut its rating on Family Dollar shares to "underweight" from "neutral." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In a research note, Charles Grom said that, if the back-to- school shopping season is any indication, "it's going to be tough sledding for many retailers, particularly Family Dollar this upcoming holiday season." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He cited the likelihood of increased price competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and said Dollar General, which was purchased earlier this year by private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co, would likely become a "more formidable  competitor." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Grom also said Family Dollar's comparable store sales, which measure sales at stores open at least a year, have been soft for much of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "With the pay cycle more pronounced, energy prices on the rise and higher ARM resets/foreclosures (50 percent of FDO customers are homeowners) it's hard to envision this trend reversing," he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Family Dollar shares were down $1.22, or 4.3 percent, at $27.07 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Nicole Maestri) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;((Editing by Andre Grenon; Reuters Messaging: nicole.maestri.reuters.com@reuters.net +1-646-223-6173)) Keywords: FAMILYDOLLAR STOCK/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's largest drug maker, said on Friday it is in talks with investors about spinning off its Japanese research and development laboratory, albeit as a much smaller organisation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Its drug discovery research centre in Nagoya, central Japan, is set to close by April next year as part of major restructuring by Pfizer that means about 10,000 job cuts worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    While that closure of the lab, which has some 380 employees, will go ahead, investors are interested in funding a new company of 80 people, centred around its top researchers, Hiromitsu Iwasaki, chief executive of Pfizer Japan, told a news conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    U.S, European and Japanese investors, which include banks and funds, have shown interest although that level varies greatly depending on Pfizer's potential stake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We have some investors who say they think the company will do much better if is independent and any Pfizer stake is small and we have others who say they would be more comfortable with bigger Pfizer participation," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The newly reborn laboratory would initially focus on discovering drugs for pain-related and gastro-intestinal diseases but also move on to clinical trials later, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A spokesman for the laboratory said it may take on developing dormant patents on Pfizer drugs for the Japanese markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer had come under much criticism in Japan for closing the lab, with industry executives saying the company might find it hard to attract top people in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Edwina Gibbs, editing by Paul Bolding; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Reuters messaging: edwina.gibbs.reuters.com@reuters.net; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Email: edwina.gibbs.@reuters.com; +81 3 3432-8720))  Keywords: PFIZER JAPAN/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - After making stars of 
singer-actors like Hilary Duff and Miley Cyrus, Disney Channel 
has now set its sights on a trio of teen siblings, ordering a 
series, movie and concert special starring recording act the 
Jonas Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Kevin, Joe and Nick Jonas will star in a live-action spy 
comedy titled "J.O.N.A.S.," which is set to go into production 
early next year. They play government sleuths -- a.k.a. Junior 
Operatives Networking as Spies (J.O.N.A.S.) -- who thwart evil 
while working undercover as a superstar teen rock band. The 
number of episodes has yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently in production in Toronto is "Camp Rock," a 
music-filled original movie that will premiere on the cable 
channel next summer. The Jonases play members of a leading 
musical group, Connect 3, who are celebrity guest counselors at 
a prestigious summer camp for aspiring musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, the network is set to air a concert special, 
"Jonas Brothers in Concert," originating from New York's 
Gramercy Park, on October 6. The special will feature songs 
from the group's self-titled second album, released by Walt 
Disney Co.-owned Hollywood Records, which recently reached No. 
5 on the Billboard 200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All three projects also will air on Disney Channel around 
the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Channel does seem to have a magic touch when it 
comes to making stars. Along with Duff and "Hannah Montana" 
starlet Cyrus, it also has boosted the careers of such 
youngsters as Shia LaBeouf, Zac Efron and Raven-Symone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the Jonas Brothers already have a following among the 
tween set. The trio -- who were raised in Wyckoff, N.J., and 
now live in Los Angeles -- came to the attention of Radio 
Disney in early 2005 and were added to its playlist in October 
of that year. Since then, they recorded the theme song to 
Disney Channel's animated series "American Dragon: Jake Long," 
and that music video and others have been regularly featured on 
the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brothers also were showcased in summer 2006 in a 
concert special from the "Disney Channel Games" at Walt Disney 
World in Orlando and guest-starred in the record-setting 
episode of "Hannah Montana" that aired after the premiere of 
"High School Musical 2" last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gary Marsh, Disney Channel Worldwide president of 
entertainment, said music has become a big part of Disney 
Channel's programming, citing other original movies such as the 
"High School Musical" and "Cheetah Girls" franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Next up for the Jonas Brothers is a 54-date arena tour as 
part of the Hannah Montana  Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds 
jaunt that kicks off in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A California appeals court on Tuesday declined to reinstate a long-running case against the Walt Disney Co over royalties it paid for its popular Winnie the Pooh character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004, a Los Angeles trial court dismissed the case brought by the estate of Stephen Slesinger, the literary agent who helped popularize Winnie the Pooh in the United States, on the grounds that the Slesingers' legal team illegally obtained documents by trespassing on Disney property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slesinger's widow and daughter sued Disney in 1991, claiming the media company had underreported Pooh sales and owed the estate billions of dollars in royalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has conceded in securities filings that the case exposed the company to huge potential losses if the Slesingers prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Slesinger's daughter, Pati, said she will appeal the latest decision to the state Supreme Court, and will proceed with a federal lawsuit seeking $2 billion in damages and to strip Disney of its rights to the Pooh character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney attorney Daniel Petrocelli said the state case "never had merit from the outset and the only way it was kept alive so long was by breaking the rules."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This misconduct was breathtaking and there was really no choice but to throw out the case," Petrocelli said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Pooh merchandise generated more than $6 billion in retail sales in 2005, for which Disney realizes a licensing fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slesinger, a New York television and film producer, obtained exclusive merchandising and other rights to the Pooh works from author A.A. Milne in 1930.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slesinger and Milne's widow passed those rights to Disney in 1961 in exchange for royalties from the sale of Pooh products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has cemented its reputation among hardcore gamers with the launch of alien shoot-out "Halo 3," but it is still struggling to attract the mass market audience that has flocked to Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS Wii console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widely expected to be one of the top-selling games of the year after its Tuesday debut, "Halo 3" should help Microsoft sell more of its Xbox 360 gaming machines and finally turn a profit in its entertainment division this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that you will have a lot of people begin to look at the Xbox 360, especially for holiday purchases," said Van Baker, an analyst with market research firm Gartner, citing the strong reviews for "Halo 3," which starts at $60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it had 1.7 million advance orders for the game in the United States, but it won't release actual sales figures for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank said checks carried out ahead of the game's launch indicated stronger-than-expected demand that could mean revenue from "Halo 3" this fiscal year may be as much as $430 million, nearly 80 percent higher than previous estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe demand for 'Halo 3' could drive EDD to profitability," analyst Todd Raker wrote in a note, referring to Microsoft's Entertainment and Devices Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox 360 leads the current-generation console market, with nearly 12 million units shipped globally by the end of June, compared with more than 9 million for the Wii and over 4 million for Sony Corp's (6758.T) PlayStation 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Wii, which launched a year after the Xbox 360, has outsold rivals every month this year and may soon overtake the Xbox 360 in terms of total worldwide sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does the Wii offer the lowest price -- $250 versus $280 for the cheapest Xbox and $500 for the cheapest PS3 -- it also features an innovative motion-sensing controller that lets players act like they are really swinging a sword or rolling a bowling ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An emphasis on simple games that get players off the couch has made the Wii attractive to older people and women, customers outside the base of young males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIVING ROOM HOPES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft knows it must attract casual customers as well if the Xbox 360 is going to be a living-room fixture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's the biggest challenge Microsoft has. They were never able to do that with the original Xbox and they will be hard-pressed to do it with the 360," said Todd Mitchell, an analyst with Nollenberger Capital Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has praised Nintendo for "expanding the market", but so far its attempts to attract a broader audience have met with mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's "Viva Pinata," a kid-oriented game in which players tend to a virtual garden inhabited by colorful pinata animals, saw only lackluster sales despite critical praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft is nothing if not persistent, and a second "Viva Pinata" game is in the works for this holiday featuring a collection of simple "party games" meant to be played by several people at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the problem is image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The huge buzz around games like "Halo 3" obscures the fact that Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade has about 100 games available for download. These range from arcade classics like "Pac-Man" to popular card games like "Texas Hold'em".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They need to take their lowest-priced model and push it with a combination of games they have with Xbox Live. It's not games coming out of Activision (ATVI.O) or EA ERTS.O, it's the $5 to $10 games on Live," Mitchell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker said he expected Microsoft to ramp up marketing aimed at casual gamers in another month or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've got a pretty good offering for casual gamers with Xbox Live Arcade, but the problem they have is they are not perceived as a casual gamer platform," Baker said. "They have to do some messaging and marketing to that consumer to let them know the Xbox 360 is viable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Click here to see Reuters MediaFile blog)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) began selling "Halo 3" on Tuesday, hoping the acclaimed alien shooter game will widen its lead over Sony Corp (6758.T) in the battle for industry dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some game enthusiasts lined up before dawn at a Best Buy store on New York's Fifth Avenue to grab a good seat for the launch extravaganza while others took advantage of the retailer's offer to let them pay for a copy of the game and pick it up at midnight or the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Escobar was the first one at the store's checkout counter, turning in a receipt to pick up his advance order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is worth it. It is time to finish this fight," Escobar said, echoing the tagline for a game featuring a futuristic soldier battling to save humanity from an alien onslaught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What had been a only a modest gathering earlier in the day had swelled to a crowd of about 500 people that cheered as buyers entered the store, resembling other big consumer debuts this year, such as the last "Harry Potter" book and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Halo 3" is seen as the $30 billion video game industry's equivalent of a new Potter book and Microsoft is counting on the game to finally push its money-losing entertainment unit into profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a critical holiday in terms of winning the next-generation console fight versus our competition and nobody has anything to go up and match 'Halo,'" Shane Kim, vice president of Microsoft Game Studios, told Reuters Television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is backing the game with a marketing blitz that includes celebrity-studded midnight sales events at some 10,000 retailers across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaming retail chain GameStop Corp (GME.N) said the title set a record for advance orders, while Microsoft expects initial demand to surpass that for 2004's "Halo 2," which racked up $125 million in its first 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a Best Buy near Microsoft headquarters outside Seattle, company founder Bill Gates was cheered by a crowd of more than 500 people when he emerged from the store to shake hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates personally sold and autographed the first copy to Ritesh David, a 17-year-old who was stunned to find himself being served by the richest man in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I gotta check your ID to see if you're 17," Gates said, in a joking reference to the game's "mature" rating, meaning it is intended for customers 17 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYSTEM SELLER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two "Halo" games have sold a combined 15 million copies and cemented Microsoft as a serious player in a video game industry that was dominated by Sony's PlayStation 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Halo 3" is targeted firmly at the core Xbox audience of young males, for whom realistic combat games are a staple. It does little to widen the machine's appeal to a more casual audience that is being successfully courted by Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS Wii console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not necessarily going to move a lot of new systems like the first 'Halo' did," said Dan Hsu, editor-in-chief of EGM, a gaming magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the same time, with all the marketing blitz and hype, consumers will be out there," Hsu said, "and if they are thinking video games, they are thinking one of two things: 'Halo' or the Wii."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is certainly betting that the last chapter of the Halo trilogy will give a further boost to its latest console. The Xbox 360, launched in late 2005, has already enjoyed stronger sales than the pricier PlayStation 3, which critics say so far lacks any "system-seller" games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was caught between buying the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but there are certain games like 'Madden '08' and this one that pushed me to Xbox 360," said Darnell Jefferson, 25, who was second in line at Best Buy, referring to the hit football game made by Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Halo 3" will benefit from the absence of another blockbuster game, "Grand Theft Auto IV," whose October debut was delayed by publisher Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO.O) until some time between February and April 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest "Halo" has drawn wide praise from reviewers for its lush settings, cinematic story and breadth of features, positive buzz that pushed Microsoft shares up as much as 3.35 percent on Monday, their biggest one-day gain since April. The stock ended 1.5 percent higher at $29.08 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Scott Hillis in San Francisco and Robert MacMillan in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court said
on Tuesday that it would decide a case initially filed by
people who said they were harmed by the withdrawn diabetes drug
Rezulin, a dispute that hinges on whether state or federal law
take precedence when the two clash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) unit Warner-Lambert, the maker of
Rezulin, appealed to the high court after a federal appeals
court in New York reinstated the lawsuit in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit, filed by Michigan residents who said their
injuries were caused by Rezulin, had been dismissed by U.S.
District Judge Lewis Kaplan in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He ruled that state law shielded pharmaceutical companies
from liability claims unless there is evidence the company
misrepresented or withheld material information in obtaining
approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the
drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rezulin was pulled from the market in March 2000 at the
request of the FDA after about 100 people who took the medicine
needed liver transplants or died from acute liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York appeals court had reinstated the lawsuit
because, it argued, a lower court judge had wrongly concluded
that federal law preempted  claims made under a Michigan state
product liability statute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, which acquired Warner-Lambert some three months
after Rezulin was withdrawn, fought thousands of lawsuits
claiming that Warner-Lambert failed to inform the public of the
drug's liver toxicity risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The justices will hear arguments in the case earlier next
year, with a decision likely by the end of June.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, changes source)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 25 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities upgraded digital
media software company Sonic Solutions SNIC.O to "overweight"
from "neutral," saying the stock is significantly undervalued
compared to its peer group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said Sonic is positioned to benefit from the
DVD industry's decision to permit Internet downloading, and the
release of digital media suite, MediaCreator10, should provide
a seasonal lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said Sonic's stock-options backdating review
should conclude soon, thereby reducing related costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were up more than 4 percent at $9.28
in morning trade on the Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is in talks to buy up to 5 percent of Facebook in a deal that could value the fast-growing online social network company at $10 billion or more, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move could give maturing Microsoft more access to young users and let Facebook get closer to a major software maker at a time when its growth is increasingly tied to a proliferation of small applications from independent developers on its site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing people familiar with the matter, the Journal said the world's largest software company sought to buy a stake of up to 5 percent in Facebook for $300 million to $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook, led by its 23-year-old founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, may insist on a valuation as high as $15 billion and is considering raising up to $500 million in cash to expand its operations, according to the Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a deal could help Microsoft better compete against Web search leader Google Inc for a growing base of online advertising and put one of the Internet's hottest names in Microsoft's camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook, which already has an advertising deal with Microsoft, would benefit from closer ties with developers as it seeks to turn its site into a full-fledged Web platform where users can play games, interact and read news about each other, said Forrester analyst Charlene Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you are building a business around building a platform there is one company that has done it better than anybody else -- and that is Microsoft," she said. "People have been just assuming that Google would be the best partner and that is not necessarily the case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has also expressed an interest in investing in Facebook, the Journal report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would probably be pretty good for Microsoft since it has not had the best success in creating really hip, young-people-grabbing stuff on the Web," said Kim Caughey, a senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which oversees more than $1 billion, including Microsoft shares, for clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Microsoft and Facebook declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg has repeatedly said his company wants to remain independent and is seen as preparing to float itself on the stock market eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook has grown to 39 million members, up nearly 63 percent from 24 million in late May, and is quickly gaining ground on larger rival MySpace, which was taken over by News Corp in 2005 for what is now seen as a bargain price of $580 million. MySpace has more than 200 million users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook's explosion popularity has also drawn increased scrutiny, including a 50-state investigation into the company by attorneys general concerned about Web sexual predators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said on Monday his office had subpoenaed Facebook and accused it of not keeping young users safe. Facebook said it was preparing a statement about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft already has an exclusive agreement until 2011 to broker display advertisements for Facebook. The Journal said Microsoft and Facebook are discussing expanding that agreement beyond the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After relinquishing an early advantage in the lucrative paid search market to Google and Yahoo Inc, Microsoft is trying to catch up by clinching deals to broker display advertising to some of the leading names in "Web 2.0."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo and Google are also maneuvering. Earlier this year, for instance, News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch said he had discussed swapping MySpace for a 25 percent stake in Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web 2.0 is a catch-phrase for a new generation of Internet services that run on interactive software and typically rely on content generated by users to attract more visitors. Microsoft also has an agreement with popular news site Digg.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 1.5 percent to $29.08 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi, with additional reporting by Michele Gershberg and Yinka Agedoke in New York, Peter Henderson in Los Angeles; editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) have halted negotiations on the disputed Natuna D-Alpha gas block, which is now controlled by the U.S. company, an official at energy watchdog BPMIGAS told Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talks on the offshore gas project, estimated to require investment of about $40 billion, have run into several problems, attracting the attention of foreign investors who are already wary of committing money to Southeast Asia's biggest economy because of its weak legal system, bureaucracy and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent setback over Natuna has arisen because the two parties involved cannot agree on how to split the gas produced, the official said, but other unresolved issues include the length of Exxon's contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the Indonesian side is waiting for the government to issue new instructions before talks can resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon controls a 76 percent stake in the Natuna block while Indonesian state oil and gas firm, Pertamina, owns 24 percent and would like to increase its stake to half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia also says that Exxon's contract giving it that 76 percent share has expired, whereas the energy major has said the contract is valid until 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BPMIGAS official, who asked not to be identified by name, said the two sides stopped talking recently because they could not agree on how to split the gas produced from the block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Indonesia wants a 65 percent split for the government and 35 percent for the contractor. Exxon has rejected the proposal because it wants more," the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can say the talks on Natuna are in deadlock. The Indonesian negotiating team has reported to the government about the differences," the official added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon Mobil spokeswoman in Jakarta said she could not comment on the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARBITRATION?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former Pertamina official, Gatot Wiroyudo, said foreign investors such as Exxon Mobil require more certainty for their contracts such as the production split, or such disputes could end up in arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it is brought to arbitration, it can have serious consequences. Exxon is a multinational company with an international network. It will also have political impact," said Wiroyudo, who now lectures on energy at Trisakti University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Natuna D-Alpha block has around 222 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas reserves, of which about 46 tcf is thought to be commercially recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The block, which is about 1,100 km (680 miles) north of Jakarta and 200 km east of the West Natuna fields that feed gas to Singapore, accounts for about a quarter of Indonesia's total commercially recoverable gas reserves of 182 tcf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia's mines and energy Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro said in July that the price of Natuna gas, which contained around 70 percent carbon dioxide, is still too high, making it expensive to develop and difficult to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia has said it wants Pertamina to be the majority shareholder in Natuna. The state oil firm said in January that it wanted to increase its stake to 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp
(MSFT.O) began selling "Halo 3" on Tuesday, hoping the acclaimed
alien shooter game will widen its lead over Sony Corp (6758.T)
in the battle for industry dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Some game enthusiasts lined up before dawn at a Best Buy
store on New York's Fifth Avenue to grab a good seat for the
launch extravaganza while others took advantage of the
retailer's offer to let them pay for a copy of the game and pick
it up at midnight or the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Escobar was the first one at the store's checkout
counter, turning in a receipt to pick up his advance order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is worth it. It is time to finish this fight," Escobar
said, echoing the tagline for a game featuring a futuristic
soldier battling to save humanity from an alien onslaught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What had been a only a modest gathering earlier in the day
had swelled to a crowd of about 500 people that cheered as
buyers entered the store, resembling other big consumer debuts
this year, such as the last "Harry Potter" book and Apple Inc's
(AAPL.O) iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Halo 3" is seen as the $30 billion video game industry's
equivalent of a new Potter book and Microsoft is counting on the
game to finally push its money-losing entertainment unit into
profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a critical holiday in terms of winning the
next-generation console fight versus our competition and nobody
has anything to go up and match 'Halo,'" Shane Kim, vice
president of Microsoft Game Studios, told Reuters Television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is backing the game with a marketing blitz that
includes celebrity-studded midnight sales events at some 10,000
retailers across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gaming retail chain GameStop Corp (GME.N) said the title set
a record for advance orders, while Microsoft expects initial
demand to surpass that for 2004's "Halo 2," which racked up $125
million in its first 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At a Best Buy near Microsoft headquarters outside Seattle,
company founder Bill Gates was cheered by a crowd of more than
500 people when he emerged from the store to shake hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gates personally sold and autographed the first copy to
Ritesh David, a 17-year-old who was stunned to find himself
being served by the richest man in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I gotta check your ID to see if you're 17," Gates said, in
a joking reference to the game's "mature" rating, meaning it is
intended for customers 17 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SYSTEM SELLER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first two "Halo" games have sold a combined 15 million
copies and cemented Microsoft as a serious player in a video
game industry that was dominated by Sony's PlayStation 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Halo 3" is targeted firmly at the core Xbox audience of
young males, for whom realistic combat games are a staple. It
does little to widen the machine's appeal to a more casual
audience that is being successfully courted by Nintendo Co Ltd's
7974.OS Wii console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's not necessarily going to move a lot of new systems
like the first 'Halo' did," said Dan Hsu, editor-in-chief of
EGM, a gaming magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At the same time, with all the marketing blitz and hype,
consumers will be out there," Hsu said, "and if they are
thinking video games, they are thinking one of two things:
'Halo' or the Wii."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is certainly betting that the last chapter of the
Halo trilogy will give a further boost to its latest console.
The Xbox 360, launched in late 2005, has already enjoyed
stronger sales than the pricier PlayStation 3, which critics say
so far lacks any "system-seller" games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I was caught between buying the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,
but there are certain games like 'Madden '08' and this one that
pushed me to Xbox 360," said Darnell Jefferson, 25, who was
second in line at Best Buy, referring to the hit football game
made by Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Halo 3" will benefit from the absence of another
blockbuster game, "Grand Theft Auto IV," whose October debut was
delayed by publisher Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO.O)
until some time between February and April 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest "Halo" has drawn wide praise from reviewers for
its lush settings, cinematic story and breadth of features,
positive buzz that pushed Microsoft shares up as much as 3.35
percent on Monday, their biggest one-day gain since April. The
stock ended 1.5 percent higher at $29.08 on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - After making stars of singer-actors like Hilary Duff and Miley Cyrus, Disney Channel has now set its sights on a trio of teen siblings, ordering a series, movie and concert special starring recording act the Jonas Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin, Joe and Nick Jonas will star in a live-action spy comedy titled "J.O.N.A.S.," which is set to go into production early next year. They play government sleuths -- a.k.a. Junior Operatives Networking as Spies (J.O.N.A.S.) -- who thwart evil while working undercover as a superstar teen rock band. The number of episodes has yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently in production in Toronto is "Camp Rock," a music-filled original movie that will premiere on the cable channel next summer. The Jonases play members of a leading musical group, Connect 3, who are celebrity guest counselors at a prestigious summer camp for aspiring musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the network is set to air a concert special, "Jonas Brothers in Concert," originating from New York's Gramercy Park, on October 6. The special will feature songs from the group's self-titled second album, released by Walt Disney Co.-owned Hollywood Records, which recently reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three projects also will air on Disney Channel around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Channel does seem to have a magic touch when it comes to making stars. Along with Duff and "Hannah Montana" starlet Cyrus, it also has boosted the careers of such youngsters as Shia LaBeouf, Zac Efron and Raven-Symone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the Jonas Brothers already have a following among the tween set. The trio -- who were raised in Wyckoff, N.J., and now live in Los Angeles -- came to the attention of Radio Disney in early 2005 and were added to its playlist in October of that year. Since then, they recorded the theme song to Disney Channel's animated series "American Dragon: Jake Long," and that music video and others have been regularly featured on the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brothers also were showcased in summer 2006 in a concert special from the "Disney Channel Games" at Walt Disney World in Orlando and guest-starred in the record-setting episode of "Hannah Montana" that aired after the premiere of "High School Musical 2" last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Marsh, Disney Channel Worldwide president of entertainment, said music has become a big part of Disney Channel's programming, citing other original movies such as the "High School Musical" and "Cheetah Girls" franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up for the Jonas Brothers is a 54-date arena tour as part of the Hannah Montana  Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds jaunt that kicks off in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is talking to Facebook about buying a minority stake in the fast-growing online social network that could value the company at $10 billion or more, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Citing people familiar with the matter, the Journal said the world's largest software company sought to buy a stake of up to 5 percent in Facebook for $300 million to $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Facebook, led by its 23-year-old founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, may insist on a valuation as high as $15 billion and is considering raising up to $500 million in cash to expand its operations, according to the Journal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Such a deal could help Microsoft better compete against Web search leader Google Inc (GOOG.O) for email users and a growing base of Internet advertising. Google has also expressed an interest in investing in Facebook, the Journal report said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Facebook, which allows members to seek out a circle of friends and share online activities, has seen speculation over a potential partnership or buyout intensify as it rapidly expands its base of users and advertisers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It has grown to 39 million members, up nearly 63 percent from 24 million in late May and is quickly gaining ground against larger rival MySpace, owned by News Corp NWSa.N. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft shares rose 2.5 percent to $29.36 in late trading on the Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft would not comment on the report, while Facebook representatives were not immediately available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Additional reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Michele Gershberg, editing by Braden Reddall; Reuters Messaging: michele.gershberg.reuters.com@reuters.net; E-mail: michele.gershberg@reuters.com; +1-646-223-6185)) Keywords: FACEBOOK MICROSOFT/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

of Northern Rock appear to be fading, raising the prospect of it

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) "Halo 3" video game set an opening-day U.S. sales record of $170 million, outdoing any video game or movie debut and giving the company's money-losing entertainment unit a strong boost toward profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alien-shooting fans also surged onto Microsoft's Xbox Live online service. More than a million members took up virtual arms in "Halo 3" in the first 20 hours on September 25, the day the game debuted, Microsoft said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Halo 3" easily surpassed its predecessor, 2004's "Halo 2," which racked up $125 million on the first day. The $60 game also beat the $59 million U.S. opening-day movie box office record, set by "Spider-Man 3".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a good number," said Andy Miedler, technology analyst at Edward Jones. "This certainly goes a long way toward bringing Microsoft's entertainment division toward that full-year profitability, which we think is important for investors," he added.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) is making its chief administrative officer, Edward
Forst, the co-head of its investment management division,
according to an internal memo, bolstering a division beset by
struggles at some high-profile hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Forst, 46, will run the division along with Peter Kraus.
Forst fills a vacancy created three months ago when Eric
Schwartz stepped down as co-head of investment management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Ed, together with Peter Kraus, will lead our efforts to
grow our combined asset management and private wealth platform,
which already is one of the largest in the world," said the
memo from Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and the
co-presidents, Jon Winkelried and Gary Cohn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman spokeswoman Andrea Raphael confirmed the memo, but
declined to make further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forst made headlines in February when he was transferred to
London, making him the highest-ranking Wall Street executive to
be posted overseas. Goldman said Forst will remain in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment management has become increasingly important for
Goldman, which last week reported 27 percent growth in managed
assets to $796 billion. But it has also been the source of some
bad news this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The flagship Global Alpha hedge fund has plunged about 40
percent in value, and Goldman and investors infused $3 billion
of new cash to bolster a Global Equity Opportunities fund
hammered by market volatility this summer. Goldman executives
said they expect more than $1 billion in further Global Alpha
redemptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The division's revenue fell 1 percent in the first nine
months of the fiscal year, versus the year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forst previously was chief of staff in the equities and
fixed-income divisions and a co-head of global credit markets.
Since 2004, Forst has been co-head of operations, technology,
finance and services with Finance Chief David Viniar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forst joined the firm in 1994 in capital markets, was
promoted to managing director in 1996 and made a partner in
1998, the memo said.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds online details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on
Wednesday said its "Halo 3" video game had $170 million in
sales on its first day, easily surpassing its predecessor,
2004's "Halo 2," which racked up $125 million in the first
day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is counting on the alien-shootout game, the final
chapter in a trilogy, to boost the company's money-losing
entertainment unit to profit this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The game which debuted this week is also key to Microsoft's
quest to widen its lead over rival Sony Corp (6758.T) in the
battle for industry dominance of the current generation of game
machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the strength's of Microsoft's Xbox 360 console is
its ability for online play, and Microsoft in a statement said
that more than a million members of the Xbox Live online
service played Halo 3 over the Web within the first 20 hours.
Sept. 25 was the most active day ever for the online platform.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on Wednesday that its board had approved share buybacks of up to $15 billion over the next three years, the latest in a series of huge repurchases by oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron said its new repurchase program was equal to the three $5 billion buybacks that were completed in 2005, 2006 and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil companies have been buying up massive amounts of their own stock on the market to pass on the windfall profits from soaring energy prices in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's buyback matches the $15 billion program that peer ConocoPhillips (COP.N) announced in July. ConocoPhillips plans to complete those purchases by the end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude oil prices reached a record high of $83.90 per barrel on Thursday, fueled by the U.S. interest rate cuts, the weakening dollar and fears of supply disruptions from storms in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our continuing strong cash flows have enabled us to fund a significant capital program budgeted at almost $20 billion in 2007, increase dividends to our stockholders, repurchase our shares in the market and reduce the company's debt," Chevron Chief Executive Dave O'Reilly said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second quarter was the largest ever in the history of U.S. companies' buybacks, with the Standard and Poor's 500 members spending $158 billion on their own stock, according to SP analyst Howard Silverblatt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that quarter, buybacks outpaced capital expenditures, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has been buying about $1.1 billion of its shares from the market per quarter, well below industry leader Exxon Mobil's (XOM.N) top mark of $9.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SP 500 companies began the buybacks in earnest in the fourth quarter of 2004, Silverblatt said, with about $1.1 billion in shares being returned to corporate treasuries since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology sector has been the most active, claiming about 23 percent of all the buybacks, followed by the financial sector at nearly 22 percent. The energy industry had contributed about 9.7 percent of the SP's buybacks in that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares were up 1.2 percent at $93.02 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade, just ahead of the 1 percent gain for the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index .OIX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Daily)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has cemented its reputation among hardcore gamers with the launch of alien shoot-out "Halo 3," but it is still struggling to attract the mass market audience that has flocked to Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS Wii console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widely expected to be one of the top-selling games of the year after its Tuesday debut, "Halo 3" should help Microsoft sell more of its Xbox 360 gaming machines and finally turn a profit in its entertainment division this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that you will have a lot of people begin to look at the Xbox 360, especially for holiday purchases," said Van Baker, an analyst with market research firm Gartner, citing the strong reviews for "Halo 3," which starts at $60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it had 1.7 million advance orders for the game in the United States, but it won't release actual sales figures for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank said checks carried out ahead of the game's launch indicated stronger-than-expected demand that could mean revenue from "Halo 3" this fiscal year may be as much as $430 million, nearly 80 percent higher than previous estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe demand for 'Halo 3' could drive EDD to profitability," analyst Todd Raker wrote in a note, referring to Microsoft's Entertainment and Devices Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox 360 leads the current-generation console market, with nearly 12 million units shipped globally by the end of June, compared with more than 9 million for the Wii and over 4 million for Sony Corp's (6758.T) PlayStation 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Wii, which launched a year after the Xbox 360, has outsold rivals every month this year and may soon overtake the Xbox 360 in terms of total worldwide sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does the Wii offer the lowest price -- $250 versus $280 for the cheapest Xbox and $500 for the cheapest PS3 -- it also features an innovative motion-sensing controller that lets players act like they are really swinging a sword or rolling a bowling ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An emphasis on simple games that get players off the couch has made the Wii attractive to older people and women, customers outside the base of young males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIVING ROOM HOPES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft knows it must attract casual customers as well if the Xbox 360 is going to be a living-room fixture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's the biggest challenge Microsoft has. They were never able to do that with the original Xbox and they will be hard-pressed to do it with the 360," said Todd Greenwald, an analyst with Nollenberger Capital Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has praised Nintendo for "expanding the market", but so far its attempts to attract a broader audience have met with mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's "Viva Pinata," a kid-oriented game in which players tend to a virtual garden inhabited by colorful pinata animals, saw only lackluster sales despite critical praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft is nothing if not persistent, and a second "Viva Pinata" game is in the works for this holiday featuring a collection of simple "party games" meant to be played by several people at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the problem is image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The huge buzz around games like "Halo 3" obscures the fact that Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade has about 100 games available for download. These range from arcade classics like "Pac-Man" to popular card games like "Texas Hold'em".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They need to take their lowest-priced model and push it with a combination of games they have with Xbox Live. It's not games coming out of Activision (ATVI.O) or EA ERTS.O, it's the $5 to $10 games on Live," Greenwald said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker said he expected Microsoft to ramp up marketing aimed at casual gamers in another month or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've got a pretty good offering for casual gamers with Xbox Live Arcade, but the problem they have is they are not perceived as a casual gamer platform," Baker said. "They have to do some messaging and marketing to that consumer to let them know the Xbox 360 is viable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Click here to see Reuters MediaFile blog)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Iraq has sold a total of 2.5
million barrels of Kirkuk crude to U.S. major Exxon Mobil
(XOM.N) and Turkish refiner Tupras (TUPRS.IS) in a tender, an
Iraq oil ministry source said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iraq will issue a new tender to sell up to 5 million barrels
more of Kirkuk oil "very shortly", the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source declined to say how many of the 2.5 million
barrels would go to Exxon and how many would go to Tupras. The
oil is to be loaded at the Turkish terminal of Ceyhan before
Oct. 5, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Storage tanks in Ceyhan receive sporadic deliveries of
Kirkuk crude by pipeline from Iraq's northern oilfields. Iraq
has pumped around 7.5 million barrels through the line in the
past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A vessel at Ceyhan was on Wednesday loading the last of
around 4.6-4.7 million barrels of Kirkuk crude awarded in a
previous sale earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The next Kirkuk tender will be the third Iraq has issued in
a month and the fifth this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sabotage attacks have kept pumping along the route mostly
idle since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003. The
pipeline is Iraq's secondary export route, and when it is down
the country relies on its main export terminal in the south at
Basra to ship around 1.5 million barrels per day.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court said on Tuesday that it would decide a case initially filed by people who said they were harmed by the withdrawn diabetes drug Rezulin, a dispute that hinges on whether state or federal law take precedence when the two clash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) unit Warner-Lambert, the maker of Rezulin, appealed to the high court after a federal appeals court in New York reinstated the lawsuit in October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The lawsuit, filed by Michigan residents who said their injuries were caused by Rezulin, had been dismissed by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He ruled that state law shielded pharmaceutical companies from liability claims unless there is evidence the company misrepresented or withheld material information in obtaining approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rezulin was pulled from the market in March 2000 at the request of the FDA after about 100 people who took the medicine needed liver transplants or died from acute liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The New York appeals court had reinstated the lawsuit because, it argued, a lower court judge had wrongly concluded that federal law preempted  claims made under a Michigan state product liability statute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer, which acquired Warner-Lambert some three months after Rezulin was withdrawn, fought thousands of lawsuits claiming that Warner-Lambert failed to inform the public of the drug's liver toxicity risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The justices will hear arguments in the case earlier next year, with a decision likely by the end of June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Diane Bartz and Jim Vicini) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Lisa Von Ahn; diane.bartz@Reuters.com, 202-898-8313)) Keywords: WARNERLAMBERT PUBLIC/LAWSUIT &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Thursday it plans to keep selling its Windows XP operating system until the end of June 2008, delaying a scheduled transition to its newer Windows Vista software by five months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker introduced Windows Vista in January with the plan to phase out sales of its predecessor, Windows XP, by January 30, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it decided to extend XP sales in response to feedback from computer manufacturers who said there were customers who still wanted to buy the older operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some customers have voiced displeasure with Vista due to a lack of compatibility with existing software programs and devices. The hardware requirements needed to run Vista also are a significant upgrade from many older computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company downplayed any dissatisfaction with Vista, saying it is the fastest-selling operating system in the history of Microsoft. As of the end of June, Microsoft had sold more than 60 million Windows Vista licenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the top 50 consumer software applications now have a Vista-compatible version and it provides support for more than 2.2 million devices. The Windows operating system sits on about 95 percent of the world's computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company also said Microsoft historically makes its older operating system available to customers for two years after the new one is introduced, but it decided to shorten that period to one year with Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were a little ambitious to think that we would need to make Windows XP available for only a year after the release of Windows Vista," said Mike Nash, a Microsoft corporate vice president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has forecast that XP will account for about 22 percent of Windows sales in the current year to June with Vista comprising the remainder. The company said it plans to update this forecast when it announces quarterly results in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said it plans to extend sales of the most basic Windows XP Starter Edition for very low cost computers in emerging markets until June 30, 2010. It had also planned to stop sales of that system in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said on Thursday it would stop operating its U.S.-based mobile phone service at the end of the year to reassess how it competes in a tough market for high-end cell phone services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney said it would serve and support current customers of the service, with Family Center features that allow parents to display the location of a child's phone on a map and monitor its use, until December 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Internet Group President Steve Wadsworth said in a statement the company found the business to be "a difficult proposition in the hyper-competitive U.S. mobile phone market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman said 120 Internet Group employees would be affected by the shutdown. The number of layoffs was not yet known because the company was trying to find jobs for the affected workers within Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesman would not comment on the closure's financial impact or on the total number of subscribers to the service, which was offered on network space rented from Sprint Nextel Corp (S.N) on specially designed handsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney took a $30 million charge last year when it shut down Mobile ESPN, which had also been run by Disney on space rented on Sprint's network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's offerings were among a slew of upstart services renting space on established providers networks to target niche markets such as families with young children or young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While one youth-focused service, Amp'd Mobile, went bankrupt during the summer, another, Virgin Mobile USA, which has been around since July 2002, is expected to make its stock market debut in a matter of weeks. Virgin, a venture of Sprint and Richard Branson's Virgin VA.UL, also uses Sprint's network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's TV sports channel ESPN this year struck a license deal for Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L), to carry ESPN's mobile application which delivers sports data to phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney said it would offer rebates to eligible customers for the handset, content and accessories purchased directly from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMH Capital analyst David Miller said the closure "is not something that affects the stock price."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's almost kind of immaterial. It was not something that made or lost money for them but probably something heading in a direction that the margins were not acceptable for Disney," Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney closed off about 1 percent, or 31 cents, at $34.21 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sinead Carew in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - European and U.S. antitrust regulators tried to calm a transatlantic storm on Thursday over a European Court ruling that Microsoft used monopoly power to muscle rivals, but did not back down over policy differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European and U.S. officials were careful at the high- profile Fordham antitrust conference to avoid antagonizing each other after a sharp exchange last week between U.S. Department of Justice antitrust chief Thomas Barnett and European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the European Union's Court of First Instance in Luxembourg upheld a landmark 2004 European Commission decision and a 497 million euro fine against Microsoft Corp for illegal business practices that violated antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the conference on Thursday, U.S. Federal Trade Commission Chairman Deborah Majoras said a European Court had explicitly rejected the U.S. approach, and Brussels and Washington now needed to find better ways to co-operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Majoras had a hand in fashioning the U.S. remedies against Microsoft in 2001 after the company was found to have violated U.S. antitrust law. The U.S. remedies requiring limited licensing of some Microsoft connection information -- far less than the Europeans -- won approval from U.S. courts. But some states have criticized the U.S. sanctions as ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Majoras said Europeans and Americans need to aim for "co-operation and enhanced discussion" about their antitrust treatment of individual company behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her carefully calibrated remarks contrasted with those of Barnett, her counterpart at the Justice Department. Hours after the Microsoft ruling, he issued a news release accusing the European court of "chilling innovation and discouraging competition" with its 248-page decision. That brought a stinging rebuke from European Competition Chief Neelie Kroes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rebuke was echoed in milder terms after Majoras spoke on Thursday, when British Office of Fair Trading Chief Executive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Fingleton said: "The other point that's important to recognize in this is respect for different jurisdictions' autonomy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fingleton called convergence a "two-way process" and suggested that U.S. courts had emasculated U.S. agency power by throwing out a Justice Department case against American Airlines that accused the carrier of lowering prices to drive a low-priced airline out of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It really is going to be quite difficult ever to find true predatory pricing liability in the United States with the case law that's there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, the No. 2 official of the European Commission's competition department spoke up from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On this question of convergence ... We have to make efforts here," said Philip Lowe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he strongly defended the care his agency used in gathering facts against Microsoft and questioned how long an agency should wait to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're talking about a long lasting position of dominance," he said. "Is 10 years too short or too long? Is 15 years too short or too long?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroes, speaking later, also urged cooperation between U.S. and European regulators, as well as respect for differences between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have looked with interest at the way you have tackled ... issues over here and have drawn some useful lessons from your experiences," she said. "In this as in so many other areas, there is a very broad degree of consensus across the Atlantic about the problems to be addressed, even if the solutions we design are not always exactly identical in every detail, reflecting our different geopolitical environment, legal tradition and culture."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds government comment. In U.S. dollars)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jeffrey Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) and Murphy Oil Corp (MUR.N) plan to sue Canada for at
least $50 million, claiming they have been forced into spending
more on research in Newfoundland in contravention of previous
agreements for offshore oil projects, court documents say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. oil companies, partners in the Hibernia and Terra
Nova oil developments off Newfoundland, plan to sue under the
terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to
documents that they filed last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies claim the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador
Offshore Petroleum Board, the regulator of offshore projects,
imposed guidelines in 2004 requiring investors spend millions
of dollars on research and development in the Atlantic
province. If the money is not spent, it must be paid into a
fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That contravenes a Canadian commitment when NAFTA was
enacted in 1994 in which it agreed not to impose any new local
spending requirements on companies developing offshore energy
projects, according to the notice of claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The claims have not been proven in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is an avenue open to the company, and the company is
using it to seek the financial protection that NAFTA provides,"
Margot Bruce-O'Connell, an Exxon Mobil spokeswoman in St.
John's, Newfoundland, said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murphy officials were not immediately available for comment
on what is the latest tussle over Newfoundland's desire to get
a bigger chunk of the rewards of oil development off its
coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil of Irving, Texas, is seeking damages "in excess
of $40 million" and El Dorado, Arkansas-based Murphy is seeking
more than $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Canadian government declined to discuss the specifics
of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government of Canada is currently assessing the claim
and is consulting with the province of Newfoundland and
Labrador and the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore
Petroleum Board," said Valerie Noftle, a spokeswoman for
International Trade Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The claims follow a Newfoundland and Labrador Supreme Court
Case in 2005, in which the Hibernia and Terra Nova operators
argued the board did not have the authority to impose the
research spending guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The court ruled the board in fact had the power. An appeal
is pending, according to the claims under NAFTA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil has a 33 percent stake in the 200,000 barrel a
day Hibernia project and a 22 percent interest in Terra Nova,
which produces about 150,000 barrels a day. Murphy has 6.5
percent of Hibernia and 12 percent of Terra Nova.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Newfoundland, and its outspoken premier, Danny Williams,
have also recently come under fire from some quarters of the
oil industry for demanding a share of new offshore projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The province said early this month it plans to take 10
percent interests in future oil and gas projects as part of a
new energy strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The initiative followed an agreement this summer with
Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and its partners to take a 4.9 percent
stake in the proposed Hebron development.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A California appeals court on 
Tuesday declined to reinstate a long-running case against the 
Walt Disney Co over royalties it paid for its popular Winnie 
the Pooh character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In 2004, a Los Angeles trial court dismissed the case 
brought by the estate of Stephen Slesinger, the literary agent 
who helped popularize Winnie the Pooh in the United States, on 
the grounds that the Slesingers' legal team illegally obtained 
documents by trespassing on Disney property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slesinger's widow and daughter sued Disney in 1991, 
claiming the media company had underreported Pooh sales and 
owed the estate billions of dollars in royalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has conceded in securities filings that the case 
exposed the company to huge potential losses if the Slesingers 
prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Slesinger's daughter, Pati, said she will 
appeal the latest decision to the state Supreme Court, and will 
proceed with a federal lawsuit seeking $2 billion in damages 
and to strip Disney of its rights to the Pooh character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney attorney Daniel Petrocelli said the state case 
"never had merit from the outset and the only way it was kept 
alive so long was by breaking the rules."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This misconduct was breathtaking and there was really no 
choice but to throw out the case," Petrocelli said in an 
interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of Pooh merchandise generated more than $6 billion in 
retail sales in 2005, for which Disney realizes a licensing 
fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slesinger, a New York television and film producer, 
obtained exclusive merchandising and other rights to the Pooh 
works from author A.A. Milne in 1930.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slesinger and Milne's widow passed those rights to Disney 
in 1961 in exchange for royalties from the sale of Pooh 
products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters&lt;/p&gt;

may be interested in buying Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) assets in
Argentina, a senior official at Venezuela's state oil company,
PDVSA, said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, the Argentine Clarin newspaper reported Exxon
wanted to sell its assets in the country, where it is a key
player in the fuel market, for an estimated $200 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked at a natural gas conference if Venezuela was
considering buying the assets, Luis Vierma, a PDVSA vice

Argentine business is part of a wider plan to sell its assets
in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon left Venezuela earlier this year during a
nationalization drive by President Hugo Chavez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest oil company has taken the OPEC nation

of a multi-billion dollar project that it operated to upgrade
heavy crude in the Orinoco oil reserve.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment, details, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Peter Henderson &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LOS ANGELES, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) "Halo 3" video game set an opening-day U.S. sales record of $170 million, outdoing any video game or movie debut and giving the company's money-losing entertainment unit a strong boost toward profitability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Alien-shooting fans also surged onto Microsoft's Xbox Live online service.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Seeking to narrow the gap with Google, Microsoft Corp unveiled a retooled Web search service that aims to deliver more relevant results and combines text, video and other information onto a single page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, said Windows Live search is now on an even technology footing with offerings from rival search engines after years of playing catch-up since it started developing its own Web search in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its new presentation is in line with an industry trend to step beyond traditional text links, with unified search results that offer Web sites, news, pictures and video on one page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivals Google Inc and Ask.com made similar changes this year, and Yahoo Inc is moving in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is realistic. It doesn't think it's going to wake up tomorrow and overtake Google," said Allen Weiner, an analyst at research firm Gartner. "Right now, Microsoft wants to establish itself more firmly with its existing users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft ceded a head start to Google in Web search and then watched it create a multibillion-dollar business on the back of selling advertisements tied to search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is now one of its main rivals, using its Web ad money to invest in threats to Microsoft's core desktop software business by offering Web-delivered software as a "service."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last quarter, Google earned net income of $925 million, almost entirely from ads. That lagged Microsoft's $3 billion overall profit, but Microsoft online services business posted a loss and the unit's revenue grew at a third of Google's pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft ranks a distant third in Web search, with just 11.3 percent of the U.S. search market in August versus 56.5 percent for Google and 23.3 percent for Yahoo, according to research firm ComScore. Yet analysts note Microsoft is one of the few companies with the wherewithal to close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's very, very challenging but Microsoft is one of the few companies that is in a position to take a really long-term view of this whole game," said Greg Sterling, founding principal of research firm Sterling Market Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIRST STEP: CREDIBILITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satya Nadella, Microsoft's corporate vice president in the search and advertising platform group, said its first challenge was to get current users to do more searches on Windows Live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first step was to have a credible product," said Nadella, who joined the search team six months ago. "Google has been ahead of us and we believe with this release we've caught up and we can compete effectively in terms of search quality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it broadened the coverage, quadrupling the size of its searchable index over the last year. It has also worked to improve the core algorithm behind its search engine and better decipher the intent of a query.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company also focused on improving four specific areas of search: entertainment, health, shopping and local. Those four segments account for about 40 percent of all searches, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a search for "Justin Timberlake" yields news, videos, images and even the "buzz" ranking of the singer versus other celebrities. For shoppers, Windows Live will aggregate reviews, prices and other information about a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is just the latest company to expand search from a series of text links to a more multimedia offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask.com, the search arm of IAC/InterActiveCorp, started a search service this year, Ask3D, that divides results into panels for links, images, video and other information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google released "Universal Search" to draw results from separate properties covering local information, images, news, video and books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in San Francisco)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian soft drinks maker Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd (CCL.AX) said on Thursday the Coca-Cola Company (KO.N) plans to sell a stake of about 2.4 percent in Amatil to buy a stake in Amatil's former South Korean business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - European and U.S. antitrust regulators 
tried to calm a transatlantic storm on Thursday over a European 
Court ruling that Microsoft used monopoly power to muscle 
rivals, but did not back down over policy differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; European and U.S. officials were careful at the high- 
profile Fordham antitrust conference to avoid antagonizing each 
other after a sharp exchange last week between U.S. Department 
of Justice antitrust chief Thomas Barnett and European 
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, the European Union's Court of First Instance in 
Luxembourg upheld a landmark 2004 European Commission decision 
and a 497 million euro fine against Microsoft Corp for illegal 
business practices that violated antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the conference on Thursday, U.S. Federal Trade 
Commission Chairman Deborah Majoras said a European Court had 
explicitly rejected the U.S. approach, and Brussels and 
Washington now needed to find better ways to co-operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Majoras had a hand in fashioning the U.S. remedies against 
Microsoft in 2001 after the company was found to have violated 
U.S. antitrust law. The U.S. remedies requiring limited 
licensing of some Microsoft connection information -- far less 
than the Europeans -- won approval from U.S. courts. But some 
states have criticized the U.S. sanctions as ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Majoras said Europeans and Americans need to aim for 
"co-operation and enhanced discussion" about their antitrust 
treatment of individual company behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her carefully calibrated remarks contrasted with those of 
Barnett, her counterpart at the Justice Department. Hours after 
the Microsoft ruling, he issued a news release accusing the 
European court of "chilling innovation and discouraging 
competition" with its 248-page decision. That brought a 
stinging rebuke from European Competition Chief Neelie Kroes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rebuke was echoed in milder terms after Majoras spoke 
on Thursday, when British Office of Fair Trading Chief 
Executive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Fingleton said: "The other point that's important to 
recognize in this is respect for different jurisdictions' 
autonomy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fingleton called convergence a "two-way process" and 
suggested that U.S. courts had emasculated U.S. agency power by 
throwing out a Justice Department case against American 
Airlines that accused the carrier of lowering prices to drive a 
low-priced airline out of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It really is going to be quite difficult ever to find true 
predatory pricing liability in the United States with the case 
law that's there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At one point, the No. 2 official of the European 
Commission's competition department spoke up from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On this question of convergence ... We have to make 
efforts here," said Philip Lowe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he strongly defended the care his agency used in 
gathering facts against Microsoft and questioned how long an 
agency should wait to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're talking about a long lasting position of dominance," 
he said. "Is 10 years too short or too long? Is 15 years too 
short or too long?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kroes, speaking later, also urged cooperation between U.S. 
and European regulators, as well as respect for differences 
between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have looked with interest at the way you have tackled 
... issues over here and have drawn some useful lessons from 
your experiences," she said. "In this as in so many other 
areas, there is a very broad degree of consensus across the 
Atlantic about the problems to be addressed, even if the 
solutions we design are not always exactly identical in every 
detail, reflecting our different geopolitical environment, 
legal tradition and culture."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Recent volatility and
slumping returns in the hedge fund industry have not dampened
the appetite for new funds founded by former investment bankers
from firms such as JPMorgan Chase to Merrill Lynch  Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The new funds are evidence that investors continue to flock
to the fast-growing, $1.8 trillion hedge fund industry, which
promises investment returns in up markets or down, but does not
always deliver. Hedge funds in aggregate lost 1.3 percent in
August, according to Hedge Fund Research, an industry tracker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the highest profile is Robson Ventures LLC, a firm
founded by Phil Duff, the former Morgan Stanley (MS.N) senior
executive who co-founded multi-strategy hedge fund group
FrontPoint Partners but left after his alma mater bought the
firm late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robson is set to unveil a hedge fund and private equity
strategy in October with "substantially more" than $300 million
to finance acquisitions, fund company growth and make other
investments, according to sources. Robson describes itself as
"the next generation investment management company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Duff declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And slated for a launch early next week is Pent Water
Capital, a Chicago-based multi-strategy hedge fund that is
expected to lure around $1 billion in investments, sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pent Water was founded by Matthew Halbower, who managed
"event-driven" investment strategies until last December at
Deephaven Capital, the investment unit of Knight Capital Group
NITE.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EX-MERRILL GLOBAL MARKETS HEAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Halbower, who has signed up Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and
UBS as prime brokers, could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another fund set to roll out in coming months is a
distressed debt hedge fund co-founded by Jonathan Katz, a
partner in JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) Special Situations
Investing fund, which trades distressed bank and high-yield
debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katz, who leaves the bank today, expects a wave of
opportunities in coming months to buy attractive bank and bond
debt that was written in recent years when credit markets were
more robust, both for company refinancings and leveraged
buyouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In a down market environment, we would expect a third to a
half of this highly leveraged paper will have to be
restructured," said Katz in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katz declined to say what he is naming the fund or how much
he plans to raise. A source familiar with the firm said it
would likely be around $250 million and launch early next year.
JPMorgan declined to comment
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also early next year, Dow Kim, former president of Merrill
Lynch  Co Inc's MER.N global markets and investment banking
group, is expected to launch his new global multi-strategy fund
called Diamond Lake Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kim announced in May he would leave the bank to set up a
new multi-strategy fund, which sources said will aim to raise
between $1.5 billion to $3 billion and invest in a variety of
long-short equity and credit strategies. He is now a senior
executive advisor to Merrill, which has said it plans to be an
initial client of Kim's new firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department's top antitrust official called the remedy in Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) U.S. antitrust case "well-crafted" and "successful," and urged U.S. and European Union officials on Friday to be cautious in fighting abusive monopoly behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remedy -- most of which expires in November -- has been challenged by California and some other states, which argue that Microsoft continues to abuse its dominant position in the market for computer operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Barnett, the Justice Department's assistant attorney general for antitrust, defended the 2002 consent decree mandating 5-year oversight of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(The) remedy was well-crafted and has been successful," said Barnett in an appearance at an international antitrust conference at Fordham Law School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The states want portions of the decree to be extended to 2012, arguing that Microsoft has failed to live up to the agreement. Some portions have already been extended to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnett also warned about choosing overly draconian remedies for monopolistic conduct, quoting Hippocrates' admonition to doctors to, above all, do no harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consider that markets change in ways that could not be predicted. Many formerly big powerful firms are struggling," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe's second-highest court affirmed last week a 2004 European Commission ruling that Microsoft abused its overwhelming market position to crush competitors. The court also upheld a 497 million-euro ($708 million) fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnett criticized the European court's ruling hours after it came down. He issued a news release accusing the European court of "chilling innovation and discouraging competition" with its 248-page decision. European Competition Chief Neelie Kroes shot back by saying it was unacceptable for the U.S. administration to criticize an independent court outside its jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transatlantic disagreement over the ruling formed a backdrop to this week's conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Lowe, the European Commission's director general for competition, playfully rejected a suggestion that it was time for a victory lap, telling the conference that oversight of Microsoft was an "ultramarathon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, Microsoft was required to create a Microsoft Communications Protocol Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is designed to give other software companies access to protocols that allow servers running non-Microsoft software to operate with the Windows desktop operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state attorneys general argue that this has not happened. This portion of the agreement is to expire in 2009, and the Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has said it is premature to extend it further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Microsoft agreed to modify its Windows Vista operating system in response to a complaint that its computer search function put Google Inc (GOOG.O) and other potential rivals at a disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARIS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs has
slashed its forecasts for economic growth in the United States,
Japan and Europe, joining numerous forecasters who are abruptly
changing view since the start of a global credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In a note released this week, Goldman Sachs has cut its U.S.
growth forecast for next year to 1.8 percent from 2.6 and for
this year to 2.0 from 2.1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Japan, it is calling 2008 growth of 2.1 percent versus a
previous call of 2.5, and it says it now expects 2.0 percent GDP
growth this year rather than 2.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It now expects euro zone growth of 2.0 percent next year,
not 2.4 percent, and is forecasting 2.6 percent for this year
instead of 2.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Much has changed since mid-July, when we wrote that 'the
global economy continues to enjoy one of the strongest sustained
expansions in modern history'," chief economist Jim O'Neill said
in a preamble to a note on the revisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The mood in financial markets is clearly darker, and the
economic data in the developed world are showing signs of wear.
The key question, which will take time to answer, is the extent
to which the credit crunch will affect the real economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank is less gloomy about emerging market economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It maintained its 7.7 percent forecast for aggregate growth
in the emerging market world next year and raised it for this
year to 8.4 from 8.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For advanced economies as a whole its forecast for 2008 is
cut to 2.2 from 2.8 percent and for this year to 2.6 from 2.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the world as a whole, it is predicting 4.2 percent now
instead of 4.6 percent previously and for this year it is
sticking to a rise of 4.7 percent in gross domestic product.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)

 Sept 28 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities downgraded Spanish
broadcaster Sogecable SA SGC.MC to "neutral" from
"underweight," saying the pay-TV group was being threatened by
new media and telecom entrants, with potentially less security
over key football programming.

 Pan-European free-to-air (FTA) TV broadcasters represent
superior investment opportunities versus single-market-focused
broadcasters due to lower revenue volatility and exposure to
fast-growing emerging markets, among other factors.

 The brokerage initiated coverage of Sweden's Modern Times
Group (MTG) (MTGb.ST) with an "overweight" rating and a price
target of 484 Swedish crowns and resumed coverage of German
broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media PSMG_p.DE with an
"overweight" rating, compared with an earlier "neutral" rating.

 MTG offers investors a unique opportunity to grow in the
European emerging markets, JP Morgan said in a note to clients.

 On ProSiebenSat.1, it said the company has one of the best
strategies in Europe and that it will continue to play an
active role in the consolidation of European FTA TV.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said on Thursday it 
would stop operating its U.S.-based mobile phone service at the 
end of the year to reassess how it competes in a tough market 
for high-end cell phone services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney said it would serve and support current customers of 
the service, with Family Center features that allow parents to 
display the location of a child's phone on a map and monitor 
its use, until December 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Internet Group President Steve Wadsworth said in a 
statement the company found the business to be "a difficult 
proposition in the hyper-competitive U.S. mobile phone market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman said 120 Internet Group employees would be 
affected by the shutdown. The number of layoffs was not yet 
known because the company was trying to find jobs for the 
affected workers within Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The spokesman would not comment on the closure's financial 
impact or on the total number of subscribers to the service, 
which was offered on network space rented from Sprint Nextel 
Corp on specially designed handsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney took a $30 million charge last year when it shut 
down Mobile ESPN, which had also been run by Disney on space 
rented on Sprint's network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's offerings were among a slew of upstart services 
renting space on established providers networks to target niche 
markets such as families with young children or young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While one youth-focused service, Amp'd Mobile, went 
bankrupt during the summer, another, Virgin Mobile USA, which 
has been around since July 2002, is expected to make its stock 
market debut in a matter of weeks. Virgin, a venture of Sprint 
and Richard Branson's Virgin, also uses Sprint's network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's TV sports channel ESPN this year struck a license 
deal for Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications 
Inc and Vodafone Group Plc, to carry ESPN's mobile application 
which delivers sports data to phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney said it would offer rebates to eligible customers 
for the handset, content and accessories purchased directly 
from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SMH Capital analyst David Miller said the closure "is not 
something that affects the stock price."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's almost kind of immaterial. It was not something that 
made or lost money for them but probably something heading in a 
direction that the margins were not acceptable for Disney," 
Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Disney closed off about 1 percent, or 31 cents, 
at $34.21 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Sinead Carew in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - European and U.S. antitrust regulators 
tried to calm a transatlantic storm on Thursday over a European 
Court ruling that Microsoft used monopoly power to muscle 
rivals, but did not back down over policy differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; European and U.S. officials were careful at the high- 
profile Fordham antitrust conference to avoid antagonizing each 
other after a sharp exchange last week between U.S. Department 
of Justice antitrust chief Thomas Barnett and European 
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, the European Union's Court of First Instance in 
Luxembourg upheld a landmark 2004 European Commission decision 
and a 497 million euro fine against Microsoft Corp for illegal 
business practices that violated antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the conference on Thursday, U.S. Federal Trade 
Commission Chairman Deborah Majoras said a European Court had 
explicitly rejected the U.S. approach, and Brussels and 
Washington now needed to find better ways to co-operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Majoras had a hand in fashioning the U.S. remedies against 
Microsoft in 2001 after the company was found to have violated 
U.S. antitrust law. The U.S. remedies requiring limited 
licensing of some Microsoft connection information -- far less 
than the Europeans -- won approval from U.S. courts. But some 
states have criticized the U.S. sanctions as ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Majoras said Europeans and Americans need to aim for 
"co-operation and enhanced discussion" about their antitrust 
treatment of individual company behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her carefully calibrated remarks contrasted with those of 
Barnett, her counterpart at the Justice Department. Hours after 
the Microsoft ruling, he issued a news release accusing the 
European court of "chilling innovation and discouraging 
competition" with its 248-page decision. That brought a 
stinging rebuke from European Competition Chief Neelie Kroes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rebuke was echoed in milder terms after Majoras spoke 
on Thursday, when British Office of Fair Trading Chief 
Executive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Fingleton said: "The other point that's important to 
recognize in this is respect for different jurisdictions' 
autonomy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fingleton called convergence a "two-way process" and 
suggested that U.S. courts had emasculated U.S. agency power by 
throwing out a Justice Department case against American 
Airlines that accused the carrier of lowering prices to drive a 
low-priced airline out of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It really is going to be quite difficult ever to find true 
predatory pricing liability in the United States with the case 
law that's there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At one point, the No. 2 official of the European 
Commission's competition department spoke up from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On this question of convergence ... We have to make 
efforts here," said Philip Lowe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he strongly defended the care his agency used in 
gathering facts against Microsoft and questioned how long an 
agency should wait to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're talking about a long lasting position of dominance," 
he said. "Is 10 years too short or too long? Is 15 years too 
short or too long?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kroes, speaking later, also urged cooperation between U.S. 
and European regulators, as well as respect for differences 
between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have looked with interest at the way you have tackled 
... issues over here and have drawn some useful lessons from 
your experiences," she said. "In this as in so many other 
areas, there is a very broad degree of consensus across the 
Atlantic about the problems to be addressed, even if the 
solutions we design are not always exactly identical in every 
detail, reflecting our different geopolitical environment, 
legal tradition and culture."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KANO, Nigeria (Reuters) - A court case brought by Nigeria against Pfizer resumes on Wednesday with the U.S. drug maker saying it answered a call for help to save the lives of African children during a meningitis epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria alleges Pfizer deceived patients and caused the death of 11 children in 1996 when it performed clinical trials for a new drug. With the northern state of Kano, it is suing the company for $8.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meningitis outbreak killed more than 12,000 children in six months near Kano, a predominantly Muslim metropolis with a history of conflict with the West. Meningitis is an infection of the nervous system that can kill in hours if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ngozi Edozien, managing director of Pfizer in West Africa, said the company brought the experimental drug, Trovan, to Nigeria in response to an international plea for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a compelling reason to look at Trovan because it was an oral formulation, it was known to have shown efficacy in meningitis and was a five-day treatment so it was perfect for an epidemic setting," she told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test involved 200 children, half of whom received Trovan while the other half received a proven meningitis treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria alleges Pfizer was responsible for the deaths of 11 children and permanent health problems for many others. It says it failed to obtain all the required approvals for the test and did not get proper consent from the patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rejects all the charges. It says Trovan saved lives and the alleged victims were affected by meningitis, not the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was first brought in the United States, but thrown out in 2005 by a judge who said it should be heard in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Pfizer will be in two courts for civil and criminal proceedings brought by the Kano state government.

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects day of trial from Tuesday to Wednesday) By Mike Oboh KANO, Nigeria, Sept 30 (Reuters) - A court case brought by Nigeria against Pfizer resumes on Wednesday with the U.S. drug maker saying it answered a call for help to save the lives of African children during a meningitis epidemic. Nigeria alleges Pfizer deceived patients and caused the death of 11 children in 1996 when it performed clinical trials for a new drug. With the northern state of Kano, it is suing the company for $8.5 billion. The meningitis outbreak killed more than 12,000 children in six months near Kano, a predominantly Muslim metropolis with a history of conflict with the West. Meningitis is an infection of the nervous system that can kill in hours if left untreated. Ngozi Edozien, managing director of Pfizer in West Africa, said the company brought the experimental drug, Trovan, to Nigeria in response to an international plea for help.  There was a compelling reason to look at Trovan because it was an oral formulation, it was known to have shown efficacy in meningitis and was a five-day treatment so it was perfect for an epidemic setting, she told Reuters. The test involved 200 children, half of whom received Trovan while the other half received a proven meningitis treatment.  Nigeria alleges Pfizer was responsible for the deaths of 11 children and permanent health problems for many others. It says it failed to obtain all the required approvals for the test and did not get proper consent from the patients. Pfizer rejects all the charges. It says Trovan saved lives and the alleged victims were affected by meningitis, not the drug. The case was first brought in the United States, but thrown out in 2005 by a judge who said it should be heard in Nigeria. On Wednesday, Pfizer will be in two courts for civil and criminal proceedings brought by the Kano state government. The federal government has also brought civil and criminal charges. TESTING Trovan had already been tested on 5,000 people before it was used in Nigeria, Edozien said. It was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use on adults a few months after the Kano trial, and briefly became one of Pfizer's top-selling drugs. However, the authorities imposed severe restrictions on its use three years later when it was found to cause serious liver injuries in some patients. Mustapha Maisekili, the father of two alleged victims in the Kano trial, said his two daughters were walking and talking when he took them to the Infectious Diseases Hospital suffering from flu-like symptoms typical of meningitis.  They died a few weeks later. Most of the victims lost hope of getting any form of justice on the issue, he said. If we are compensated through the court judgment we shall be relieved somehow. Most of us are living hand-to-mouth.  Pfizer faces a hostile reception in Kano, a focus of Islamic radicalism in Nigeria with a history of religious bloodshed and rejection of Western medicine. The state government banned vaccines against polio for nine months in 2003, alleging they contained HIV and were spreading infertility.
