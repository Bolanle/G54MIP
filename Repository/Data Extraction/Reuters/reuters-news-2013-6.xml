&lt;p&gt;In a rare personal interview to be broadcast later on Sunday, the 65-year-old, who was previously a professor at the London School of Economics, expressed sadness that his focus on work had damaged his private life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The career always came first.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - Dance lessons are one of Bank of
England Governor Mervyn King's few clear plans for his
retirement when he steps down later this month after 20 years at
the Bank of England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a rare personal interview to be broadcast later on
Sunday, the 65-year-old, who was previously a professor at the
London School of Economics, expressed sadness that his focus on
work had damaged his private life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The career always came first. That was probably a mistake,"
he said when asked if he regretted not having children and only
marrying in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King rarely speaks about his personal life, though his
passion for cricket and soccer team Aston Villa is well-known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However he opened up in an interview with BBC Radio 4's
Desert Island Discs, a British broadcasting institution in which
public figures discuss their lives and the eight pieces of music
they would wish to listen to if stranded on a desert island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King's top pick was "My Ship" from the 1941 musical Lady in
the Dark by composer Kurt Weill and lyricist Ira Gershwin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The song was played at his wedding to Barbara Melander, a
university sweetheart who he lost touch with when she returned
home to Finland, and then reconnected with later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever the economist, King partly blamed the heavily regulated
nature of the international telephony market in the 1970s for
him and Melander drifting apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of King's musical choices were classical - though he
also selected a song celebrating Aston Villa's 1982 European cup
success - and he commented how he felt like dancing whenever he
heard Beethoven's 7th Symphony in A major.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have promised my wife when I leave the Bank that I will
take dance lessons," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about his work, King confirmed the widespread
impression that he takes a rigorous, academic approach to
central banking and has little sympathy with commercial bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My office tries very hard to protect me as much as possible
each morning to have as much of the morning free as I can to sit
and read and think and reflect," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King rebuffed in familiar terms criticisms that the Bank of
England had failed to warn of the risk of a financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he expressed pleasure that fewer young people now wished
to become bankers. "I don't think they want to earn money if
it's being earned in a way that creates enormous damage to the
rest of society," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also showed a soft spot for Britain's politicians,
despite the fact that some - such as former Labour finance
minister Alistair Darling - have been less flattering about him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of the politicians I have had the good fortune to work
with are far more impressive people than the press would lead
you to believe," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Perhaps we would do better to give politicians space to let
them go away in private to think something through in depth, and
then come back and talk about it at length, rather than expect
... an immediate solution to every problem."

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The Washington journalism establishment, which allows federal officials to go off the record every minute on the minute, got a little picky this week after Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. invited reporters and editors over for an off-the-record meeting about the Department of Justice's handling of the investigations of national security leaks to Fox News Channel and the Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson sent her pithy regrets: "We will not be attending the session at DOJ. It isn't appropriate for us to attend an off-the-record meeting with the attorney general. Our Washington bureau is aggressively covering the department's handling of leak investigations at this time." The AP sent a similar snub, as did CNN, McClatchy Newspapers, the Huffington Post, CBS News, NBC News, Reuters and Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the government wants to justify its pursuit of journalists, they ought to do it in public," McClatchy's James Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What made the face-off so delicious was the way it pitted two self-righteous and pompous entities against each other. On the one side, you've got the government, which wanted to keep secret the thinking behind its devious, but legal, series of subpoenas and search warrants directed at journalists, while still blabbing about it. On the other, the press, which swoons for these sorts of sit-downs as long as the meeting isn't public knowledge, because such revelations makes them look like suck-ups and collaborators, which they can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had Holder stealthily invited a couple of bureau chiefs and editors over to his place for afternoon cookies and milk to ask for their help in getting out of his PR pickle, of appearing anti-press, I'm sure most would have obliged him and maintained the requested omert&#224;. But that wasn't the attorney general's strategy. In order to relieve the anti-Holder political pressure the press has exerted in the past two weeks and the calls from several corners for his resignation, Holder needed to publicize the soiree. The purpose of the meeting was not to explain or apologize or promise to change Department of Justice policy. The purpose of the meeting was to have a meeting, and to begin a "dialogue" with the press over its "concerns" so the press would give Holder some breathing room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly who was using whom still needs to be sorted out. Was Holder exploiting the press by pretending to seek its counsel, or was the press boosting its own status by telling Holder to shove his off-the-record invitation? One Twitter user almost untangled the weave of hypocrisy with this succinct sentence: "Journos decline a secret talk w/ #DOJ about how DOJ can best respect &amp; protect journos' rights to secret talks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the press is too decentralized to congeal into an effective cartel, the Department of Justice found another way to make its hour-long Thursday afternoon get-together happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journalists from the Washington Post, Politico, the Wall Street Journal, New York's Daily News and the New Yorker agreed to attend, and Holder whispered into their ears his minor words of remorse. How do we know what Holder whispered if the meeting was off the record, which literally means the information can't be shared? Because the Department of Justice relented, allowing the press to "describe what occurred during the meeting in general terms," as the Washington Post&#8216;s coverage put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional meetings like yesterday's are planned for the near future, and given that they're no longer off the record you can expect more news organizations to attend. My employer, Reuters, citing the changed ground rules, sent representatives to a session today.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post&#8216;s news account of yesterday's meeting, which cites "participants" as its sources, finds Holder "acknowledging criticism" that his department had grown too aggressive. Acknowledging criticism is not the same as agreeing, of course, as all passive-aggressive adepts know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Post story continues to explain Holder's "broad commitment" to "update internal guidelines," as if antiquated guidelines were the problem and a new review the solution. But the existing guidelines are fine. Self-imposed and observed by both Democratic and Republican administrations, the current Department of Justice guidelines remind attorneys general to walk "en pointe" whenever contemplating the subpoena of information from journalists or the issuance of search warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fine-tuning the guidelines won't protect reporters and their sources as long as the attorney general still goes wild with subpoenas and search warrants in leak investigations, as Holder did in the Fox News case and his deputy, James Cole, did in the AP case. Politico reported that "Holder stopped short of offering any concrete changes to the guidelines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for a "shield law" to protect the press, to which Holder and President Barack Obama have lent so much lip service, allow me to direct you to an authority on that topic, journalist Matthew Cooper. Cooper, who fought all the way to the Supreme Court a subpoena to appear before a grand jury investigating the Valerie Plame case, writes this week in the National Journal that the shield law currently under consideration by Congress wouldn't have been much help to him, the AP or Fox News had it been on the books a decade ago. And he's right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you resist looking at the current spat in the freeze frame of current events, you might view Holder as sincerely troubled by the press corps' reaction, as a new Daily Beast piece does, and see his efforts as an attempt to reset the press-government relationship to the way it once was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the press has learned the value of showing the White House a little backbone. Perhaps Holder regrets nothing and is buying time with gestures so he can resign on his own terms after the noise stops. Or maybe we're all overinterpreting, and all that has transpired this week is the standard Washington power dance, with duplicity and fatuousness by all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd pick door No. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Jack Shafer is a Reuters columnist but his opinions are his own.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co raised single-day admission prices as much as 6.7 percent over the weekend at its theme parks in Florida and California, hikes that are more than five times the rate of inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher prices for Disney's theme parks have become an annual tradition. The theme parks and resorts unit provided 20 percent of the company's overall profits in the financial year that ended in September 2012, second only to the company's media unit that includes the behemoth sports channel ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Sunday, one-day entry to Disney's Magic Kingdom at the Walt Disney World resort in Orlando, Florida, costs $95 for a person age 10 or older, a 6.7 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single-day pass to one of two parks at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, rose 5.7 percent to $92. A park hopper ticket for entry to both California parks on the same day increased 9.6 percent to $137.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Price Index, which measures a sample of goods and services Americans pay for, increased at a 1.1 percent pace for the 12 months that ended in April. A narrower measure of the cost of sporting events rose 1.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney offers discount prices through multi-day tickets and other tailored offerings.

		&lt;p&gt;
			U.S. Subsidiary of Walton Westphalia Development Corporation Enters 
      into a Senior Credit Facility
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Westphalia Development Corporation (the "Corporation") 
      announced today that its U.S. subsidiary, Walton Westphalia Development 
      (USA), LLC ("WWDU") and its affiliate, Walton Westphalia 
      Europe, LP ("WWE"), (WWDU and WWE are collectively, the "Borrowers"), 
      have entered into a senior credit facility (the "Senior
			Loan") 
      with an arm's length institutional lender to finance initial 
      construction of the Westphalia property. WWDU and WWE are co-owners of 
      the Westphalia property.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Senior Loan is a secured loan for up to $40.95 million USD with an 
      interest rate of Libor +5.10% with a floor of 6.20% per annum. The 
      initial term of the Senior Loan will be for 36 months. The term of the 
      Senior Loan may be extended in certain circumstances. The Senior Loan is 
      secured by, among other things, a first priority deed of trust on the 
      Westphalia property.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Drawdown on the Senior Loan is subject to the Borrowers meeting certain 
      standard conditions prior to funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation is also in negotiations with an arm's length mezzanine 
      lender to obtain additional required construction financing of up to 
      $7.3 million USD.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As set out in the Corporation's press release dated May 27, 2013, 
      reporting the Corporation's Q1 2013 results, other highlights in 
      connection with the Westphalia property since January 1, 2013, include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        obtaining signed letters of intent with three builders to construct 
        homes on all of the lots in Phase 1;
      
			
        selecting a real estate company to represent the Corporation in the 
        sale of the multi-family apartment site in Phase 1; and
      
			
        continuing a review of the hotel site in Phase 1 with a potential 
        lodging group. In April, a formal offer was received from the group 
        and is under review.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The project remains on track financially and from a timing perspective. 
      As a result of securing the Senior Loan, management anticipates that 
      construction on the project will commence by the end of Q2 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched in March 2012, the Corporation was formed to provide investors 
      with the opportunity to participate in the acquisition and development 
      of the 310-acre Westphalia property located in Prince George's County,

      Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., which is the site of the White House, 
      the National Mall and the Capitol Building.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The Corporation is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P. and the 
      development of the property is managed by Walton Development

			Mellanox Delivers 50 Percent More Virtual Desktops in Virtual Desktop 
      Infrastructure (VDI) Running Microsoft Windows Server 2012 over Hyper-V
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mellanox RDMA-based interconnects and LSI&#174; 
      Nytro&#8482; MegaRAID&#174; 
      Application Acceleration Card-based VDI solution maximizes the number of 
      Virtual Desktops per server and boosts application performance to remote 
      storage at a lower cost
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft TechEd &#8211; Mellanox&#174; Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ: MLNX) 
      (TASE: MLNX), a leading supplier of high-performance, end-to-end 
      interconnect solutions for data center servers and storage systems, 
      today announced that its 10GbE with RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) 
      interconnect solutions achieved a new record of application performance 
      and efficiency for Virtual Desktop Infrastructures (VDI). Mellanox 
      internal benchmark results from the combined VDI solution of Mellanox 
      10GbE, LSI Nytro MegaRAID Application Acceleration Card, and Windows 
      Server 2012 over Hyper-V, delivered 105 virtual desktops with less than 
      5 seconds response time compared to 70 virtual desktops when running 
      over TCP/IP and reduced the application latency by 30 percent. The 
      impressive benchmark performance demonstrates how the joint solution 
      helps to overcome bottlenecks that limit the number of Virtual Desktops 
      running on a physical server that is simultaneously accessing storage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new performance results were enabled by Microsoft SMB Direct 
      protocol implemented in Windows Server 2012 running under Hyper-V and 
      connected to File Storage with an LSI Nytro MegaRAID Application 
      Acceleration card, all connected by Mellanox&#8217;s end-to-end 10GbE with 
      RoCE interconnect solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Storage can represent 40 to 60 percent of the cost of a VDI 
      installation,&#8221; said Tony Afshary, director of marketing, Accelerated 
      Solutions Division. &#8220;The PCIe flash LSI Nytro MegaRAID card with 
      Mellanox&#8217;s 10GbE RDMA adapter allows more VDI desktops to be supported 
      by combining low-latency server-side flash technology with intelligent 
      flash caching. Since only a fraction of VDI data needs flash 
      acceleration, the balance of the data is maintained on more economical, 
      capacity optimized hard drives. The joint solution is designed to enable 
      more virtual desktops per physical server while providing significant 
      cost benefits over traditional Fibre Channel-attached storage 
      subsystems.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SMB Direct takes advantage of Mellanox&#8217;s RDMA interconnect technology to 
      provide greater performance and reduced CPU overhead in VDI-based 
      enterprise data center applications. Mellanox&#8217;s RDMA-based technologies 
      include the company&#8217;s 10/40/56GbE and FDR 56Gb/s InfiniBand interconnect 
      products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;VDI has proven to be a very effective technology to increase data 
      center efficiency. Mellanox&#8217;s interconnect solution plays a key role in 
      solving the I/O bottlenecks that occur when accessing remote storage in 
      a highly virtualized data center,&#8221; said Kevin Deierling, vice president 
      of marketing at Mellanox Technologies. &#8220;Using SMB Direct over Mellanox&#8217;s 
      RDMA-enabled interconnects with LSI&#8217;s Nytro MegaRAID delivers higher 
      application performance and simplifies the VDI deployment and 
      maintenance, resulting in higher efficiency and better 
      return-on-investment.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., June 3, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aidikoff, Uhl  Bakhtiari announces the filing of a securities arbitration on behalf of a former J P Morgan Securities, LLC broker with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Philip M. Aidikoff, a partner at the firm, said that the firm's client "was recruited from another broker dealer but soon learned that J P Morgan had a policy to only recommend in house product to customers, irrespective of whether that product was the best choice for customers to meet their investment objectives."&#160;The claim alleges that when brokers recommended and sold outside product, brokers would have difficulty in collecting the commissions and fees due. &#160;The claim further alleges JP Morgan created a continuing conflict between the fiduciary responsibilities owed by the broker to clients in light of the firm's insistence on selling proprietary funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The claims are supported by other former JP Morgan brokers around the country who have reported similar practice and policies, all designed to increase the profitability of the firm at the expense of customers. Ryan K. Bakhtiari, a partner at Aidikoff, Uhl  Bakhtiari stated that, "brokers are obligated to always place the interests of their customer first, and pressure exerted by their employers to only sell in house product is inconsistent with obligations imposed by securities regulators."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Aidikoff, Uhl  Bakhtiari is a Beverly Hills, California based law firm that restricts its practice to disputes with the securities industry on behalf of customers and brokers.&#160;If you have information concerning JP Morgan's sale of proprietary mutual funds, please contact an attorney below.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: Philip M.

			Arista Networks Delivers Open Management Infrastructure API Support 
      for Microsoft
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Furthering Automation and Programmability for Today&#8217;s Data Center
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Arista today announced full support for Microsoft Open Management 
      Infrastructure (OMI) across all Arista platforms through Arista EOS 
      (extensible operating system) software version 4.12. This expands 
      Arista&#8217;s offerings in Software 
      Defined Networking (SDN) by continuing to provide the broadest set 
      of interfaces to management platforms for open programmability and 
      orchestration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s Cloud OS is built on Windows Server, System Center, and 
      Windows Azure and aligns with Microsoft&#8217;s commitment to openness, 
      supporting standards (DIM + WS-Man) using OMI,&#8221; said Chris Phillips, 
      Partner Director PM, Windows Server, Microsoft. &#8220;Arista&#8217;s manageable 
      switch&#8217;s support for Microsoft OMI gives customers flexibility and cost 
      effectiveness as they implement networking across public and private 
      cloud environments.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The growth of cloud-based computing is driving demand for more 
      automation, which requires a solid foundation built upon management 
      standards. Arista switches, widely deployed in Windows Azure data 
      centers, drove Arista&#8217;s implementation of OMI in close collaboration 
      with Microsoft, and enabling OMI standards-based management to satisfy

Completes Acquisition of Prime Alaska Properties Bordering ExxonMobil's Point Thomson Project in Alaska's North Slope Region&lt;POLR.OB&gt;</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska, June 3, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Polar Petroleum Corp. (OTCBB:POLR) (herein after "Polar Petroleum", "Polar" and/or "the Company") announces that on May 31, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of a 100% Working Interest (WI) in 12 offshore oil and gas leases (~19,662 acres) in Alaska's prolific North Slope region. The leases are collectively known as the North Point Thomson Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Polar Petroleum (AK) Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Polar Petroleum Corp., signed the lease purchase agreement. The agreement reserved an overriding royalty of 4% for the Sellers of the properties, and royalties for the State of Alaska of 12.5% for 7 of the leases and 16.67% for 5 of the leases (Polar has an NRI of 83.5% in 7 of the leases, and 79.33% in 5 of the leases).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Polar's newly acquired North Point Thomson Project properties are located in close proximity to significant oil and gas activities, both historic and ongoing, in Alaska's North Slope region:&lt;/p&gt;
			
		Bordering ExxonMobil's Point Thomson Unit to the north.
			
		60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay, North America's largest oil field and the largest producing field in America.
			
		8 miles northeast of the producing Badami Unit (60+ MMBO).
			
		9 miles southwest of Unocal/Shell's Hammerhead-Sivulliq discovery (100-200+ MMBO).
			
		12 miles west-southwest of the Kuvlum discovery (160-300 MMBO).
			
		8 miles northwest of the Stinson discovery (150+ MMBO).
			
		Sits along an east-west line of exploratory wells that have encountered carbonate-rich, Pre-Mississippian "basement" lithologies, starting 8 miles to the east: Stinson #1, Alaska State #A-1, Alaska State #F-1, Alaska Island #1, Challenge Island #1 (on the western end of the North Point Thomson Project), and extending westward towards the Liberty Unit area.[1]
		&lt;p&gt;
	According to Alaska's Department of Natural Resources, the main Thomson Sand Reservoir (i.e., the primary reservoir in ExxonMobil's Point Thomson Unit) probably continues northwesterly beneath the southwestern portion of the North Point Thomson Project area. The report's conclusion was based upon the 64 feet of sand in the Challenge Island #1 well, the 6 feet of sand in the Alaska Island #1 well, and available seismic data.[2] Additional targets for the North Point Thomson Project include the Pre-Mississippian of the 1990 ARCO Stinson oil discovery located just to the east. At the same time, most of the North Point Thomson Project area may have significant potential for oil production due to its position on the northern flank of a ridge-like structural feature. According to the US Geological Survey (Open File Report 98-34), this northern flank would have been oil-charged from the north as part of the Canning-Sagavanirktok Petroleum System, as were the Hammerhead (Sivulliq) and Kuvlum oil discoveries.[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Bordering Polar's North Point Thomson Project to the south is ExxonMobil's Point Thomson Unit (PTU). The PTU represents an estimated 295 million barrels of oil (MMBO) [1] and 8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas (TCFG), which represents about 25% of the recoverable natural gas on Alaska's North Slope.[3] Russia's Rosneft &#8211; the world's largest publicly traded oil company &#8211; entered an agreement in February 2013 with ExxonMobil, giving Rosneft the option to purchase a 25% interest in ExxonMobil's holdings in the Point Thomson field.[3] From December 2012 to May 2013, ExxonMobil commenced construction of a 22-mile pipeline to transport liquid natural gas condensates westward from their PTU wells to the Badami Unit, where the liquid fuel will be diverted into the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).[4]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Neighboring Polar's North Point Thomson Project 8 miles to the southwest is the producing Badami Unit. Badami has produced 5.9 MMBO and 30 billion cubic feet of gas (BCFG) to date, and as of May 2012 had production of 1,535 barrels of oil per day (BOPD).[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Two miles southwest of Polar's North Point Thomson Project is the location of the proposed Telemark Unit. The new Telemark Unit would lie between the Badami and Point Thomson units, and would develop the Tertiary "Flaxman Sands" encountered when Humble Oil (Exxon) drilled the onshore E. Mikkelsen Bay State #1 well in 1971. BP's Red Dog #1 Well, drilled in 1999, also lies within the proposed Telemark Unit area, and had 1,275' of oil and gas shows in Middle Brookian sands.[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Polar Petroleum Corp.'s President and CEO, Daniel Walker, commented: "By acquiring the North Point Thomson Project, we have established a presence in a third area marked by significant Alaska energy industry production, activity and development involving major industry players. Our next steps will include drawing on the insights of the surrounding historic exploration to plan an initial work program to assess the project's estimated resources and production potential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS, June 3, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TechEd 2013 &#8211; sTec, Inc. (NASDAQ:STEC), a leading global provider of solid-state storage solutions, today announced the sTec&#174; s3000 storage appliance. The s3000 combines the performance, reliability and endurance of sTec's industry-leading solid-state drive (SSD) technology with Microsoft Windows Storage Server 2012 storage clustering, virtualization and management features -- all within a cost-effective hardware configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	With up to 96 terabytes (TB) of storage per appliance, the s3000 is a significant addition to sTec's solid-state storage product portfolio of top-performing and most-reliable enterprise SSD drives and caching software. Furthermore, the s3000 demonstrates sTec's commitment to providing an expansive range of tailored solid-state storage solutions, directly to the enterprise or through the company's growing global partner program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"In providing customized SSD solutions to meet our customers' storage requirements, we discovered a significant opportunity for an sTec-developed appliance that blends the power and performance of sTec SSDs with the capabilities and widespread deployment of Windows Storage Server 2012," said Ali Zadeh, corporate senior vice president and chief marketing officer, and general manager of the Systems and Software Group, sTec. &#160;"The s3000 is an ideal solution for IT managers looking to tailor their data centers to meet the demanding performance needs of their data-intensive applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Windows Storage Server 2012 introduced industry-leading innovations in storage, and sTec is building on these advances," said Brian Hillger, director, Server and Tools Marketing, Microsoft.&#160;"sTec's s3000 solid-state storage appliance takes advantage of Windows Storage Server 2012's range of features to give enterprises worldwide an advanced storage platform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"The enterprise-storage market is ripe for leveraging advances in SSDs and operating systems that provide powerful solutions to IT professionals' greatest challenges: storage management, clustering and virtualization &#8211; all within a reasonable budget," said Jim Bagley, senior analyst, Storage Strategies NOW, a leading industry analyst firm covering the IT industry.&#160;"sTec has aligned its solid-state storage expertise with this trend, as the s3000 was developed around Windows Storage Server 2012 for a tight coupling of enterprise-class storage and a standardized software platform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	As with all sTec solid-state storage solutions, the s3000 is architected for enterprise-class storage, enabling it to address the critical-data requirements of industries such as oil and gas, government, telecommunications, and cloud computing. &#160;With a large in-house team of storage, application and data center experts, sTec is able to work directly with customers to develop ideal approaches for tailoring their data centers to optimally incorporate the s3000 along with its other SSD solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	With performance as high as 1.2 million IOs per second (IOPS) and featuring sTec Serial Attached Storage (SAS) SSDs with up to twice the endurance of competing drives, the s3000 harnesses the power of sTec SSD technology to reduce application execution time and increase real-time access to high-demand, shared assets. &#160;By building the s3000 for Windows Storage Server 2012, sTec is bringing to market a high-performance storage appliance that can be integrated with existing storage systems, enhance traditional file-serving capabilities, and extend hypervisors such as Hyper-V and file-based storage for application workloads such as, SQL Server and SharePoint.&#160;The s3000 is particularly applicable in virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environments and those requiring performance-intensive I/O deployments to achieve higher virtualization consolidation factors. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The s3000 provides continuous availability and full redundancy through Windows Server 2012 Storage Spaces, and enables hot-swapping of drives and power supplies. &#160;It offers flexible, unified storage and data reduction through de-duplication and thin provisioning.&#160;Additionally, the s3000 is highly scalable; it can be configured with one or two 19-inch rack-mountable shelves, each accommodating as many as 24 SSDs, and can scale up to eight full interconnected appliances for a total of 768 TB of solid-state storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			Chevron Phillips Chemical Announces Expansion of Ethylene Production 
      by 200 Million Pounds per Year at its Sweeny Complex in Old Ocean, Texas
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP (Chevron Phillips Chemical) 
      announced it will expand its ethylene production by 200 million pounds 
      by adding a tenth furnace to ethylene unit 33 at its Sweeny complex in 
      Old Ocean, Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company recently received consent to begin construction from the 
      Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The new furnace will 
      achieve lower emissions and incorporate Best Available Control 
      Technology (BACT). Construction is targeted to commence within the next 
      quarter, with an anticipated startup in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This furnace addition will provide additional ethylene supply to meet 
      the growing global demand to better serve our customers and provide 
      additional supply prior to starting up our proposed U.S. Gulf Coast 
      Petrochemicals Project in 2017,&#8221; said Dave Smith, olefins  natural gas 
      liquids vice president for Chevron Phillips Chemical. Chevron Phillips 
      Chemical&#8217;s U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project continues to be on 
      track to build an ethane cracker at its Cedar Bayou plant in Baytown, 
      Texas and two polyethylene units in Old Ocean.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While the additional furnace will not add to the nameplate capacity of 
      the facility, the increased operating factor should result in net 
      increase of 200 million pounds of ethylene availability to provide 
      additional operational flexibility and reliability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Sweeny complex is one of the world&#8217;s largest single-site ethylene 
      facilities and is capable of producing greater than 11 million pounds of 
      ethylene per day, or roughly 4.1 billion pounds annually. &#8220;This project 
      and the proposed addition of the adjacent polyethylene units emphasize 
      the importance of Sweeny in the company&#8217;s portfolio,&#8221; said Wayne 
      McDowell, Sweeny complex manager. &#8220;We are thrilled to produce quality 
      products safely and reliably on an even larger scale.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;By Prakash Chakravarti and Elzio Barreto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, June 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has
joined Alibaba Group's $8 billion loan with $500 million in

&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES, June 4 (Reuters) - Argentina's Supreme Court
on Tuesday lifted a freeze that had been placed on Chevron Corp

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
CHICAGO, June 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+'
rating to Pfizer 
Inc.'s (Pfizer) $4 billion debt issuance comprising five
tranches. Proceeds from 
the new debt are expected to be used to refinance coming debt
maturities and for 
general corporate uses including further debt reduction. 
Key Rating Drivers
Pfizer is beyond a period of significant patent losses that
included the U.S. 
patent expiration of the world's once best-selling
pharmaceutical Lipitor in 
November 2011. The company's patent cliff is less daunting given
only 12.9% of 
the company's drug portfolio is at-risk of losing market
exclusivity over the 
next three years, including the potential loss of market
exclusivity for two of 
its five-bestselling medicines - Celebrex and Enbrel. Beyond
2015, the next 
significant U.S. drug patent expiration is Lyrica in December
2018.
Fitch believes that total debt leverage will remain relatively
steady through 
2013 concomitant with operational pressures from expiring drug
patents offset by 
a further decrease in the debt level from payment of maturing
securities. 
Currently, total debt leverage and adjusted debt leverage
(including $3.6 
billion in Zoetis debt) were 1.59 times (x) and 1.67x,
respectively, for the 
latest 12 month (LTM) period ending March 31, 2013. Potential
upside to the 
rating would result from accelerated debt repayment utilizing
strong cash flow, 
resulting gross debt-to-EBITDA below 1.3x.
Fitch believes that Pfizer will continue to generate superior
cash flow despite 
the top-line pressures from key drug patent exclusivity lapses
and expects that 
operating cash flow will remain above $18 billion through the
intermediate-term. 
Pfizer generated free cash flow (operating cash flow less
dividends and capital 
spending) of $8.6 billion generated in the LTM period ending
March 31, 2013, 
representing a strong margin of 15.1%. Fitch sees free cash flow
margins above 
17% over the next few years despite an increasing dividend. 
A cash balance and short-term investments totaling $35.3
billion, and long-term 
investments of $15.4 billion at the end of the first quarter
provide further 
liquidity. The company also had lines of credit totaling $8.8
billion at the end 
of the first quarter, of which $8.3 billion were unused. Unused
lines of credit 
of $7 billion that expire in 2016 backstop the company's $12
billion commercial 
paper program. Pfizer had outstanding commercial paper of $2.7
billion at the 
end of the first quarter. 
Fitch recognizes Pfizer's success in extracting costs via
organizational 
restructuring and integration synergies undertaken since 2005,
which have 
sustained margins despite revenue and earnings pressures from
the maturing drug 
portfolio. EBITDA and EBITDAR margins were to 44.6% and 45.2%,
respectively, for 
the LTM period ending March 31, 2013 compared to 44.6% and 45.2%
in 2011, and 
43.8% and 44.4% in 2010. Fitch expects moderate compression in
EBITDA and 
EBITDAR margins in 2013 from the levels of 44.9% and 45.5%,
respectively, at the 
end of 2012.
Pfizer's R program has been highly productive over the past
two years having 
launched three new oncology therapies - Xalkori, Inlyta, and
Bosulif - and two 
potential blockbuster drugs - Eliquis and Xeljanz. The approvals
were achieved 
despite heavy cutting of research expense since a realignment of
the R 
organization in early 2011. The company spent $7.6 billion on
R in 2012, which 
represented 12.8% of total revenues. 
Pfizer's cash flow generation supports its aggressive
shareholder-friendly 
activities. The company first directs capital to share
repurchases and uses the 
return on investment from the buybacks as a measuring stick for
bolt-on 
acquisition activity. In 2012, Pfizer bought back $8.3 billion
in common equity 
after purchasing $9 billion of shares during 2011. In the first
quarter of 2013, 
the company repurchased $4.6 billion in common equity. In
addition, dividends 
have risen at least 9% annually over the past three years.
Aggressive 
shareholder-friendly actions can be absorbed by the predicted
strong cash flow, 
in Fitch's opinion.      
Rating Sensitivities
Positive rating action would be warranted if Pfizer 
significantly reduces gross leverage via debt reduction in
excess of the 
long-term debt maturity schedule or sustained strong operational
performance 
through the patent cliff. Gross debt leverage maintained in the
range of 1.0x to 
1.3x would lead to positive rating action. 
Downward rating action would result from pressure on the
operations such that 
debt reduction efforts are compromised. Operational weakness
could stem from 
lower-than-anticipated results from cost containment initiatives
or 
poorer-than-expected sales performance. A transaction while
recovering from the 
patent cliff that places pressure on gross leverage would
negatively affect the 
rating.
Fitch currently rates Pfizer as follows: 
--Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+';
--Senior unsecured debt 'A+';
--Bank loan 'A+';
--Short-term IDR 'F1';
--Commercial paper 'F1'.
The Rating Outlook is Stable.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) Vice President Fabrice Tourre lost a bid to limit a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil fraud case against him over a transaction that led to a $550 million settlement by the Wall Street bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan on Tuesday rejected Tourre's argument that a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision limiting the reach of U.S. securities laws required the SEC to narrow its case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision is a victory for the SEC and gives it "a stronger tool to go after people who offer securities in the United States, regardless of where the recipient of the offer was located at the time," according to Angelo Savino, a partner at Cozen O'Connor who leads its professional liability practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC had accused Goldman and Tourre in a 2010 lawsuit of failing to tell investors that Paulson &amp; Co, the hedge fund run by billionaire John Paulson, helped choose and then bet against risky mortgage-backed securities underlying a collateralized debt obligation they marketed and sold, Abacus 2007-AC1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman in 2010 agreed to pay $550 million to settle its part of the case, without admitting wrongdoing. Tourre, now a graduate student in economics at the University of Chicago, chose to fight the charges, with Goldman paying his legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre had argued that fraud allegations concerning the offering of parts of Abacus to two non-U.S. purchasers, IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKBG.F) and ABN AMRO Bank NV, were not governed by U.S. securities laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His argument was rooted in a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB.AX), limiting the non-U.S. reach of a key fraud law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Forrest said that while Morrison also applied to a law that bans fraud "in the offer or sale of any securities," she said a "domestic offer" could give rise to a fraud claim "regardless of whether it results in a sale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the SEC could pursue this claim against Tourre because a reasonable jury could find that he had conducted a domestic offer, having worked in New York at all relevant times, including when he communicated with IKB and ABN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest also ruled in favor of the SEC on other parts of the case, including the sale of credit protection by third-party ACA LLC on $909 million of Abacus securities, while denying other parts of its request for partial summary judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trial is scheduled for July 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FABULOUS FAB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre, said in a statement: "The central point in today's ruling is that the SEC's attempt to win the case without a trial has failed. We look forward to a trial on the merits that will vindicate Mr. Tourre."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman Kevin Callahan said the regulator is pleased with the decision and looks forward to a trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment. The bank is not a defendant in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre had gained notoriety in the case for having referred to himself in an email as "fabulous Fab."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson's firm made about $1 billion from Abacus, which the SEC said cost other investors more than $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest has yet to rule on other parts of the case, including the extent to which the SEC may refer at trial to the 2008 financial crisis and to Goldman's $550 million settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones, who had overseen the case before leaving the bench, in 2011 cited the Morrison decision in dismissing some claims against Tourre over IKB and ABN Amro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v.

&lt;p&gt;* Fabrice Tourre set back ahead of July 15 trial&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* SEC fraud case relates to Abacus CDO involving Paulson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Goldman settled with SEC for $550 mln&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Stempel and Bernard Vaughan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 Vice President Fabrice Tourre lost a bid to limit a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission civil fraud case against him
over a transaction that led to a $550 million settlement by the
Wall Street bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan on
Tuesday rejected Tourre's argument that a 2010 U.S. Supreme
Court decision limiting the reach of U.S. securities laws
required the SEC to narrow its case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision is a victory for the SEC and gives it "a
stronger tool to go after people who offer securities in the
United States, regardless of where the recipient of the offer
was located at the time," according to Angelo Savino, a partner
at Cozen O'Connor who leads its professional liability practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC had accused Goldman and Tourre in a 2010 lawsuit of
failing to tell investors that Paulson &amp; Co, the hedge fund run
by billionaire John Paulson, helped choose and then bet against
risky mortgage-backed securities underlying a collateralized
debt obligation they marketed and sold, Abacus 2007-AC1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman in 2010 agreed to pay $550 million to settle its
part of the case, without admitting wrongdoing. Tourre, now a
graduate student in economics at the University of Chicago,
chose to fight the charges, with Goldman paying his legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre had argued that fraud allegations concerning the
offering of parts of Abacus to two non-U.S. purchasers, IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG and ABN AMRO Bank NV, were
not governed by U.S. securities laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His argument was rooted in a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court
decision, Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd,
limiting the non-U.S. reach of a key fraud law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Forrest said that while Morrison also applied to a law
that bans fraud "in the offer or sale of any securities," she
said a "domestic offer" could give rise to a fraud claim
"regardless of whether it results in a sale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the SEC could pursue this claim against Tourre
because a reasonable jury could find that he had conducted a
domestic offer, having worked in New York at all relevant times,
including when he communicated with IKB and ABN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest also ruled in favor of the SEC on other parts of the
case, including the sale of credit protection by third-party ACA
LLC on $909 million of Abacus securities, while denying other
parts of its request for partial summary judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trial is scheduled for July 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FABULOUS FAB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre, said in a statement:

to himself in an email as "fabulous Fab."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson's firm made about $1 billion from Abacus, which the
SEC said cost other investors more than $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest has yet to rule on other parts of the case,
including the extent to which the SEC may refer at trial to the
2008 financial crisis and to Goldman's $550 million settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones, who had overseen the case
before leaving the bench, in 2011 cited the Morrison decision in
dismissing some claims against Tourre over IKB and ABN Amro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, U.S. District Court, Southern

      Microsoft&#8217;s highly anticipated Surface PC tablet triggered a windfall of 
      buzz throughout tech and advertising communities worldwide, the creative 
      minds at award-winning Los Angeles-based design firm The Pastilla 
      Institute of Design knew they hit a home run. Created to spark momentum 
      and generate word-of-mouth for Microsoft&#8217;s first mobile computer, the 
      outdoor illustrations&#8212;which popped up on walls and sidewalks throughout 
      major metropolitan areas from Los Angeles to Paris&#8212;marked the initial 
      phase in Pastilla&#8217;s advertising campaign for Microsoft Surface.

			For Pastilla Institute of Design, Microsoft Surface Advertising 
      Campaign Heralds Next Stage of Growth
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Award-winning design firm The Pastilla Institute of Design recently 
      stepped forward as the creative driving force behind the Microsoft 
      Surface advertising campaign&#8212;the Los Angeles-based firm&#8217;s biggest, most 
      highly publicized advertising campaign to date. Since the PC tablet&#8217;s 
      celebrated launch in late October 2012, the ubiquitous advertising 
      campaign has triggered as much buzz and speculation in tech, advertising 
      and design circles as the Surface tablet itself.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 Vice President Fabrice Tourre lost a bid to narrow the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's fraud charges against
him over the marketing and sale of a collateralized debt
obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest on Tuesday rejected
Tourre's argument that a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision
limiting the reach of U.S. securities laws would require the SEC
to narrow its case against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest also ruled in favor of the SEC on portions of the
case, including the sale of credit protection on a part of the
collateralized debt obligation known as Abacus 2007-AC1 CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rulings come ahead of Tourre's upcoming trial, scheduled
for July 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys and representatives for Tourre, Goldman Sachs and
the SEC did not immediately return requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v Goldman Sachs &amp; Co et al, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 4 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp
 said on Tuesday that it would acquire database Web
hosting company SoftLayer Technologies and create a new division
for clients interested in cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial terms were not disclosed, but Reuters reported
in March that IBM, among others, had been in talks to buy
SoftLayer in a deal that could fetch more than $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dallas-based SoftLayer was founded in 2005 and has become
what is says is the world's largest privately held website
hosting service. The company provides its 25,000 customers,
mainly small and medium-sized businesses, with cloud
infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For IBM's part, SoftLayer is helping the company build out
its private and public cloud-based services for its clients. IBM
said it expected to gain $7 billion annually in revenue from
cloud services by the end of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It created a new division called Cloud Services, which will
combine SoftLayer and IBM's existing offerings into a global
platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said it expected the deal to close in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

      will carry out this mission with &#8220;Give a Girl a Break,&#8221; an initiative 
      that will turn filmmaking passions into careers for a group of aspiring 
      young women.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Women help and inspire each other every day, but unfortunately that is 
      not always how women are portrayed. Even a little encouragement from 
      another woman can spark amazing accomplishments and we want to celebrate 
      women supporting other women,&#8221; said Sarah Innes, PG North America 
      FemCare Marketing Director. &#8220;We are proud to launch &#8216;Give a Girl a 
      Break&#8217; as an inspiring example of what can be achieved by a community of 
      women who encourage each other to pursue their passions. We hope many 
      will join Always in this effort and help demonstrate how women are 
      stronger together.&#8221;

			About &#8220;Give a Girl a Break&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Every day, women are trying to pursue their dreams and realize their 
      passions, but they may feel unsupported, discouraged or held back, even 
      by other women. However, more than ever before, women are in a prime 
      position to inspire, motivate and, most importantly, lend a helping hand 
      to each other. In fact, there is a natural inclination for women to 
      support each other -- research has shown, when stressed, women &#8220;tend and 
      befriend.&#8221; Distinct from the &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; response, women give care 
      or seek the company of other women, which releases oxytocin that reduces 
      stress and restores calm.1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;When women have a support system, they can overcome obstacles, pursue 
      their dreams and feel motivated to support other women to achieve their 
      goals,&#8221; says Mar&#237;a Mar&#237;n, bestselling author, TV/radio personality and 
      motivational guru for women. &#8220;We owe it to ourselves to continue to help 
      each other because, honestly, we all benefit tremendously from the 
      amazing things that can be accomplished when women support other women.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the Cassandra Report, 70 percent of Millennial women would 
      turn their passion into a career if given the choice. With this in mind, 
      &#8220;Give a Girl a Break&#8221; will engage the Always Facebook community to 
      commit to helping other women and support the filmmakers&#8217; journey.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			How &#8220;Give a Girl a Break&#8221; Works
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Give a Girl a Break&#8221; features three teams of passionate female 
      filmmakers as they create short films showing how support from other 
      women can make a difference. During the production, the Always community 
      has a chance to engage with the teams and their stories through:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Exclusive behind-the-scenes videos
      
			
        Facebook updates from the sets
      
			
        Twitter chats with the filmmakers and Mar&#237;a Mar&#237;n
      
			
        Photos and updates documenting the journey
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upon completion, all three films will debut on the Always Facebook page 
      where fans can vote in different categories to show the filmmakers their 
      support.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      offer the female film teams a unique opportunity to gain valuable 
      experience turning their passion into a reality.

			Insightly Integrates CRM with Microsoft Office 365 and Outlook 2013
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Free CRM application now delivers improved productivity and sales 
      management for small-business users of popular Office suite
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Insightly, 
      the leading provider of customer relationship management (CRM) 
      applications for small businesses, today announced new integration 
      capabilities with Microsoft Office 365 and Outlook 2013. Now, small 
      businesses can easily keep track of customer interactions and manage 
      leads, proposals, opportunities and projects from within Outlook or 
      Office. Insightly&#8217;s tight integration with the latest version of this 
      hugely popular email client and application suite allows small 
      businesses to manage customer interactions and sales processes directly 
      from their email, without having to change applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since email is at the core of small businesses&#8217; customer interactions, 
      bringing Insightly to Microsoft&#8217;s Outlook gives more companies the means 
      to merge email communications and customer management and puts CRM 
      within reach of any business that wants to grow its customer base and 
      deliver superior service. Insightly&#8217;s intuitive interface and freemium 
      pricing model align closely with small businesses that need affordable, 
      comprehensive, easy-to-use CRM and project management. Insightly users 
      can access project and customer data from any PC, laptop, smartphone or 
      tablet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our users have long cited our seamless email integration as one of 
      Insightly&#8217;s most valuable features, and that&#8217;s been a big part of how we 
      help customers succeed,&#8221; said Anthony Smith, CEO of Insightly. &#8220;Now 
      we&#8217;re applying everything we&#8217;ve learned from our more than 300,000 
      customers to the new Microsoft Outlook app, boosting productivity for 
      Outlook 2013 and Office 365 users, cutting the need for context 
      switching between apps, and helping users accomplish more work in less 
      time.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the new capabilities, Insightly users can:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Save emails from Outlook directly into Insightly CRM in one click and 
        automatically have all associated contacts and organizations created 
        and linked;
      
			
        Create new opportunities, projects or tasks in Insightly directly from 
        within Outlook;
      
			
        Save email contacts to Insightly and display and edit CRM contact 
        information directly from within Outlook emails;
      
			
        Link emails to the relevant projects and opportunities within 
        Insightly;
      
			
        View the complete history of CRM activity associated with any contact 
        or organization linked to an email directly from Outlook;
      
			
        Display Insightly contact details, social information and a profile 
        photo right&#160;above&#160;the email itself.

      generate a lasting positive impact by manufacturing, distributing, 
      selling and hiring through its local business in Myanmar.

			Agari Teams up with Microsoft, Financial Services and Others to 
      Disrupt Global Cybercrime Ring
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Email security leader plays key role in disrupting more than one 
      thousand botnets targeting people&#8217;s online banking information and 
      personal identities and stealing over half a billion dollars
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Agari, 
      the leading provider of email authentication solutions that prevent 
      cybercrime phishing, today announced it has successfully teamed up with 
      Microsoft, financial services industry leaders FS-ISAC, NACHA, American 
      Bankers Association, other industry partners, as well as the Federal 
      Bureau of Investigation to break up a massive cybercrime ring which was 
      stealing people&#8217;s online banking information and personal identities. 
      More than one thousand botnets, believed to be responsible for over half 
      a billion US dollars in financial fraud and affecting more than five 
      million people in over 90 countries, were disrupted by the operation. 
      The investigation culminated June 5th with the seizure of key 
      servers at two data hosting facilities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, 
      along with data and evidence from the botnets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Agari played a key role in the investigation and subsequent disruption 
      by providing crucial information over the course of many months.&#160;These 
      cyber criminals&#160;used phishing emails impersonating legitimate brands to 
      build the botnets.&#160;Agari leveraged the&#160;terabytes of phishing data it 
      processes every month to provide critical insights on the&#160;development 
      and growth of&#160;these&#160;botnets&#160;to Microsoft and FS-ISAC members.&#160;These 
      insights allowed Agari to serve as a direct declarant to the court by 
      describing the actual damage botnets cause, as well as the methods they 
      use to attack financial services firms and their customers worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is a significant day for Agari, but more importantly, a great day 
      for the Internet,&#8221; said Patrick Peterson, Agari CEO. &#8220;Through our 
      cooperation with Microsoft, law enforcement and others, we have 
      seriously disrupted a cybercrime operation that has already stolen more 
      than half a billion dollars and millions of people&#8217;s personal identities 
      and online banking information. While this certainly doesn&#8217;t end the war 
      with cybercriminals, a battle has definitely been won and we at Agari 
      are proud to have played a pivotal role.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Deemed as &#8220;one of the most highly sophisticated and organized cybercrime 
      rings in existence today,&#8221; the cybercriminals employed more than one 
      thousand botnets to infect computers with Citadel malware. Once 
      infected, the victim&#8217;s keystrokes were monitored and recorded, providing 
      access to banking and other financial accounts leading to the theft of 
      money and other personal information. As part of the operation, 
      Microsoft took action against 1,462 Citadel botnets in order to cut off 
      communication between the cybercriminals and the millions of infected 
      computers under their control. The FBI also provided information to 
      foreign law enforcement counterparts so that they could also take 
      voluntary action on botnet infrastructure located outside of the U.S. 
      The FBI also obtained and served court-authorized search warrants 
      domestically related to the botnets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "While we certainly celebrate today's victory, we are once again 
      reminded just how advanced these types of attacks have become and how 
      potentially costly and&#160;damaging they truly are," said Bill Nelson from 
      FS-ISAC. "It underscores the need to be proactive in the ongoing battle 
      against cybercriminals and to work together with partners like Agari to 
      protect&#160;businesses and customers alike." Due to the size and complexity 
      of the operation, the botnet threat has not been wiped out entirely, but 
      it has been significantly disrupted, providing an opportunity to 
      eliminate the malware from infected computers. Microsoft is working with 
      Internet Service Providers and Computer Emergency Response Teams 
      worldwide to quickly notify people with infected computers.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and the FBI, aided by authorities in more than 80 countries, have launched a major assault on one of the world's biggest cyber crime rings, believed to have stolen more than $500 million from bank accounts over the past 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said its Digital Crimes Unit on Wednesday successfully took down at least 1,000 of an estimated 1,400 malicious computer networks known as the Citadel Botnets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citadel infected as many as 5 million PCs around the world and, according to Microsoft, was used to steal from dozens of financial institutions, including: American Express, Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, eBay's PayPal, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Canada and Wells Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the criminals remain at large and the authorities do not know the identities of any ringleaders, the internationally coordinated take-down dealt a significant blow to their cyber capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bad guys will feel the punch in the gut," said Richard Domingues Boscovich, assistant general counsel with Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Botnets are armies of infected personal computers, or bots, which run software forcing them to regularly check in with and obey "command and control" servers operated by hackers. Botnets are typically used to commit financial crimes, send spam, distribute computer viruses and attack computer networks. (See graphic link.reuters.com/vem68t)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citadel is one of the biggest botnets in operation today. Microsoft said its creator bundled the software with pirated versions of the Windows operating system, and used it to control PCs in the United States, Western Europe, Hong Kong, India and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation told Reuters it is working closely with Europol and other overseas authorities to try to capture the unknown criminals. The FBI has obtained search warrants as part of what it characterized as a "fairly advanced" criminal probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are upping the game in our level of commitment in going after botnet creators and distributors," FBI Assistant Executive Director Richard McFeely said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a more concerted effort to engage our foreign partners to assist us in identifying, locating and - if we can - get U.S. criminal process on these botnet creators and distributors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has filed a civil lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Charlotte, North Carolina against the unknown hackers and obtained a court order to shut down the botnets. The complaint, unsealed on Wednesday, identifies the ringleader as John Doe No. 1, who goes by the alias Aquabox and is accused of creating and maintaining the botnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boscovich said investigators are trying to determine Aquabox's identity and suspect he lives in eastern Europe and works with at least 81 "herders," who run the bots from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Citadel software is programmed so it will not attack PCs or financial institutions in Ukraine or Russia, likely because the creators operate in those countries and want to avoid provoking law enforcement officials there, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINDING 'JOHN DOE'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft, Citadel was used to steal more than $500 million from banks in the United States and abroad, but the company did not specify losses at individual accounts or firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Bankers Association, one of three financial industry groups that worked with Microsoft, said any success in reducing the number of active Citadel Botnets will reduce future losses incurred by banks and their customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am hopeful we have a model that will allow us to get closer and closer to those who are the ultimate perpetrators of these crimes," said ABA Vice President Doug Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, banks typically reimburse consumers when they are victims of cyber crime, but they may require business customers to absorb those losses, the ABA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's team of digital detectives, who are based at corporate headquarters in Redmond, Washington, have been involved in seven efforts to attack botnets since 2010. Wednesday's marked its first collaboration with the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software maker sought help from the FBI about 10 days ago. At that time the agency told Microsoft that it had already done significant work on a criminal probe into the Citadel Botnets, the FBI's McFeely said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it and the FBI are working with law enforcement and other organizations in countries including: Australia, Brazil, Ecuador, Germany, Holland, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Spain and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the more than 1,000 botnets that were shut down on Wednesday, Microsoft said 455 were hosted in 40 data centers in the United States. The rest were located in dozens of countries overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technicians from Microsoft, accompanied by U.S. Marshals, visited two U.S. data centers in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Absecon, New Jersey to collect forensic evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boscovich said the data center operators typically are not aware that their servers are being used to run botnets. "There is no responsibility on their part to see what is in the pipes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEJA ZEUS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the second time Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit sought to bring down a large number of botnets at once. In March 2012 it targeted hundreds of Zeus botnets, which use similar software and infrastructure as Citadel, though they were not as sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That effort succeeded in shutting just a quarter of the approximately 800 targeted Zeus command and control servers, according to Microsoft. Zeus is not controlled by a single developer like Citadel, which made it harder for investigators to track and knock out herders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyber criminals typically infect machines by sending spam emails containing malicious links and attachments, and by infecting legitimate websites with computer viruses that attack unsuspecting visitors. Some bot herders rent or sell infected machines on underground markets to other cyber criminals looking to engage in a wide variety of activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Citadel software disables anti-virus programs on infected PCs so they cannot detect malicious software. It surfaced in early 2012 and is sold over the Internet in kits that cost $2,400 or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boscovich said he believes that Aquabox also gets a percentage of money stolen by his customers using Citadel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These kits allow herders to easily set up and run botnets on pirated versions of Microsoft's Windows XP operating system, according to court documents. The kits include modules for infecting PCs, as well as stealing from online banking sites, sending spam and engaging in other types of cyber crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Citadel Botnet operators have used infected machines to disrupt bank websites in so-called distributed denial of service attacks, hoping to distract those firms from thefts that are occurring or have occurred, according to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aquabox provided herders a secret forum where they could suggest new features for the Citadel kits, as well as exchange ideas on best practices in botnet herding, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Tiffany Wu and Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

        responsibilities as Group President &#8211; Global Fabric Care. In 
        connection with this, George Tsourapas, currently Vice 
        President&#8211;Fabric and Home Care, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle 
        East and Africa, has been elected President-Global Home Care and PG 
        Professional, succeeding David Taylor. Mr. Tsourapas will report to 
        Mr. Ciserani.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      With their expanded roles, Mr. Ciserani, Ms. Henretta, Mr. Riant and Mr. 
      Taylor will report directly to Mr. Lafley. Presidents for each of the 
      global business units included in each sector will now report to the 
      respective Sector Group President. These changes are effective July 1, 
      2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We expect this structure to facilitate faster global expansion of brand 
      and product innovations to win with consumers,&#8221; Mr. Lafley said. 
      &#8220;Sectors will also drive technical, commercial, financial and 
      organizational synergies to improve results.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Concurrent with these changes, PG is also announcing that Dimitri 
      Panayotopoulos, currently Vice Chairman, Global Business Units, has been 
      elected Vice Chairman and Advisor to the Chairman and Chief Executive 
      Officer effective July 1, 2013. Mr. Panayotopoulos will continue to 
      report to Mr. Lafley.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Also effective July 1, 2013, Melanie L. Healey, Group President - North 
      America and Global Hyper, Super and Mass Channel, will report to Mr. 
      Lafley in addition to Werner Geissler, Vice Chairman, Global Operations. 
      This change reflects the size and impact of the North America market to 
      PG&#8217;s business. Mr. Geissler will continue reporting to Mr. Lafley as 
      Vice Chairman, Global Operations, with particular focus on Western 
      Europe and developing markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This will strengthen our focus on go-to-market excellence in our core 
      developed and developing markets,&#8221; Mr. Lafley said. &#8220;Taken together, 
      these organization changes will help us operate better and faster as one 
      unified team to win.&#8221;

			Forward-Looking Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Certain statements in this release or presentation, other than purely 
      historical information, including estimates, projections, statements 
      relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating 
      results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are 
      &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private 
      Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities 
      Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
      These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words 
      &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;strategy,&#8221; 
      &#8220;future,&#8221; &#8220;opportunity,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;will 
      be,&#8221; &#8220;will continue,&#8221; &#8220;will likely result,&#8221; and similar expressions. 
      Forward-looking statements are based on current expectation and 
      assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause 
      results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We 
      undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking 
      statements, whether because of new information, future events or 
      otherwise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Risks and uncertainties to which our forward-looking statements are 
      subject include: (1) the ability to achieve business plans, including 
      growing existing sales and volume profitably and maintaining and 
      improving margins and market share, despite high levels of competitive 
      activity, an increasingly volatile economic environment, lower than 
      expected market growth rates, especially with respect to the product 
      categories and geographical markets (including developing markets) in 
      which the Company has chosen to focus, and/or increasing competition 
      from mid- and lower tier value products in both developed and developing 
      markets; (2) the ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition, 
      divestiture and joint venture activities to achieve the cost and growth 
      synergies in accordance with the stated goals of these transactions 
      without impacting the delivery of base business objectives; (3) the 
      ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational changes and 
      achieve productivity improvements designed to support our growth 
      strategies, while successfully identifying, developing and retaining 
      particularly key employees, especially in key growth markets where the 
      availability of skilled or experienced employees may be limited; (4) the 
      ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships; (5) the 
      ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply sources (including sole 
      supplier and plant manufacturing sources); (6) the ability to 
      successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal requirements and matters 
      (including, but not limited to, product liability, patent, intellectual 
      property, price controls, import restrictions, environmental and tax 
      policy), and to resolve pending matters within current estimates; (7) 
      the ability to resolve the pending competition law inquiries in Europe 
      within current estimates; (8) the ability to successfully implement, 
      achieve and sustain cost improvement plans and efficiencies in 
      manufacturing and overhead areas, including the Company's outsourcing 
      projects; (9) the ability to successfully manage volatility in foreign 
      exchange rates, as well as our debt and currency exposure (especially in 
      certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization or 
      pricing controls, such as Venezuela, China, India and Argentina); (10) 
      the ability to maintain our current credit rating and to manage 
      fluctuations in interest rate, increases in pension and healthcare 
      expense, and any significant credit or liquidity issues; (11) the 
      ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty 
      and disruptions, especially in the Company's significant geographical 
      markets, due to a wide variety of factors, including but not limited to, 
      terrorist and other hostile activities, natural disasters and/or 
      disruptions to credit markets, resulting from a global, regional or 
      national credit crisis; (12) the ability to successfully manage 
      competitive factors, including prices, promotional incentives and trade 
      terms for products; (13) the ability to obtain patents and respond to 
      technological advances attained by competitors and patents granted to 
      competitors; (14) the ability to successfully manage increases in the 
      prices of commodities, raw materials and energy, including the ability 
      to offset these increases through pricing actions; (15) the ability to 
      develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs; (16) the 
      ability to stay on the leading edge of innovation, maintain the positive 
      reputation of our brands and ensure trademark protection; and (17) the 
      ability to rely on and maintain key information technology systems and 
      networks (including Company and third-party systems and networks), the 
      security over such systems and networks, and the data contained therein.

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to JPMBB 2013-C12
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) is pleased to announce the assignment of 
      preliminary ratings for the JPMBB 2013-C12 transaction (see ratings list 
      below). JPMBB 2013-C12 is a $1.34 billion CMBS conduit transaction 
      collateralized by 77 commercial mortgage loans that are secured by 107 
      properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loans have principal balances ranging from $1.6 million to $125.0 
      million for the largest loan in the pool, Legacy Place (9.3%). Legacy 
      Place is a 575,248 sf (483,569 collateral sf) lifestyle anchored retail 
      center located in Dedham, Massachusetts, approximately 12 miles 
      southwest of Boston, Massachusetts. The top five loans, which also 
      include the Americold Cold Storage Portfolio (8.2%), IDS Center (6.7%), 
      Southridge Mall (4.1%) and Colony Hills Portfolio (3.5%), represent 
      31.4% of the initial pool balance, while the top 10 loans represent 
      45.0%. 67 loans have 10-year terms (82.0%), one loan (2.0%) has a 
      nine-year term, one loan has a seven-year term (2.8%) and seven loans 
      (13.2%) have a five-year term. Over half of the pool&#8217;s balance (55 
      loans, 51.1%) is comprised of amortizing balloon loans with no 
      interest-only periods. There are 19 loans (45.6%) that have partial 
      interest-only periods, and two full-term, interest-only loans (3.2%). 
      The collateral properties are located in 33 states. The five largest 
      state exposures represent 43.6% of the pool balance and include: 
      Massachusetts (11.9%), Texas (10.0%), California (7.7%), Minnesota 
      (7.6%) and New York (6.4%). The pool has exposure to four property types 
      with concentrations in excess of 10.0%: Retail (40.4%), Multifamily 
      (14.1%), Office (12.9%), and Hotel (12.5%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction incorporated our multi-borrower 
      rating process that begins with our analysts' evaluation of underlying 
      collateral properties' financial and operating performance, which 
      determine KBRA&#8217;s estimate of sustainable net cash flow (KNCF) and KBRA 
      value. The analysis incorporates a detailed evaluation of the underlying 
      collateral properties&#8217; financial and operating performance using our 
      CMBS Property Evaluation Guidelines to determine Kroll Net Cash Flow 
      (KNCF), which on an aggregate basis was 4.0% less than the issuer cash 
      flow. KBRA capitalization rates were applied to each asset&#8217;s KNCF to 
      derive individual property values that, on an aggregate basis, were 
      33.6% lower than third party appraisal values. The weighted average 
      capitalization rate for the transaction was 9.3%. The pool has an 
      in-trust KLTV of 96.4% and an all-in KLTV of 101.7%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The KBRA credit model deploys rent and occupancy stresses, probability 
      of default regressions, and loss given default calculations to determine 
      losses for each collateral loan, which are then used to assign our 
      credit ratings. The preliminary ratings are based on information known 
      to KBRA at the time of this publication. Information received subsequent 
      to this release could result in the assignment of final ratings that 
      differ from the preliminary ratings.

			ExxonMobil&#8217;s Baytown Chemical Plant Earns AFPM&#8217;s Highest Safety Honor
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil&#8217;s Baytown Chemical Plant has earned the American Fuel  
      Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) Distinguished Safety Award for 
      superior safety performance in the U.S. refining and petrochemical 
      manufacturing industries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Some 1,350 employees and contractors at the ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical 
      Plant received AFPM&#8217;s highest honor for superior safety performance 
      during more than five million work hours in 2011 and 2012 with no 
      recordable injuries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Operational excellence is the foundation of ExxonMobil Chemical&#8217;s 
      success,&#8221; said Joe Blommaert, ExxonMobil Chemical Plant manager. &#8220;The 
      achievement by our employees demonstrates their commitment to excellence 
      in pursuing our vision that nobody gets hurt."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Baytown has an exceptional safety culture that is built on a foundation 
      of extensive employee involvement and commitment,&#8221; continued Blommaert. 
      &#8220;Our employees and contractors help drive our safety efforts through 
      their active involvement in our personnel and process safety activities. 
      Our safety culture has helped us consistently deliver industry-leading 
      safety performance.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

			BuilderMT Shares Market Share Leadership Position With Microsoft for 
      Residential Construction Project Management Software
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BuilderMT&#8217;s Dominant Market Share Is More Than Twice As Big as the 
      Next Competitor
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BuilderMT, 
      the widely-acknowledged market share leader in workflow management 
      solutions for homebuilders, today announced that a recent analysis by Constructech 
      places BuilderMT as the market share co-leader (with Microsoft, 
      NASDAQ: MSFT) 
      for residential project management software.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BuilderMT increased its market share by 10% since the last Constructech 
      survey in 2011. Today, BuilderMT holds a 20% market share position, 
      more than twice the market share of Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL). 
      Some well-known project management software companies dropped market 
      share in the same time period. Constellation HomeBuilder Systems (TSX: CSU) 
      saw a 100% market share retraction in the last two years. 
      Constellation stands at 9% today. HomeFront Software has a 2% market 
      share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The news about BuilderMT&#8217;s dominant market share comes on the heels of 
      other good news from the company. BuilderMT recently announced that its 
      Cloud development program is proceeding ahead of schedule, with an 
      initial rollout set for Q3 2013. BuilderMT&#8217;s new multi-tenant Cloud 
      platform will support pure off-premise products as well as hybrid 
      solutions, like BuilderMT&#8217;s popular portal solutions. With the BuilderMT 
      Cloud platform in place (fully enabled to talk to the clients&#8217; 
      on-premise WMS), BuilderMT will offer the powerful &#8220;hybrid platform&#8221; 
      that is the preferred model used by enterprise-class ERP/CRM solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Nothing indicates the success of a software package more than market 
      acceptance and increased market share, both of which BuilderMT has 
      experienced year after year, since our inception,&#8221; said BuilderMT&#8217;s 
      President Tom Gebes. &#8220;We&#8217;re proud and honored to be #1.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Jeff Shellebarger named president of Chevron North America 
      Exploration and Production;
				Gary Luquette to retire after 
      distinguished 35-year career
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) announced that Jeff Shellebarger has 
      been named president of Chevron North America Exploration and Production 
      Company, effective August 1, 2013. Shellebarger succeeds Gary Luquette, 
      who will retire from Chevron after 35 years of distinguished service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Shellebarger, 56, is currently managing director of Chevron&#8217;s IndoAsia 
      Business Unit. Since joining Chevron in 1980, Shellebarger has held a 
      variety of upstream positions in the U.S., Angola and Indonesia. In his 
      new capacity, he will be responsible for overseeing Chevron&#8217;s 
      exploration and production activities throughout North America, 
      including the company&#8217;s significant portfolio of assets in California, 
      the Gulf of Mexico, Pennsylvania, the Mid-Continent region of the U.S. 
      and Canada. Shellebarger will report to George Kirkland, Chevron&#8217;s vice 
      chairman and executive vice president of Upstream.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Jeff&#8217;s appointment to this leadership role demonstrates the bench 
      strength of our management team,&#8221; said John Watson, Chevron&#8217;s chairman 
      and CEO. &#8220;We are placing an experienced and proven executive in a key 
      position as we continue to pursue our growth objectives.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Luquette has led Chevron&#8217;s North America Upstream business since 2006. 
      He previously held key exploration and production positions in 
      Louisiana, California, United Kingdom and Indonesia. As the head of the 
      company&#8217;s North America upstream business, Luquette opened new frontiers 
      by advancing Chevron&#8217;s presence in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and 
      acquiring significant shale gas positions in Pennsylvania and Canada. In 
      addition to these contributions, Luquette played an instrumental role in 
      helping the industry improve its oil spill prevention and response 
      capabilities, and enabling the company&#8217;s restart in the Gulf through 
      diligent work with government officials and regulators following the Deepwater 
      Horizon incident. Luquette, 57, will stay with the company until 
      September 1, 2013 to transition his responsibilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Over the course of his career, Gary established himself as a remarkable 
      leader within Chevron and the industry,&#8221; said Watson. &#8220;But beyond his 
      leadership qualities, Gary was an exceptional colleague whose experience 
      and insight made him an invaluable member of our senior management team.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

			Dewalt - DCT416 Imaging Thermometer Kit Reverse Costing Analysis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Being part of Dewalt 12V cordless tool platform, this rugged product is 
      meant to bring thermal imaging tools to everyone in the field. Its 
      low-cost when compared with microbolometer-based cameras is coming with 
      the low thermal resolution of its 15x15 pixel array. However the 
      possibility to blend the thermal array with a visual image enhances its 
      usage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The thermal sensor used in this camera is a ceramic pyroelectric array. 
      A camera module, an infrared optical lens, a 2.2 display are packed in a 
      compact housing. The system with its accessories is supplied in a rigid 
      transport case.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on a complete teardown analysis, the report provides an estimation 
      of the production cost as well as the selling price of the product.

      The REDEYE-6A is an array sensor using pyroelectric ceramic. The 
      manufacturing process is simpler than it is for a micro-bolometer. The 
      ceramic plate is attached on top of the readout integrated circuit and 
      sealed with the IR window.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The definition of the REDEYE-6A is rather low: 31x31 pixels. It is 
      optimized for low-cost application which do not need a great definition 
      and high refresh rate. The same pyroelectric ceramic technology is used 
      for higher definition array sensor, up to 47x47 pixels

      capabilities to connect participating member institutions and their Visa 
      account holders with unique merchant offers, discounts and other loyalty 
      programs relevant to their interests and communities. By bringing both 
      national and local merchant offers to community bank customers, the Visa

      Visa. &#8220;We are committed to customizing Visa&#8217;s products and services, 
      such as Visa Offers, to help our partners provide the greatest value to 
      their customers in ways that are both scalable for their business and 
      relevant to their local communities. Importantly, this initiative with 
      ICBA Bancard will help inform and develop other community bank programs 
      that can further enable these institutions to grow and meet the unique 
      needs of their customers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This partnership with Visa will enable us to create a program that is 
      relevant to our members and their customers and that meets the demand 
      for both local and national merchant offers to reach consumers,&#8221; said 
      Noah Wilcox, chairman of ICBA Bancard and president and CEO of Grand 
      Rapids State Bank in Grand Rapids, Minn. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to work with

      cutting-edge programs, technology and services to support community 
      banks across the country.&#8221;

      expanded and refined in the coming months, ICBA Bancard will offer the 
      service to its broader community bank membership base.

Reports on BP, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips Planning Additional $1 Billion Investment in Alaska Due to New Industry Friendly Tax Legislation&lt;POLR.OB&gt;</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska, June 5, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Polar Petroleum Corp. (OTCBB:POLR) (herein after "Polar Petroleum", "Polar" and/or "the Company") is pleased to report on news that oil industry majors BP, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips plan to invest an extra $1 billion over the next 5 years on the North Slope of Alaska. BP is the operator of Alaska's Prudhoe Bay field, the largest oil field in North America. As operator, BP will increase capital spending at Prudhoe Bay by roughly 30%, adding 2 new onshore rigs to bring BP's total fleet in the area to 9 working rigs.[1] According to a June 3, 2013 new release issued by BP, the increased investment is due to changes in Alaska's industry friendly oil tax policy (i.e., Senate Bill 21 or SB 21), which was signed into law on April 14, 2013.[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	BP also announced it has support from the other Working Interest (WI) owners at Prudhoe Bay (BP 26%; Exxon 36%; ConocoPhillips 36%; Chevron 1%) to evaluate a further $3 billion worth of new development projects in the Greater Prudhoe Bay area. Among the additional development opportunities being evaluated are expanding and debottlenecking existing Prudhoe Bay facilities; constructing a new drilling pad; and expanding of existing pads, including the drilling of over 110 new wells. The additional development projects could take nearly 10 years to complete, and would be expected to further increase Alaska's oil production while creating new industry jobs.[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The news is yet another indication that the state's tax reform has revived Alaska's energy industry by making it more attractive to oil industry investment. On April 17, 2013, ConocoPhillips announced its first additional investments on Alaska's North Slope based on the tax change.[4] According to ConocoPhillips, the company will be deploying a new drilling rig to the Kuparuk oil field to work over existing wells in order to increase production.[5] BP's June 3, 2013 news release included the following comments from the president of BP Alaska, Janet Weiss: "With this new tax law, the Alaska legislature and Governor Parnell have taken an important step toward improving Alaska's long-term economic future. Our announcement today should make abundantly clear that BP is committed to being a part of that future and to continuing to extend the life of North America's largest oil field." Weiss also added: "Now that an improved tax structure is in place, oil and gas projects can once again move forward, keeping Alaska competitive in the midst of America's recent energy renaissance."[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The tax reform was backed by Alaska's governor, Sean Parnell, and is designed to simplify the tax system and abolish the structure of raised tax rates that previously took effect at higher oil prices.[1] In contrast, the former system resulted in Alaska's tax rate exceeding 50% when oil prices were high, making Alaska less inviting for energy companies. The new system represents significant benefits for companies such as Polar Petroleum by utilizing a base tax rate for oil companies of 35% on net profits.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the news of the extra industry investments, BP also plans to increase well work at its Prudhoe Bay and Milne Point fields as soon as Q4 2013 to improve the performance of existing wells on the North Slope.[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Polar Petroleum Corp.'s President and CEO, Daniel Walker, commented: "With the Prudhoe Bay Unit bordering our Hemi Springs Project to the north, and several of the unit's producing oil wells being about 1 mile away from our project, we are understandably encouraged by the news of such significant industry investment so close by. We're also encouraged by the near-term and longer-term investment that is already being spurred by the new and welcomed industry friendly tax regime in Alaska. Increased investment will undoubtedly only make the region more productive and attractive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

	ABOUT POLAR PETROLEUM CORP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Polar Petroleum (OTCBB:POLR) is an independent American oil and gas company based in Anchorage, AK. The Company is focused on securing domestic energy solutions through the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas in Alaska's proven North Slope region: home to the 2 largest oil fields in North America, over 10 other producing fields, and established infrastructure. The Company's Franklin Bluffs Project overlies the 3 source rocks thought to represent potential unconventional shale oil on the North Slope. Test drilling in the vicinity has met expectations for finding oil in the source rocks.* The Company's Hemi Springs Project is estimated to potentially represent recoverable petroleum reserves of ~558 million barrels of oil.** The Company's North Point Thomson Project lies along the northern border of ExxonMobil's Point Thomson Unit and is 8 miles northeast of the producing Badami Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Polar's projects comprise 29 leases and ~66,061 acres, and are strategically positioned between many of the major players of the oil and gas industry and the necessary infrastructure to bring hydrocarbons to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      May 29, 2013 &#8211; The Azbil Corporation (formally known as 
      Yamatake-Honeywell) is providing long term support to ExxonMobil for its 
      use of TDC2000-based control systems. Azbil is a co-developer and a 
      co-owner of the TDC2000 technology and Intellectual Property (IP).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For companies with a large installed base of this equipment, Azbil can 
      provide services through the year 2025 which include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The ability to redesign parts as needed and to recertify used parts 
        via a high quality factory refurbishment process to bring the part up 
        to the latest revision
      
			
        The availability of highly skilled regional engineers with in depth 
        knowledge of the system and its operation
      
			
        The ability to perform a detailed analysis of parts failures to 
        determine if a failure was atypical or simply due to aging
      
			
        The ability to proactively analyze system performance and robustness 
        and provide recommendations for improvement
      
			
        The ability to train and maintain detailed system knowledge from both 
        a supplier and site perspective through the term of the agreement

      on the card (to enhance reliability and decrease power consumption) and 
      the number of different cards required (to reduce spare parts 
      requirements).

			About Synageva&#8217;s lead programs sebelipase alfa for LAL Deficiency and 
      SBC-103 for MPS IIIB
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL 
      Deficiency) is a rare autosomal 
      recessive lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by a marked decrease 
      in LAL enzyme activity. Late onset LAL Deficiency, sometimes called 
      Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease (CESD), is an underappreciated cause 
      of cirrhosis and accelerated atherosclerosis in children and adults. 
      These complications are due to the buildup of fatty material in the 
      liver and blood vessel walls as a result of decreased LAL enzyme 
      activity. Early onset LAL Deficiency, sometimes called Wolman disease, 
      is the most rapidly progressive form of LAL Deficiency and is usually 
      fatal within the first six months of life. Affected infants develop 
      severe malabsorption, growth failure and liver failure. There are no 
      approved therapies for LAL Deficiency.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sebelipase 
      alfa (SBC-102) is a recombinant form of the human LAL enzyme under 
      development by Synageva as an enzyme replacement therapy for LAL 
      Deficiency. Synageva is evaluating sebelipase alfa in global clinical 
      trials for both early and late onset LAL Deficiency. Sebelipase alfa has 
      been granted orphan designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the Japanese Ministry of 
      Health, Labour and Welfare. Additionally, sebelipase alfa received fast 
      track designation
			by the FDA, and Breakthrough Therapy 
      designation by the FDA for early onset LAL Deficiency.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) consist of a group of rare LSDs caused 
      by a deficiency of enzymes needed to break down complex sugars called 
      glycosaminoglycans. The MPS III syndromes (also known as Sanfilippo 
      syndromes) share complications with other MPS diseases but represent a 
      clinically distinct subset with marked central nervous system 
      degeneration. Mucopolysaccharidosis 
      IIIB (MPS IIIB, also known as Sanfilippo B syndrome) is caused by a 
      marked decrease in alpha-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAGLU) enzyme 
      activity which leads to the buildup of abnormal sugars called heparan 
      sulfate disaccharides (HSD) in the brain and other organs. The 
      accumulation of abnormal HSD, particularly in the central nervous 
      system, leads to severe cognitive decline, behavioral problems, speech 
      loss, increasing loss of mobility, and premature death. There are no 
      approved therapies for MPS IIIB.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SBC-103 
      is a recombinant form of the human NAGLU enzyme under development by 
      Synageva as an enzyme replacement therapy for MPS IIIB. Using various 
      dosing approaches, SBC-103 reduced HSD substrate storage in the brains, 
      liver and kidney tissues in an MPS IIIB animal model. SBC-103 has been 
      granted orphan designation by the FDA and the EMA. Synageva plans to 
      enter SBC-103 into human clinical trials for MPS IIIB during the first 
      half of 2014.

			Forward-Looking Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This news release contains &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221;. Such statements 
      generally can be identified by the use of words such as &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; 
      &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; 
      &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; or words of similar meaning. These 
      forward-looking statements address, among other matters, our plans to 
      enter into human clinical trials for MPS IIIB. Many factors may cause 
      actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, 
      including inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of risks and 
      uncertainties, some of which are known, including an accurate 
      understanding of the implications of Breakthrough Therapy designation 
      which cannot be determined at this time, and the risks associated with 
      transitioning our preclinical MPS IIIB program to human clinical trials 
      and those additional risks identified under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; 
      in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities 
      and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) on May 7, 2013, and other filings 
      Synageva periodically makes with the SEC, and others of which are not 
      known. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future results or 
      events, and investors should avoid placing undue reliance on such 
      statements. Synageva undertakes no obligation to update any 
      forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, 
      future events or otherwise. Our business is subject to substantial risks 
      and uncertainties, including those referenced above. Investors, 
      potential investors, and others should give careful consideration to 
      these risks and uncertainties.

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI, June 5 (Reuters) - A private equity fund run by
Goldman Sachs has invested $135 million in unlisted
Indian wind energy firm ReNew Power Pvt Ltd, a company official
said, making it one of the largest renewable energy investors in
India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bank's private equity arm had invested about
$200 million in the same company two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs private equity funds have invested  more than
$2 billion in capital since 2006 in the country, said Ankur
Sahu, co-head of Goldman Sachs' private equity business in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ReNew Power has installed capacity of 200 MW as of April 30,
its website showed. The company aims to have 1,000 MW capacity
by 2015, the site said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - International Business Machines said on Tuesday it would acquire Web hosting company SoftLayer Technologies and create a new division for clients interested in so-called cloud services, a move to better compete with larger rivals in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives with IBM and SoftLayer declined to comment on the terms of the deal on a call with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported in March that IBM, among others, had been in talks to buy SoftLayer in a deal that could fetch more than $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dallas-based SoftLayer, which leases online storage space to companies, was founded in 2005 and has become what it says is the world's largest privately held website hosting service. The company provides its 25,000 customers, including AT Inc and Citrix Systems Inc, with cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company competes with Amazon.com Inc's Web services business and Rackspace Hosting Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like rivals Hewlett Packard Co and Microsoft Corp, IBM has increasingly invested in cloud services as corporate users move away from costly internal information technology infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has traditionally specialized in assisting large corporate and government users but has been trying in recent years to expand into smaller businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIMING BIG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Erich Clementi, senior vice president of IBM Global Technology Services, said on a call with reporters that IBM is shooting squarely for the large business segment with this acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are the largest infrastructure provider to the enterprise world on the planet," he said "That is our focus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, Web hosting companies have been considered attractive takeover candidates as technology and telecom companies look to improve the performance and cost efficiencies of their cloud computing services for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo analyst Gray Powell estimated that the transaction was worth 11.1 times SoftLayer's projected 2013 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That compares with Rackspace, which is currently trading at 11 times 2013 estimated EBITDA, Powell noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said it expected to gain $7 billion annually in revenue from cloud services by the end of 2015. It created a new division called Cloud Services, which will combine SoftLayer and IBM's existing offerings into a global platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoftLayer is majority held by GI Partners, which purchased all of the equity in partnership with the company's management in August 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data storage equipment maker EMC had been approached about SoftLayer as well. An EMC spokesman said on Tuesday, "EMC was initially approached, uninterested and decided not to bid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said it expected the deal to close in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of IBM were down about 1 percent at $206.78.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jennifer Saba in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			U.S. Subsidiary of Walton Westphalia Development Corporation Enters 
      into a Mezzanine Loan
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Westphalia Development Corporation (the "Corporation") 
      announced today that its U.S. subsidiary, Walton Westphalia Development 
      (USA), LLC ("WWDU") and its affiliate, Walton Westphalia 
      Europe, LP ("WWE"), (WWDU and WWE are collectively, the "Borrowers"), 
      have entered into a mezzanine loan (the "Mezzanine Loan") 
      with an arm's length institutional lender to finance initial 
      construction on the Westphalia property. This is in addition to the 
      $40.95 million USD senior loan (the "Senior Loan") that the 
      Corporation announced on June 3, 2013. WWDU and WWE are co-owners of the 
      Westphalia property.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Mezzanine Loan is a second priority secured loan for up to 
      $7,285,850 USD with interest accruing at 15% per annum, and payable from 
      cash flow on asset sales. The initial term of the Mezzanine Loan is 36 
      months and shall terminate with the termination of the Senior Loan. The 
      term of the Mezzanine Loan may be extended in certain circumstances. The 
      Mezzanine Loan will be subordinated to the terms of the Senior Loan and 
      be secured by, among other things, a second-priority deed of trust on 
      the Westphalia property.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Drawdown on the Senior Loan and the Mezzanine Loan is subject to the 
      Borrowers meeting certain standard conditions prior to funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further to the Corporation's press release dated May 16, 2013, certain 
      of the proceeds from the Mezzanine Loan will be used to pay any 
      outstanding amounts owing under WWDU's unsecured non-arm's length demand 
      loan of up to $3,500,000 USD.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The project remains on track financially and from a timing perspective. 
      As a result of securing the Senior Loan and the Mezzanine Loan, 
      management anticipates that construction on the project will commence by 
      the end of Q2 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched in March 2012, the Corporation was formed to provide investors 
      with the opportunity to participate in the acquisition and development 
      of the 310-acre Westphalia property located in Prince George's County, 
      Maryland, U.S.A. The Westphalia property is approximately 21.7 km from 
      Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., which is the site of the White House, 
      the National Mall and the Capitol Building.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P. and the 
      development of the property is managed by Walton Development  
      Management (USA), Inc., both of which are members of the Walton Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walton Group of Companies is a multinational group of real estate 
      investment and development companies headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, 
      Canada. As one of North America&#8217;s leading land-based real estate 
      investment and development firms, its expertise is in the research, 
      acquisition, management and development of strategically located land in

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM/BOSTON (Reuters) - Europol said a global effort led by Microsoft Corp to stop one of the world's biggest cybercrime rings has succeeded in wiping out the malicious computer networks that the gang used, known as the Citadel Botnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit, with help from authorities in more than 80 countries, on Wednesday cut off the servers controlling as many as 5 million infected PCs that belonged to the Citadel cyber crime operation, which is believed to have stolen more than $500 million from bank accounts over the past 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically the Citadel bug is now clean," Troels Oerting, head of Europol's European Cybercrime Center, said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The details are still emerging about the individual roles that dozens of countries across Europe and Asia played in bringing down the estimated 1,400 botnets that were part of the Citadel operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Archibald, interim Deputy Director of Britain's National Cyber Crime Unit, said on Thursday that his agency had seized "a number of servers" as part of the effort and was closely working with the FBI on its investigation into Citadel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archibald said forensics experts were examining the servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said on Wednesday that it had collected forensic evidence from two U.S.-based Internet hosting providers, under a federal court order that the company obtained by filing a civil lawsuit against the unknown operators of Citadel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An FBI spokeswoman said she could not immediately say whether the evidence collected had brought investigators any closer to catching the culprits behind Citadel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citadel was used against dozens of financial institutions by stealing passwords with key logging software.

Besides financial crimes, botnets are also used to send spam, distribute computer viruses and attack computer networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in its court filing that it suspects the developer of the Citadel software, who goes by the alias Aquabox, lives in eastern Europe and works with at least 81 "herders," who may be running the bots from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Citadel software is programmed so it will not attack PCs or financial institutions in Ukraine or Russia, likely because the creators operate in those countries and want to avoid provoking law enforcement officials there, Microsoft said.

			About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Alnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics 
      based on RNA interference, or RNAi. The company is leading the 
      translation of RNAi as a new class of innovative medicines with a core 
      focus on RNAi therapeutics toward genetically defined targets for the 
      treatment of serious, life-threatening diseases with limited treatment 
      options for patients and their caregivers. These include: ALN-TTR02, an 
      intravenously delivered RNAi therapeutic targeting transthyretin (TTR) 
      for the treatment of TTR-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) in patients with 
      familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP); ALN-TTRsc, a subcutaneously 
      delivered RNAi therapeutic targeting TTR for the treatment of ATTR in 
      patients with familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC); ALN-AT3, an 
      RNAi therapeutic targeting antithrombin (AT) for the treatment of 
      hemophilia and rare bleeding disorders (RBD); ALN-AS1, an RNAi 
      therapeutic targeting aminolevulinate synthase-1 (ALAS-1) for the 
      treatment of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP); ALN-PCS, an RNAi

      deficiency liver disease, amongst other programs. As part of its 
      &#8220;Alnylam 5x15TM&#8221; strategy, the company expects to have five 
      RNAi therapeutic products for genetically defined diseases in clinical 
      development, including programs in advanced stages, on its own or with a 
      partner by the end of 2015. Alnylam has additional partnered programs in 
      clinical or development stages, including ALN-RSV01 for the treatment of 
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and ALN-VSP for the 
      treatment of liver cancers. The company&#8217;s leadership position on RNAi 
      therapeutics and intellectual property have enabled it to form major 
      alliances with leading companies including Merck, Medtronic, Novartis, 
      Biogen Idec, Roche, Takeda, Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Cubist, Ascletis, 
      Monsanto, Genzyme, and The Medicines Company. In addition, Alnylam holds

			JPMorgan Chase Receives &#8220;2013 Work Life Legacy Military Award&#8221; for 
      Its Efforts to Help Military Veterans Successfully Transition to 
      Civilian Life
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. has received the &#8220;2013 Work Life Legacy Military 
      Award&#8221; by the Families and Work Institute for the second consecutive 
      year for its support of transitioning service members, veterans and 
      their families.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "The Work Life Legacy Award was created to address a critical economic 
      and societal need. Approximately 1,000 service men and women transition 
      out of the military on a daily basis &#8211; and only 100 are getting jobs 
      each day. The purpose of this rigorous award is to increase these 
      numbers as well as highlight best practices in hiring and supporting 
      veterans and their families. Congratulations to JPMorgan Chase for being 
      among the four best-in-class winners," said Ellen Galinsky, President of 
      Families and Work Institute.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Creating and sharing best practices around veteran employment has been a 
      focus of the company over the past two years. JPMorgan Chase is a 
      founding member of the 100,000 Jobs Mission, a coalition of 102 
      companies committed to hiring veterans and sharing best practices. The 
      100,000 Jobs Mission companies have collectively hired 64,628 veterans 
      through the first quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Within its own ranks, JPMorgan Chase has hired more than 5,500 veterans 
      since 2011. The company&#8217;s approach includes a centralized military 
      recruiting team and innovative internal training programs to bridge the 
      knowledge gap between military and civilian cultures. Military 101 
      is a training program for hiring managers and recruiters to educate them 
      about the unique training and experience service members gain through 
      military service. Body Armor to Business Suits is for veteran 
      employees to help them assimilate into corporate culture and make their 
      transition into the company as smooth as possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our nation has been at war for almost twelve years &#8211; and almost three 
      million brave men and women volunteered to serve,&#8221; said Maureen Casey, 
      Managing Director of Military and Veterans Affairs at JPMorgan Chase, at 
      the Families and Work Institute award ceremony on June 3. &#8220;We are 
      committed to our mission of hiring transitioning service members, 
      veterans and military spouses &#8211; and positioning them for long-term 
      success.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through a partnership with Syracuse University, the firm also co-founded 
      the Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF), the first 
      national center in higher education focused on the social, economic, 
      education and policy issues impacting veterans and their families 
      post-service. In addition to publishing leading practices on veteran 
      employment, IVMF offers educational programs for transitioning veterans 
      and families, including the tuition-free Veterans Career Transition 
      Program and Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase was also recognized as a top company for supporting 
      veteran-owned businesses by the National Veteran-Owned Business 
      Association (NaVOBA); ranked second on the 2013 Military Times EDGE 
      &#8220;Best for Vets Employer&#8221; list; recognized as one of G.I. Jobs Top 100 
      Military Friendly Employers&#174; for 2012 and 2013; and included 
      in CivilianJobs.com 2013 Most Valuable Employers (MVE) for Military&#174;.

			About Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Spectrum Pharmaceuticals is a leading biotechnology company focused on 
      acquiring, developing, and commercializing drug products, with a primary 
      focus in oncology and hematology. Spectrum and its affiliates market 
      three oncology drugs &#9472; FUSILEV&#174; (levoleucovorin) for 
      Injection in the U.S.; FOLOTYN&#174; (pralatrexate injection), 
      also marketed in the U.S.; and ZEVALIN&#174; (ibritumomab 
      tiuxetan) Injection for intravenous use, for which the Company has 
      worldwide marketing rights. Spectrum's strong track record in 
      in-licensing and acquiring differentiated drugs, and expertise in 
      clinical development have generated a robust, diversified, and growing 
      pipeline of product candidates in advanced-stage Phase 2 and Phase 3 
      studies. More information on Spectrum is available at www.sppirx.com.

			Forward-looking statement &#8212; This press release may contain 
      forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future 
      performance of Spectrum Pharmaceuticals that involve risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
      These statements are based on management's current beliefs and 
      expectations. These statements include, but are not limited to, 
      statements that relate to our business and its future, including certain 
      company milestones, Spectrum's ability to identify, acquire, develop and 
      commercialize a broad and diverse pipeline of late-stage clinical and 
      commercial products, leveraging the expertise of partners and employees 
      around the world to assist us in the execution of our strategy, and any 
      statements that relate to the intent, belief, plans or expectations of 
      Spectrum or its management, or that are not a statement of historical

      possibility that our existing and new drug candidates may not prove safe 
      or effective, the possibility that our existing and new applications to 
      the FDA and other regulatory agencies may not receive approval in a 
      timely manner or at all, the possibility that our existing and new drug 
      candidates, if approved, may not be more effective, safer or more cost 
      efficient than competing drugs, the possibility that our efforts to 
      acquire or in-license and develop additional drug candidates may fail, 
      our lack of sustained revenue history, our limited marketing experience, 
      our dependence on third parties for clinical trials, manufacturing,

&lt;p&gt;(Adds BoA/Merrill quote, details on impact of IOF tax, paras
9-11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Sujata Rao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 6 (Reuters) - Brazil's move to drop a tax on
foreign buying of domestic debt will allow more of its bonds to
join two JPMorgan indexes, potentially boosting inflows by at
least $2.8 billion, the bank said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The removal of the 6 percent IOF tax, imposed in 2010 to
fend off so-called hot money flows, could bring up to $30
billion into the local bond market, according to some estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real, which had hit four-year lows amid a widespread
selloff in emerging assets, rose 2 percent at one point on
Wednesday after Brazil announced it was removing the tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose bond indices are used by 80 percent of
emerging market investors, said in a note to clients that 11
Brazilian bonds would now become eligible to enter its GBI-EM
Narrow and GBI-EM Narrow Diversified indices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Potential flows for passive investors total approximately
$2.8 billion," the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entry will be staggered over a 10-month period starting Aug.
1, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two indices exclude countries and bonds that impose
any form of tax or capital controls for international investors.
As a result of inclusion, Brazil's weight in the GBI-EM Narrow
will rise to 26 percent, up from 1.13 percent, to become the
biggest component of the index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its share in the GBI-EM Narrow Diversified will rise to 10
percent from 4.7 percent, JPM said, adding that index-eligible
Brazilian bonds would have a market value of $217.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imposition of the IOF in late 2010 has been a
significant deterrent to foreign flows, keeping the share of
foreigners in Brazilian local bonds to around 15 percent
compared to the 30 percent average in emerging domestic debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America/Merrill Lynch put flows to Brazilian local
bonds last year at $11.3 billion, almost a third of 2010 levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This shows the possible magnitude of the increase in
inflows," the bank said in a note to clients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But JPMorgan says the tax move will have no impact on the
composition of its most widely used domestic debt index, the
GBI-EM Global Diversified, which has less stringent entry
criteria. This index assigns Brazil a 10 percent weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan says assets managed against the GBI-EM indices
total over $231 billion but the narrow versions make up only $16
billion or less than 7 percent.

			CytomX 
      Therapeutics, Inc., a biotechnology company developing a new 
      generation of targeted antibody therapeutics, today announced that it 
      has entered into a global strategic collaboration with Pfizer Inc. to 
      develop and commercialize multiple Probody&#8482;-Drug Conjugates (PDCs). 
      CytomX&#8217;s novel Probody 
      Platform brings to the collaboration a proprietary, highly 
      differentiated approach to developing safer and more effective 
      antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). PDCs are engineered to combine 
      cytotoxic agents with masked Probodies that remain inert in healthy 
      tissue but are activated specifically in the tumor microenvironment, 
      opening up new target space for this emerging therapeutic class.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Combining our novel Probody Platform with Pfizer&#8217;s broad capabilities 
      in ADCs marks an important milestone for CytomX and underscores the 
      potential of our Probody Platform to enable new generations of empowered 
      antibodies,&#8221; said Sean McCarthy, D.Phil., chief executive officer of 
      CytomX. &#8220;Our innovative science is driving the development of 
      groundbreaking Probodies and PDCs that have already demonstrated 
      preclinical activity when selectively activated within the tumor 
      microenvironment. We look forward to collaborating with Pfizer with the 
      aim of researching and developing highly differentiated PDC products 
      that have the potential to change the way cancer is treated.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer has exclusive rights to pursue 
      development and commercialization of select PDCs. The companies will 
      work together on preclinical research and Pfizer will be responsible for 
      development and potential commercialization of any selected PDCs. CytomX 
      will be eligible to receive up-front, research reimbursement and 
      preclinical milestone payments totaling approximately $25 million and 
      approximately $610 million in regulatory and sales milestone payments, 
      as well as tiered royalties reaching double digits on potential future 
      sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This partnership is a great example of how Pfizer is seeking to 
      innovate new capabilities in cutting-edge science and technology 
      platforms with the aim of delivering safer, more effective cancer 
      medicines to patients,&#8221; said Robert T. Abraham, senior vice president 
      and chief scientific officer, Pfizer&#8217;s Oncology Research Unit. &#8220;Pfizer&#8217;s 
      investment in CytomX&#8217;s emerging Probody Platform is an important 
      component of our overall strategic focus to advancing the next 
      generation of ADCs and reflects the disruptive potential of this 
      approach.&#8221;

			About The CytomX Probody&#8482; Platform
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CytomX&#8217;s novel Probody&#8482; Platform is enabling the development of a 
      diversified pipeline of next generation empowered antibodies, including 
      Probodies, Probody-Drug Conjugates (PDCs), bispecifics, and other 
      formats, to address previously undruggable targets in cancer, 
      inflammation, and other significant unmet medical needs. Probodies have 
      the potential to expand the therapeutic window for targets where 
      therapeutic intervention is expected to have a significant impact on the 
      disease, but also where normal tissue expression patterns are too 
      widespread to allow for adequate safety margins using conventional 
      antibody approaches. CytomX&#8217;s Probodies are fully recombinant masked 
      antibodies that remain inert in healthy tissue but are activated 
      specifically in the disease microenvironment. Probodies leverage 
      dysregulated protease activity, a hallmark of many diseased states, to 
      locally activate in the disease tissue thereby achieving unprecedented 
      levels of tissue-specific targeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About CytomX
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CytomX Therapeutics is a biotechnology company developing the next 
      generation of highly targeted antibody therapeutics. The company&#8217;s 
      vision is to transform lives with safer, more effective therapies. 
      CytomX&#8217;s Probody&#8482; Platform represents a disruptive approach to 
      discovering and developing empowered antibodies and is enabling the 
      development of a diversified pipeline addressing previously undruggable 
      targets in major unmet medical needs including cancer and inflammation. 
      Probodies are masked antibodies that remain inert in healthy tissue but 
      are activated specifically in the disease microenvironment. This 
      improved selectivity allows CytomX to open a therapeutic window for high 
      potential, but previously inaccessible targets, and to expand the 
      therapeutic index of existing, validated targets, thereby redefining the 
      landscape for therapeutic antibodies. CytomX is led by a seasoned and 
      proven management team and is financed by leading life science investors 
      including Third Rock Ventures, Canaan Partners and the Roche Venture 
      Fund. For more information, please visit www.cytomx.com.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Brazil's move to drop a tax on foreign buying of domestic debt will allow more of its bonds to join two JPMorgan indexes, potentially boosting inflows by at least $2.8 billion, the bank said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The removal of the 6 percent IOF tax, imposed in 2010 to fend off so-called hot money flows, could bring up to $30 billion into the local bond market, according to some estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real, which had hit four-year lows amid a widespread selloff in emerging assets, rose 2 percent at one point on Wednesday after Brazil announced it was removing the tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose bond indices are used by 80 percent of emerging market investors, said in a note to clients that 11 Brazilian bonds would now become eligible to enter its GBI-EM Narrow and GBI-EM Narrow Diversified indices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Potential flows for passive investors total approximately $2.8 billion," the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entry will be staggered over a 10-month period starting August 1, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two indices exclude countries and bonds that impose any form of tax or capital controls for international investors. As a result of inclusion, Brazil's weight in the GBI-EM Narrow will rise to 26 percent, up from 1.13 percent, to become the biggest component of the index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its share in the GBI-EM Narrow Diversified will rise to 10 percent from 4.7 percent, JPM said, adding that index-eligible Brazilian bonds would have a market value of $217.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the tax move will have no impact on the composition of the most widely used domestic debt index, the GBI-EM Global Diversified, which has less stringent entry criteria. This index assigns Brazil a 10 percent weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan says assets managed against the GBI-EM indices total over $231 billion but the narrow versions make up only $16 billion or less than 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sujata Rao; Editing by Susan Fenton)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 6 (Reuters) - Brazil's move to drop a tax on
foreign buying of domestic debt will allow more of its bonds to
join two JPMorgan indexes, potentially boosting inflows by at
least $2.8 billion, the bank said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The removal of the 6 percent IOF tax, imposed in 2010 to
fend off so-called hot money flows, could bring up to $30
billion into the local bond market, according to some estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real, which had hit four-year lows amid a widespread
selloff in emerging assets, rose 2 percent at one point on
Wednesday after Brazil announced it was removing the tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose bond indices are used by 80 percent of
emerging market investors, said in a note to clients that 11
Brazilian bonds would now become eligible to enter its GBI-EM
Narrow and GBI-EM Narrow Diversified indices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Potential flows for passive investors total approximately
$2.8 billion," the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entry will be staggered over a 10-month period starting Aug.
1, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two indices exclude countries and bonds that impose
any form of tax or capital controls for international investors.
As a result of inclusion, Brazil's weight in the GBI-EM Narrow
will rise to 26 percent, up from 1.13 percent, to become the
biggest component of the index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its share in the GBI-EM Narrow Diversified will rise to 10
percent from 4.7 percent, JPM said, adding that index-eligible
Brazilian bonds would have a market value of $217.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the tax move will have no impact on the composition of
the most widely used domestic debt index, the GBI-EM Global
Diversified, which has less stringent entry criteria. This index
assigns Brazil a 10 percent weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan says assets managed against the GBI-EM indices
total over $231 billion but the narrow versions make up only $16
billion or less than 7 percent.

&lt;p&gt;By Jeffrey Goldfarb
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big targets were all the rage this shareholder voting season in the United States. Uppity investors set their sights on industry heavyweights like JPMorgan and Apple. Such headline-grabbing giants overshadowed activist investor Ralph Whitworth&#8217;s success at the far smaller Timken. He persuaded fellow shareholders to approve his ballot campaign to break up the steel and ball bearing manufacturer. It&#8217;s the result that boards should be most carefully watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon fended off JPMorgan shareholders who wanted to split his chairman and chief executive roles. Overall, though, it has been a pretty good year for dissidents. Greenlight Capital boss David Einhorn forced Apple to unbundle a trio of proposals. Elsewhere, through June 5, shareholders had either won votes to secure board seats or successfully negotiated for them in 30 instances, according to FactSet SharkRepellent. There have been no more than 18 such victories at the same point in any of the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitwhorth, however, pulled off the real coup. His proposal to carve up Timken was only the 11th occurrence of its kind on the nine years SharkRepellent has been tracking such issues. JPMorgan, for example, managed to prevent a similar plan from making it into its proxy this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Whitworth, the founder of San Diego-based Relational Investors, is the first to get shareholder approval. Previous efforts by other investors at General Electric and Viacom failed to sway even 5 percent of shareholders. At Timken, just over half of the shares voted last month were in favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company intends to respond within a couple of weeks. It&#8217;s a non-binding vote and strategic initiatives are rarely decided at the ballot. It&#8217;s hard to imagine, though, how the board will be able to ignore completely the will of Timken&#8217;s owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a wake-up call to chairmen and chief executives everywhere. Votes on corporate governance and social and environmental issues are one thing  these constitute nearly all proxy season shareholder proposals. Shareholders proposing value-maximizing steps that call the entire business model into question, though, are far more threatening than losing a title or board members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitworth also didn&#8217;t act alone. He teamed up with the influential California teachers&#8217; pension plan Calstrs, which typically focuses on governance matters. The next wave of barbarians clamoring at the gate won&#8217;t necessarily be the usual suspects  and may not be following a familiar playbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      manufacturing workforce training initiatives across the U.S. Gulf Coast 
      area, impacting more than 15,000 students.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lee College will work with Houston Community College, Lone Star College, 
      San Jacinto Junior College, Alvin Community College, Wharton County 
      Junior College, Brazosport College, Galveston College and College of the 
      Mainland to train students seeking certification or completion of degree 
      programs for instrumentation, electrical, machinist/millwright, welding, 
      pipefitting and other skills and competencies needed by the chemical 
      industry. There are also future plans to include area high schools in 
      the program, which will provide training that aligns with skills and 
      competencies defined by industry, as well as nationally recognized 
      certification programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The chemical industry supports 73,000 high-paying Texas manufacturing 
      jobs and will add more under announced expansion plans by industry, 
      including ExxonMobil,&#8221; said Steve Pryor, president, ExxonMobil Chemical 
      Company. &#8220;Our industry has made Texas the top chemical producing state 
      in the nation, driven in large part by abundant and affordable supplies 
      of natural gas for energy and feedstock. We contribute to a strong 
      economy for Houston and the state.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil is awaiting construction permits to progress plans for a 
      world-class petrochemical expansion in Baytown, Texas. The multi-billion 
      dollar project would include a new ethane cracker and premium product 
      facilities at ExxonMobil&#8217;s integrated complex and capitalize on abundant 
      supplies of American natural gas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If developed, the project is estimated to create about 10,000 
      construction jobs and 350 permanent jobs would be added to the company&#8217;s 
      workforce of more than 6,000 in the Baytown area. The estimated 
      multiplier effect would create another 3,800 jobs in the local community.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At an announcement today at the Greater Houston Partnership, state Sen. 
      Rodney Ellis said the proposed petrochemical expansions will require 
      highly skilled workers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The jobs that will become available in our area over the next decade 
      represent a life-changing opportunity for many in our community,&#8221; said 
      Ellis. &#8220;With the average annual salary in the Texas chemical industry at 
      $86,000, this landmark partnership among our schools, business community 
      and ExxonMobil can help make the dream of economic independence come 
      true for a lot of families.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is great news for workers who will be retrained or want to enter 
      the chemical manufacturing industry in the next few years," said Bob 
      Harvey, president and CEO of the Greater Houston Partnership. &#8220;The 
      ExxonMobil program is a great example of what can be accomplished when 
      employers and educators work together.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Lee College Center for Workforce and Community Development will 
      implement the program to educate qualified students to meet the 
      industry's current and future workforce needs. Marketing and recruiting 
      to technical programs that support petrochemical workforce needs will 
      increase, including targeting military veterans through existing 
      programs at these community colleges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prospective students can enroll at the campus of their choice for 
      classroom instruction, dual-credit courses, internships, certificate 
      programs and two-year degrees. More information is available at www.HoustonNaturalGas.com.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO, June 10 (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs
 said on Monday it recommended exiting short Chicago Board
of Trade soybean crush spread positions based on it latest
market outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a note to clients, Goldman said the current value of the
CBOT July soy crush spread was 3 cents a bushel, versus 47 cents
on April 10, the day it recommended the trade, equating to a 44
cent profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soybean crush spread - buying (or selling) Chicago Board
of Trade soybean futures contracts and simultaneously selling
(or buying) CBOT soymeal and soyoil contracts - is a popular
trade to capture the profit of crushing soybeans into soymeal
and soyoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had recommended in April shorting the spread -
buying soybeans and selling meal and oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also expects the CBOT August crush margin to decline
from its current level of 25 cents a bushel "especially as the
U.S. new-crop soybean harvest will likely be delayed this fall,"
the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported late Monday that
U.S. farmers had planted 71 percent of their intended soy acres
as of Sunday, down from the usual pace of 84 percent by the
first week of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Malathi Nayak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, June 10 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
said on Monday its new Xbox One console would launch in November
at $499 in the United States, higher than most gamers had
expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price is greater than its current console, the Xbox 360,
but it includes a Kinect motion sensor for hands-free game
playing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced the Xbox One in May as the latest move
in its rivalry with Nintendo Co Ltd and Sony Corp
 in the $65 billion a year video game business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a glitzy event at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3)
in Los Angeles, Microsoft said the console will be sold in 21
countries, including the United Kingdom at 429 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement of the pricing was met with some groans
from the audience, mostly hard-core gaming enthusiasts, who had
hoped for a cheaper price tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 8 gigabyte Xbox One is priced higher than Nintendo's new
Wii U 8GB model at $300. Sony may detail pricing of its new
PlayStation 4 at a presentation at E3 later on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also announced exclusive game titles coming to the
new console, including an Xbox edition of 'Minecraft' and a new
'Halo' game, which will be released in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yusuf Mehdi, an executive at Microsoft's interactive
entertainment unit, did not set any sales targets for the new
Xbox, even though its existing console is currently the best
selling in the United States market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have nothing new to announce other than the price," said
Mehdi in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

			Portland General Electric Company Announces Public Offering of Common 
      Stock
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Portland General Electric Company (NYSE: POR) announced today that it 
      plans to commence a registered underwritten public offering of up to 
      11.1 million shares of its common stock. Subject to certain market 
      conditions, these shares will be sold in connection with a forward sale 
      agreement, as discussed below. The underwriters will be granted an 
      option to purchase up to an additional 1.665 million shares of PGE&#8217;s 
      common stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The offering will be made under PGE&#8217;s existing shelf registration 
      statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which 
      became automatically effective on Nov. 18, 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In connection with the offering, PGE expects to enter into a forward 
      sale agreement with an affiliate of Barclays Capital Inc. (&#8220;Barclays&#8221;) 
      under which PGE will agree to issue and sell to Barclays (subject to 
      PGE&#8217;s right to cash settle or net share settle the forward sale 
      agreement) the same number of shares of PGE&#8217;s common stock sold by 
      Barclays or its affiliate to the underwriters for sale in the 
      underwritten public offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The forward sale agreement will provide for settlement on dates to be 
      specified by the company within approximately 24 months after the date 
      of this offering. Upon physical settlement of the forward sale 
      agreement, PGE will issue and deliver to Barclays shares of its common 
      stock in exchange for cash proceeds per share equal to the forward sale 
      price, which will initially be the public offering price, less 
      underwriting discounts and commissions, and will be subject to certain 
      adjustments as provided in the forward sale agreement. PGE may, subject 
      to certain conditions, elect cash settlement or net share settlement for 
      all or a portion of its rights or obligations under the forward sale 
      agreement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PGE intends to use any net proceeds that it receives upon settlement of 
      the forward sale agreement or upon any issuance and sale to the 
      underwriters of shares of its common stock in the offering to repay 
      debt, with the balance to fund capital expenditures and general 
      corporate purposes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Barclays Capital Inc., J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo Securities and BofA 
      Merrill Lynch are acting as joint book-running managers for the 
      offering. Morgan Stanley is acting as co-manager for the offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      In his new role as CRO at Federated Media, Mr. Arkin will drive 
      corporate revenue strategy and oversee the company&#8217;s demand and direct 
      sales teams, as well as its sales marketing teams. Mr. Arkin joins 
      Federated Media as a 20-year veteran of the digital media space. Most 
      recently, Mr. Arkin was President and CRO of 33Across, where he led the 
      sales and operations departments, growing the company&#8217;s client roster to 
      include 300 of the top Fortune 500 companies. Prior to that, Mr. Arkin

      &#8220;Matt and Walter will be strong leaders in their new roles at FMP 
      because they truly believe in our mission - to champion an ecosystem 
      where independent and influential publishers thrive,&#8221; said John 
      Battelle, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Federated Media Publishing. 
      &#8220;Using our publisher platform, brands and agencies can easily and 
      efficiently engage with our ecosystem in whatever way they choose, 
      depending on their specific marketing needs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;There&#8217;s a huge secular shift in the market where brands are realizing 
      that their future lies in the combination of native, content-driven 
      marketing alongside programmatic, scaled distribution,&#8221; said Matt Arkin, 
      CRO of Federated Media Publishing. &#8220;FMP is the only company with a 
      leadership position in both premium and programmatic, and I&#8217;m excited to 
      take this differentiation to market so that brands and agencies can 
      realize the true value that we have to offer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Over the past few years we&#8217;ve been able to exponentially scale our 
      network by serving as a true partner to publishers,&#8221; said Walter Knapp, 
      COO of Federated Media Publishing. &#8220;Moving forward, we will continue to 
      bring new products and services to market that help high-quality, 
      independent publishers grow their audience and better monetize their

&lt;p&gt;June 10 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Co Inc and
other power traders that benefited from a flaw in the California
electricity market rules from 2009 through 2011 will need to
reimburse $52 million in excess profits, U.S. regulators said
last week.
    The ruling from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) marks a victory for the Californian grid operator, and
comes as JPMorgan may face more serious charges related to power
market manipulation in California and Michigan.
    The California Independent System Operator (ISO), which
operates the state's power system, changed its market rules in
2011 to cut off the loophole that the grid operator said the
bank used to disrupt the power market.
        
JPMORGAN TIMELINE
        
June 2013 - FERC approves California ISO request to force power
sellers, including JPMorgan, to reimburse $16.7 million to
California electricity distributors for disruptive bidding
practices between April 2009 and March 2011. FERC also
signed-off on the $35.3 million reimbursement the ISO already
forced the sellers to pay in April 2011.

May 2013 - JPMorgan reduces presence in California power market,
selling the right to market electricity from three power plants.
 
    
May 2013 - JPMorgan tells shareholders FERC may take action
against bank for certain power market bidding activities.
 
    
May 2013 - An internal FERC document leaked to the New York
Times says the regulator may charge JPMorgan with power market
manipulation. The document also says JPMorgan's commodities
chief, Blythe Masters, may have made "false and misleading
statements," to the regulator under oath. 
    
April 2013 - JPMorgan six-month ban on selling power at market
based rates starts.
        
Jan 2013 - FERC appeals magistrate's November 2012 ruling
blocking FERC from seeing JPMorgan emails.
    
Nov 2012 - Federal magistrate rules that JPMorgan does not need
to hand over emails FERC sought in July 2012 as part of the
regulator's power market manipulation investigation.
        
Nov 2012 - FERC suspends JPMorgan's authority to sell power at
market based rates for six months for making factual
misrepresentations during an investigation into market
manipulation. The ban is to start in April 2013.  
 
        
Sep 2012 - FERC directs JPMorgan to show why regulators should
not suspend its authority to sell power at market rates, after
it says the bank submitted misleading information to the
Commission during the market manipulation investigation.
 
    
July 2012 - FERC subpoenas JPMorgan in federal court to provide
emails as part of its investigation into market manipulation in
California and the Midwest. This is when JPMorgan is publicly
named as the party that allegedly manipulated the California
market. 
    
June 2012 - California ISO asks FERC to approve its plan to
force power sellers to reimburse money earned from exploitive
bidding practices to electricity distributors from April 2009 to
March 2011. The ISO had already forced power sellers to
reimburse $35.3 million in April 2011 for the period between
August 2010 and March 2011. 
        
Feb-June 2012 - California ISO imposes a non-public $486,000
penalty against JPMorgan in February for failing to submit all
information the grid operator sought as part of its
investigation. JPMorgan appeals the penalty in March and FERC in
April rejected the bank's appeal.
    JPMorgan filed a complaint with FERC in May that the fine
was unjust, but withdrew its complaint in June after the FERC
Office of Enforcement said the bank and its lawyers were not
adequately responding to numerous requests for information from
the ISO and FERC.
    
May 2011 - FERC approves California ISO's request to fix flaw in
the bidding mechanism, effective March 26, 2011. 
    
April 2011 - California ISO forces power sellers to reimburse
$35.3 million to electricity distributors from trades executed
from August 2010 to March 2011 due to effect of exploitive
bidding practices. 
            
March 2011 - California ISO informs JPMorgan the grid operator
reviewed the bank's bidding activities and intends to refer the
matter to the FERC Office of Enforcement, which was the start of
FERC's non-public investigation.
    
March 2011 - California ISO files with FERC to fix a loophole in
the power market bidding mechanism after a party's behavior
"aggravated the market impact of the flaw." That party was later
identified as JPMorgan.
             
2005 - FERC authorizes JPMorgan to sell power at market based
rates.

damage claims of 460 million euros ($608.1 million) from
flooding in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic, insurance
analysts at JP Morgan have estimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We estimate that Allianz's bill for the floods in Germany
is 350 million euros, just above the 330 million cost for
Germany in 2002, and 460 million is the likely total cost vs 710
million in 2002, including 110 million for Czech and Austria,"
JP Morgan analyst Michael Huttner wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This means that Allianz is still on track we believe for
our forecast 94.0 percent full year combined ratio," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combined ratio measures administrative costs and claims
as a percentage of premiums, so a ratio below 100 percent means
an insurer is making a profit on its core insurance business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Allianz spokeswoman declined to comment on the figure,
saying it was too early for damage estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is raining again and we are still trying to get into the
affected areas," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other German insurers have said this month's events
look likely to match or exceed the costs of the big floods that
hit the region in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinsurer Munich Re on Monday said it would
likely take "weeks" to arrive at a reliable figure on the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7564 euros)

&lt;p&gt;Strategists at Goldman Sachs back going 'long' on Britain's FTSE 100
 equity index while going 'short' on Switzerland's SMI equity
index, arguing that the FTSE's greater component of cyclical stocks should help
it outperform in an improving economic environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"More cyclical or more global-growth exposed markets such as the DAX
 or FTSE 100 should do better than the SMI, which is more dominated by
consumer staples and defensives and on a high multiple," they write in a
research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We currently recommend being long FTSE 100 vs short SMI," they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Defensive' stocks - those seen as most resilient to any downturn in the
global economy - such as healthcare groups Roche and food company
Nestle - dominate much of the Swiss index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, more 'risk-on' and cyclical sectors such as financials and miners -
seen as more sensitive to swings in the economic cycle and which underperform
falling markets but outperform when markets rise - carry more weight on the FTSE
100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman strategists write that uncertainty over the global economy has
driven up valuations on the more defensive parts of the equity market, but signs
of less stress in the euro zone's debt crisis may now boost more cyclical
sectors, at the expense of 'safe haven' defensive stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The risk premium...has started to come down as sovereign risks in Europe
have diminished and as market participants have started to anticipate a turn in
the cycle," they write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect a further fall in the risk premium along with improved economic
growth to reduce investor preference for these 'safe haven' stocks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FTSE 100 has risen by around 9 percent since the start of 2013, while
the Swiss SMI index has climbed 15 percent, meaning some traders feel the Swiss
market has less room for further gains than the FTSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters messaging rm://sudip.kargupta.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net&lt;/p&gt;

      Formally named the Arctic Research and Design Center for Continental 
      Shelf Development, the ARC will provide the Rosneft and ExxonMobil joint 
      ventures a full range of research, development and technical services, 
      with near-term focus on the Kara Sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Initial activities include work in the areas of safety and environmental 
      protection; ice, metocean and geotechnical surveys; sea ice management; 
      development of design criteria; and the evaluation and design of 
      development concepts. The ARC will build on current best practices of 
      Rosneft and ExxonMobil to develop technologies that are environmentally 
      safe, and more effective and efficient.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rosneft President and Chairman of the Management Board Igor Sechin said, 
      &#8220;Projects in the framework of our strategic partnership with ExxonMobil 
      pose a number of challenges. The ARC will be a platform for development 
      of the most up-to-date and efficient technologies aimed at project

      with Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and other executives from both companies 
      in attendance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the joint work between the companies, Rosneft and ExxonMobil 
      management attended an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in 
      Washington. The &#8216;Diaghilev 
      and the Ballets Russes, 1909&#8211;1929: When Art Danced with Music&#8217; 
      exhibition was organized in collaboration with the Victoria and Albert

      Treatment with IBM Watson
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Maine Center For Cancer Medicine Joins Anthem Blue Cross and Blue 
      Shield in Maine to Explore Breakthroughs&#160;in Oncology&#160;Treatment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      More than 1.6 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the U.S. 
      this year alone, according the American Cancer Society. It is estimated 
      that new clinical research and medical information doubles every five 
      years, and nowhere is this knowledge advancing more quickly than in the 
      complex area of cancer care.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Maine Center for Cancer Medicine (MCCM) is exploring the 
      capabilities of Interactive 
      Care Insights for Oncology, a new product developed by Anthem&#8217;s 
      parent company, IBM and Memorial Sloan Kettering that utilizes IBM&#8217;s 
      Watson technology and Memorial Sloan-Kettering&#8217;s clinical expertise.&#160;The 
      Watson capability, available through the cloud or on premise, is 
      expected to assist medical professionals and researchers by helping to 
      identify individualized treatment options for patients with cancer, 
      starting with lung cancer. The solution provides users with a detailed 
      record of the data and information used to reach the treatment options. 
      MCCM will tap into IBM Watson's ability to understand the nuances of 
      human language, process questions akin to the way people think, and 
      quickly cull through vast amounts of Big Data for relevant, 
      evidence-based answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interactive Care Insights for Oncology will bring real-time decision 
      support to oncologists by using natural language processing capabilities 
      to pull in all the medical information available about a specific 
      patient, synthesize it, and then compare it with clinical evidence and 
      cancer treatment guidelines, providing a more patient-specific and 
      actionable clinical interpretation. Ultimately, the Watson-powered 
      solution&#160;could help physicians to select the most effective treatment 
      option while streamlining health plan approvals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are honored to have been asked to partner with IBM and Anthem&#8217;s 
      parent company in bringing the IBM Watson technology to health care in 
      Maine,&#8221; said Tracey Weisberg, M.D., MCCM. &#8220;The Watson technology, along 
      with Memorial Sloan-Kettering&#8217;s clinical expertise will bring more 
      relevant oncologic information to the physician and patient, making 
      treatment planning more comprehensive.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "IBM's work with MCCM and Anthem's parent&#160;is a great example of how 
      technology and evidence based medicine can transform the way in which 
      health care is practiced," said Manoj Saxena, IBM General Manager, 
      Watson Solutions. "These breakthrough capabilities bring forward the 
      first in a series of Watson-based technologies, which exemplifies the 
      value of applying big data and analytics and cognitive computing to 
      tackle the industry&#8217;s most pressing challenges."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MCCM is providing Anthem&#8217;s parent company and Memorial Sloan-Kettering 
      with valuable feedback that will shape the&#160;next version of the&#160;product. 
      Oncologists at MCCM will focus their attention on&#160;Watson's unique 
      capabilities, such as
			how Watson presents information to the 
      physician, and if the data is displayed in an actionable&#160;way and in 
      logical order. Using these insights, the MCCM oncologists&#160;will recommend 
      features that will ultimately improve the usability of the product.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our goal is to provide oncologists tools to help select the most 
      effective treatment options for their patients and we&#8217;re excited to work 
      with MCCM in this endeavor,&#8221; said Dan Corcoran, president and general 
      manager, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Maine. &#8220;Their perspective 
      is essential in ensuring the product utilizing IBM&#8217;s Watson technology 
      and Memorial Sloan-Kettering&#8217;s clinical expertise will benefit 
      physicians and ultimately, their patients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 9,000 new cancer cases 
      were diagnosed in Maine 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are also dedicated to innovation and directly apply such treatments, 
      technologies and support models to the patient care experience whenever 
      appropriate,&#8221; noted Dr. Weisberg. &#8220;Our collaboration with Anthem to test 
      this new product developed by Anthem&#8217;s parent company, Memorial Sloan 
      Kettering and IBM builds on our belief that innovation can truly 
      transform health care.&#8221;

			Watson: Then and Now
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IBM Watson system gained fame by beating human contestants on the 
      television quiz show Jeopardy! almost two years ago. Since that time, 
      Watson has evolved from a first-of-a-kind status, to a commercial 
      cognitive computing system gaining a 240 percent improvement in system 
      performance, and a reduction in the system&#8217;s physical requirements by 75 
      percent and can now be run on a single Power 750 server. The 
      transformational technology, named after IBM founder Thomas J. Watson, 
      was developed in IBM&#8217;s Research Labs. Using advances in natural language 
      processing and analytics, the Watson technology can process information 
      similar to the way people think, representing a significant shift in the 
      ability for organizations to quickly analyze, understand and respond to 
      vast amounts of Big Data. The ability to use Watson to answer complex 
      questions posed in natural language with speed, accuracy and confidence 
      has enormous potential to improve decision making across a variety of 
      industries from health care, to retail, telecommunications and financial 
      services.For more information on IBM Watson, please visit www.ibmwatson.com

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, June 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. ethanol mandate
could boost domestic gasoline prices as refiners get around the
requirement by exporting more gasoline, the CEO of oil major
Chevron Corp said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

E15, gasoline containing a higher blend of ethanol, for cars
made since the 2001 model year - or about two-thirds of the
vehicles currently on the road in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethanol backers say E15 is a good way for refiners to meet
the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires blenders to
mix more ethanol, made mostly from corn, into gasoline each
year. The RFS mandate will level off in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many refiners say E15 adds to their costs, and cite a
AAA automobile club report from November that said only about 12
million of 240 million cars on U.S. roads have warranties that
would cover their engines burning higher blends of ethanol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you were me, would you sell a product that engine
manufacturers won't certify?" John Watson, the head of Chevron,
one of the country's largest refiners, said during a talk at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies on Tuesday. "I'm
not going to do that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson said refiners will likely export more gasoline to get
around the RFS, which could make gasoline more scarce and raise
prices for U.S. consumers. He did not say when prices might rise
or by how much. The national average for regular retail gasoline
on Tuesday was more than $3.63 a gallon, about 9 cents higher
than the same time last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States fuel market is close to the so-called
"blend wall," or the point where the RFS requires more use of
ethanol than can be blended into the fuel supply at the most
common level of 10 percent ethanol per gallon of gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has helped push up prices for renewable energy credits
known as RINs, which refiners can buy to meet their RFS
requirements on gasoline they sell domestically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refiners on the East Coast could also limit their imports of
gasoline from Europe if RINs prices are too high, which could be
another factor in reducing U.S. fuel supplies, said Charles
Drevna, the head of the industry group American Fuel and
Petrochemical Manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson added that Chevron is long on RINs, so exporting
gasoline is not a strategy for his company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices for RINs hit about $1.04 a gallon in March, up from
only a few cents four months earlier, and are currently near 90
cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Bius, the head of the ethanol industry group Growth
Energy, said on Tuesday that many oil companies "have done
everything in their power to prevent the blending and sale of
renewable fuels," which prevents market competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to
lower RFS targets or waive them completely. It is expected to
release targets for 2013 and 2014 this summer, an EPA official
told lawmakers earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many analysts expect the EPA to reaffirm its earlier 2013
target, but possibly lower the 2014 standard announced earlier
this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry and Peter Rudegeair&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co Chief
Executive Jamie Dimon, who won a strong vote of confidence from
shareholders last month, on Tuesday defended the disclosures the
bank made last year about its unfolding London Whale derivatives
loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did everything that we thought was the right thing to
do," Dimon said in response to a question about the episode at
an investor conference in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon repeated his earlier apologies for the loss that he
had mistakenly called a "tempest in a teapot" one month before
the company disclosed in May 2012 that it had lost more then $2
billion on the trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dimon forcefully added that bank officials had properly
described the situation as they knew it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no hiding. There was no lying," Dimon said,

Securities and Exchange Commission last year began probes into
the loss but have not brought any public actions against the
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon consolidated his power as both chairman and CEO of the
biggest bank in the United States on May 21 when two-thirds of
shareholders voted against a proposal at the company's annual
meeting that called for him to be stripped of one of his two
titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of the measure had argued that the London Whale
loss showed that Dimon and other bank executives needed more
objective oversight from a board of directors with an
independent chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many shareholders who voted against the measure were
concerned that Dimon might leave and that JPMorgan stock would
fall if he lost that vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon spoke rapidly for more than three minutes about the
trading debacle, prompting nervous laughter from the audience
when he finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a wide range of questions at the conference, which
was hosted by Morgan Stanley and broadcast online, Dimon
also said the U.S. economy and American consumers were improving

in Manhattan federal court seeking to dismiss a lawsuit accusing
the bank of deceiving shareholders about Bruno Iksil - the
JPMorgan trader nicknamed the London Whale for the size of his
positions - and the loss that ultimately topped $6.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said the plaintiffs in the shareholder lawsuit had
failed to make a case that Dimon and his lieutenants intended to

&lt;p&gt;* No plans to bid for Algerian blocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* To bid with Royal Dutch Shell offshore Lebanon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Drilling first well for shale gas with Shell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nidhi Verma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI, June 11 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is
in talks with Turkey's TPAO to buy a stake in a block in the
Black Sea, and the country is on the hunt for shale gas in its
own territory, the acting head of the state-owned energy company
said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ExxonMobil wants to be in the Black Sea with us, in deep
offshore," TPAO's acting president and chief executive, Besim
Sisman, told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's on the Ukraine and Romania side," he added, without
giving further details on the talks between Turkey's state owned
energy company and Exxon, the world's largest publicly-traded
oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon spokesman said the company did not comment on
commercial discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey, keen to reduce its dependence on imports, has
stepped up exploration efforts in the Black Sea and
Mediterranean in cooperation with foreign companies. Turkey has
yet to find any oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its domestic production is in decline and covered only about
7 percent of demand in 2012, according to the International
Energy Agency (IEA). Of its hefty imports, about 39 percent came
from Iran in 2012 but sanctions have resulted in sharp cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXPLORING MORE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country is also seeking exploration and production
assets elsewhere in the region and is just starting to look for
shale gas on its own territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sisman said TPAO would not bid for blocks in Algeria, a turn
around from January when Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said TPAO
planned to take part in upcoming Algerian oil exploration
tenders. He did not give a reason for the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Iraq, "we have four projects and that is enough for us,"
Sisman said, adding that "it is not our business to go to the
north side of Iraq."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey is hoping to work on exploration and production in
northern Iraq through commercial contracts with Russian and U.S.
companies, Yildiz told Reuters last month, after Turkey's prime
minister said that a Turkish company had a contract in place
with Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country has increasingly courted Iraqi Kurdistan over
oil and gas, upsetting the central government in Baghdad which
says it alone has authority to control oil exports from Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sisman said TPAO would join the latest bidding round for
blocks offshore in Lebanon with Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
which it already partners with in the Mediterranean and in shale
exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TPAO is drilling a first well for shale gas with Shell
currently, Sisman said, and is talking to other companies for
further work in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Small and big, they are coming to Turkey ... but we want to
choose only strong companies" with experience of fracking, the
process used to extract oil and gas from shale rocks, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sisman said TPAO is scouting for oil assets in Africa as it
wants to take more risk to generate higher returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Sony Corp on Monday priced its latest PlayStation 4 console $100 lower than the new Xbox One by rival Microsoft Corp as competition for gamers' pockets intensifies ahead of the year-end holidays and gift-giving season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony said it would sell the latest PlayStation model for $399 late in the year shortly after Microsoft announced a $499 price tag for its first new Xbox in eight years and said it would go on sale in the United States in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony also drew cheers from the audience at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles when it said the PS4 would run second-hand games and did not require an always-on Internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had earlier elicited groans from gamers when it announced restrictions on used games for the Xbox One and said players had to log onto the Internet for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The PlayStation 4 won't impose any new restrictions on used games," said Jack Tretton, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America as the audience whistled and applauded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Sony hope the consoles will attract new fans and retain users who are increasingly playing games on smartphones and other mobile devices, gradually diminishing the $66 billion video game business. Both companies are also offering more entertainment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox 360 is currently the best-selling gaming console in the United States, but global sales are almost on par with the PlayStation 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Xbox and PlayStation are both pricier than the $300 Wii U which Nintendo Co Ltd launched late last year but which has sold poorly, partly due to a dearth of new gaming titles. Nintendo is expected to announce new games for the device at the E3 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony did not give details about original programming content for the PS4 but said new game titles would include Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag by Ubisoft and Kingdom Hearts III by Disney Interactive Studios and Square Enix Holdings Co Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a very compelling price... given the entertainment PS4 will provide to gamers," Sony Computer Entertainment President and CEO Andrew House told the E3 event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox One is costlier than the current Xbox 360 and includes a Kinect motion sensor for hands-free game playing. Microsoft also announced several exclusive game titles, including a rendition of 'Minecraft' and a new installment in the popular 'Halo' franchise, which will be released in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device will go on sale in 21 countries, including Britain, before the year-end holidays, the company said. Yusuf Mehdi, an executive at Microsoft's interactive entertainment unit, did not set any sales targets for the new Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Bill Rigby; Editing by Gary Hill and Miral Fahmy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - When Walt Disney Co introduced its latest video game, Infinity, to the gaming faithful this week at the annual E3 gaming conference, it rented a Los Angeles movie theater to show 30-minute clips of upcoming films and hosted a party with the glitz it usually reserves for its blockbuster movie wannabes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shows just how much the company is counting on Infinity - whose players can for the first time mix together characters from Disney's different franchises - to help turn around one part of the media giant that stubbornly refuses to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it was created in 2008, Disney's interactive division, which houses its video game and online properties, has chalked up losses in 13 of its 14 quarters, compiling $1.1 billion in total operating losses in that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The division will likely not turn a profit this fiscal year ending September 30 as a result of the company delaying Infinity by two months, Disney CEO Bob Iger told analysts on an earnings call in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe in Infinity," Iger said during the call. "We think it will be a great product and it's going to drive profitability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took more than three years and around 200 people to create Infinity, according to John Blackburn, who heads Avalanche Software, the Disney-owned studio that created the game. Disney would not say how much it spent to create the game, which is scheduled for release on August 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the game, players can pit characters from Disney or Pixar movies against each other, such as a race between the super-charged racecar Lighting McQueen from "Cars" and quick-footed 10-year old superhero Dash from "The Incredibles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is Disney's answer to Activision Blizzard's Skylanders games, which lets players collect action figures that they can send on virtual action-adventure quests in a magical world called Skylands. The game was one of 2012's top-selling games with more than $1 billion worldwide in retail sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch will test Disney's vaunted marketing troops, who can crank out hit movies and flashy theme park rides but have yet to work their magic to create many gaming hits. One reason is that most of its characters are more popular with girls than boys, who make up the majority of game players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney also invested heavily in console games, only to see sales of traditional boxed games decline and consumers flock instead to games played on cell phones or social networks like Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To revamp the interactive unit, Iger in 2010 tapped former Yahoo Inc executive James Pitaro and John Pleasants, head of the social games maker Playdom that Disney had acquired for $563 million, as co-presidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitaro and Pleasants cut costs through layoffs, redesigned the Disney.com website, and encouraged their creators to develop new characters. They had a minor hit with an alligator named Swampy that stars in the mobile game "Where's My Water?" that has been downloaded more than 200 million times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pleasants jettisoned many of the console projects. He told the interactive team that a narrow focus on two to three core titles would be better than working on 75 or more titles, according to Blackburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have really tipped the scales in a very different way," Pleasants said in an interview, "trying to get our development dollars and our energy focused on where the river is running fastest and where the growth is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit's losses narrowed to $54 million last quarter, about half of where they were when Pleasants and Pitaro started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry experts mostly approve of Disney's strategy. Targeting the company's mainstay market of 6- to 12-year-olds allows it to take advantage of the built-in fan base for its characters and to promote them with its movies, TV shows and theme park rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney will release two movies from which it gets game characters - "Monsters University" on June 21 and "The Lone Ranger" on July 3 - in the months before the Infinity launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does, though, need to fend off Activision, the dominant force in the same video game world in which Infinity hopes to compete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You never want to discount the ability of Disney to sell stuff branded with their characters," said Cowen &amp; Co analyst Doug Creutz, "but I do think it will be an uphill climb."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lisa Richwine and; Malathi Nayak; Edited by Ronald Grover and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Row between Lisbon and JP Morgan involved threats of
lawsuits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Lisbon renegotiating up to 3 billion euros in swap deals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Privatisation part of sell-offs dictated by bailout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LISBON, June 11 (Reuters) - Portugal appointed JP Morgan as
financial advisers in the planned privatisation of the national
postal service, in a move that bodes well for resolving
cash-strapped Lisbon's row with the U.S. bank over potentially
costly hedging contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State holding company Parpublica, which owns the CTT postal
service, said on Tuesday it had picked JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co
 and state-owned bank CGD after analysing various
proposals to advise on the sell-off promised by Lisbon to its
international lenders under the terms of an EU/IMF bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choice of JP Morgan is the first sign of reconciliation
between Lisbon and the U.S. investment bank after a tussle over
derivatives contracts that Lisbon described as "toxic" that the
bank sold to Portuguese state-owned companies by various banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisbon is trying to stem potential losses of up to 3 billion
euros from the swap contracts sold to companies such as the
Lisbon and Porto Metros. The government and JP Morgan had each
threatened legal action over the matter but eventually resumed
talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some local media said earlier that the government had been
awaiting the outcome of the swaps renegotiation before advancing
with the CTT sell-off and that JP Morgan's application for the
advisory role hinged on progress in the talks. The Expresso
weekly said a tentative deal on swaps was reached last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finance ministry, Parpublica and JP Morgan officials all
declined to comment on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The privatisation is part of a wider state property sell-off
 by Lisbon ordered under the country's 78 billion euro EU/IMF
bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike fellow bailed-out nation Greece that earlier on
Tuesday said it would ask lenders to lower its asset sales goals
after failing to sell natural gas firm DEPA, Portugal has
already shot past its end-2013 target to raise 5.5 billion
euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After pocketing over 6.4 billion euros from selling stakes
in airport operator ANA, power firms EDP and REN
, this year it hopes to sell CTT, the cargo unit of
Comboios de Portugal railway company, CGD's insurance arm, and
to relaunch the privatisation of airline TAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI, June 11 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil is in
talks with TPAO to buy a stake in a block in the Black Sea, the
acting head of the Turkish state-owned energy company told
Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"ExxonMobil wants to be in the Black Sea with us, in deep
offshore," TPAO's acting president and chief executive, Besim
Sisman, said on the sidelines of a conference here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's on the Ukraine and Romania side," he added, without
giving further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey has stepped up exploration efforts in the Black Sea
and Mediterranean in cooperation with foreign companies as it
tries to reduce its import dependence. In its exploration work
in the Black Sea, Turkey has yet to find any oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sisman said TPAO would not bid for blocks in Algeria and
added that in Iraq, "we have four projects and that is enough
for us".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said TPAO would join the latest bidding round for blocks
offshore in Lebanon with Royal Dutch Shell, which it
already partners with in the Mediterranean and in shale
exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

      Ever since college-bound Mike Wazowski (voice of Billy Crystal) was a 
      little monster, he has dreamed of becoming a Scarer&#8212;and he knows better 
      than anyone that the best Scarers come from Monsters University (MU). 
      But during his first semester at MU, Mike&#8217;s plans are derailed when he 
      crosses paths with hotshot James P. Sullivan, &#8220;Sulley&#8221; (voice of John 
      Goodman), a natural-born Scarer. The pair&#8217;s out-of-control competitive 
      spirit gets them both kicked out of the University&#8217;s elite Scare 
      Program. To make matters worse, they realize they will have to work 
      together, along with an odd bunch of misfit monsters, if they ever hope 
      to make things right. Screaming with laughter and oozing with heart, 
      Disney&#8226;Pixar&#8217;s &#8220;Monsters University&#8221; is directed&#160;by Dan Scanlon (&#8220;Cars,&#8221; 
      &#8220;Mater and the Ghostlight,&#8221; &#8220;Tracy&#8221;), produced by&#160;Kori Rae&#160;(&#8220;Up,&#8221; &#8220;The 
      Incredibles,&#8221; &#8220;Monsters, Inc.&#8221;) and features music from future Rock and 
      Roll Hall of Fame inductee and award-winning composer Randy Newman

			Lavante Inc. Announces New CEO, Sam Klepper, Former Executive with 
      Intuit, Microsoft, and eMeter
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lavante, the leading provider of cloud-based recovery auditing and 
      supplier information management (SIM) software for Fortune 1000 
      companies, announced today that Sam Klepper has joined as CEO. Klepper 
      has an exceptional track record of creating and commercializing 
      game-changing software products that drive growth and customer success 
      at tech companies including Intuit, Microsoft and eMeter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Lavante has an enormous market opportunity,&#8221; said Sam Klepper. &#8220;The 
      founders and management team have redefined the supplier information 
      management space and in the process created a Who&#8217;s Who list of 
      corporate customers. Lavante SIM is the first product to target the 
      finance team and focus on the supplier organization rather than the 
      transaction. The result is a new way to easily onboard, maintain and 
      communicate with vast supplier communities, driving down operational 
      costs, enhancing compliance and recovering credits.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Sam&#8217;s arrival signals that Lavante is ready to move to the next level 
      in the supplier information management space,&#8221; said Andreas Weiskam, 
      Managing Director of SAP Ventures, an investor since 2010. &#8220;Lavante has 
      the product, momentum and leadership to capture significant share in the 
      market.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With Klepper&#8217;s arrival, founder and former CEO, Joe Flynn, a veteran of 
      the supply chain and finance domains, becomes Chief Strategy Officer and 
      will work closely with customers and partners. &#8220;Sam is the perfect 
      catalyst to accelerate the momentum we are already enjoying at Lavante,&#8221; 
      Flynn said. &#8220;We look forward to a bright future under his leadership.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prior to joining Lavante, Klepper was GM and then interim CEO at smart 
      grid software leader, eMeter, and General Manager at Microsoft for a 
      $500m division of MSN. He also was an early employee of Intuit and 
      co-invented the QuickBooks product line. Klepper has a BA from 
      Harvard University and an MBA from Harvard Business School.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Klepper joins Lavante during an active quarter that has yielded new 
      customers across multiple industry segments as well as new product 
      functionality across both Recovery and SIM product lines. The company 
      delivered advanced reporting capabilities earlier this month to give 
      customers additional insights into their supplier population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Blocks hold around 200 million barrels of oil - sources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Chevron the latest oil major to sell Nigerian assets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Oil theft, delayed energy law create uncertainty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Joe Brock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, June 11 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm Chevron 
is selling its stake in two Nigerian shallow water oil blocks,
the company said on Tuesday, the latest oil major seeking to
dispose of assets in Africa's biggest oil producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two blocks OML 83 and OML 85 hold an estimated 200
million barrels of oil and an unknown amount of natural gas but
there has been no production yet, two industry sources told
Reuters. Chevron did not give details of reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As part of a continuous process of portfolio evaluation and
business prioritisation, Chevron Nigeria Limited ... has
put forward its interests in two oil mining leases for auction,"
a company spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The assets are located in the shallow waters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron owns a 40 percent stake in 13 shallow water blocks
with Nigeria's state oil firm NNPC and also has several deep
offshore assets. Its 2012 net daily production in Nigeria
averaged 238,000 barrels of crude oil and 165 million cubic feet
of natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several oil majors have sold assets onshore or in the
shallow waters of the Niger Delta over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria suffers from widespread oil theft and at times
difficult relationships with local communities onshore, driving
up the costs of operating there, while a long-delayed energy
bill is stuck in parliament, adding to industry uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joint owners Royal Dutch Shell, Italy's Eni
 and France's Total have sold several blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buyers of these included UK-listed firms Heritage Oil
 and Eland Oil. Chinese-owned Addax has said it
is interested in buying more Nigerian assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's blocks are at the exploratory stage, unlike
Shell's already producing fields, which will make valuations
less straightforward, one banking source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. firm ConocoPhillips is also planning to sell
its Nigerian businesses to Oando Energy for about $1.79
billion, the company said in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil majors, which are looking more towards deepwater
offshore, say they can't invest in large new projects until the
oil bill is passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, June 11 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm Chevron 
is selling its stake in Nigerian shallow water oil blocks OML 83
and OML 85, the company said on Tuesday, the latest oil major
seeking to sell assets in Africa's biggest oil producer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As part of a continuous process of portfolio evaluation and
business prioritisation, Chevron Nigeria Limited ... has
put forward its interests in two oil mining leases for auction,"
a company spokesman said by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron owns a 40 percent stake in the blocks with Nigeria's
state oil firm NNPC having the other 60 percent. The company did
not say what oil and gas reserves the blocks held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Today, Koos Timmermans, Vice-Chairman of ING Bank, will address the Goldman Sachs Seventeenth Annual European Financials Conference in Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In his presentation, Mr Timmermans will demonstrate how ING Bank's balance sheet optimisation programme is ahead of plan. After taking major strides in 2012 to optimise the balance sheet and de-risk the investment portfolio, ING Bank is now comfortably meeting its capital, funding and liquidity targets, creating room to selectively grow the loan book and to focus on improvement of the Net Interest Margin.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Mr Timmermans will show how ING Bank's conservative risk approach has led to a relatively low risk profile despite the uptick in risk costs due to the economic downturn. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Elaborating on the Bank's progress on reaching its long-term targets as laid down in the Ambition 2015 programme, Mr Timmermans will reiterate how the Bank is further optimising its cost structure ensuring that the cost/income target of 50-53% will be reached by 2015. He will conclude his presentation by showing how ING Bank is on track to reach the Return on Equity target of 10-13% by the same year.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Today's presentation "Towards Ambition 2015" by Koos Timmermans can be viewed/downloaded via ING's corporate website or SlideShare.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* PS4 priced $100 lower than Xbox One&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* PS4 will run second-hand games, doesnt need always-on
Internet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft, Sony facing competition from mobile device
gaming&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* New consoles to go on sale before Christmas, New Year
holidays&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Malathi Nayak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, June 10 (Reuters) - Sony Corp on
Monday priced its latest PlayStation 4 console $100 lower than
the new Xbox One by rival Microsoft Corp as competition
for gamers' pockets intensifies ahead of the year-end holidays
and gift-giving season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony said it would sell the latest PlayStation model for
$399 late in the year shortly after Microsoft announced a $499
price tag for its first new Xbox in eight years and said it
would go on sale in the United States in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony also drew cheers from the audience at the Electronic
Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles when it said the PS4
would run second-hand games and did not require an always-on
Internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had earlier elicited groans from gamers when it
announced restrictions on used games for the Xbox One and said
players had to log onto the Internet for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The PlayStation 4 won't impose any new restrictions on used
games," said Jack Tretton, president and CEO of Sony Computer
Entertainment America as the audience whistled and applauded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Sony hope the consoles will attract new fans
and retain users who are increasingly playing games on
smartphones and other mobile devices, gradually diminishing the
$66 billion video game business. Both companies are also
offering more entertainment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox 360 is currently the best-selling gaming console in
the United States, but global sales are almost on par with the
PlayStation 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Xbox and PlayStation are both pricier than the $300 
Wii U which Nintendo Co Ltd launched late last year
but which has sold poorly, partly due to a dearth of new gaming
titles. Nintendo is expected to announce new games for the
device at the E3 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony did not give details about original programming content
for the PS4 but said new game titles would include Assassin's
Creed IV Black Flag by Ubisoft and Kingdom Hearts III
by Disney Interactive Studios and Square Enix Holdings
Co Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a very compelling price... given the entertainment PS4
will provide to gamers," Sony Computer Entertainment President
and CEO Andrew House told the E3 event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox One is costlier than the current Xbox 360 and 
includes a Kinect motion sensor for hands-free game playing.
Microsoft also announced several exclusive game titles,
including a rendition of 'Minecraft' and a new installment in
the popular 'Halo' franchise, which will be released in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device will go on sale in 21 countries, including
Britain, before the year-end holidays, the company said. Yusuf
Mehdi, an executive at Microsoft's interactive entertainment
unit, did not set any sales targets for the new Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      global experience is a perfect fit to keeping OnCore&#8217;s operational 
      organization ahead of our customer&#8217;s ever increasing performance 
      expectations.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;OnCore has a strong operations foundation to build upon, and I look 
      forward to becoming part of a well-recognized leader in customer care,&#8221; 
      stated Walt Hussey COO, OnCore Manufacturing. &#8220;When an entire 
      organization&#8211;top to bottom&#8211;becomes involved in the Lean-based continuous 
      improvement process and culture there are few limits on the potential 
      that can be achieved. The whole organization becomes engaged in 
      transforming processes that quickly re-align and form the basis for a 
      company&#8217;s non-stop focus upon operational excellence. Extending this 
      culture through the end-to-end supply chain cultivates a robust service 
      organization delivering both agility and the lowest total cost of 
      ownership for each of OnCore&#8217;s customers.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) was granted time by regulators to carry out a second round of testing on the ruptured Pegasus oil pipeline, after the firm said an initial investigation into the reason the nearly 70-year-old line failed was not conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By David Sheppard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 12 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp was
granted time by regulators to carry out a second round of

safety concerns about transporting Canada's tar sands on ageing
U.S. infrastructure have mounted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has granted Exxon until
July 10 for further testing of the failed pipe as long as the
companies provides "information regarding the additional testing
and protocols."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, the first independent report into Pegasus's failure
was sent to Exxon and PHMSA by a third-party laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has said the Hurst Metallurgical Research Laboratory

&lt;p&gt;The report showed the funds raised their ownership of euro zone securities by $12 billion, to $217 billion, last month, led by an increase in French bank debt that included certificates of deposits and time deposits, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a year-to-date basis, the funds' euro zone bank exposure increased by $15 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These funds, seen as alternatives to bank accounts, "continued to allocate more cash into bank credit, particularly into European banks," JPMorgan analysts wrote in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime money funds also bought a combined $10 billion in Norwegian, Swedish, Swiss and British bank paper last month. This raised their year-to-date purchases of this debt to $26 billion, bringing their total holdings to $249 billion, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to European bank paper, they bought more municipal and corporate debt in May, while they pared holdings of U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agencies, U.S. bank and asset-backed commercial paper, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime funds' holdings of U.S. debt fell $3 billion to $173 billion in May. In the first five months of 2013, their U.S. debt holdings have declined $21 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by James Dalgleish)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd would pay $2.15 billion to settle a patent suit related to its acid-reflux drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first instance of generic drugmakers paying damages for marketing a copy of an existing drug for which patents have yet to expire - known as an 'at-risk' launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer drug, Protonix, recorded peak annual revenue of almost $2 billion in 2007, before sales plunged following the launch of generic versions by Teva in 2007 and Sun Pharma in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent covering the active ingredient in Protonix -- pantoprazole -- expired in January 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is an important milestone, setting a 'book-end' case for the industry. It will serve to encourage patent settlements," Bernstein Research analyst Aaron Gal said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said the Pfizer case was unique among these types of lawsuits as it involved a "composition of matter patent" - one of the stronger patent protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see more at-risk launches but probably of less powerful patents," Conover said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A New Jersey jury ruled that Teva had infringed the Protonix patent in April 2010, following a protracted 10-year legal battle. (r.reuters.com/xuv78t)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trial to determine damages began on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent was held by Nycomed, now a Takeda subsidiary, and the drug was licensed to Wyeth, now owned by Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeda will receive 36 percent or about $774 million from the settlement, with the rest going to Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel-based Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker, will pay $1.6 billion - half this year and the rest by October 2014. India's Sun Pharma will pay $550 million this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OVERHANG REMOVED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teva said in February that it may face legal losses of up to $2.07 billion to resolve the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teva said on Wednesday it will record a charge of about $930 million in the second quarter, in addition to the $670 million provision recorded in its 2012 financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the company said it may have up to $560 million of net insurance coverage for the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Protonix damages were one of the negatives Teva had to 'get out of the way' before investors can focus on the company's growth prospects," Bernstein's Aaron Gal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Teva reported positive results from a mid-stage study of its experimental lupus drug that aims to treat inflammation of the kidney caused by the autoimmune disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that the drug when combined with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids - the current standard of care - improved kidney function compared with current therapy alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teva's U.S.-listed shares were down about 1 percent at $39.47 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIT TO ACQUISITION PLANS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Pharma set aside 5.84 billion rupees, or about $100 million, last November towards potential damages to Pfizer. The company will now have to shell out a further $450 million as final settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not a very positive out-of-court settlement," said Daljeet Kohli, head of research at brokerage IndiaNivesh in Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The agreed amount is way too high for such a settlement. It will also restrict Sun's ability to look for acquisitions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Indian company has been considering several potential acquisitions. It was in talks to buy Swedish drugmaker Meda and Israel's Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, but both deals fell through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Pharma's shares closed little changed at 980.70 rupees, prior to the announcement of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares were up about 1 percent at $28.69 , while Teva's shares were down about 1 percent at $39.51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Kaustubh Kulkarni in Mumbai and Ransdell Pierson in New York; Editing by Roshni Menon and Anthony Kurian)&lt;/p&gt;

      Coca-Cola is popping the top on a new quartet of athletes, including two 
      Olympic champions, a world-class legend and a Paralympic hopeful, who 
      will represent the brand for the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games. The 
      foursome will have prominent roles in the Company&#8217;s marketing efforts 
      leading up to the Games and will be featured, in part, in digital 
      advertising, packaging and retail POS. Members of the Coca-Cola &#8220;Four 
      Pack&#8221; also will serve as &#8220;Ambassadors of Active Living&#8221; to encourage and 
      inspire fans to lead healthy, balanced lifestyles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      This week, the Coca-Cola &#8220;Four Pack&#8221; joined together in Boston to take 
      part in a photo and video shoot to capture content and images that will 
      be used in the Company&#8217;s marketing efforts. The collection of athletes 
      includes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Michelle Kwan &#8211; two-time Olympic medalist in women&#8217;s figure 
        skating. Kwan also is a five-time World Champion, nine-time U.S. 
        National Champion and is the most decorated figure skater in U.S.

				Evan Lysacek &#8211; gold medalist in men&#8217;s figure skating at the 
        2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and Sochi 2014 hopeful. Lysacek also 
        has won a World Championship (2009) and two U.S. Championships (2007, 
        2008). His 10 major titles make him the most decorated U.S. male 
        skater in the past decade.
      
			
				Amy Purdy &#8211; three-time World Cup champion in para-snowboarding 
        and currently the top-ranked female adaptive snowboarder in the U.S. 
        and a Paralympic hopeful for Sochi 2014.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is the fourth consecutive Olympic Games in which Coca-Cola has 
      featured a collection of athletes as part of its Olympic marketing 
      program. The &#8220;Six Pack&#8221; that competed in Beijing in 2008 brought home 14

&lt;p&gt;LISBON, June 12 (Reuters) - Portugal has reached an
agreement with JP Morgan in a row over costly interest
rate hedging contracts sold to state companies, the finance
ministry said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute, during which both sides threatened legal action

have now been closed and relations with the bank have been
"normalised," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The row had echoes of similar battles in countries such as
Italy where bank clients said they were missold products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portuguese treasury secretary Maria Luiz Albuquerque said in
April the government had managed to renegotiate interest rate
swap contracts containing "highly speculative elements" with

			Teva Reaches Settlement Agreement with Pfizer and Nycomed Regarding 
      Generic Protonix&#174; (Pantoprazole) Tablets
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA) announced today that it 
      has entered into a settlement agreement with Wyeth/Pfizer and 
      Altana/Nycomed to resolve all claims relating to Teva&#8217;s sales, 
      commencing in December 2007, of its 20 mg and 40 mg generic Protonix&#174; 
      (pantoprazole sodium) tablets. As part of the settlement, which provides 
      for the release of all claims against Teva and its subsidiaries, Teva 
      agreed to pay $1.6 billion to Wyeth/Pfizer and Altana/Nycomed. Teva will 
      pay $800 million in 2013 and the remainder in 2014. As a result of this 
      settlement, Teva expects to incur a charge of approximately $930 million 
      in the second quarter of 2013 in addition to the $670 million provision 
      previously recorded in its 2012 financial statements. The Company 
      believes it may have up to $560 million of net insurance coverage in 
      connection with this settlement, subject to recovery from the insurance 
      carriers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Richard Egosi, Group Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, 
      commented: &#8220;We are pleased to put this matter behind us as we continue 
      to focus on delivering safe and affordable medicines to patients around 
      the world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As previously reported, Altana Pharma and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals had 
      previously sued Teva for patent infringement, and in September 2007, the 
      United States District Court for the District of New Jersey had denied 
      Wyeth&#8217;s motion for a preliminary injunction. In May 2009, the Court of 
      Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court&#8217;s denial of 
      the preliminary injunction. Subsequently, a jury trial was held, and in 
      April 2010, the jury returned a verdict finding that the patent, which 
      Teva had infringed, was not invalid. In July 2010, the District Court 
      denied Teva&#8217;s motion to overturn the verdict.

			Pfizer Obtains $2.15 Billion Settlement from Teva and Sun for 
      Infringement of Protonix&#174; Patent
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. announced today a $2.15 billion settlement reached with Teva 
      Pharmaceuticals Industries, Limited and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, 
      Limited for patent-infringement damages resulting from their "at-risk&#8221; 
      launches of generic Protonix&#174; in the United States. The settlement comes 
      after a nearly 10-year legal battle in which Pfizer and Nycomed (now 
      part of Takeda) sought to enforce the patent for its blockbuster acid 
      reflux medicine. Pfizer and Takeda will divide the proceeds of the 
      settlement with Pfizer receiving 64 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased with today's settlement, which recognizes the validity 
      and value of the innovation that led to Protonix,&#8221; said Amy W. Schulman, 
      executive vice president and general counsel of Pfizer. &#8220;Protecting 
      intellectual property is vital as we develop new medicines that save and 
      enhance patients&#8217; lives.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the terms of the settlement, Teva and Sun will pay a total of 
      $2.15 billion to compensate Pfizer&#8217;s subsidiary Wyeth and Takeda for the 
      damages they suffered when Teva and Sun launched &#8220;at-risk&#8221; generic 
      versions of Protonix prior to the January 2011 expiry of the patent for 
      pantoprazole, the active ingredient in Protonix. These &#8220;at-risk&#8221; 
      launches were determined by a jury in New Jersey federal court to 
      violate United States Patent No. 4,758,579, which is owned by Takeda and 
      was licensed exclusively to Wyeth in the United States. The parties 
      reached the settlement shortly after the commencement of a trial to 
      determine damages in the same New Jersey federal court.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Teva will pay Pfizer and Takeda $1.6 billion and Sun will pay $550 
      million. Teva will pay $800 million in 2013 and the remaining $800 
      million by October 2014; Sun&#8217;s entire payment will be made in 2013. As 
      part of the settlement, both Teva and Sun have admitted that their sales 
      of generic pantoprazole infringed the patent that was held valid by the 
      court.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today&#8217;s settlement reflects our resolve to enforce our patents both in 
      and out of the courtroom,&#8221; Ms. Schulman said. &#8220;We are proud of the work 
      of the scientific colleagues who developed this medicine and the lawyers 
      who defended it."

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) kept its top spot for investment banking in the first quarter after bringing in $6.9 billion in revenues, putting it ahead of four rivals tied for second place, a study showed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) made the strongest gains in the January-March period compared to a year ago, lifting them to joint second spot with Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N), according to industry analytics firm Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays (BARC.L) ranked sixth, followed by Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry is paying particularly close attention to rankings data as banks are restructuring operations to cut costs and improve profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan brought in $4.3 billion in revenue from fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading, which accounts for more than half of investment bank revenues. Citi and Deutsche were second and third in FICC income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs topped equities revenue with JPMorgan and UBS (UBSN.VX), each bringing in about $1.4 billion in the quarter, Coalition estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Bank of America topped the rankings for advisory income, each getting $1.4 billion in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking income is often volatile, and revenue at the start of this year was down from year-ago levels but up from a poor fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top five U.S. banks reported investment bank revenues down 7 percent on the year, but up 35 percent on the fourth quarter. Europe's big four investment banks - Deutsche Bank, Barclays, UBS and Credit Suisse - reported resilient first quarters, as cost-cutting helped them to keep pace with their U.S. rivals and ease concern they were falling behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coalition said JPMorgan was the top investment bank last year with revenues of $24.1 billion out of $159 billion for the top 10 banks it assesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It says its study is based on public information from banks' results and benchmarked to a common standard to produce a top 10 league table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Slater; editing by Stephen Nisbet)&lt;/p&gt;

			Portland General Electric Company Announces Pricing of Common Stock 
      Offering
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Portland General Electric Company (NYSE: POR) announced today the 
      pricing of a public offering of 11.1 million shares of its common stock 
      at $29.50 per share in connection with the forward sale agreement 
      described below. The underwriters have been granted an option to 
      purchase up to an additional 1.665 million shares of PGE&#8217;s common stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The offering is being made under PGE&#8217;s existing shelf registration 
      statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In connection with the offering, PGE entered into a forward sale 
      agreement with an affiliate of Barclays Capital Inc. (&#8220;Barclays&#8221;) under 
      which PGE agreed to issue and sell to Barclays (subject to PGE&#8217;s right 
      to cash settle or net share settle the forward sale agreement) the same 
      number of shares of PGE&#8217;s common stock sold by Barclays or its 
      affiliates to the underwriters for sale in the underwritten public 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The forward sale agreement will provide for settlement on dates to be 
      specified by the company within approximately 24 months after the date 
      of this offering. Upon physical settlement of the forward sale 
      agreement, PGE will issue and deliver to Barclays shares of PGE common 
      stock in exchange for cash proceeds per share equal to the forward sale 
      price, which will initially be $28.54125 (the public offering price, 
      less underwriting discounts and commissions), and will be subject to 
      certain adjustments as provided in the forward sale agreement. PGE may, 
      subject to certain conditions, elect cash settlement or net share 
      settlement for all or a portion of its rights or obligations under the 
      forward sale agreement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PGE intends to use any net proceeds that it receives upon settlement of 
      the forward sale agreement or upon any issuance and sale to the 
      underwriters of shares of its common stock in the offering to repay 
      debt, with the balance to fund capital expenditures and general 
      corporate purposes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Barclays Capital Inc., J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo Securities and BofA 
      Merrill Lynch are acting as joint book-running managers for the 
      offering. Morgan Stanley is acting as co-manager for the offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      respect to this offering may be obtained by contacting:

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Research and Markets: Global Mobile Wallets Analysis Report 2013: 
      Featuring Amazon, Google, Master Card, Visa, Apple and PayPal
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/lmwntj/mobile_wallets) 
      has announced the addition of the "Mobile 
      Wallets" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After a considerable period of experimentation, negotiation and 
      discovery, there is finally consensus in the communications industry 
      about mobile payments: they are never going to be a substantial source 
      of revenue on their own. Even so, Visa predicts that by 2020 half its 
      transactions will be made through a mobile device.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The opportunity to build other services around mobile payments has 
      sparked huge interest from many different parties and brought the idea 
      of mobile wallets to the fore.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mobile wallets should offer a quicker, cheaper and/or easier payment 
      method than other options, wherever you are. Different wallets emphasize 
      different elements, depending on the business model of the provider but 
      they can include a stored equivalent value of cash, debit and credit 
      card details, loyalty rewards, discount vouchers, gift cards and ID.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Our report looks at who is involved- from Amazon to Google and 
      MasterCard, mobile network operators to PayPal, phone manufacturers to 
      Visa. They have one thing in common; they can't offer mobile wallet 
      services themselves, they need partnerships. This throws up many 
      questions and challenges too.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We explore different business models and the ecosystems needed to 
      support them. We find many different approaches in different 
      combinations and no obviously dominant force. Interestingly, Apple is 
      yet to enter the fray, although its iPhone, through technologies such as 
      Square, is making an impact. We review where this leaves mobile 
      operators as we ask what are they trying to achieve?
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Finally, we look at what is holding mobile payments back. Although 
      issues include data protection and consumers' worries about security and 
      privacy, perhaps the greatest barrier is lack of interest shown by 
      consumers who are not clear about how wallets work or why they should 
      care. We suggest that until this skepticism is addressed mobile wallets 
      will continue to be a supply-side push, not mass-market demand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Key Topics Covered:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Section 1 Why buy into mobile wallets and who wants to?
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Section 2 Finding the business model, building the ecosystem
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Section 3 When simple becomes complicated - what's holding mobile 
      payments back?

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Development of energy sources around the world drives the availability 
      of petrochemical feedstocks, and for most of the past two decades, much 
      of that development has been in the Middle East leading to a surge in 
      petrochemical production in that region. If the European petrochemical 
      industry hopes to remain competitive, it must continue to capitalize on 
      its historic advantage in innovation and further work on developing its 
      specialty products portfolio, according to Benny Mermans, Europe and 
      Africa region general manager at Chevron Phillips Chemicals 
      International N.V. (Chevron Phillips Chemical).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In his presentation &#8220;Adapting in a Changing Feedstock Environment: U.S. 
      Driving the Way&#8221; at the Global Petrochemical Conference, Mermans said, 
      &#8220;Focusing on innovation is even more important in light of the prolonged 
      economic crisis which continues to impact demand and margins in much of 
      Europe. The mega complexes being built today will likely have difficulty 
      effectively competing in this highly specialized area.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As an example of this emphasis on specialty products, Chevron Phillips 
      Chemical announced it will expand its Tessenderlo, Belgium plant by 
      adding the capability to manufacture sulfur-based organic products 
      starting with elemental sulfur. In 2011, Chevron Phillips Chemical 
      acquired a PAO plant located in Beringen, Belgium from Neste Oil, NV. 
      This is a strategically important acquisition because it establishes a 
      European production base for PAOs and expands its PAO capacity to better 
      serve our customers and growing demand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mermans also understands the challenges European producers face. He 
      said, &#8220;Many regions in the world have shale formations and potential 
      shale gas and shale oil resources, and we expect that these will be 
      developed, providing petrochemical investment opportunities in the 
      future. The challenges that must be overcome to fully develop these 
      resources in Europe include land access, regulatory hurdles, 
      infrastructure development, and continued development of drilling and 
      completion technologies.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;To get access to competitive feedstock within its borders, European 
      producers must encourage development of European energy resources, 
      creating an environment of plentiful gas supply. This would take 
      substantial cooperation and development,&#8221; Mermans continued.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During his presentation in Frankfurt, Germany, Mermans highlighted that 
      Chevron Phillips Chemical has filed permit applications to build an 
      ethane cracker with an annual capacity of 1.5 million metric tons at its 
      Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown, Texas and two polyethylene units each 
      with annual capacity of 500,000 metric tons in Old Ocean, Texas. Final 
      approval for the project is expected this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The proposed investment reflects our strong confidence on the 
      opportunity that development of abundant shale resources affords the 
      United States and the world,&#8221; said Mermans. &#8220;We estimate that global 
      demand growth for ethylene over the next ten years could support the 
      equivalent of 3-4 new world-scale crackers per year, and we believe the 
      development of shale energy resources around the world will also 
      catalyze new investments in petrochemicals and plastics. Satisfying 
      global demand growth will require continued high investment in 
      petrochemicals and plastics globally,&#8221; he continued.

&lt;p&gt;By Ayesha Rascoe and Valerie Volcovici
    WASHINGTON, June 13 (Reuters) - Delays in approval of more
natural gas export projects are costing U.S. companies millions
of dollars a day and giving a leg up to rival countries also
looking to boost exports, the chief of Exxon Mobil Corp 
said on Thursday.  
    The comments by Exxon's Rex Tillerson came hours after new
U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz told lawmakers he hopes to
"expeditiously" begin evaluating the more than a dozen
applications awaiting approval to export liquefied natural gas
(LNG).
    "It's a very competitive marketplace. It's not like people
are just going to stand at our door like panting dogs just
waiting for us to give this (LNG) to them," Tillerson said while
answering questions after an event at the Asia Society focused
on Asian energy security.
    Tillerson said he left a meeting with Moniz on Wednesday
with no clear idea of when the company's Golden Pass LNG project
- a $10 billion joint venture with Qatar Petroleum - would be
approved. 
    "I don't want to start on this process if you tell me its
going to take five years for you to get around to my
application," Tillerson said. 
    U.S. companies need authorization from the Department of
Energy to export gas to all but a handful of countries with free
trade agreements. Japan and India are among the countries keen
to gain access to U.S. supplies.       
    The Energy Department ended a two-year freeze in reviewing
liquefied natural gas (LNG) export applications in May, when it
approved gas exports to all countries from Freeport LNG's
terminal in Texas. 
    Shortly after that move Moniz, who was sworn in on May 21,
said he would undertake a thorough review of the gas export
review process, promising to ensure that current data was being
used to make these decisions. 
    At his first appearance at a Congressional panel since his
swearing-in, Moniz told lawmakers at a House Energy and Commerce
committee hearing on Thursday the review should wrap up soon.
    "We're getting ready to begin evaluating the dockets on a
case-by-case basis," Moniz said. There would "absolutely" be
additional decisions this year, he added, without giving a more
specific time frame.    
    Companies have lined up to export excess gas produced from
the nation's shale boom. The gas can fetch higher prices abroad.
    Other backers of proposed export projects include Dominion
Resources Inc, Sempra Energy, BG Group Plc 
and Veresen Inc. 
    Some lawmakers and a group of manufacturers led by Dow
Chemical Co, have called on the department to be
cautious, arguing that unfettered exports could harm the U.S.
economy by raising the price of gas at home.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said it would open 500 special stores within existing Best Buy Co Inc stores in the United States selling exclusively Windows-based tablets and computers and other Microsoft products in an effort to revitalize sales of its flagship operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company, which already has a chain of 70 or so of its own Microsoft Stores and kiosks within shopping malls, said on Thursday the initiative would add more than 1,200 Best Buy Microsoft-trained sales associates to help customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new Windows 8 operating system has sold more than 100 million copies since launch in October, but sales of new tablets and PCs running the software, and its own Surface tablet, have not been as strong as it hoped. An updated version called Windows 8.1 is scheduled for release later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem has been that Microsoft has struggled to get the attention of shoppers at large retailers such as Best Buy due to the profusion and popularity of Apple Inc's iPad and tablets running Google Inc's Android system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new store-within-a-store approach "offers a large-scale, hands-on customer experience" of Microsoft products, said Tami Reller, head of marketing at Microsoft's Windows unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's plan comes just two months after Samsung Electronics also unveiled plans to install its brand shops in more than 1,400 Best Buy stores this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The store-within-a-store effort is a key plank of Best Buy's turnaround plan, which includes dedicating more space to more-profitable products like tablets and mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best Buy, the world's largest consumer electronics chain, has also been trying to use its clout with suppliers to fight online and discount rivals and boost in-store traffic, sales and profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Dhanya Skariachan; Editing by David Gregorio and Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - John Hogan, who was named chief risk officer at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) last year just as its London Whale trades began racking up billions of dollars of losses, may leave the company, CEO Jamie Dimon said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hogan will hold a new title of chairman of risk after returning to work on Monday from a leave he started in January, Dimon said in a memo to employees which was seen by Reuters. Ashley Bacon, Hogan's deputy, will become chief risk officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hogan became chief risk officer in January 2012 he inherited a dysfunctional risk management system, according to a report by the U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The report found that Hogan had no role in approving the bad trades and that he was unaware of their size and mounting losses before press reports about them in April of that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company disclosed one month later that the trades had lost at least $2 billion. The disclosure set off intense investigations by government and company officials of JPMorgan's risk controls and whether some banks are too big to manage safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hogan worked on overhauling the risk systems under the scrutiny of regulators. In November, Hogan's father died after a long illness, according to a person close to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hogan said in January that he had discussed the possibility of a leave with Dimon and other executives before deciding taking the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has lost, or reassigned, a number of top executives since the London Whale debacle, which ultimately cost more than $6.2 billion. Since last May, Dimon has replaced his chief financial officer and investment banking chief, as well as the head of the Chief Investment Office, where the London Whale losses occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said in the memo on Thursday that Hogan will work with Bacon for "several" months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We then hope he will stay at the firm in another senior role, but he may choose to do something different outside of our company," Dimon said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - John Hogan, who was named
chief risk officer at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co last year just
as its London Whale trades began racking up billions of dollars
of losses, may leave the company, CEO Jamie Dimon said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hogan will hold a new title of chairman of risk after
returning to work on Monday from a leave he started in January,
Dimon said in a memo to employees which was seen by Reuters.
Ashley Bacon, Hogan's deputy, will become chief risk officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hogan became chief risk officer in January 2012 he
inherited a dysfunctional risk management system, according to a
report by the U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. The report found that Hogan had no role in
approving the bad trades and that he was unaware of their size
and mounting losses before press reports about them in April of
that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company disclosed one month later that the trades had
lost at least $2 billion. The disclosure set off intense
investigations by government and company officials of JPMorgan's
risk controls and whether some banks are too big to manage
safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hogan worked on overhauling the risk systems under the
scrutiny of regulators. In November, Hogan's father died after a
long illness, according to a person close to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hogan said in January that he had discussed the possibility
of a leave with Dimon and other executives before deciding
taking the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has lost, or reassigned, a number of top executives
since the London Whale debacle, which ultimately cost more than
$6.2 billion. Since last May, Dimon has replaced his chief
financial officer and investment banking chief, as well as the
head of the Chief Investment Office, where the London Whale
losses occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said in the memo on Thursday that Hogan will work with
Bacon for "several" months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We then hope he will stay at the firm in another senior
role, but he may choose to do something different outside of our
company," Dimon said. "John is a highly talented executive who
did a superb job as head of Risk when we needed him most."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has quietly offered some top clients a tool that allows them to plug into its trading system and buy or sell large blocks of stock electronically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology is part of a broader platform called Marquee, details of which not been previously reported, but were confirmed to Reuters by Goldman executives. It is the latest attempt by a Wall Street bank to automate block trading, a small sliver of the equities business that is still handled mostly by humans rather than specialized computer programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Block trades involve at least 10,000 shares or $200,000 worth of stock and are often used to get clients out of a pinch. When clients really want to buy shares or must offload shares, they are willing to pay a little more to guarantee liquidity and hands-on service. Prices are set based on the bank's inventory and market conditions - the more Goldman wants to reduce its exposure to a stock, the cheaper it is for a client to buy. The more the firm wants the stock, the costlier it becomes for the client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of automating block trading isn't new, but some previous attempts have faltered. The pressure to make it work has increased as banks look for ways to boost profits in the low-margin equities business. Several other banks, including Barclays Plc (BARC.L), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), are trying to migrate block trading to electronic platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone brings a different twist to the way they're trying to solve a common problem, which is: How do you continue to bring high-touch service in an industry that's facing downward commissions revenue?" said Adam Sussman, director of research at TABB Group, a market research and advisory firm. "The industry as a whole has to cover more clients with fewer people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks have been forced to take a fresh look at their equities businesses after years of weak trading volumes and shrinking commissions. Brokerages took in an estimated $12.8 billion in equity commissions last year, down 23 percent from 2007, according to TABB. The firm expects commissions to rise this year on higher volumes, but remain well below the pre-financial crisis levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's $8.2 billion in overall equities trading revenue last year was down 27 percent from fiscal 2007. Its $3.1 billion in equity commissions were down 33 percent from fiscal 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From dark pools and high-frequency trading to E*Trade accounts, technology has replaced many things humans once did. While robot-like machines now rule many aspects of equities trading they have not displaced humans in block trading because some clients still prefer talking to a person before making a huge trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marquee's block-trading algorithm takes seconds to execute the trade, compared with the minutes or hours it can take human traders. It is also cheaper for the client and, over the long run, Goldman executives hope it will be cheaper for the bank as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clients said they had a sense of urgency and that it's really expensive to trade these blocks," said one Goldman executive involved in the system's development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman executives insisted the new tool was not created to cut jobs, and that getting human traders' cooperation is key to Marquee's success. But they acknowledged that, if it does take off, traders' jobs could be at risk in the long-term if they cannot transition into roles that increase Goldman's returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRADERS VERSUS ROBOTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier attempts automate block trading flopped. Traders who worried that they would lose their jobs to machines routinely undercut their robot competitors on pricing. Plus, technology was not up to snuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, Bank of America Securities launched a platform called Premier Block Trading, or PBT, to build market share in equities trading. But PBT's pricing algorithm was easy for clients to game because it gave blanket quotes a few cents above or below prevailing market prices, according to several people familiar with its history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traders at Bank of America took advantage the system's shortcomings, pricing trades more cheaply than PBT to keep client business, said the sources, who asked not to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America closed down PBT within a couple of years, after suffering big losses on its development and rollout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Bank of America spokeswoman declined to comment on the old block-trading program, but said the bank launched a platform called Instinct Natural earlier this year that matches buyers and sellers for block trades. Henry Mulholland, head of Americas equities at Bank of America, said the bank will be adding the capability to use its own balance sheet to facilitate block trades electronically as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, this year NYSE Euronext NYX.N said it was shuttering its New York Block Exchange venture after failing to attract enough business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman executives declined to specify client discounts for using Marquee. They said it's too early to tell how much money Marquee will save the bank because the system has many functions and the rollout to clients is still in early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside Goldman, Marquee is also used for risk management and profit-and-loss analysis for the bank's equities business. Early developers of Marquee in the 1990s first called the software "Marty," after Martin Chavez, who oversaw its development and is now global co-chief operating officer of equities. The name changed as its functions expanded and it became used more widely used inside the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Custom versions of Marquee's block-trading tool were rolled out to a small group of preferred clients in a 2012 beta test, and it was launched more widely this year. The tool covers roughly 1,000 stocks, as well as commonly traded ETFs. About 1 million client trades have been processed through Marquee so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is successful, Goldman is considering expanding the platform into other markets, such as fixed income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; editing by Paritosh Bansal, Martin Howell and Alden Bentley)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, June 13 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said it
would open 500 special stores within existing Best Buy Co Inc
 stores in the United States selling exclusively
Windows-based tablets and computers and other Microsoft products
in an effort to revitalize sales of its flagship operating
system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company, which already has a
chain of 70 or so of its own Microsoft Stores and kiosks within
shopping malls, said on Thursday the initiative would add more
than 1,200 Best Buy Microsoft-trained sales associates to help
customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new Windows 8 operating system has sold more
than 100 million copies since launch in October, but sales of
new tablets and PCs running the software, and its own Surface
tablet, have not been as strong as it hoped. An updated version
called Windows 8.1 is scheduled for release later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem has been that Microsoft has struggled to
get the attention of shoppers at large retailers such as Best
Buy due to the profusion and popularity of Apple Inc's 
iPad and tablets running Google Inc's Android system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new store-within-a-store approach "offers a large-scale,
hands-on customer experience" of Microsoft products, said Tami
Reller, head of marketing at Microsoft's Windows unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's plan comes just two months after Samsung
Electronics also unveiled plans to install its brand
shops in more than 1,400 Best Buy stores this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The store-within-a-store effort is a key plank of Best Buy's
turnaround plan, which includes dedicating more space to
more-profitable products like tablets and mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best Buy, the world's largest consumer electronics chain,
has also been trying to use its clout with suppliers to fight
online and discount rivals and boost in-store traffic, sales and
profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) tapped an Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) executive to become its next CEO when Clarence Cazalot retires at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Tillman, Exxon Mobil's vice president of engineering, will take the top post at the energy exploration company in January 2014, Marathon Oil said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillman's experience in some of the world's most complex energy fields, including Norway, Scotland and Indonesia, will help Marathon Oil as it works to expand its operations in Canada's oil sands, America's shale fields, and in Iraq and Angola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillman, 51, has worked at Exxon Mobil since earning a Ph.D. at Auburn University.

			Pritzker, Goldman Sachs Announce $20 Million First Phase of Early 
      Childhood Innovation Accelerator Initiative
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Novel Social Impact Investments to Debut at CGI America Conference in 
      Chicago
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At President Clinton's CGI America Conference in Chicago today, investor 
      J.B. Pritzker announced commitments for $20 million as the first phase 
      of an Early Childhood Innovation Accelerator (the &#8220;Accelerator&#8221;) to 
      increase the availability and quality of early childhood education 
      programs for disadvantaged children.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pritzker also announced the Accelerator's first three investments. The 
      first is a co-investment with Goldman Sachs through a partnership with 
      the United Way of Salt Lake that will, in its initial phase starting 
      September 2013, provide preschool for 450 disadvantaged children who 
      would otherwise be wait listed because of limited government resources. 
      Services will be provided at no upfront costs to taxpayers, with 
      investor returns determined by student achievement. This program is 
      expected to be scaled to serve more disadvantaged children in the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Access to early education gives children a foundation they will build 
      upon throughout their education and beyond,&#8221; said Lloyd C. Blankfein, 
      Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Goldman Sachs. &#8220;Through this 
      innovative financing, we are pleased to partner with J.B. Pritzker and 
      the United Way of Salt Lake to provide the opportunity to thousands of 
      children who otherwise may not have been able to attend preschool.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Early Childhood Innovation Accelerator seeks to improve the lives of 
      children from birth to age five by breaking down barriers to increased 
      state and federal support for high-quality early learning programs. In 
      addition, the Accelerator seeks to stimulate innovation and unlock 
      greater private investment for efforts aimed at disadvantaged infants, 
      toddlers and their families.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Accelerator, seeded by The Pritzker Children&#8217;s Initiative, a project 
      of the J.B. and M.K. Pritzker Family Foundation, to date has raised $20 
      million from investors including other private foundations and co 
      investors including Goldman Sachs. Its purpose is to rapidly increase 
      the availability of high-quality early childhood learning opportunities, 
      while building measurable successes backed by evidence, accountability 
      and results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Investing early and intelligently in the development of infants, 
      toddlers and preschoolers significantly improves educational outcomes. 
      Early learning reduces social and economic inequality and builds a 
      better workforce and a stronger nation,&#8221; said J.B. Pritzker, president 
      of the J.B. and M.K. Pritzker Family Foundation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Deborah Bayle, president and CEO of United Way of Salt Lake, added, &#8220;We 
      are committed to solving our community&#8217;s most complex social problems. 
      Without high quality, early education opportunities, it will not be 
      possible to achieve our State&#8217;s goals of 90 percent proficiency in core 
      subjects, 90 percent high school graduation, and 66 percent of Utahns 
      with a post-secondary education. That is why United Way of Salt Lake is 
      proud to be part of this groundbreaking financing model.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under this novel public-private partnership, philanthropists and 
      investors finance innovations which can then be scaled up to provide 
      more children with higher-quality early childhood programs. Research 
      consistently shows such programs result in superior long-term education, 
      health, social and economic outcomes, particularly for disadvantaged 
      children and their families. In cases like the Utah social impact bond, 
      special education costs are reduced through high-quality early learning 
      programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Initially the ECIA will make three investments:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Alongside Goldman Sachs&#8217; $4.6 million commitment, and in partnership 
        with the United Way of Salt Lake, the Accelerator will commit $2.4 
        million towards the Early Childhood Education Social Impact loan. In 
        the first year, 450 children will come off the wait list and be placed 
        into high-quality Pre-K in Salt Lake&#8217;s Granite School District. 
        Without private capital from the Accelerator and other investors, 
        these disadvantaged three-and four-year old children would not receive 
        early learning services.This loan and the program services 
        will be administered by the United Way of Salt Lake. The investment 
        was chosen because Utah studies conducted since 2006 by Utah Voices 
        for Children found similar interventions resulted in substantial 
        direct cost-savings.
      
		
		
			
        Venture investment in Acelero Learning, a nationally recognized 
        operator of outperforming Head Start and Early Head Start programs, 
        which will use the Accelerator&#8217;s investment to scale its data-driven 
        methodology for driving improved outcomes for low-income children.
      
			
        Direct grant for the City of Chicago&#8217;s comprehensive early childhood 
        education web portal (www.chicagoearlylearning.org). 
        This interactive bilingual tool serves as a one-stop-shop for parents 
        to find local high-quality pre-K programs and get information on their 
        quality.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The concept of creating an Early Childhood Innovation Accelerator was 
      initially announced at last year&#8217;s CGI America. Imprint Capital Advisors 
      was then engaged by Pritzker to develop and build-out the Accelerator 
      prototype for these social investments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Working in tandem with an investment committee, the Accelerator will 
      also be guided by an advisory panel headed by national and international 
      early childhood expert Dr. Joan Lombardi, who will lead a team of 
      professionals evaluating the extent to which prospective investments 
      will favorably impact the early learning field.

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS, June 13 (Reuters) - The Venezuela division of
Coca-Cola Femsa , Latin America's largest Coke
bottler, began restarting operations at its largest plant on
Thursday following a 24-day strike that it called illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work stoppage at the plant in the central-western city
of Valencia caused sporadic shortages of products such as soft
drinks, bottled water, juices and tea in some parts of the
country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have not yet quantified the impact of the protests on
national production ... but the workers are committed to
recovering the lost hours," Corporate Affairs Director Mariana
Parma said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters was unable to obtain comment from the workers who
had been on strike, who were demanding higher wages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico's Coca-Cola Femsa, a joint venture of Coca-Cola Co
 and Mexican company Femsa , this year
said 18 percent of its 2012 sales came from Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has 34 bottling plants in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Kiev government sends draft project to local councils&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* If approved, Olesska shale deal would be second for
Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Project faces some opposition in western Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIEV, June 13 (Reuters) - Ukraine's government has concluded
negotiations with U.S. energy major Chevron on a second
shale gas project and is lining up another energy deal with an
ExxonMobil-led consortium, its energy minister said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has been in talks with Kiev for several months over
exploration in the 5,260sq km Olesska field in western Ukraine,
with the government keen for shale gas to ease Ukraine's
dependence on costly natural gas supplies from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy Minister Eduard Stavytsky told journalists on
Thursday that a draft agreement with Chevron had been sent to
local authorities for approval, which is required under
Ukrainian law. "They will consider it some time between June 18
and 21," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Soviet republic signed a $10 billion
production-sharing agreement with Royal Dutch Shell 
this year for shale gas exploration in the Yuzivska field in the
east, but the Chevron plan has come up against more opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiev estimates Olesska shale reserves at up to 1.5 trillion
cubic metres, but local politicians and environmental lobby
groups have voiced their concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government officials and Chevron have met local groups to
try to allay fears of environmental damage from shale
exploration, which involves the injection of water and chemicals
into layers of rock to release trapped gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinting that the Chevron project might be in for a rough
ride with regional authorities, Natural Resources Minister Oleh
Proskuryakov said: "Nobody can give any guarantee (about the
outcome of the debate), but we are hoping for a constructive
dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there is a positive decision, an agreement could be
signed within a month," he told Reuters on the sidelines of a
business conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy Minister Stavytsky, meanwhile, is already looking
ahead to the next significant energy deal - an offshore one with
a consortium led by ExxonMobil on the Skifska field in the Black
Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am convinced that we will achieve a positive result and
sign this deal in late July or early August," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      Workshop in Houston
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IHS (NYSE: IHS), the leading global source of information and analysis, 
      today announced that Chevron was selected as the &#8220;Best of the Best&#8221; 
      among this year&#8217;s IHS SPECTRUM Excellence Award winners based on its 
      innovative use of information systems and best practices to achieve 
      environmental, health, safety and sustainability (EHSS) business goals. 
      Chevron&#8217;s team accepted the award during a ceremony at the IHS EHSS 
      Solutions Workshop in Houston on June 11.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;IHS congratulates Chevron for showing how enterprise-level operational 
      risk information solutions can be successfully leveraged across a 
      multi-faceted global organization,&#8221; said Scott Lockhart, IHS Vice 
      President of EHS and Sustainability. &#8220;Chevron&#8217;s proven ability to 
      enhance critical decision-making and achieve world-class performance 
      through a comprehensive strategy for Enterprise Sustainability 
      Management that drives Operational Excellence will serve as a model for 
      all kinds of businesses around the world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron, one of the world&#8217;s largest integrated energy companies, is 
      renowned for its leadership in promoting a culture of safety and 
      environmental stewardship through a strong, ongoing commitment to 
      Operational Excellence. In 2011, Chevron&#8217;s upstream and downstream 
      businesses both implemented IHS IMPACT ERM&#174; 
      software for operational risk management in combination with its own 
      groundbreaking Data Analysis and Reporting Tool (DART) warehouse and 
      legacy systems. By creating a unified incident analysis and reporting 
      system that serves more than 26,000 users company-wide, Chevron has:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Enhanced health, environmental and safety (HES) business intelligence 
        across the enterprise by providing quality data and historical trend 
        analysis as well as greater transparency and accountability.
      
			
        Provided HES key performance indicators (KPIs) for quarterly and 
        annual corporate sustainability reporting based on Global Reporting 
        Initiative and American Petroleum Institute guidelines.
      
			
        Improved incident analysis and reporting workflows by continually 
        standardizing and driving efficiency &#8211; e.g. archiving 12 systems for 
        Management of Change (MOC).
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2012, Chevron&#8217;s performance in Days Away from Work injury rates 
      (DAFWR) and Total Recordable Incident rates (TRIR) were among the best 
      of its peers. Between 2004 and 2012, the company&#8217;s DAFWR declined by 78 
      percent and TRIR rate dropped 53 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are proud to accept this IHS SPECTRUM Excellence Award,&#8221; said Bob 
      Bollinger, HES Global Business Information System Manager at Chevron.&#8221; 
      Our ability to capture quality data and generate critical analysis and 
      reporting helps us highlight the company&#8217;s outstanding incident 
      management metrics to the investor community&#8230;Chevron&#8217;s documented 
      leadership in operational excellence has given us a real competitive 
      edge.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The IHS SPECTRUM Excellence Awards gala banquet was just one of many 
      highlights from the recent EHSS Solution Workshop. Top EHS and IT 
      professionals, industry experts, business executives and other decision 
      makers participated in more than 50 sessions across eight topical tracks

      software, content and expertise can drive continuous improvement across 
      an organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IHS also announced the launch of its newly enhanced customer portal, 
      which is called the EHSS Customer Network (ECN). The new ECN has an 
      updated look and feel that will make the portal easier to use as well as 
      technological and performance improvements including the ability to: 
      select which product or products users wish to receive notifications on,

			Tablet-based Innovation in the Life Sciences Focuses on Mobile Lab of 
      the Future
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As mobile technology infiltrates every aspect of the enterprise, end 
      users and IT professionals in the life sciences are searching for 
      powerful new ways to unite lab-oriented work with tablet technology. To 
      this end, Ceiba Solutions, Intel and Microsoft have come together with 
      representatives from leading pharmaceutical companies to drive a fully 
      integrated discussion about the mobile lab of the future. This unique 
      collaboration is designed to identify tablet use cases in the laboratory 
      RD environment and provide solutions based on Intel-powered devices, 
      the Microsoft Windows 8 operating system and Ceiba software.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The collaborative effort has kicked off with the distribution of 
      Intel-powered devices to key early adopters in the pharma space to 
      experiment with potential uses for tablets in the lab. The Windows 8 
      devices are pre-loaded with two mobile software products from Ceiba 
      designed to streamline activities and expose greater data insights on 
      projects. Ceiba&#8217;s applications include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Helium, 
        a self-service analytics tool that integrates various databases across 
        an enterprise to present available data consistently and serve as a 
        single source repository
      
			
				Labtrack, 
        a feature rich portal that provides users with the power to manage lab 
        equipment maintenance
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The modern lab is one of the most complex and demanding computing 
      environments one can encounter,&#8221; said Andrea McGonigle, managing 
      director, life sciences, Microsoft. &#8220;To be successful in creating a 
      mobile lab of the future requires integration of hardware, operating 
      systems and software and most importantly the views of our customers. We 
      look forward to the results of the combined effort.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After an initial review period, the participants will come together to 
      discuss their experiences in a steering committee environment. The 
      committee will discuss examples of best practices, as well as their 
      visions for how the mobile lab of the future can use this powerful, 
      vertically integrated stack of hardware and software in the highly 
      demanding RD lab environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Ceiba has always been focused on helping scientists in the lab 
      environment improve productivity,&#8221; said Tom Arneman, president, Ceiba 
      Solutions. &#8220;It is gratifying to be part of an effort where we hear 
      firsthand the needs and desires of those we want to help the most. The 
      new mobile versions of Helium and Labtrack are powerful tools that have 
      the ability deliver great benefits, and we are thrilled that they will 
      be available in such a powerful way.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU regulators asked Visa Europe's customers and rivals to assess its offer to cap inter-bank credit card fees at the same level as competitor MasterCard (MA.N), a concession intended to end an antitrust investigation and avoid a possible fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe, which is the European licensee of Visa Inc. (V.N) and is owned and operated by more than 3,700 European banks, found itself the target of an investigation by the European Commission last year. Regulators said its fees harmed competition and led to higher consumer prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network, which accounts for about 41 percent of all payment cards issued in Europe, subsequently offered to cut its inter-bank credit card fees by about 40-60 percent, to 0.3 percent of the value of each transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission unveiled details of the proposal last month, which also included revamping rules making it easier for businesses to seek better cross-border deals from competing banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission is now seeking feedback on these proposals from interested parties through a market test," it said in a statement on Thursday.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, June 13, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to National Tay-Sachs and Allied Diseases Association (NTSAD) for development of the first-ever treatment for Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff, rare diseases that are fatal in young children and extremely debilitating in their late-onset form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The gene therapy in development would correct an enzyme deficiency that causes the progressive neurodegeneration that marks these diseases. Both Tay Sachs and Sandhoff are lysosomal storage diseases, a group of more than 50 genetically inherited disorders characterized by deficiency of a vital enzyme that prevents the proper breakdown of undigested material inside cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Orphan drug designation, which is intended to facilitate drug development for rare diseases, provides substantial benefits to the sponsor, including the potential for funding of certain clinical studies, study-design assistance and several years of market exclusivity for the product upon regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"This orphan drug designation is a giant step forward in our efforts to bring hope to Tay-Sachs patients and their families, as today there are no treatments," said NTSAD President, Shari Ungerleider. "Gene therapy has the potential to be a one-time transformative therapy for patients suffering from rare neurodegenerative genetic disorders such as Tay-Sachs. NTSAD, along with its funding partners, is committed to advancing the clinical and commercial development of our gene therapy platform because of the potential life-changing benefit it could have for patients and their families."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Based on promising results of animal studies that have been ongoing since 2007, the Tay-Sachs Gene Therapy Consortium research team is completing pre-clinical studies in advance of a Phase I clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About the Tay-Sachs Gene Therapy Consortium &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Tay-Sachs Gene Therapy (TSGT) Consortium was founded in 2007 to advance human clinical trials in the quest for a gene therapy treatment for Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. The multidisciplinary team, led by Miguel Sena Esteves, Ph.D., recipient of the 2011 Outstanding New Investigator Award from the American Society of Gene  Cell Therapy, includes scientists and clinicians from Auburn University, Boston College, Cambridge University-UK, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, University of Massachusetts Medical School, and New York University Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About NTSAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The oldest rare disease advocacy organization in the nation, National Tay-Sachs and Allied Diseases Association (NTSAD) was founded in 1957 by concerned parents whose children were affected by Tay-Sachs disease or related rare genetic lysosomal storage diseases and leukodystrophies. Today NTSAD continues its multifaceted support of affected families and funds research seeking a treatment or cure. NTSAD also pioneered the development of community education about carrier screening programs for Tay-Sachs and related diseases, which became models for all genetic diseases.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, June 13 (Reuters) - EU regulators asked Visa
Europe's customers and rivals to assess its offer to cap
inter-bank credit card fees at the same level as competitor
MasterCard, among concessions intended to end an
antitrust investigation and avoid a possible fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The (European) Commission is now seeking feedback on these
proposals from interested parties through a market test," the EU
antitrust authority said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the proposals address the Commission's competition
concerns, the Commission may decide to make them legally binding
on Visa Europe," said the executive EU body, which acts as
antitrust regulator across the 27-country bloc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accepting the offer would mean no finding of wrongdoing nor
any fine for Visa Europe, the European licensee of Visa Inc
. The Commission unveiled details of the company's proposal
last month..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms JPMC 2002-CIBC5; Revises Outlook
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed JP Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage 
      Securities Corporation's (JPMC) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates, series 2002-CIBC5. A detailed list of rating actions 
      follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are attributed to increased credit enhancement levels 
      offset by fewer, more concentrated loans (by unpaid principal balance) 
      remaining in the pool. Based on Fitch's analysis, some of the remaining 
      loans may have difficulty refinancing their existing debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 2.2% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 2.4%, including losses already incurred. 
      The pool has experienced $23.2 million (2.3% of the original pool 
      balance) in realized losses to date. The pool has become highly 
      concentrated with only 12 loans remaining, compared to 46 at last 
      review. Fitch has designated three loans (19.9%) as Fitch Loans of 
      Concern, which includes one specially serviced asset (5.4%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Stable Rating Outlook on classes G, H and J indicates that despite 
      increased credit enhancement from principal paydown and defeasance, 
      upgrades are not likely due to increased concentration of loans in the 
      pool and the greater risk of adverse selection. The Negative Outlook on 
      classes M and N indicates that future downgrades are possible if the 
      collateral performance deteriorates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the June 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 94.3% to $56.9 million from $1 billion at 
      issuance. Two loans (35.1% of the pool) are defeased. Interest 
      shortfalls are currently affecting classes M through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest remaining non-defeased loan is secured by a 384,763 
      industrial property in Las Vegas, NV (26.4% of the pool). The 
      distribution facility is 100% leased to a single tenant - Southern Wine 
       Spirits of America on a triple-net (NNN) lease through year-end 2020. 
      As of 3rd quarter 2012, the servicer reported DSCR was 1.47x, in line 
      with performance from issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest remaining non-defeased loan is secured by a 118,298sf 
      retail property in Bedford, TX (23.9%). The center's anchor, Tom Thumb 
      Grocery, occupies 41% of the NRA until August 2017. All tenants are 
      under NNN leases. As of year-end 2012, the servicer reported DSCR was 
      0.88x, compared to 0.80x at YE11 and 1.00x at YE10. The poor performance 
      is due to the weak market. The borrower has to offer rent concessions to 
      compete in the market and maintain existing tenancy. As of 1st quarter 
      2013 rent roll, the property was 87.9% occupied.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes and revises the Rating Outlook as 
      indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$12.6 million class J at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook to Stable from Negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Fitch affirms the following classes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$10.1 million class G at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$18.8 million class H at 'BBB+sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5 million class K at 'BBsf'; Outlook Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5 million class L at 'Bsf'; Outlook Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5.3 million class M at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class N at 'Dsf'; RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The classes A-1, A-2, B, C, D, E, F and the interest only X-2 
      certificates have paid in full. Fitch does not rate the class NR 
      certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only 
      class X-1 certificates.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walter Energy Inc. (NYSE:WLT) (TSX:WLT), a leading, publicly traded 
      &#8220;pure-play&#8221; producer of metallurgical (met) coal for the global steel 
      industry, today said that it will not proceed at this time with a 
      refinancing of a portion of its existing debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company had said in a Current Report on Form 8-K dated June 5, 2013, 
      that it had begun exploring options to refinance a portion of its 
      existing debt and that the refinancing transactions could include 
      borrowings under a new secured term loan facility, a new revolving 
      credit facility, and an unsecured debt financing, the proceeds of which 
      the Company intended to use to repay outstanding indebtedness and to pay 
      fees and expenses related to the refinancing transactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earlier this year the Company completed a closing of a $450 million 
      senior note offering that provided enhanced financial flexibility and 
      liquidity. The Company has no material debt principal payments due until 
      2015, and it requires no incremental funding at this time. The proposed 
      refinancing would not have raised additional capital.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) said on Friday its private equity unit will become independent, the latest move by a financial institution to shed risky businesses amid financial reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first step toward separation from the bank, the unit, One Equity Partners, which manages $4.5 billion of investments, will raise its next investment fund externally rather than through JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Equity Partners will continue to manage existing portfolio companies for the bank, including the travel technology firm Travelport TRVPT.UL and the healthcare firms M*Modal and Wright Medical Group (WMGI.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The private equity business has become less appealing to banks because of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which includes limits on banks' investing their own money in such funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) has been winding down its private equity business, and in April Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.VX) agreed to sell a private equity unit to Blackstone Group (BX.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman did not immediately return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares were down 1.25 percent at $53.49 in morning trading on The New York Stock Exchange on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore and Peter Rudegeair in New York; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

      said NJPAC President and CEO John Schreiber. &#8220;Prudential's 
      remarkable support of NJPAC since our earliest days has enabled us to 
      grow and thrive, and John&#8217;s service as our new Board co-chair signals a

      of arts and culture and the transformational impact NJPAC can continue 
      to have on the fabric of life not only in Newark but throughout New

			JPMorgan Chase Announces One Equity Partners to Raise Future Funds 
      Independently
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) announced today that the partners of One 
      Equity Partners (OEP), the firm&#8217;s private equity unit, will begin to 
      raise their next fund from an external group of limited partners and 
      become independent from JPMorgan Chase. One Equity Partners currently 
      manages approximately $4.5 billion of investments for JPMorgan Chase in 
      direct private equity transactions and has produced strong returns over 
      the last twelve years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OEP will continue to make direct investments for JPMorgan Chase for an 
      interim period. OEP will still manage the existing group of portfolio 
      companies for JPMorgan Chase to maximize value for the firm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I have worked with the team at OEP for the past 12 years and have a lot 
      of respect for all that they have accomplished and the great value they 
      have delivered to the firm,&#8221; said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of 
      JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;Going forward, I am confident they will continue to be 
      extremely successful.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The One Equity team has produced strong returns over the years and we 
      have been extremely pleased with their results,&#8221; said Matt Zames, Chief 
      Operating Officer of JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;They have helped grow some great 
      companies. The time is right for them to seek new capital to strengthen 
      their global strategy, as they continue to manage our existing portfolio 
      to maximize value to the firm,&#8221; Mr. Zames added.

			Research and Markets: Global Virtualization Software Market 2012-2016 
      with Citrix Systems Inc., IBM Corp. and VMware Inc. Dominating
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/qps878/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Virtualization Software Market 2012-2016" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Virtualization Software market to grow 
      at a CAGR of 19.86 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key 
      factors contributing to this market growth is the increased need for 
      system utilization and productivity. The Global Virtualization Software 
      market has also been witnessing a rise in data center deployment. 
      However, slow adoption among SMEs due to need for high capital 
      investment could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this space include Citrix Systems Inc., IBM 
      Corp., Microsoft Corp., and VMware Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other vendors mentioned in the report are Amazon.com Inc., Desktone 
      Inc., MokaFive Inc., NComputing, Oracle Corp., Quest Software (Dell 
      Inc.), Red Hat Inc., Unidesk Corp., and Virtual Bridges Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the Data Center team said: In 
      recent years, there has been an increase in the deployment of data 
      centers. Since these data center providers increasingly adopt 
      virtualization solutions, it has led to an increasing adoption of 
      virtualization software. For instance, cloud and telecommunication 
      service providers are increasingly deploying data centers as it helps 
      them reduce the cost of infrastructure, technology, and human resources. 
      Moreover, data centers are helpful in disaster recovery and also improve 
      network infrastructure security. Hence, enterprises are consolidating 
      their applications and services into a single point of operation by 
      centralizing their systems. This also helps in reducing the overall cost 
      of network infrastructure maintenance. Therefore, the increasing 
      deployment of data centers is an emerging trend that is expected to have 
      a positive impact on the market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the key challenges in this market 
      is the slow adoption of virtualization software by SMEs, primarily 
      because of high capital investment. The adoption of virtualization 
      requires huge capital investments, especially while restructuring the 
      network infrastructure and procuring virtualization software solutions. 
      Hence, SMEs are delaying their adoption due to the high investments 
      required.

			Procter  Gamble and Stella McCartney Announce Fragrance License 
      Agreement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Procter  Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) and Stella McCartney today 
      announced that PG Prestige has signed a contract to enter into a 
      license agreement with Stella McCartney to manufacture and sell designer 
      fragrance products. Effective September 13, 2013, PG will begin to 
      develop and market new initiatives under the Stella McCartney brand name.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Stella McCartney is a truly iconic global brand with a modern, 
      naturally sexy and confident approach to fashion. She has a unique, 
      responsible approach to luxury and design. We look forward to extending 
      that approach to beauty even further,&#8221; said Joanne Crewes, President, 
      PG Prestige. &#8220;Stella McCartney enhances the PG Prestige portfolio, and 
      her passionate consumer base will enable us to reach more women around 
      the world. Her unique point-of-view combined with our expertise in the 
      fine fragrance category, our core strengths in brand building and 
      innovation, and our global retail partnerships, create a perfect 
      partnership for global growth and expansion. We are thrilled!&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Stella McCartney commented: "It is just an incredibly exciting time to 
      look at the world of Stella McCartney beauty and to have such an 
      opportunity with such a great partner in PG Prestige that understands 
      my beliefs. I am incredibly excited to get working and to start a new 
      world of beauty for us. There is so much energy already and we haven't 
      even started, I just feel like we can do really wonderful things and 
      explore the world of beauty, together, as a team.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The signing of the Stella McCartney fragrance license is consistent with 
      PG Prestige&#8217;s strategy to grow the business with strong brands with 
      global leadership potential. Stella McCartney is complementary to PG&#8217;s 
      existing designer fragrance portfolio and expands upon their strong 
      luxury fragrance brands.

			Chevron Confirms First Cargo from Angola LNG
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			First LNG project in Angola and one of the largest projects on the 
      African continent demonstrates further commercialization of Chevron&#8217;s 
      natural gas resources
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation&#8217;s (NYSE: CVX)
			subsidiary Cabinda Gulf Oil 
      Company Limited today confirmed that initial production of liquefied 
      natural gas (LNG) has commenced at the Angola LNG project. Angola LNG is 
      one of the largest energy projects on the African continent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;First gas at Angola LNG is an important milestone in support of our 
      strategic plan to grow our production,&#8221; said George Kirkland, vice 
      chairman of Chevron Corporation. &#8220;This project will commercialize 
      natural gas resources in western Africa to meet growing demand in the 
      region and internationally.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The $10 billion project will collect and transport natural gas from 
      offshore Angola to an onshore liquefaction plant on the coast near the 
      Congo River. The project has the capacity to produce 5.2 million metric 
      tons per year of LNG, 63,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids for 
      export and 125 million cubic feet per day of natural gas for domestic 
      consumption.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The project represents the first LNG project in Angola, and it is 
      expected to contribute to the development of Angola&#8217;s natural gas 
      industry,&#8221; said Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa and Latin 
      America Exploration and Production Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Angola LNG plans to use associated natural gas produced from existing 
      crude oil operations operated by Chevron and other partners as well as 
      new non-associated gas from other offshore fields. The project is 
      expected to reduce natural gas flaring and greenhouse gas emissions from 
      offshore producing areas, and support continued offshore oil field 
      development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s subsidiary, Cabinda Gulf Oil Company Limited, has a 36.4 
      percent interest in the joint-venture, along with Sonangol with a 22.8 
      percent interest and subsidiaries of Total, BP and ENI, each with a 13.6 
      percent interest.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, June 17 (Reuters) - Oil refiner Tesoro Corp
 won approval from U.S. antitrust regulators to buy
Northwest Products Pipeline system and related assets from
Chevron Corp, on the condition it sells a petroleum
terminal in Boise, Idaho.     
    Tesoro struck a deal in December to buy the assets from
Chevron for $400 million but lowered the price in May to $355
million after a renegotiation.
    As part of the deal, Tesoro bought the 760-mile pipeline,
along with a series of terminals. 
    The Federal Trade Commission said on Monday that with
ownership of two of the three full service light products
terminals the proposed transaction would have given the company
too much power in the Boise market and therefore required the
sale of one terminal.
    The FTC said it would allow Tesoro to close the transaction
immediately, but sell the terminal within six months.
    In a separate transaction, Tesoro won antitrust approval in
May to buy a BP refinery in southern California without
being required to sell any assets. That transaction was worth
$2.5 billion. 
    Tesoro closed at $57.61 per share and Chevron at $121.22 on
the New York Stock Exchange, each up 0.8 percent.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SAN ANTONIO - June 17, 2013 - Tesoro Logistics LP (NYSE:TLLP) ("TLLP" or the "Partnership") today announced that the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") has cleared the Partnership's acquisition of the Northwest Products Pipeline and Terminal System ("Northwest Products System") from Chevron Pipe Line Company and Northwest Terminalling Company.&#160; Pursuant to the regulatory review process, TLLP has agreed to divest its current refined products terminal in Boise, Idaho within 180 days.&#160; The divestiture of the existing Boise terminal is not expected to materially impact EBITDA.&#160; TLLP expects the acquisition of the Northwest Products System to close on June 19, 2013, subject to customary closing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased to have received the FTC's clearance of the Northwest Products System acquisition," said Greg Goff, TLLP's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.&#160; "We continue to expect that the system will allow TLLP to capture operational synergies with our existing terminal assets in the region and estimate that the assets will contribute $30 million to $35 million of EBITDA in the first twelve months of operation." &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The purchase price for the Northwest Products System is $355 million.&#160; Additionally, TLLP expects to invest $15 million to $25 million over the next two years to implement a comprehensive inspection and repair program to further improve the integrity of the pipeline system.&#160; The Partnership expects to utilize net proceeds from the $392 million equity offering in January 2013 to fund the acquisition of the Northwest Products System. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Northwest Products System consists of the Northwest Product Pipeline, a 760-mile Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-regulated common carrier products pipeline which extends from Salt Lake City, Utah to Spokane, Washington, a five-mile jet fuel pipeline to the Salt Lake City International Airport and certain assets of the Northwest Terminalling Company, consisting of refined products terminals in Boise and Pocatello, Idaho and Pasco, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The common carrier pipeline is the primary source of refined products to southern Idaho and is a major supplier of refined products to eastern Washington.&#160; For 2012, throughput volumes on the pipeline system averaged approximately 87,000 barrels per day.&#160; The terminals have a total storage capacity of 1.3 million barrels and delivered an average of approximately 56,000 barrels per day. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;About Tesoro Logistics LPTesoro Logistics LP, headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, is a fee-based, growth-oriented Delaware limited partnership formed by Tesoro Corporation to own, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined products logistics assets.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;This press release contains certain statements that are "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 concerning the transaction closing date; the capture of operational synergies; expected EBITDA from the assets to be acquired; and potential costs associated with the pipeline inspection program and integrity work.&#160; For more information concerning factors that could affect these statements see our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

&lt;p&gt;June 17 (IFR) - Chevron Corp on Monday kicked off the week
for the US primary high-grade market with a six-part deal
expected to be sized at about USD5bn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is expected to give a boost to a primary market
that has been deprived of major issuance activity in recent
weeks due to volatile Treasury rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Rio Tinto stepped in to break the dry spell,
raising USD3bn from a four-parter that was the largest deal of
the week. That deal, which attracted a book of USD7.25bn, showed
that issuers can still raise sizeable volume from the market
despite the concerns about Treasury yields as long as they are
conservative in pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pace of high-grade issuance was expected to pick up
today with Treasuries relatively flat on the back of a strong
rally in equity futures. Issuance in any case was expected to be
front-loaded to the first two days of the week ahead of the
conclusion of the Fed meeting on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock futures rallied following a report that the Bank of
Japan is considering increasing its REIT asset purchases. That
helped improve tone, which was tentative as of Friday afternoon
as bankers had no real clarity on the likely pace of issuance
this week. Reflecting the uncertainty, syndicate estimates for
the week stretch from USD5bn-25bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Empire State Manufacturing Survey data released earlier 
showed a much stronger-than-expected rise to +7.84 in June from
-1.43 in May. The median expectation was for a flat reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, rated Aa1/AA, is issuing three-year fixed
and/or floating rate notes; five-year fixed and/or floating rate
notes, seven-year and 10-year notes via Barclays, JP Morgan,
Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial price thoughts on the three-year fixed-rate
notes are Treasuries plus 70 basis points area; five-year
fixed-rate notes at Treasuries plus 90bp area; seven-year
fixed-rate notes at Treasuries plus 120bp area; and the 10-year
fixed-rate notes at Treasuries plus 130bp area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides Chevron, other issuers in the market on Monday
include MetLife and O'Reilly Automotive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentiment, however, remains fragile and investors will
carefully watch this week's main events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the focus will be on what Bernanke says at his
post-meeting press briefing when he is expected to unveil the
Fed's latest economic projections and provide greater clarity on
the likely timing for tapering asset purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on the calendar are Tuesday's CPI, housing starts and
building permits, and Thursday's Philly Fed, existing homes
sales and weekly jobless claims.&lt;/p&gt;

			J.P. Morgan Introduces Enhanced Collateral Management Services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Collateral CentralSM to 
      Provide Complete Collateral Portfolio Management for Buy- and Sell-side 
      Clients Across Custody, Clearing and Counterparty Relationships
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan today introduced significant enhancements to its 
      industry-leading collateral management business to help clients navigate 
      new industry regulations. Core to these enhancements is Collateral 
      CentralSM, a dynamic, real time service that provides clients 
      with advanced asset tracking, margin management, proprietary 
      optimization algorithms and analytics to support collateral activities 
      across a wide range of derivatives, securities and cash transactions in 
      real time. The roll out of these capabilities allows the management of 
      collateral to move from an operational consideration to the front line 
      of trading and portfolio management decision making.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Collateral Central includes the introduction of an innovative virtual 
      global longbox for J.P. Morgan clients&#8212;a single, comprehensive view of 
      their collateral assets and obligations&#8212;as well as access to dedicated 
      experts with whom they can discuss their collateral situation in real 
      time. Clients ultimately make their own strategic collateral decisions 
      and execute their transactions through Collateral Central.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kelly Mathieson, J.P. Morgan&#8217;s global head of collateral management, 
      said: &#8220;Clients are faced with increased market complexity and a changing 
      regulatory environment with regard to how they think about their 
      collateral. Collateral Central can help them navigate this new 
      landscape. For the first time, clients can manage and optimize their 
      entire collateral portfolio, regardless of counterparty, custodian or 
      clearing bank and across all supported geographies. J.P. Morgan is the 
      only collateral agent able to offer this comprehensive global solution.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ricky Maloney, co-head of service delivery for IGNIS Asset Management, 
      notes that, &#8220;Under the new regulatory framework, collateral has become 
      very valuable to us as an institution. Understanding all the assets we 
      hold, and the margin and other obligations that need to be met, allows 
      us to manage our collateral optimally. Ultimately, that affects our 
      bottom line.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In enhancing its collateral management business, J.P. Morgan has 
      designed services for institutions as varied as asset managers, pension 
      funds, corporations and banks, all of whom have to carefully monitor 
      their collateral in order to manage their market exposure and risk. The 
      service was created and will be managed by the J.P. Morgan&#8217;s Agency 
      Clearing, Collateral Management and Execution (ACCE) business within the 
      Corporate  Investment Bank.

      Research and Markets: Dewalt - DCT416 Imaging Thermometer Kit Reverse 
      Costing Analysis
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/hj4k8l/dewalt_dct416) 
      has announced the addition of the "Dewalt 
      - DCT416 Imaging Thermometer Kit Reverse Costing Analysis" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Being part of Dewalt 12V cordless tool platform ,the DCT416 Infrared 
      Imaging Thermometer is meant to bring thermal imaging tools to everyone 
      in the field. Its low-cost when compared with microbolometer-based 
      cameras is coming with the low thermal resolution of its 15x15 pixel 
      array. However the possibility to blend the thermal array with a visual 
      image enhances its usage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The thermal sensor used in this camera is a ceramic pyroelectric array. 
      A camera module, an infrared optical lens, a 2.2 display are packed in a 
      compact housing. The system with its accessories is supplied in a rigid 
      transport case.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on a complete teardown analysis, the report provides an estimation 
      of the production cost as well as the selling price of the product.

      Year Heavy Maintenance Contract for Exclusive Repair of General Electric 
      CF6-80C2 Engines
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      International Russian airline, Transaero Airlines (Moscow, 
      Russia) awarded GA Telesis Engine Services Oy (&#8220;GATES&#8221;)

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said that an assault it led earlier this month on one of the world's biggest cyber crime rings has freed at least 2 million PCs infected with a virus believed to have been used to steal more than $500 million from bank accounts worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We definitely have liberated at least 2 million PCs globally. That is a conservative estimate," Richard Domingues Boscovich, assistant general counsel with Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit, said in an interview on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the vast majority of infected machines were in the United States, Europe and Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and the FBI, aided by authorities in more than 80 countries, on June 5 sought to take down 1,400 malicious computer networks known as the Citadel Botnets by severing their access to infected machines. Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit is working with its partners overseas to determine exactly how many of the Citadel botnets are still operational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel confident that we really got most of the ones that we were after," he said. "It was a very, very successful disruptive action."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ringleader, who goes by the alias Aquabox, and dozens of botnet operators remain at large and the authorities are working to uncover their identities.

Microsoft said its creator bundled the software with pirated versions of the Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI, which on Tuesday declined to comment on its progress in its investigation of Citadel, has said it is working closely with Europol and other overseas authorities to capture the unknown criminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyber criminals typically infect machines by sending spam emails containing malicious links and attachments, and by infecting legitimate websites with computer viruses that attack unsuspecting visitors. Some bot herders rent or sell infected machines on underground markets to other cyber criminals looking to engage in a wide variety of activities including credit card theft and attacks on government websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Citadel software disables anti-virus programs on infected PCs so they cannot detect malicious software.

			Announces 
      Commencement of Construction on
			the Westphalia Property
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Westphalia Development Corporation (the "Corporation") 
      announced today that it broke ground on the Westphalia property.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On June 7, 2013, the Corporation's U.S. affiliate, Walton Westphalia 
      Development (USA), LLC, the operator of the property, received its rough 
      grading permit which allows for the clearing and grading on the property 
      in connection with Phase 1 construction. Rough grading and the 
      construction of storm water control ponds has commenced. The 
      infrastructure improvements and site work needed to begin mixed use 
      construction is anticipated to be completed by the first quarter of 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Phase 1 development of the Corporation's Westphalia property is 
      anticipated to consist of approximately 110 acres of land, which is 
      expected to comprise 347 townhomes, 400 rental apartments, 500,000 
      square feet of retail space and 150 hotel rooms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The total development of the Corporation's 310-acre Westphalia property 
      is anticipated to comprise approximately 66 single family homes, 779 
      townhomes, 884 rental apartments, 533,759 square feet of retail space, 
      2,240,000 square feet of office space and 600 hotel rooms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			GigaOM Pro Report on Private PaaS Features How JPMorgan Chase, 
      AmerisourceBergen and Diebold Benefit from Apprenda Private PaaS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GigaOM Pro today released a report titled, &#8220;Private 
      PaaS: the Next Generation Platform for Enterprises,&#8221; authored by 
      David Linthicum, highlighting the benefits of private PaaS for large 
      enterprises with massive, mission-critical application portfolios. 
      Innovators in strategic plans for cloud, JPMorgan 
      Chase, AmerisourceBergen 
      and Diebold, 
      are featured in the report detailing improved development and deployment 
      productivity and major savings and ROI by implementing Apprenda 
      private PaaS.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report notes that public PaaS may offer great benefits to 
      application development, but questions of security, protecting sensitive 
      data and compliance with audit and governmental policies cause 
      enterprises to turn to private cloud to meet these standards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The emergence of PaaS, specifically private PaaS, provides a clear 
      opportunity for enterprises to get much better at building business 
      applications at the speed businesses need them,&#8221; said David Linthicum, 
      analyst at GigaOM Research. &#8220;Enterprises have the ability to provide 
      developers with a centralized and unified self-service cloud application 
      platform that can deploy and manage their application development 
      processes, as well as the resulting application. Organizations have all 
      of this while still maintaining control, consistency, and quality of the 
      applications built, tested, and placed into production.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report details real-world examples of how Apprenda has saved major 
      financial organizations, large healthcare companies and major 
      manufacturing brands millions by rethinking how they build cloud 
      applications and migrate existing legacy apps. By implementing a private 
      PaaS strategy, Apprenda has enabled organizations to:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Increase efficiency and agility with a centralized and unified 
        self-service cloud application platform to maintain control, 
        consistency and quality of the applications built, tested and placed 
        into production.
      
			
				Maintain or improve compliance and security of mission-critical 
        data by housing it onsite in their own datacenter.
      
			
				Reduce complexity and simplify management by transforming their 
        servers into a single resource pool as well as defining policies that 
        allow developers to consume pre-defined configurations.
      
			
				Reduce costs with a scalable architecture where you &#8216;pay as you 
        grow&#8217; and only utilize resources on an as-needed basis without large 
        up-front investments.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The path to PaaS, specifically private PaaS, is not obvious and 
      enterprises need to understand their requirements before implementing a 
      PaaS strategy. For most enterprises, there is value in leveraging 
      private PaaS as a path to increase agility and meet organizational 
      demands without adding security and compliance risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      are getting onboard, and why&#8217;, can be found here: http://pro.gigaom.com/report/private-paas-the-next-generation-platform-for-enterprises.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      enterprises can develop, deliver and manage next generation applications

      InRule Technology announced today that InRule&#174;
			for 
      Microsoft Dynamics CRM is now Certified for Microsoft Dynamics, 
      which signifies that the solution has met Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s highest 
      standard for partner-developed software. By successfully meeting all 
      certification requirements, InRule for Microsoft Dynamics CRM can 
      now carry the distinct Certified for Microsoft Dynamics logo. The first

		&lt;p&gt;
      Solutions that are Certified for Microsoft Dynamics have demonstrated 
      development quality and compatibility with the Microsoft Dynamics 
      product on which they run by passing rigorous software testing for 
      Microsoft Dynamics performed by VeriTest (a service of Lionbridge). In 
      addition, the Microsoft Dynamics partner must have customers who are 
      successfully using the certified solution and are willing to recommend 
      it and be a Gold Certified Partner in the Microsoft Partner Program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dynamics solutions that have been tested for compatibility, meet high

      for partners to better promote their packaged Microsoft Dynamics 
      solution for customers.

      &#8220;In an ever-changing economic environment, organizations need to be

      solution to help them compete in their market.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Until now business rules and calculations had to be written and 
      maintained in workflows, C# code or JavaScript. This made changes 
      expensive, time consuming and often impossible. With InRule&#160;for 
      Microsoft Dynamics CRM, rules and calculations are managed by the 
      people who best understand it&#8212;without JavaScript&#8212;meaning changes can be 
      made to systems more quickly and with greater accuracy, improving time 
      to market and often reducing costs.

      &#8220;This recognition highlights two of InRule Technology&#8217;s passions: 
      delivering software of the highest quality to our customers and focusing

&lt;p&gt;* Chevron selling five Nigerian blocks in total&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Stake in reserves around 200-250 million oil barrels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Nigerian firms, partnered with foreign firms, to bid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Joe Brock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, June 18 (Reuters) - U.S.-based Chevron Corp 
is selling five Nigerian shallow-water oil blocks, the company
said on Tuesday, the latest oil major seeking to dispose of
assets in Africa's biggest producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell, Italy's Eni and
France's Total have sold several Nigerian onshore
blocks in recent years, while U.S. firm ConocoPhillips 
is selling its Nigerian businesses to Oando Energy for
about $1.79 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria wants more direct ownership of its oil and gas,
either through the state oil company or local firms, raising
concerns among foreign oil majors they may lose smaller assets
for nothing if they don't sell now, industry experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria also suffers from widespread oil theft and an
at-times difficult relationships with local communities, driving
up the costs of operating there, while a long-delayed energy
bill is stuck in parliament, adding to industry uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet foreign oil majors like Shell, Exxon Mobil and
Chevron remain keen on expanding offshore Nigeria and want to
keep hold of their biggest producing fields onshore, so any
disposals have tended to be of smaller, more marginal onshore
assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is selling its 40 percent stake in OML 52, 53 and 55
in the Niger Delta, the company said in a statement on Tuesday,
after announcing the sale of the same-sized stake in OML 83 and
OML 85 last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale will be handled by French Bank BNP Paribas
, oil and banking sources told Reuters. The bank did
not immediately respond to request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it would prefer to sell to local Nigerian
companies, in line with government regulations on boosting local
ownership of its oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the disposal would bring down operating costs,
improve efficiency and provide other smaller businesses,
particularly Nigerian indigenous companies, opportunities to
grow. "Chevron ... remains commitment to Nigeria," it added,
noting it had been in the country for more than 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Hydrocarbon Nigeria, which has partnered with
London-listed Afren on previous Nigeria deals, has
already expressed interest in at least one block, oil sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's share of the five blocks would amount to reserves
of between 200 million and 250 million barrels of combined crude
oil and condensate, two oil industry sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not disclose the reserves held in the blocks or what
it expects to earn from the sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Shell sold its blocks, although little-known local
companies won the bids, they were partnered by smaller foreign
firms, including Heritage Oil, Eland Oil, Afren
and Poland's Kulcsk Oil Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 18 (IFR) - Ian Gilday, Goldman Sachs' former
head of EMEA syndicate and leveraged capital markets, has
assumed a new role as head of origination for collateralised
loan obligations (CLOs) in the EMEA region, according to an
internal memo obtained by IFR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the memo, confirmed by Goldman Sachs, Gilday
has relocated to the securities division, working in fixed
income currency and commodities (FICC) credit as part of the
move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The is a newly created role and reflects an expected
resurgence in CLO activity over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three new European CLOs managed by Apollo, Pramerica and
Cairn, amounting to around EUR1bn in total, have already priced
in 2013, and some analysts predict the market could grow to as
much as EUR5bn in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to Gilday's move and effective immediately,
Littleton Glover will now head the EMEA leveraged finance
origination team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, Glover led the team responsible for all
leveraged finance transactions in the technology, media and
telecommunications (TMT), financial institutions group (FIG),
and real estate industry sectors throughout EMEA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Marsh will continue to lead EMEA leveraged finance
capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilday joined Goldman Sachs in 2005. Prior to that he headed
up the European leveraged capital markets team at Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes on the back of a series of other
organisational changes in Goldman's debt markets team in recent
months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Oliver Sedgwick was appointed sole head
of investment-grade syndicate for the EMEA region. Previously,
he co-headed the team with Martin Weber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weber was appointed head of the growth markets debt
financing business for the region, while also continuing to lead
the SSA debt origination business for EMEA.

&lt;p&gt;After being close partners for the past two years on Windows Phone, Microsoft was reportedly in deep talks with Nokia to acquire its phone business. But now, those discussions have fallen apart, the Wall Street Journal reports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The big issue? According to the WSJ&#8216;s sources, Microsoft backed off from the deal due to Nokia&#8217;s asking price as well as its weak position in the mobile industry. Given Nokia&#8217;s performance over the past few years, I can&#8217;t blame Microsoft for backing away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia was once the world&#8217;s top phone maker, but Samsung ended up snatching its throne a year ago. After failing to come up with its own iPhone competitor, Nokia joined up with Microsoft to become its key Windows Phone hardware partner. That led to Nokia&#8217;s Lumia phones, which have typically been critically loved but ignored by consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reportedly paid Nokia more than $1 billion to move to Windows Phone, a cost which likely factored heavily into the acquisition talks. Given Nokia&#8217;s current $14 billion market cap, snapping up its phone business would have cost Microsoft a pretty penny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Surface tablets, Microsoft proved it could make high-quality hardware on its own. The company is also reportedly working on a Surface Phone, which would be a bold way to compete with the iPhone but would also severely diminish Nokia&#8217;s standing as the Windows Phone golden child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, Microsoft may just be better off trying to build a phone of its own rather than taking on all of Nokia&#8217;s history and corporate drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m honestly surprised I feel this way &#8212; I remember defending the Nokia/Windows Phone deal to hordes of Symbian fanboys. But even though Lumia sales are finally beginning to creep up, Microsoft needs more than just an incremental upgrade to take on the iPhone and Android. It needs a killer device that makes people instantly want to dump their current smartphone. And despite its tremendous legacy, I&#8217;m becoming less and less confident in Nokia&#8217;s capability to deliver that miracle device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Ballmer photo: Devindra Hardawar/VentureBeat&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Deals, Gadgets, Mobile&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA, June 19, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ebix, Inc. (Nasdaq:EBIX), a leading international supplier of On-Demand software and E-commerce services to the insurance industry, announced today that it and an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs  Co. ("Goldman Sachs") have agreed to terminate their previously announced merger agreement. The merger agreement, announced on May 1, 2013, had provided for Ebix to be acquired by an affiliate of Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The decision to terminate the merger agreement was the result of a letter received by the Company on June 14, 2013 from the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia that it had opened an investigation into allegations of intentional misconduct that had been brought to its attention from the pending shareholder class action lawsuits against the Company's directors and officers, the media and other sources. The pending shareholder class action lawsuits and an SEC investigation involving the same subject matters as these lawsuits were previously disclosed by the Company in its periodic reports filed with the SEC. The Company has been informed by the office of the U.S. Attorney that their investigation is in its preliminary stages and that it is too early to make a determination of whether any violation of the securities laws or other laws has occurred, or whether any individual or entity could be considered a target, subject or witness in the investigation.&#160;The merger agreement is being terminated without payment of a termination fee by either party and each party and certain significant shareholders of the Company and each of their respective affiliates have agreed to release each other from all claims arising under or related to the terminated merger agreement and related transaction agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We believe the allegations in the class action suits are without merit," said Robin Raina, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ebix. "We want to thank Goldman Sachs for their interest in acquiring Ebix and we are naturally disappointed that we could not complete a transaction at this time. The Company remains focused on running its business and continuing to provide its customers with the high quality products and services on which they rely. The Company's balance sheet remains strong and we believe the Company is well positioned for future growth and success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Mr. Pavan Bhalla, Chairman of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors, said, "We are committed to fully cooperate with all the regulatory authorities, as they conduct their investigations and believe that the allegations in the class action lawsuits, which we have understood to form the basis of these investigations are without any merit.&#160;We look forward to what we expect will be a favorable resolution of these matters.&#160;We are committed to the highest standards of integrity in our business and have confidence in the ability of the Ebix management team to lead the Company forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Company Board of Directors also announced that it intends to continue to evaluate strategic options for the Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On May 10, 2013, the Company announced results for the first quarter of 2013.&#160;Total first quarter 2013 revenue was $52.6 million, an increase of 20% on a year-over-year basis, as compared to first quarter 2012 revenue of $43.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") for the first quarter 2013 rose 13% year-over-year to $0.45, as compared to $0.40 in the first quarter of 2012. For purposes of the first quarter 2013 EPS calculation, there was an average of 38.8 million diluted shares outstanding during the quarter, as compared to 39.5 million diluted shares outstanding in first quarter 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Ebix continues to have highly diversified revenue streams across thousands of clients, with the largest client accounting for only 2.5% of the Company's first quarter 2013 revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      The fifth graf should read: As of 4 p.m., New York City time, on June 
      19, 2013, the exchange offer was oversubscribed, with approximately 
      868,006,432 shares of Pfizer common stock having been validly tendered 
      for exchange and not validly withdrawn. (sted: As of 4 p.m., New York 
      City time, on June 18, 2013, xxx)

      The corrected release reads:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			PFIZER ANNOUNCES FINAL EXCHANGE RATIO OF 0.9898 FOR ZOETIS EXCHANGE 
      OFFER AND AUTOMATIC EXTENSION OF OFFER TO MIDNIGHT ON FRIDAY, JUNE 21, 
      2013
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced the final exchange ratio in 
      connection with its previously announced offer to its shareholders to 
      exchange some or all of their shares of Pfizer common stock for shares 
      of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE: ZTS) common stock held by Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For each share of Pfizer common stock that is validly tendered and not 
      validly withdrawn by shareholders and that is accepted by Pfizer 
      pursuant to the exchange offer, Pfizer will deliver 0.9898 shares of 
      Zoetis common stock to or at the direction of such tendering holder. 
      Because the exchange offer will be subject to proration if the exchange 
      offer is oversubscribed, the number of shares of Pfizer common stock 
      that Pfizer accepts in the exchange offer may be less than the number of 
      shares validly tendered by shareholders. Based on the final exchange 
      ratio, Pfizer will accept for exchange 405,117,195 shares of its common 
      stock if the exchange offer is fully subscribed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The final calculated per-share value of Pfizer common stock and the 
      final calculated per-share value of Zoetis common stock, in each case 
      determined in the manner described in the exchange offer prospectus, 
      would have resulted in an exchange ratio of more than the upper limit of 
      0.9898. Accordingly, the final exchange ratio has been set at 0.9898 
      shares of Zoetis common stock for each share of Pfizer common stock 
      accepted in the exchange offer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Because the upper limit is in effect, the exchange offer has been 
      automatically extended to 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Friday, 
      June 21, 2013, as provided by the terms of the exchange offer. 
      Accordingly, Pfizer shareholders may tender or withdraw their shares of 
      Pfizer common stock until that time by following the procedures 
      described in the exchange offer prospectus and related letter of 
      transmittal. The completion of the exchange offer is subject to certain 
      conditions as set forth in the exchange offer prospectus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of 4 p.m., New York City time, on June 19, 2013, the exchange offer 
      was oversubscribed, with approximately 868,006,432 shares of Pfizer 
      common stock having been validly tendered for exchange and not validly 
      withdrawn.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, BofA Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs  Co. and 
      Morgan Stanley are serving as the dealer managers for the exchange offer.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Vermont police arrested 33 people on drug charges on Wednesday in a sweep aimed at tackling the state's growing heroin and cocaine problem, according to the state police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation followed a six-month investigation by the police drug task force of rising drugs flows into the Green Mountain State from cities such as New York and Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweep included house searches and seizures in Springfield and Ludlow. Officials have not said how many drugs, money or material was discovered in the searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffickers seeking to take advantage of higher street prices in Vermont towns have been sending in more drugs from other areas of the northeastern United States in recent years, triggering what officials have called an epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There isn't a Vermonter that doesn't know someone that is addicted to opiates or who has had their home or property broken into by someone who is addicted," said Public Safety Commissioner Keith Flynn in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweep targeted 36 people, most on cocaine or heroin trafficking charges, but three escaped arrest and are believed to be out of the state.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms IBM's IDRs at 'A+/F1'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of International Business 
      Machines Corporation (IBM) as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-term IDR at 'F1';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial paper (CP) rating at 'F1'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Furthermore, Fitch has withdrawn all ratings for IBM International Group 
      Capital LLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's action affects approximately $43 
      billion of debt, including IBM's undrawn $10 billion credit facility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings and Outlook reflect IBM's:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Strong company profile primarily supported by i) significant revenue 
      market share in information technology (IT) services (No.1), servers 
      (No.1), enterprise software (No.1) and external storage (No.3); ii) 
      solid recurring revenue (50%) from IT services, software and financing 
      that mitigates revenue and profit volatility; and iii) highly 
      diversified revenue base by offering, customer, industry and geography 
      (65%+ revenue outside U.S.).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Exceptional financial flexibility due to i) robust internal liquidity 
      with a significant cash position ($12 billion) and free cash flow (FCF) 
      exceeding $11 billion since 2008; ii) solid external liquidity with an 
      undrawn $10 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) due 2017 and ready 
      access to capital markets; iii) strong credit protection metrics; and 
      iv) roughly $28 billion of finance receivables (57% short-term and 60% 
      considered investment grade).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Well-executed management strategy, including i) ability to identify 
      early trends that present significant higher margin, long-term growth 
      opportunities and reposition investment priorities, both organic and 
      inorganic, to capitalize on these opportunities (i.e. analytics and 
      growth markets); ii) consistent and sizable investments in RD (6% of 
      revenue) to develop innovative differentiated solutions that leverage 
      IBM's entire portfolio of offerings and command higher profit margins 
      (i.e. Smarter Planet); iii) core competency in identifying and 
      integrating strategic acquisitions; and iv) established track record of 
      consistently meeting or exceeding financial forecasts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating concerns center on:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Risk of core debt (non-financing) increases to achieve financial 
      and/or business objectives, such as sizable debt-financed share 
      repurchases and/or acquisitions, resulting in a material reduction of 
      credit protection measures. Fitch notes IBM has significant incremental 
      debt capacity without adversely affecting its current credit ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Consistent, material increases in cash dividends long-term, which 
      could pressure FCF and financial flexibility in the absence of 
      commensurate growth in profitability. This could necessitate further 
      increases in core debt to fund acquisitions and/or share repurchases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --IBM's increasing dependence on mainframe (System Z) refresh cycles to 
      maintain profitability in the Systems and Technology Group (STG) due to 
      IBM's underperforming storage business, weak industry demand for 
      UNIX-based Power servers as more and increasingly diverse workloads are 
      performed on low-cost x86 industry standard servers (ISS), and negative 
      revenue mix shift as ISS are considerably less profitable than UNIX.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Declining demand for UNIX-based Power systems also adversely affects the 
      profitability of STG's microelectronics business, which designs and 
      manufactures the Power microprocessors used in Power servers. The 
      decline in UNIX server demand also carries negative longer-term revenue 
      and margin ramifications for IBM's support services and financing 
      businesses relating to Power servers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM's strategy to reverse the decline in Power server demand is to 
      expand the Power platform to address the open-source Linux market. IBM 
      first introduced PowerLinux solutions in April 2012 and currently offers 
      three Power-based Linux systems, including the PureFlex System, a 
      pre-integrated offering of compute, storage, networking, virtualization 
      and management. As for ISS, Fitch believes IBM lacks the scale and 
      purchasing leverage to profitably compete against Hewlett-Packard 
      Company and Dell Inc. in this highly competitive market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The long-term threat to highly profitable mainframe demand and 
      associated operating system software (zOS) from ISS.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes the company's lack of a strategic rationale to maintain a 
      higher rating at the expense of financial flexibility required for 
      acquisitions or shareholder-friendly activities limits further positive 
      rating actions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings may be downgraded in the event of:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --A shift to more aggressive financial policies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM has strong financial flexibility and liquidity supported by nearly 
      $12 billion of cash and equivalents as of March 31, 2013 and an undrawn 
      $10 billion RCF expiring on Nov. 10, 2017. Liquidity is further 
      supported by strong and consistent annual FCF (post-dividends) exceeding 
      $11 billion since 2008.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects IBM's FCF to exceed $11 billion in 2013. This is primarily 
      due to continued profit margin expansion, reflecting a more favorable 
      revenue mix and continued cost discipline, offset by substantial 
      incremental cash taxes. Also a factor is modest top-line growth led by 
      Smarter Planet solutions, business analytics, growth markets and cloud 
      computing. Fitch expects IBM to continue to use FCF for acquisitions, 
      particularly in the software and services industries, aggressive share 
      repurchases and dividend payments to shareholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The underfunded status of IBM's worldwide defined benefit (DB) pension 
      plans deteriorated to negative $14.4 billion (86% funded) at year-end 
      2012 from negative $10.4 billion (89% funded) in 2011. This is primarily 
      due to lower discount rates in the U.S. and worldwide plans, which 
      increased the present value of IBM's future pension liability (U.S. 
      discount rate declined 60 basis points to 3.6%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Excluding unfunded nonqualified DB pension plans, the funded status of 
      IBM's U.S. and worldwide plans at year-end 2012 was 98% and 94%, 
      respectively. In 2013, IBM is required to make legally mandated 
      contributions of $700 million to its international DB plans. This 
      compares with approximately $600 million actually contributed in 2012. 
      The amount of the 2013 pension contribution is very manageable given the 
      amount and consistency of IBM's cash flow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes IBM has more than ample liquidity to satisfy its 
      longer-term legally mandated pension funding requirements (estimated at 
      approximately $4 billion through 2017). This estimate could increase due 
      to more frequent re-measurement of funded status in certain non-U.S. 
      countries and the performance of financial markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total debt was $33.4 billion as of March 31, 2013, and consisted of $8.7 
      billion of short-term debt (including $1.8 billion of CP) and $24.7 
      billion of long-term debt. Fitch estimates $25.2 billion (76%) of total 
      debt is attributable to IBM's global financing business with the 
      remaining debt attributable to core (non-financing) operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the purpose of financial evaluation, Fitch analyzes IBM's core 
      business and financing activities separately, since they are capitalized 
      differently and have dissimilar cash flow characteristics. IBM Global 
      Finance (IGF) accounted for nearly 9% of IBM's pre-tax earnings in 2012. 
      This, however, represents the largest component of IBM's balance sheet, 
      constituting approximately 23% of total assets and 24% of total 
      liabilities as of March 31, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM has $3.0 billion of long-term debt maturing in the remainder of 2013 
      followed by $3.8 billion of maturities in 2014. Fitch believes IBM will 
      refinance the vast majority of the upcoming debt maturities in order to 
      maintain a targeted debt/equity ratio of approximately 7x for the 
      financing business and maintain a permanent amount of core debt in the 
      capital structure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total leverage and interest coverage as of March 31, 2013 were 
      relatively unchanged at 1.3x and 26.5x, respectively. Core leverage and 
      interest coverage remained flat at 0.3x and 55x, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The main purpose of IGF is to facilitate clients' acquisition of IBM 
      systems, software and services by providing financial and capital 
      management solutions. IGF has a solid long-term operating record, 
      provides strategic advantages to IBM in terms of attracting and 
      retaining customers by delivering total solutions. IBM also generates an 
      annuity-like revenue stream associated with multi-year leases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IGF's primary focus on IBM's products and clients mitigates some risks 
      associated with financing via a deep knowledge of its client base and 
      clear insight into the solutions being financed. Asset quality metrics 
      have remained relatively solid as a result of the relatively 
      conservative underwriting culture and strong risk management 
      capabilities. IGF's capitalization remains solid for the rating category 
      and leverage levels continue to hover near management's target of 7x.

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK, June 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings
of 
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) as follows: 
--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+';
--Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'A+';
--Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; 
--Short-term IDR at 'F1'; 
--Commercial paper (CP) rating at 'F1'.
Furthermore, Fitch has withdrawn all ratings for IBM
International Group Capital 
LLC. 
The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's action affects
approximately $43 billion 
of debt, including IBM's undrawn $10 billion credit facility.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
The ratings and Outlook reflect IBM's:
--Strong company profile primarily supported by i) significant
revenue market 
share in information technology (IT) services (No.1), servers
(No.1), enterprise 
software (No.1) and external storage (No.3); ii) solid recurring
revenue (50%) 
from IT services, software and financing that mitigates revenue
and profit 
volatility; and iii) highly diversified revenue base by
offering, customer, 
industry and geography (65%+ revenue outside U.S.).
--Exceptional financial flexibility due to i) robust internal
liquidity with a 
significant cash position ($12 billion) and free cash flow (FCF)
exceeding $11 
billion since 2008; ii) solid external liquidity with an undrawn
$10 billion 
revolving credit facility (RCF) due 2017 and ready access to
capital markets; 
iii) strong credit protection metrics; and iv) roughly $28
billion of finance 
receivables (57% short-term and 60% considered investment
grade). 
--Well-executed management strategy, including i) ability to
identify early 
trends that present significant higher margin, long-term growth
opportunities 
and reposition investment priorities, both organic and
inorganic, to capitalize 
on these opportunities (i.e. analytics and growth markets); ii)
consistent and 
sizable investments in R (6% of revenue) to develop innovative
differentiated 
solutions that leverage IBM's entire portfolio of offerings and
command higher 
profit margins (i.e. Smarter Planet); iii) core competency in
identifying and 
integrating strategic acquisitions; and iv) established track
record of 
consistently meeting or exceeding financial forecasts.
Rating concerns center on:
--Risk of core debt (non-financing) increases to achieve
financial and/or 
business objectives, such as sizable debt-financed share
repurchases and/or 
acquisitions, resulting in a material reduction of credit
protection measures. 
Fitch notes IBM has significant incremental debt capacity
without adversely 
affecting its current credit ratings. 
--Consistent, material increases in cash dividends long-term,
which could 
pressure FCF and financial flexibility in the absence of
commensurate growth in 
profitability. This could necessitate further increases in core
debt to fund 
acquisitions and/or share repurchases.
--IBM's increasing dependence on mainframe (System Z) refresh
cycles to maintain 
profitability in the Systems and Technology Group (STG) due to
IBM's 
underperforming storage business, weak industry demand for
UNIX-based Power 
servers as more and increasingly diverse workloads are performed
on low-cost x86 
industry standard servers (ISS), and negative revenue mix shift
as ISS are 
considerably less profitable than UNIX. 
Declining demand for UNIX-based Power systems also adversely
affects the 
profitability of STG's microelectronics business, which designs
and manufactures 
the Power microprocessors used in Power servers. The decline in
UNIX server 
demand also carries negative longer-term revenue and margin
ramifications for 
IBM's support services and financing businesses relating to
Power servers. 
IBM's strategy to reverse the decline in Power server demand is
to expand the 
Power platform to address the open-source Linux market. IBM
first introduced 
PowerLinux solutions in April 2012 and currently offers three
Power-based Linux 
systems, including the PureFlex System, a pre-integrated
offering of compute, 
storage, networking, virtualization and management. As for ISS,
Fitch believes 
IBM lacks the scale and purchasing leverage to profitably
compete against 
Hewlett-Packard Company and Dell Inc. in this highly competitive
market.
--The long-term threat to highly profitable mainframe demand and
associated 
operating system software (zOS) from ISS. 
KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES
Fitch believes the company's lack of a strategic rationale to
maintain a higher 
rating at the expense of financial flexibility required for
acquisitions or 
shareholder-friendly activities limits further positive rating
actions.
The ratings may be downgraded in the event of:
--A shift to more aggressive financial policies. 
IBM has strong financial flexibility and liquidity supported by
nearly $12 
billion of cash and equivalents as of March 31, 2013 and an
undrawn $10 billion 
RCF expiring on Nov. 10, 2017. Liquidity is further supported by
strong and 
consistent annual FCF (post-dividends) exceeding $11 billion
since 2008. 
Fitch expects IBM's FCF to exceed $11 billion in 2013. This is
primarily due to 
continued profit margin expansion, reflecting a more favorable
revenue mix and 
continued cost discipline, offset by substantial incremental
cash taxes. Also a 
factor is modest top-line growth led by Smarter Planet
solutions, business 
analytics, growth markets and cloud computing. Fitch expects IBM
to continue to 
use FCF for acquisitions, particularly in the software and
services industries, 
aggressive share repurchases and dividend payments to
shareholders.
The underfunded status of IBM's worldwide defined benefit (DB)
pension plans 
deteriorated to negative $14.4 billion (86% funded) at year-end
2012 from 
negative $10.4 billion (89% funded) in 2011. This is primarily
due to lower 
discount rates in the U.S. and worldwide plans, which increased
the present 
value of IBM's future pension liability (U.S. discount rate
declined 60 basis 
points to 3.6%). 
Excluding unfunded nonqualified DB pension plans, the funded
status of IBM's 
U.S. and worldwide plans at year-end 2012 was 98% and 94%,
respectively. In 
2013, IBM is required to make legally mandated contributions of
$700 million to 
its international DB plans. This compares with approximately
$600 million 
actually contributed in 2012. The amount of the 2013 pension
contribution is 
very manageable given the amount and consistency of IBM's cash
flow.
Fitch believes IBM has more than ample liquidity to satisfy its
longer-term 
legally mandated pension funding requirements (estimated at
approximately $4 
billion through 2017). This estimate could increase due to more
frequent 
re-measurement of funded status in certain non-U.S. countries
and the 
performance of financial markets. 
Total debt was $33.4 billion as of March 31, 2013, and consisted
of $8.7 billion 
of short-term debt (including $1.8 billion of CP) and $24.7
billion of long-term 
debt. Fitch estimates $25.2 billion (76%) of total debt is
attributable to IBM's 
global financing business with the remaining debt attributable
to core 
(non-financing) operations. 
For the purpose of financial evaluation, Fitch analyzes IBM's
core business and 
financing activities separately, since they are capitalized
differently and have 
dissimilar cash flow characteristics. IBM Global Finance (IGF)
accounted for 
nearly 9% of IBM's pre-tax earnings in 2012. This, however,
represents the 
largest component of IBM's balance sheet, constituting
approximately 23% of 
total assets and 24% of total liabilities as of March 31, 2013. 
IBM has $3.0 billion of long-term debt maturing in the remainder
of 2013 
followed by $3.8 billion of maturities in 2014. Fitch believes
IBM will 
refinance the vast majority of the upcoming debt maturities in
order to maintain 
a targeted debt/equity ratio of approximately 7x for the
financing business and 
maintain a permanent amount of core debt in the capital
structure. 
Total leverage and interest coverage as of March 31, 2013 were
relatively 
unchanged at 1.3x and 26.5x, respectively. Core leverage and
interest coverage 
remained flat at 0.3x and 55x, respectively. 
The main purpose of IGF is to facilitate clients' acquisition of
IBM systems, 
software and services by providing financial and capital
management solutions. 
IGF has a solid long-term operating record, provides strategic
advantages to IBM 
in terms of attracting and retaining customers by delivering

IBM also generates an annuity-like revenue stream associated
with multi-year

IGF's primary focus on IBM's products and clients mitigates some
risks 
associated with financing via a deep knowledge of its client

insight into the solutions being financed. Asset quality metrics
have remained 
relatively solid as a result of the relatively conservative
underwriting culture 
and strong risk management capabilities. IGF's capitalization
remains solid for 
the rating category and leverage levels continue to hover near
management's 
target of 7x.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday limited the extent to which former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) vice president Fabrice Tourre can argue that he was acting on the advice of company lawyers in his defense against charges that he misled investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling could be another setback for Tourre ahead of his trial on July 15, after the judge earlier this month rejected his argument that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission should narrow its case against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government accuses Tourre of failing to tell investors in a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) known as Abacus that hedge fund Paulson &amp; Co had helped choose the underlying mortgages and then bet against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a written ruling on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest said she would "limit Tourre's ability to focus on the presence and participation of lawyers" at his trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest said Tourre's opening arguments should not include references to the presence and involvement of lawyers at meetings where Abacus was discussed. She also said she would provide a "limiting instruction" preventing his defense lawyers from referring to lawyers in a way that suggests Tourre relied on them to vet the Abacus transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, she stopped short of precluding Tourre's lawyers from presenting any evidence that showed the presence of lawyers, which the SEC had requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In short, Tourre will not be precluded altogether from saying the words 'counsel,' 'lawyer,' or 'attorney,'" Forrest wrote in her decision. "But nor will he be permitted to zero in on the presence or involvement of lawyers for the sake of highlighting their presence or involvement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a hearing on Friday, the SEC had asked the judge to preclude Tourre from presenting an "advice of counsel" argument in which the approval of the transaction by attorneys at Goldman and other entities involved would essentially shield him from fault. Goldman agreed to pay $550 million to settle its part of the case, without admitting wrongdoing, in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC has said that internal memos, emails and other evidence showing that lawyers approved the CDO could create the false impression that Tourre had disclosed to them the full extent of Paulson's involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyers, meanwhile, said that their client did not intend to use an "advice of counsel" defense. They contend that Tourre thought Goldman's "institutional processes," such as approval of the CDO by various Goldman committees, ensured adequate legal review of the CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her decision on Tuesday, Forrest green-lighted that line of defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tourre will be allowed to present evidence tending to show that he was not the person primarily responsible for the transaction and that the transaction occurred in the context of a sophisticated financial institution," Forrest wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Tourre declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for the SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bernard Vaughan; Editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is looking to recruit computer geeks in its ongoing efforts to protect Windows PCs from attacks, offering rewards of as much as $150,000 to anybody who helps identify and fix major security holes in its software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft unveiled the rewards program, one of the most generous in the high-tech industry to date, on Wednesday as it sought ways to prevent sophisticated attackers from subverting new security technologies it has introduced in the latest versions of the Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is open to computer experts as young as 14, though minors need permission from their parents. Residents of countries under U.S. sanctions, such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria, are banned from the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheer size of the bonus is likely to grab the attention of the hacking community, though claiming the big money will require them to do battle with Microsoft's latest anti-hacking technology and then detail their approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's pretty generous, though what they are asking for is a pretty high bar," said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer of Veracode, a security firm that helps identify software bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has plenty of competition in getting elite hackers to turn their attention on its aging Windows franchise, which operates the vast majority of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows computers have been involved in most major attacks to date, including the recent Citadel cyber crime ring that stole more than $500 million from banks and the Stuxnet virus that attacked Iran's nuclear program in 2010 by exploiting previously unknown bugs in Microsoft software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPETING FOR TALENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best hackers are heavily recruited by the military, intelligence agencies and big corporations, who lure them with scholarships and high-paying jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also competing for the attention of the top hacking talent on a growing global gray market, where information about vulnerabilities is sold to criminals as well as governments that use it in military and intelligence operations. Bounties start at $50,000 for tools that enable attackers to break into computers, even when they are protected by up-to-date security software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the industry, exploits of such vulnerabilities are called "zero-days," because a targeted software maker has had zero days' notice to fix the hole when the malicious software is eventually discovered. (See SPECIAL REPORT: link.reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Reavey, senior director with the Microsoft Security Response Center, declined in an interview to talk about the "zero day" market for vulnerabilities in Windows products, saying the company was seeking to encourage hackers to use their skills in helpful ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's difficult to comment on the dark side," he said. "The intention of these (bounty) programs is to incentivize good behavior."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reavey said he hoped Microsoft's new program would woo some candidates away from an annual contest known as Pwn2Own (pronounced "pown to own"), which has become a key venue for elite hackers to disclose major security flaws in software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest Pwn2Own, which was held in Vancouver in March and sponsored by Hewlett-Packard Co, paid out nearly $480,000 in prize money, according to HP's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hackers won the competition by identifying new ways to "pwn," or take ownership of, browsers from Microsoft, Firefox and Google Inc, Oracle Corp's Java and Adobe System Inc's Flash and Reader software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other big technology firms already offer similar programs. Google has handed out $1.7 million in 3 years, including prizes as big as $60,000. Facebook Inc said it has paid out $500,000 to $1 million since it began its program two years ago. Adobe does not offer bounties, though it brings in hackers as temporary consultants to help fix problems that they identify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also running a one-month contest, starting July 26, offering bounties of up to $11,000 to hackers who find bugs in the trial version of its new Internet Explorer 11 browser, which will be in preview release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

wrote in her decision. "But nor will he be permitted to zero in
on the presence or involvement of lawyers for the sake of

and other entities involved would essentially shield him from
fault. Goldman agreed to pay $550 million to settle its part of
the case, without admitting wrongdoing, in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC has said that internal memos, emails and other
evidence showing that lawyers approved the CDO could create the
false impression that Tourre had disclosed to them the full
extent of Paulson's involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyers, meanwhile, said that their client did not
intend to use an "advice of counsel" defense. They contend that
Tourre thought Goldman's "institutional processes," such as
approval of the CDO by various Goldman committees, ensured
adequate legal review of the CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her decision on Tuesday, Forrest green-lighted that line
of defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tourre will be allowed to present evidence tending to show
that he was not the person primarily responsible for the
transaction and that the transaction occurred in the context of
a sophisticated financial institution," Forrest wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Tourre declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for the SEC did not immediately respond to
a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* New program to pay reward up to $150,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Google, Facebook offer similar programs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Underground market offers steep bounties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jim Finkle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, June 19 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is
looking to recruit computer geeks in its ongoing efforts to
protect Windows PCs from attacks, offering rewards of as much as
$150,000 to anybody who helps identify and fix major security
holes in its software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft unveiled the rewards program, one of the most
generous in the high-tech industry to date, on Wednesday as it
sought ways to prevent sophisticated attackers from subverting
new security technologies it has introduced in the latest
versions of the Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is open to computer experts as young as 14,
though minors need permission from their parents. Residents of
countries under U.S. sanctions, such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea,
Sudan and Syria, are banned from the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheer size of the bonus is likely to grab the attention
of the hacking community, though claiming the big money will
require them to do battle with Microsoft's latest anti-hacking
technology and then detail their approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's pretty generous, though what they are asking for is a
pretty high bar," said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer
of Veracode, a security firm that helps identify software bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has plenty of competition in getting elite hackers
to turn their attention on its aging Windows franchise, which
operates the vast majority of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows computers have been involved in most major attacks
to date, including the recent Citadel cyber crime ring that
stole more than $500 million from banks and the Stuxnet virus
that attacked Iran's nuclear program in 2010 by exploiting
previously unknown bugs in Microsoft software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPETING FOR TALENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best hackers are heavily recruited by the military,
intelligence agencies and big corporations, who lure them with
scholarships and high-paying jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also competing for the attention of the top
hacking talent on a growing global gray market, where
information about vulnerabilities is sold to criminals as well
as governments that use it in military and intelligence
operations. Bounties start at $50,000 for tools that enable
attackers to break into computers, even when they are protected
by up-to-date security software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the industry, exploits of such vulnerabilities are called
"zero-days," because a targeted software maker has had zero
days' notice to fix the hole when the malicious software is
eventually discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Reavey, senior director with the Microsoft Security
Response Center, declined in an interview to talk about the
"zero day" market for vulnerabilities in Windows products,
saying the company was seeking to encourage hackers to use their
skills in helpful ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's difficult to comment on the dark side," he said.
"The intention of these (bounty) programs is to incentivize good
behavior."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reavey said he hoped Microsoft's new program would woo some
candidates away from an annual contest known as Pwn2Own
(pronounced "pown to own"), which has become a key venue for
elite hackers to disclose major security flaws in software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest Pwn2Own, which was held in Vancouver in March and
sponsored by Hewlett-Packard Co, paid out nearly
$480,000 in prize money, according to HP's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hackers won the competition by identifying new ways to
"pwn," or take ownership of, browsers from Microsoft, Firefox
and Google Inc, Oracle Corp's Java and Adobe
System Inc's Flash and Reader software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other big technology firms already offer similar
programs. Google has handed out $1.7 million in 3 years,
including prizes as big as $60,000. Facebook Inc said it
has paid out $500,000 to $1 million since it began its program
two years ago. Adobe does not offer bounties, though it brings
in hackers as temporary consultants to help fix problems that
they identify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also running a one-month contest, starting July
26, offering bounties of up to $11,000 to hackers who find bugs
in the trial version of its new Internet Explorer 11 browser,
which will be in preview release.&lt;/p&gt;

			Procter  Gamble and Alexander McQueen Announce Fragrance License 
      Agreement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Procter  Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) and Alexander McQueen today 
      announced that PG Prestige has signed a contract to enter into a 
      license agreement with Alexander McQueen to manufacture and sell 
      designer fragrance products. Effective immediately, PG will begin to 
      develop and market fragrances under the Alexander McQueen brand name to 
      expand their business into the fine fragrance category.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Alexander McQueen has captured the imagination of the world in a unique 
      and indelible way. The brand has become synonymous with modern British 
      couture and will bring their incredibly passionate and emotional point 
      of view to fragrance,&#8221; said Joanne Crewes, President, PG Prestige. 
      &#8220;Alexander McQueen brings a unique perspective to the PG Prestige 
      portfolio. The contrasting elements of their design approach: fragility 
      and strength, tradition and modernity, fluidity and severity is 
      incredibly rich territory for fragrance development. This creative 
      approach combined with our expertise in fragrance and brand building 
      creates a wonderful opportunity for global growth and expansion. It is a 
      tremendous privilege to partner with Alexander McQueen and to bring this 
      incredible brand into beauty.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Creating a fragrance feels like a natural progression as it enhances 
      the world of Alexander McQueen. I'm very excited by this opportunity to 
      collaborate with PG Prestige, to work together to create a scent that 
      captures the unique sensibility of the house," said Sarah Burton, 
      Creative Director of Alexander McQueen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jonathan Akeroyd, President and CEO of Alexander McQueen said, &#8220;With the 
      growing popularity and interest in Alexander McQueen, signing a 
      fragrance license was a natural development for the house in expanding 
      our product offering to reach a wider audience. PG Prestige has showed 
      such passion and belief in our brand, coupled with their expertise and 
      knowledge in fragrances, I am confident that this will be an exciting 
      and successful collaboration.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The signing of the Alexander McQueen fragrance license is consistent 
      with PG Prestige&#8217;s strategy to grow the business with strong brands 
      with global leadership potential. Alexander McQueen is complementary to 
      PG&#8217;s existing designer fragrance portfolio and expands upon their 
      strong luxury fragrance brands.

			Pfizer (PFE) Stock Offer, Spinoff Report Sees Fundamental Break-Up 
      Post Zoetis (ZTS); Remember Bristol Myers  Mead Johnson?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			400m shares are due to hit the market and today&#8217;s the last day for 
      tendering Pfizer (PFE) common shares in exchange for Zoetis (ZTS) stock. 
      Further, with over 20% upside seen in the next year for both PFE and 
      ZTS, an even bigger catalyst awaits smart investors in terms of a larger 
      restructuring Spinoff from PFE in the coming years,
			according to 
      UK independent and top proven research advisor on global special 
      situations and break-ups, TSR 
      (The Spinoff Report&#174; / www.spinoffreport.com).
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TSR claim they&#8217;ve discovered the hidden fundamental catalysts and have 
      equally added each to their client 
      Model Portfolio holdings. These have notably outperformed the SP500 
      by over 6x in 66 months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Speaking to Ryan Mendy of TSR, he comments, &#8220;Under the strong 
      leadership of CEO, Ian Read (appointed in 2010 plus got his stock awards 
      compensation tripled in 2011), PFE&#8217;s strategic desire to restructure its 
      business portfolio has enhanced shareholder returns via the selloff of 
      its nutrition business to Nestle SA for $12bn and now the separation of 
      ZTS.&#8221; 
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Returning +106% in 5 years, PFE offers an attractive mix to 
      investors of 1) inexpensive and discounted valuations, 2) a solid 
      dividend and cash flow yield with limited earnings risk, 3) incentivized 
      management, and 4) similar to Abbott Laboratories and its Spinoff, 
      AbbVie (ABBV), the opportunity from the potential Spinoff of its 
      innovative and value core businesses in 2016, which our research finds 
      can unlock significant value for shareholders&#8221;, Mendy continued.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Discounted Opportunity?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			PFE is offering shareholders a discount of 7% to the ZTS share price. For 
      full analysis of the exchange offer, the potential selling/volatility 
      and upside, click 
      here
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Similar Exchange Offer: Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY)...
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Similar to the current PFE/ZTS exchange offer, Bristol 
      Myers Squibb (BMY) had Split-off its 83% stake in the baby formula 
      maker Mead 
      Johnson (MJN) in November 2009, following an IPO of its 17% stake 
      earlier in February 2009. Post IPO, MJN shares delivered a stunning 
      return of 148% over the next twenty months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Akin to PFE&#8217;s exchange offer, BMY shareholders were able to exchange 
      their shares for MJN shares, though at a slightly higher discount of 10%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			With Help from Rival Pundits, Points of Light and JPMorgan Chase 
      Announce National Effort to Unite Unlikely Allies in Service to &#8216;One 
      America&#8217;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bill O&#8217;Reilly, Donna Brazile, Karl Rove, David Plouffe, and John Oliver 
      Join in Launching Multi-City Tour, Designed to Inspire Millions to Help 
      Neighbors and Strengthen Communities
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Watch rivals set aside differences, come together for #volunteering in 
      @PointsofLight&#8217;s #1America campaign w/ @chasegiving. Join in at www.one-america.org
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At the largest convening of volunteer, national service, and civic 
      leaders in the world, Points of Light and JPMorgan Chase will today 
      announce the launch of a year-long, nationwide campaign to bring 
      together rivals in politics, entertainment, and sports with the goal of 
      inspiring millions to unite in service to their communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first unlikely pairings to be introduced at the National Conference 
      on Volunteering and Service (June 19-22, Washington, D.C. Convention 
      Center) include conservative talk show host Bill O&#8217;Reilly and 
      liberal pundit and political strategist Donna Brazile, along with Karl 
      Rove, former adviser to President George W. Bush, and David 
      Plouffe, former adviser to President Obama. Also endorsing the 
      campaign by video: comedian and Daily Show guest host John Oliver.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rival marching bands from Eastern and Duke Ellington High Schools, both 
      in Washington, D.C., will be on hand to perform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;What really matters to our nation&#8217;s future is not what divides us, but 
      what brings us together,&#8221; said Peter Scher, executive vice president and 
      head of corporate responsibility at JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;And we know we are 
      stronger when we are together as one nation&#8212;as One America.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The One America campaign will include celebrity videos, crowdsourcing 
      and online voting to suggest and encourage potential rivals to come 
      together to serve; local service events and dialogues in towns and 
      cities across the country; a social media campaign; and suggested ways 
      volunteers can make a difference in improving education, fighting hunger 
      and protecting the environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Acts of service can indeed cross boundaries, bring together the most 
      unlikely allies, and build stronger communities,&#8221; said Michelle Nunn, 
      CEO of Points of Light, the largest organization in the world dedicated 
      to volunteer service. &#8220;Recognizing that people in communities are 
      tackling tough challenges every day, One America will showcase volunteer 
      ideas that are working, and present them in a way that others can then 
      implement in their own communities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Periodic challenges will award prizes for contests that may range from 
      best video of local rivals serving, to most innovative volunteer project 
      idea addressing childhood hunger, to most compelling One America moment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Points of Light&#8217;s more than 200 on-the-ground action centers across the 
      country will also be engaged in local events and will help people find 
      meaningful opportunities to volunteer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase will host the first official One America tour event in 
      Columbus, Ohio in July, 2013. Other cities on the tour will include 
      Chicago, New York, Miami, Houston, Atlanta, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and 
      Washington, D.C.

			Procter  Gamble Launches Largest Consumer Event in Company's 175 
      Year History
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Everyday Effect of PG Products Demonstrated, Live, On Streets of 
      New York
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today Procter  Gamble (NYSE:PG) will leverage the world's biggest stage 
      -- New York City -- to share the power and meaning of its brands as part 
      of its new campaign, The Everyday Effect. Through the largest consumer 
      event in the company's 175 year history, PG will serve the daily needs 
      of New Yorkers and demonstrate how PG products make everyday life 
      better. The results will be broadcast to the rest of the country, live, 
      through on-the-ground reports, social media updates and content featured 
      across PGEveryday.com/EverydayEffect, Twitter (#EverydayEffect) and 
      Facebook.com/PGEveryday.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG brands participating in the #EverydayEffect Live From New York event 
      include Cover Girl, Gillette, Duracell, Pampers, Old Spice, Febreze and 
      Crest. More than 40,000 products representing 25 PG brands are being 
      distributed throughout Manhattan at the moments people need them most, 
      including Scope mouthwash for coffee drinkers, Febreze car vent clips 
      for taxis and Iams dog treats for pet lovers. These city-wide events 
      will enable people to directly experience the everyday effect, benefits 
      and superiority of PG products, including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The delivery of everyday confidence through free barber, salon, 
        personal care, make-up and nail services at multiple locations.
      
			
        PG brand ambassadors canvassing the streets of Manhattan with free 
        pedicab rides, product samples, brand giveaways and high-value coupons.
      
			
        Special deliveries by Pampers and appearances by the Charmin Bears, 
        Old Spice and more.
      
			
        The PG Innovation Center at Herald Square highlighting the company's 
        175 year history of innovation and broadcasting the #EverydayEffect 
        Live events taking place in the city.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We're making a deliberate effort to demonstrate to consumers how our 
      brands improve their everyday life in small yet meaningful ways," said 
      Melanie Healey, PG North America Group President. "Regardless of a 
      person&#8217;s unique challenge or need, PG products provide daily benefits 
      that improve quality of life &#8211; whether it&#8217;s helping newborns and their 
      parents get a good night&#8217;s sleep or getting college students ready for 
      life away from home, or simply getting that boost of confidence because 
      of a clean shave, beautiful skin or a beautiful white smile. By 
      providing innovative solutions to the challenges and needs faced in 
      everyday life, PG brands can help consumers in so many different but 
      important ways. That&#8217;s what we call the PG &#8216;Everyday Effect&#8217;."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The New York event is part of a series of activities, programming and

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, June 20 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is
seeking a license to export 30 million tonnes of liquefied
natural gas (LNG) per year to Asian markets from the coast of
British Columbia, according to a regulatory filing in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and other U.S. energy companies are looking to exports
of higher-margin LNG as a means of profiting from North
America's vast supplies of shale gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and its majority-owned Imperial Oil Ltd, 
propose developing a liquefaction terminal that would require up
to six separate processing units as well as storage and loading
facilities that would be sited around Kitimat and Prince Rupert,
according to the application filed with the National Energy
Board on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project is one of several LNG export plants proposed for
British Columbia's Pacific Coast, including facilities planned
by Chevron Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and
Malaysia Petronas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural gas for the project would primarily come from
Canadian fields where Exxon and Imperial hold acreage, but other
North American shale basins could also be a source of supply,
the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies' export license application is a preliminary
step in the process and does not imply a commitment to build a
facility, said a spokesman for Imperial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First exports are targeted for 2021 to 2023, according to
the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has LNG projects in operation or in development in
Papua New Guinea, Qatar and Australia and on the U.S. Gulf
Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Growth Opportunities in Global Smart Meters Market 
      2012-2017 Report Features Players such as Cisco and General Electric
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/sjzkfs/growth) 
      has announced the addition of the "Growth 
      Opportunities in Global Smart Meters Market 2012-2017: Trends, Forecast 
      and Market Share Analysis" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With increased deployment by the electric utilities, smart meters are 
      rapidly being adopted around the world as part of larger smart grid 
      initiatives. The global smart meter market, which experienced 
      double-digit growth during 2006-2011, is projected to grow further in 
      2012 with a CAGR of 12% through 2017 and US $8.2 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This research indicates that real time information sharing regarding 
      usage and tariff rates is one of the major drivers of this market. In 
      addition, the increased costs in manual reading of meter data, as in 
      case of analog and digital meters, have led to the growth of AMR and 
      AMI. Yet the lack of a compatible, reliable, and flexible protocol 
      development for interaction among different components across this 
      system and lack of customer knowledge regarding use of smart meters 
      remain challenges in this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This report gives useful technical details and market information for 
      both smart meter manufacturers and electrical utilities. The report, 
      which provides trend scenarios and forecast statistics for 2012-2017, 
      details drivers and challenges, industry background and characteristics, 
      and makes an elaborate analysis of the global smart meters market, while 
      also describing growth opportunities, emerging trends, and leading 
      manufacturers' profiles in the global smart meters market.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Europe's number 2 card payment processor Nets has hired JP Morgan (JPM.N) to sell the business for 1-2 billion euros, four people with direct knowledge of the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suitors could include private equity firms such as Advent and Bain, which acquired payment firm WorldPay from RBS in 2010, as well as French IT company Atos (ATOS.PA), one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Card payment services are seen as an attractive business for private equity firms as they offer steady cash flows and are not affected by economic cycles, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privately held Nets, which counts Nordea Bank (NDA.ST), DNB (DNB.OL) and Danske Bank (DANSKE.CO) among its largest shareholders, was formed in 2009 through the merger of Norwegian payment services conglomerate Nordito AS and Danish peer PBS. It became Europe's second-largest card processor by number of card payments after it acquired Finland's largest payment card company Luottokunta in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nets currently handles 33 million payment cards every year. It had 2012 revenues of 5962 million Danish Krone or 800 million euros and net profits of 682 million Danish Krone or 91.5 million euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nets, JPM and Advent declined to comment while Bain and Atos were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sophie Sassard and Greg Roumeliotis; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and Sophie Walker)&lt;/p&gt;

      President of Global Community Connections for The Coca-Cola Company. 
      &#8220;Through these grants, we have an amazing opportunity to make a real 
      difference for millions of people by supporting personal well-being 
      programs, improving access to critical natural resources such as clean 
      water and supporting many other sustainable community programs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first quarter 2013, The Foundation awarded:

			Chevron Issues Case Study Highlighting Increased Performance of Delo&#174; 
      for Tahoe Truckee Sierra Disposal
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Delo 400 LE SAE 15W-40 engine oil and Delo Extended Life Coolant 
      deliver 16,000 hours of life in Cummins M11 Engine
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Products Company, a Chevron U.S.A. Inc. division, maker of the 
      Delo&#174; brand of technologically advanced engine oils, lubricants and 
      coolants, released a case study demonstrating that use of Delo 400 LE 
      SAE 15W-40 decreased mechanical wear for the Tahoe Truckee Sierra 
      Disposal fleet in California&#8217;s Sierra Nevada Mountains.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I&#8217;m looking at the bottom line&#8212;I don&#8217;t want to be buying a new truck 
      every year,&#8221; said David Achiro, owner, Tahoe Truckee Sierra Disposal. &#8220;I 
      feel that the Delo 400 products are keeping our trucks on the road a lot 
      longer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tahoe Truckee Sierra Disposal operates a fleet of waste collection 
      vehicles in extreme conditions including high altitude and temperatures 
      ranging from 30 degrees below zero to over 100 degrees farenheit. The 
      fleet includes a garbage disposal truck with a Cummins M11 engine, which 
      the company recently took apart and studied after 16,000 hours of 
      service using Delo 400 LE SAE 15W-40 and Delo Extended Life Coolant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;While the exterior of the truck looked like it had travelled &#8216;to the 
      moon and back,&#8217; the engine remained in top condition. The truck&#8217;s 
      camshaft was in excellent condition with no abrasive wear pattern,&#8221; said 
      Jim McGeehan, senior scientist at Chevron. &#8220;The combination of the use 
      of Delo 400 LE oil and Delo Extended Life Coolant allowed Tahoe Truckee 
      Sierra Disposal to extend the life of critical engine parts and achieve 
      significant cost savings.&#8221;

			Berry Plastics Appoints Rodgers Greenawalt Executive Vice President - 
      Operations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Berry Plastics Group, Inc. (NYSE: BERY) announced today that it has 
      appointed Rodgers Greenawalt, who currently serves as Executive Vice 
      President of Product Management for Berry Plastics&#8217; Rigid Open Top

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Greenawalt assumes his new role July 1, 2013, in connection with the 
      retirement of Randall (Randy) Becker as the Company&#8217;s Chief Operating 
      Officer, who earlier this year announced his intention to retire. As EVP 
      - Operations, Greenawalt will provide strategic leadership for the 
      Company-wide Operations, Safety, Product Development, and Creative 
      Services teams. Becker will remain with the Company for a short period 
      of time to help with the transition of his operational responsibilities.

      &#8220;On behalf of Berry Plastics and its Board of Directors, I extend our 
      sincere appreciation to Randy for his 24 years of service to the 
      Company,&#8221; said Jon Rich, Berry Plastics&#8217; Chairman and CEO. &#8220;Randy&#8217;s 
      outstanding leadership and the contributions he made helped to build 
      Berry Plastics&#8217; solid foundation.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rich added, &#8220;Rodgers has a well-rounded and extensive background in the 
      packaging industry including experience in manufacturing, supply chain, 
      product management, and finance. I look forward to working closely with 
      him as we plan the commercialization of exciting new products.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Greenawalt joined Berry Plastics more than 17 years ago through its 
      acquisition of Venture Packaging. Throughout this time, he held a broad 
      range of management positions, most recently serving as EVP of Product 
      Management for the Company&#8217;s Rigid Open Top division, prior to which he 
      served as EVP Operations for the Company&#8217;s Rigid Closed Top division. 
      Greenawalt holds Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in 
      Management from Clemson University.

&lt;p&gt;June 21 (Reuters) - To many in the West, a fatwa is often
associated with the 1989 religious edict against author Salman
Rushdie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in what may be a first, a party has cited the term in a
U.S. bankruptcy court, citing a "fatwa" as a reason to prevent
Goldman Sachs from making a loan to bankrupt Bahrain
investment firm Arcapita Bank BSC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Sean Lane in
New York confirmed Arcapita's reorganization in what many
experts said was the first Chapter 11 that was compliant with
Islamic law, or Sharia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Central Bank of Bahrain rules, Arcapita must obtain a
fatwa, or religious edict, from a supervisory board of Islamic
experts, before undertaking new finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York on Monday,
Hani Alsohaibi, who had invested money with by Arcapita, said
only one member of Arcapita's supervisory board signed the fatwa
setting the conditions for a debtor-in-possession, or DIP, loan
from Goldman Sachs. Therefore, the court should reject the loan,
the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for Arcapita Bank were quick to direct the judge
back to the governing law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The principal DIP transaction documents are governed by
English Law, and compliance with moral and religious principles
of sharia, on which there is no universal view (at least on
earth), is not pertinent to the courts' final ruling," a lawyer
for Arcapita, Craig Millet of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher, wrote
in a filing on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A search of court records in the Westlaw legal database
suggests that the Goldman loan appears to be the first time a
question of a fatwa has been presented to a U.S. bankruptcy
judge.&lt;/p&gt;

      Creativity, for its work on IBM&#8217;s &#8216;People for Smarter Cities&#8217; campaign. 
      The campaign fused traditional outdoor and interactive advertising,

      passers-by.

      "This year&#8217;s Grand Prix Outdoor Lions winner Ogilvy France&#8217;s IBM 
      campaign demonstrates how the most simple of ideas, executed in an 
      innovative way, can lead to an interactive and brilliantly original 
      campaign,&#8221; said William Eccleshare, CEO, Clear Channel Outdoor. &#8220;While 
      outdoor presents almost limitless possibilities for creativity, this 
      campaign shows how engaging people in the most personal of ways can lead 
      to the most exciting results. Through its creative approach, it also 
      offered the public a whole new perspective on outdoor advertising, 
      demonstrating how it can become part of the fabric and identity of a 
      city.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      President of the Outdoor Lions jury Tony Granger, global chief creative 
      officer, Young  Rubicam, praised the IBM campaign as &#8220;classic outdoor.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;d like to give the Grand Prix to work that could only live in

			Goldman Sachs Asset Management to Launch New Stable Value Fund
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Seeking to meet plan sponsor demand for pooled stable value funds
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (GSAM) announced today that it has 
      reached an agreement with Fifth Third Bank for eligible plan investors 
      in the Fifth Third Stable Value Fund to transition to the Goldman Sachs 
      Stable Value Collective Trust (Fund), a new stable value fund expected 
      to be formed by The Goldman Sachs Trust Company, N.A. The transaction 
      reflects GSAM&#8217;s commitment to the defined contribution (DC) 
      investment-only business and reinforces the importance of stable value 
      as an investment option for retirement plan participants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The new Fund enables GSAM and its affiliates to expand access to stable 
      value solutions to an even greater number of retirement plans and their 
      participants,&#8221; said Eric S. Lane and Timothy J. O&#8217;Neill, global co-heads 
      of the Investment Management Division at Goldman Sachs, in a formal 
      statement. &#8220;Stable value continues to be an important asset class for DC 
      plans and our new Stable Value Collective Trust will be an opportunity 
      to respond to strong demand in the marketplace.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GSAM built on its historically strong fixed income capabilities with the 
      acquisition of Dwight Asset Management Company LLC (Dwight) in May 2012. 
      The Dwight stable value portfolio management team has been advising the 
      Fifth Third Stable Value Fund since 1998 and will be adviser in respect 
      of the stable value contracts for the Fund. The Goldman Sachs Trust 
      Company, N.A. will act as trustee for the Fund, and GSAM and Dwight will 
      be the investment advisers for the Fund&#8217;s investment portfolio.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Currently, stable value is offered in approximately half of all 401(k) 
      plans1. GSAM has over $34 billion in stable value assets as 
      part of over $55 billion in DC assets under supervision (AUS)2. 
      This agreement is GSAM&#8217;s latest step in delivering capabilities that 
      help meet the needs of DC plan sponsors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction with Fifth Third is expected to close by the fourth 
      quarter of 2013, at which time we anticipate the launch of the Goldman 
      Sachs Stable Value Collective Trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman Sachs Asset Management is the asset management arm of The 
      Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS), which manages $860 billion as of 
      March 31, 2013. Goldman Sachs Asset Management has been providing 
      discretionary investment advisory services since 1988 and has investment 
      professionals in all major financial centers around the world. The 
      company offers investment strategies across a broad range of asset 
      classes to institutional and individual clients globally. Founded in 
      1869, Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking, securities 
      and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial 
      services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes 
      corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth 
      individuals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Goldman Sachs Stable Value Collective Trust (the Fund) has not been 
      launched yet. This press release is delivered solely for informational 
      purposes with respect to the Fund, an investment product that Goldman

		&lt;p&gt;
      Rosneft and ExxonMobil 
      today announced the achievement of several milestones under their 2011 
      Strategic Cooperation Agreement, including joint venture formation for 
      the Kara Sea and Black Sea projects, and establishing foundations for 
      joint ventures to explore seven other licenses in the Russian Arctic and 
      to manage the joint West Siberia tight oil project. The companies have 
      also agreed to move to the next planning phase for an LNG development in 
      the Russian Far East.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Black Sea and Kara Sea joint venture operating companies, 
      Tuapsemorneftegaz SARL and Karmorneftegaz SARL respectively, will 
      commence project implementation activities as operator pursuant to 
      agreement with Rosneft, which is the license holder. Rosneft holds 66.67 
      percent interest and ExxonMobil holds 33.33 percent interest in the two 
      projects. The initial cost of exploration in the two areas is estimated 
      at more than US $3.2 billion, the majority of which will be financed by 
      ExxonMobil. In 2013 collection of data for both regions will continue 
      until the commencement of drilling operations in the Kara and Black seas 
      in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In February, ExxonMobil and Rosneft announced plans to increase the 
      scope of their strategic cooperation by adding seven new blocks in the 
      Russian Arctic in the Chukchi Sea, Laptev Sea and Kara Sea, spanning 
      approximately 600,000 square kilometers (150 million acres). Rosneft and 
      ExxonMobil have entered into agreements that lay the foundation for 
      joint venture entities for these areas. Data acquisition is being 
      planned for these blocks, which represent some of the most promising and 
      least explored offshore areas globally. The license obligations 
      stipulate that 14 exploration and appraisal wells will be drilled and a 
      significant amount of 2D and 3D seismic will be conducted over the next 
      10 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Agreements are also now in place establishing the foundation for a new 
      joint venture for a tight oil pilot project in West Siberia, where data 
      collection operations are currently underway. Rosneft will hold 51 
      percent interest and ExxonMobil will hold 49 percent interest in this 
      project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Also in place is an agreement identifying further steps for the 
      development of an LNG plant in the Russian Far East. Following the 
      agreement, by the end of 2013 the parties will undertake work to 
      determine an LNG plant site, gas liquefaction technologies and 
      commercial structure of the project. Once this work is finalized, the 
      parties plan to progress engineering definition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Agreements were signed today at the St. Petersburg International 
      Economic Forum by Igor I. Sechin, Rosneft president and chairman of the 
      Management Board, and Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil 
      Corporation, in the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the agreements signed, Igor Sechin said, &#8220;I am glad to 
      note the activities outlined in the Strategic Cooperation Agreement are 
      being implemented ahead of schedule. I would like to thank the teams 
      from both companies for their hard and coordinated work. Our cooperation 
      touches upon the most promising aspects of today&#8217;s oil and gas industry: 
      Arctic shelf and deep water areas in the Black Sea covering a total area 
      of 773,000 square kilometers, tight oil in West Siberia as well as a 
      promising LNG project in the Russian Far East. We are convinced that 
      implementation of all these projects will benefit both companies&#8217; 
      shareholders. We believe it will also boost the development of the 
      Russian oil and gas industry and will have a multiplying effect on 
      related industries, already creating market demand for equipment, 
      knowledge and technologies.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;ExxonMobil is making a significant investment in Russia, and these 
      agreements serve as the foundation for our projects and future work 
      together,&#8221; Tillerson said. &#8220;Experience tells us that a good foundation 
      is critical for success in the Arctic and elsewhere. ExxonMobil&#8217;s 
      Sakhalin-1 project with Rosneft is an example where we have put this 
      experience to work.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally, on June 11, 2013 Rosneft and ExxonMobil signed agreements 
      regarding the creation of the Arctic Research Center and the joint use 
      of technologies in different regions of the world. ExxonMobil will 
      provide funding for the initial research phase of the Arctic Research 
      Center in the amount of $200 million. Rosneft and ExxonMobil will 
      equally fund the next $250 million to continue their joint research 
      work. The partners&#8217; interests are Rosneft 66.67 percent and ExxonMobil 
      33.33 percent. The Arctic Research Center will build on current best 
      practices of Rosneft and ExxonMobil to create more environmentally safe 
      and efficient technologies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Statements of future events and conditions in this release are 
      forward-looking statements. The Strategic Cooperation Agreement 
      represents a binding outline of terms, and closing of the transactions 
      contemplated by the agreement is subject to execution of definitive 
      final agreements, receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, and other 
      customary conditions. Actual future results, including project plans, 
      timing, costs, and benefits realized by the parties as a result of the 
      transactions, could differ materially depending on the outcome of future 
      negotiations; the actions of governmental authorities and regulators, 
      including legal and legislative uncertainties; the outcome of 
      exploration programs; changes in prices and other market and economic 
      factors affecting the oil and gas industries; future technological

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - With their cricket team in disarray and rugby side playing catch-up, Mr. Reliable Lleyton Hewitt gave Australia's suffering sports fans something to smile about as he upset 11th seed Stanislas Wawrinka at Wimbledon on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewitt, who has dropped to 70 in the world, did not have to delve too deeply into his famed reserves of fighting spirit to oust the Swiss ranked 60 places above him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 32-year-old baseline terrier no longer has the ferocious energy of his heyday but he showed that when he slips on his grasscourt shoes and strides onto the lawns of the All England Club, the 2002 champion remains a force to be reckoned with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrapped up a 6-4 7-5 6-3 win in the evening gloom on Court One in two hours 12 minutes, dropping to his knees in celebration at claiming a significant scalp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perched in the stands were a group of vocal supporters known as the "Fanatics", clad in green and gold, cheering what has become a rare success for a country used to feasting at sport's top table, but currently feeding on scraps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day the cricket team sacked their coach with the Ashes series against England looming and hot on the heels of an opening rugby test defeat by the touring British and Irish Lions, Hewitt's win was cheered to the rafters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know a few of the Fanatic boys in the crowd," Hewitt told reporters. "They enjoy the win as much as I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's good that I can put on some sort of show that they can get pretty pumped up out there as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hewitt does not have a game that stands out as particularly lethal on grass, but his clever courtcraft means he can still move opponents out of their comfort zone on the slick green grass of SW19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wawrinka had won their last two meetings but struggled to make an impression against the feisty Hewitt who, despite owning two grand slam titles, ranked this among his best victories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's definitely up there," he added. "It was a tough draw coming into one of my favorite tournaments. "To get through it in straight sets is a pretty good effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hewitt's grand slam winning days are more than a decade in the past, but the 32-year-old scrapper is not entertaining any thoughts of walking away from the fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know that I can still play the game," he said. "I compete against the best guys. I play well in the big tournaments, I think. That's why I'm still playing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up for Hewitt is Germany's Dustin Brown on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Toby Davis; editing by Ken Ferris)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 24 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp has secured access
to key infrastructure for its recently expanded position in the
Permian basin around west Texas through a deal with Cimarex
Energy Co.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, said on Monday
it signed a joint development agreement for 104,000 acres to be
operated by Cimarex, while Chevron will pay $60 million for 50
percent of the smaller company's Triple Crown gathering system
and a 50 percent interest in wells drilled this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our complementary acreage positions in west Texas and New
Mexico, along with our common development outlook, make Chevron
and Cimarex natural partners," said Alan Kleier, vice president
of Chevron`s Mid-Continent division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has a position in the Delaware basin part of the
Permian exceeding 1 million "gross" acres, or including acreage
that is only partially owned. Last September, Chevron bought
264,000 acres there from Chesapeake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eight-year agreement with Cimarex includes access to
roads and utilities for development of the acreage in Culberson
County, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			Goodwin Procter Expands Securities Litigation  White Collar Defense 
      Group with Addition of Grant Fondo in Silicon Valley
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Goodwin 
      Procter, a national Am Law 50 firm, announced today that Grant 
      P. Fondo has joined the firm&#8217;s Silicon Valley office as a partner in 
      its Securities Litigation  White Collar Defense Group. Fondo comes to 
      Goodwin from the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Northern District of 
      California, where he served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in its 
      Criminal Division for nearly five years. He will focus on representing 
      technology, life sciences and venture capital clients in a wide range of 
      litigation and investigative matters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During his tenure as an AUSA, Fondo prosecuted white collar crime &#8211; 
      including investment, bank and securities fraud &#8211; as well as drug 
      trafficking. He led a team that received the 2012 Northern California 
      High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Case of the Year Award for a 
      wiretap case that culminated in what is believed to be the largest 
      seizure of methamphetamine in U.S. history.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prior to his service in the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office, Fondo was a partner 
      at Cooley LLP in Palo Alto, where he focused on securities litigation 
      and government enforcement matters, as well as general commercial 
      litigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fondo&#8217;s practice at Goodwin is expected to include representation of 
      clients across a wide range of complex business disputes, including 
      white collar, class action and securities litigation, SEC enforcement 
      proceedings, MA litigation, internal investigations, licensing and 
      contractual disputes, and other commercial litigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Grant&#8217;s wide and varied skill set and experience spans both commercial 
      and white collar/securities litigation areas, bringing added depth to 
      the range of services we can provide to our West Coast clients on 
      high-stakes matters,&#8221; said Anthony 
      McCusker, head of the firm&#8217;s Silicon Valley office. &#8220;We&#8217;re delighted 
      that he has chosen to join our growing California team.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;Grant is a tremendously talented attorney with a proven track record of 
      success,&#8221; added Richard 
      Strassberg, head of Goodwin&#8217;s White Collar Defense practice. &#8220;He 
      complements our established white collar and government investigations 
      practice team well and will help us serve our West Coast and 
      international clients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fondo received his J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law 
      and his B.A. from the University of Vermont. He is admitted to practice 
      in California and Connecticut, as well as before the U.S. District Court 
      for the Central, Eastern and Northern Districts of California and for 
      the District of Connecticut, and before the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
      the Ninth Circuit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      He is co-chair of the White Collar  Corporate Governance Subcommittee 
      of the Securities Litigation Committee, ABA Section of Litigation and is 
      a former co-chair of the Computer and Internet Litigation Committee, ABA 
      Section of Litigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      He can be reached at 650.752.3236 or gfondo@goodwinprocter.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goodwin&#8217;s Silicon 
      Valley office opened in 2007 and is now home to more than 50 
      attorneys who provide business law and litigation services in the areas 
      of private equity, venture capital, technology and life sciences, 
      intellectual property, SEC investigations, and labor and employment 
      matters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goodwin has one of the country&#8217;s largest and most active Securities 
      Litigation  SEC Enforcement practices, defending securities 
      class actions and shareholder derivative suits, as well as SEC 
      investigations and enforcement proceedings. Goodwin is currently 
      defending cases in California and in other courts across the country 
      involving hundreds of billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities,

			U.S. Bank and Polaris Offer Credit Card Rewards 
      Program with Launch of Polaris&#174; 
      Visa&#174; 
      Card
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. Bank and Polaris, a leader in the power sports industry, have 
      created the Polaris&#174; Visa&#174; card where customers 
      can earn points for every dollar spent at Polaris dealerships and for 
      everyday purchases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is a new venture for Polaris and it&#8217;s a great way to offer their 
      customers a way to earn rewards in the form of Polaris Cash to help them 
      purchase the Polaris merchandise and services they want even faster,&#8221; 
      said Robert Goeller, vice president, co-brand partnerships at U.S. Bank.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the Polaris Visa, cardholders earn points on all of their purchases 
      and can redeem those points for Polaris Cash. For example, for every 
      dollar of net purchases spent on the card at a Polaris dealership, they 
      will earn two points. They also earn two points at gas stations and one 
      point everywhere else. Once a cardholder earns 2,500 points, they can 
      redeem the points for $25 in Polaris Cash, which can only be used at 
      participating Polaris dealerships.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Polaris Visa was created specifically for Polaris enthusiasts,&#8221; 
      said Kelly Clawson, manager financial services for Polaris Industries. 
      &#8220;The partnership with U.S. Bank will let our customers earn rewards on 
      all their purchases and then return to their local dealership to spend 
      their rewards on top-of-the-line parts and accessories, Polaris apparel, 
      or put it toward the purchase of a new vehicle.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Paragon Solutions and Microsoft Co-Author SharePoint 2013 Version of 
      Compliance Whitepaper
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			At the DIA 
      2013 49th Annual Meeting, Paragon Solutions, an advisory 
      consulting and systems integration firm, and Microsoft Corporation today 
      announced the release of an updated version of their well-accepted, 
      collaborative whitepaper, &#8220;SharePoint 
      Configuration Guidance for 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance.&#8221; The 
      revision, entitled &#8220;SharePoint 2013 Configuration Guidance for 21 CFR 
      Part 11 Compliance,&#8221; provides in-depth guidance to life sciences and 
      healthcare organizations for meeting the challenges of FDA 21 CFR Part 
      11 compliance through the functionality and architecture of the latest 
      release of Microsoft SharePoint, SharePoint 2013.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;SharePoint 2013 brings new capabilities and features that support 
      compliance, including greater ability to configure technical 
      capabilities and use much less custom code than the previous release,&#8221; 
      said Les Jordan, chief technology strategist for Microsoft. &#8220;The paper 
      demonstrates that the Microsoft SharePoint 2013 platform, in combination 
      with Paragon Solutions&#8217; and Microsoft&#8217;s industry expertise, can provide 
      pharmaceutical firms with a more secure, compliant and collaborative 
      solution to meet their information management and regulatory needs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;SharePoint is a key technology being used within life sciences and 
      healthcare organizations,&#8221; said Jim Kane, director of collaboration and 
      knowledge management for Paragon Solutions. &#8220;For day-to-day business 
      across RD and clinical organizations, compliance is a key issue. Being 
      assured that SharePoint can be an enabling tool is extremely important. 
      The assurance that compliance needs are met allows teams to expand their 
      use of SharePoint across more business functions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The whitepaper not only uncovers advances in SharePoint 2013&#8217;s 
      architecture that support compliance, it also establishes use cases for 
      compliance with detailed configurations. In addition, the paper 
      addresses the mapping between 21 CFR Part 11 and the detailed 
      configurations that support each individual line of the regulation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Working with Microsoft, we are improving how business teams can use SharePoint 
      in the workplace to address compliance, 
      productivity and knowledge creation and management,&#8221; said Kane. 
      &#8220;Paragon&#8217;s efforts illustrate how SharePoint 2013 is a power enabling 
      tool in these areas, and supports Microsoft&#8217;s vision for how SharePoint 
      is to be leveraged in the workplace.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Along with providing life sciences industry expertise, Paragon developed 
      the demonstration system, SharePoint configurations, workflows and 
      sample source code for the whitepaper. Full details are outlined in the 
      paper.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Monday said it would complete the spinoff of its Zoetis Inc (ZTS.N) animal health business after investors offered to trade their Pfizer shares for the company's remaining majority stake in the unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker said it would distribute all its Zoetis Class A common stock, representing more than 80 percent of the animal health business, to investors who tendered Pfizer stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it no longer would hold any ownership interest in Zoetis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exchange offer of 0.9898 Zoetis share for each Pfizer share expired on Friday.

It said it expects to complete the exchange on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Zoetis fully divested, Pfizer said it expects full-year earnings, excluding special items, of $2.10 to $2.20 per share.

D'Amelio will remain a member of the Zoetis board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in February sold about 20 percent of its animal health business in an initial public offering of Zoetis that raised $2.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer continues to unload its non-pharmaceuticals businesses to focus on its core prescription drugs business, which has far higher profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2012 Pfizer sold its infant nutrition business to Nestle SA (NESN.VX) for $11.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. drugmaker is also considering selling off its wide array of generic prescription drugs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 24 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc on Monday said it
would complete the spinoff of its Zoetis Inc animal
health business after investors offered to trade their Pfizer
shares for the company's remaining majority stake in the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker said it would distribute all its Zoetis Class
A common stock, representing more than 80 percent of the animal
health business, to investors who tendered Pfizer stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it no longer would hold any ownership interest
in Zoetis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exchange offer of 0.9898 Zoetis share for each Pfizer
share expired on Friday. Pfizer will swap almost 401 million
Zoetis shares for more than 405 million Pfizer shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said the exchange offer was oversubscribed, with
almost 1.7 billion Pfizer shares tendered. It said it expects to
complete the exchange on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Zoetis fully divested, Pfizer said it expects full-year
earnings, excluding special items, of $2.10 to $2.20 per share.
It previously forecast $2.14 to $2.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It projected 2013 revenue of $50.8 billion to $52.8 billion,
down from an earlier forecast of $55.3 billion to $57.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said its prior 2013 forecasts included revenue and
earnings from its 80 percent stake in Zoetis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said the Zoetis spinoff will boost its earnings per
share in 2014 because all 405 million Pfizer shares it is
receiving for its Zoetis stake are considered retired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoetis, in a separate statement, said it had named Michael
McCallister, a company board member and former chief executive
of managed care company Humana Inc, as its non-executive
board chairman. He will succeed Frank D'Amelio, Pfizer's chief
financial officer. D'Amelio will remain a member of the Zoetis
board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in February sold about 20 percent of its animal
health business in an initial public offering of Zoetis that
raised $2.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer continues to unload its non-pharmaceuticals
businesses to focus on its core prescription drugs business,
which has far higher profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2012 Pfizer sold its infant nutrition business to
Nestle SA for $11.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. drugmaker is also considering selling off
its wide array of generic prescription drugs. In that event, it
would keep its branded patent-protected medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer were down 2.5 percent at $27.74 near midday

&lt;p&gt;June 24 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Monday that
enough Pfizer shareholders offered to trade their shares for
stock in Pfizer's majority owned Zoetis Inc animal
health business to allow Pfizer to complete its spinoff of the
unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said all its Class A Zoetis common stock will be
distributed to Pfizer shareholders who validly tendered required
shares of Pfizer stock, and as a result Pfizer no longer will
hold any ownership interest in Zoetis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker said it continues to expect the separation of
Zoetis to boost Pfizer's earnings in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      Zoetis Inc. (NYSE: ZTS), the former animal health business of Pfizer 
      Inc. (NYSE: PFE), opens a new chapter in the company&#8217;s history today, 
      marking its separation from Pfizer and first day as a fully independent 
      company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is an historic day for Zoetis,&#8221; said Zoetis Chief Executive 
      Officer Juan Ram&#243;n Alaix. &#8220;We are setting off on the next stage in our 
      company&#8217;s life &#8211; pursuing our own initiatives and strategies as a fully 
      independent company.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am very proud of all the Zoetis colleagues who have prepared us for 
      this day, while continuing to support our customers with the products, 
      innovations and reliable supply they expect from us. We will continue 
      serving our customers in ways that make a meaningful difference to their 
      businesses and strengthen our position as the world leader in animal 
      health,&#8221; said Alaix.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of today, according to the terms of the exchange offer that commenced 
      on May 22, 2013, Pfizer has accepted shares of Pfizer stock in exchange 
      for all of its 400,985,000 shares of Zoetis common stock, according to 
      the preliminary results of its exchange offer announced in a Pfizer 
      press release today. Following Pfizer&#8217;s acceptance of shares of Pfizer 
      common stock, Pfizer no longer holds any ownership interest in Zoetis, 
      making Zoetis a fully independent company. Full details of the 
      preliminary results are available in a separate press release issued 
      this morning by Pfizer and on www.zoetisexchange.com. 
      Final results of the exchange offer will be announced in the coming days.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Zoetis has also become one of the newest members of the SP 500&#174;. SP 
      Dow Jones Indices announced its intent to add Zoetis to the SP 500 GICS 
      (Global Industry Classification Standard) Pharmaceuticals Sub-Industry 
      index after the close of trading on June 21.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Changes in Board of Directors
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In related news, Zoetis announced the appointment of Michael McCallister 
      as Non-Executive Chairman of the Zoetis Board of Directors. Mr. 
      McCallister, former CEO of Humana, has served on the Zoetis Board since 
      January 2013. Mr. McCallister replaces Frank D&#8217;Amelio, Executive Vice 
      President, Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer of Pfizer, as 
      Non-Executive Chairman of the Zoetis Board. Mr. D&#8217;Amelio will remain a 
      director on the Zoetis Board.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Given the separation, which eliminates Pfizer&#8217;s ownership interest in 
      Zoetis, certain Pfizer executives have stepped down from the Board: Geno 
      Germano, Douglas Giordano, Charles Hill and Amy Schulman. Meanwhile, 
      Zoetis appointed two new independent directors to the Board, effective 
      as of the closing date of the exchange offer: Sanjay Khosla and Robert 
      Scully. The Board will continue to evaluate additional board candidates 
      to identify individuals with appropriate backgrounds and experience to 
      guide the company&#8217;s strategic direction and contribute to the company&#8217;s 
      success.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The changes to our Board reflect our full independence from Pfizer and 
      add valuable new experience to our leadership,&#8221; said Alaix. &#8220;I want to 
      thank the exiting directors for their support and guidance in achieving 
      our separation objectives and shaping our strategy for the future of 
      Zoetis.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Khosla brings more than 35 years of international business 
      experience from his career with food, beverage and consumer product 
      leaders such as Mondelez, Kraft and Unilever, where he managed various 
      business units, particularly in developing markets. He also has animal 
      health experience from his three-year tenure as Managing Director of 
      Fonterra Brands and Food Service, a multi-national dairy cooperative 
      based in New Zealand. Mr. Khosla serves on the board of Best Buy, Inc., 
      a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, personal computers, 
      entertainment software and appliances, and on the board of NIIT, Ltd., a 
      company involved in technology-related educational services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Scully served as a member of the office of the chairman of Morgan 
      Stanley focusing on the firm's key clients until January 2009, when he 
      retired after nearly 35 years in the financial services industry. Mr. 
      Scully brings global management experience, business development 
      knowledge and investor insights to the Zoetis board. In addition to his 
      roles at Morgan Stanley from 1996 through 2008, Mr. Scully held various 
      positions in other banking and financial services companies throughout 
      his career. He currently serves on the board of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts 
       Company (KKR), a global investment management firm.

			Pfizer Announces Preliminary Results of Zoetis Exchange Offer and 
      Adjusts 2013 Financial Guidance(1)
				Solely to 
      Reflect Impact of Exchange Offer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Continues to expect the full separation of Zoetis to be accretive on 
      a full-year basis to Pfizer&#8217;s Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (2) 
      (EPS) and Reported Diluted EPS(3) in 
      2014
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that, based on preliminary 
      results, its previously announced offer to its shareholders to exchange 
      all, some or none of their shares of Pfizer common stock for shares of 
      Zoetis Inc. (NYSE: ZTS) common stock owned by Pfizer was oversubscribed. 
      The exchange offer expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on 
      June 21, 2013. Under the terms of the exchange offer, 0.9898 shares of 
      Zoetis common stock will be exchanged for each share of Pfizer common 
      stock accepted in the exchange offer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the exchange agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., 
      1,680,439,287 shares of Pfizer common stock were validly tendered and 
      not validly withdrawn, including 497,530,121 shares that were tendered 
      by notice of guaranteed delivery. Pfizer has accepted 405,117,195 of the 
      tendered shares in exchange for the 400,985,000 shares of Zoetis common 
      stock owned by Pfizer. Because the exchange offer was oversubscribed, 
      Pfizer accepted only a portion of the shares of its common stock that 
      were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, on a pro rata basis in 
      proportion to the number of shares tendered. Shareholders who owned 
      fewer than 100 shares of Pfizer common stock, or an &#8220;odd-lot&#8221;, who have 
      validly tendered all of their shares and made the appropriate election, 
      will not be subject to proration, in accordance with the terms of the 
      exchange offer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on the total number of shares of Pfizer common stock reported to 
      be tendered prior to the expiration of the exchange offer, it is 
      estimated that approximately 24% of the tendered shares of Pfizer common 
      stock will be exchanged, assuming all shares tendered by guaranteed 
      delivery procedures are delivered under the terms of the exchange offer. 
      This preliminary proration factor is subject to change based on the 
      number of tendered shares that satisfy the guaranteed delivery 
      procedures, as well as the number of &#8220;odd-lot&#8221; shares that were validly 
      tendered and not subject to proration. Pfizer expects to announce the 
      final proration factor promptly following the expiration of the 
      guaranteed delivery period, which is expected to occur on June 26, 2013. 
      Shares of Pfizer common stock tendered but not accepted for exchange 
      will be returned to the tendering shareholders in book-entry form 
      promptly after the final proration factor is announced.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Promptly after the final proration factor is announced, the exchange 
      agent will credit shares of Zoetis common stock for distribution in the 
      exchange offer in book-entry form to accounts maintained by the Zoetis 
      transfer agent for tendering shareholders who have validly tendered and 
      not validly withdrawn their shares of Pfizer common stock. Checks in 
      lieu of fractional shares of Zoetis common stock will be delivered after 
      the exchange agent has aggregated all fractional shares and sold them in 
      the open market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the expiration of the exchange offer, Pfizer converted all of 
      its Zoetis Class B common stock into Zoetis Class A common stock and, as 
      noted above, all such converted Class A common stock will be distributed 
      to Pfizer shareholders who validly tendered and did not validly withdraw 
      their shares of Pfizer common stock. As a result, Pfizer no longer holds 
      any ownership interest in Zoetis. Pfizer continues to expect the full 
      separation of Zoetis to be accretive on a full-year basis to Pfizer&#8217;s
			Adjusted 
      Diluted EPS(2) and Reported Diluted EPS(3) in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, BofA Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs  Co. and 
      Morgan Stanley served as the dealer managers for the exchange offer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2013 Financial Guidance(1)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of the full separation of Zoetis, Pfizer will now present 
      Zoetis&#8217; financial results from January 1, 2013 to June 24, 2013 as a 
      discontinued operation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer is adjusting its 2013 financial guidance solely to reflect the 
      impact of the Zoetis exchange offer. The adjustment reflects 
      modifications to the following components:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Reported Revenues, Adjusted Cost of Sales as a Percent of Revenues(2), 
        Adjusted SIA Expenses(2), Adjusted RD Expenses(2) 
        and Adjusted Other (Income)/Deductions(2) : Actual and 
        projected revenue and expense contributions of Zoetis have been 
        excluded for the full-year 2013 from these components. While such 
        contributions of Zoetis also have been excluded for the full-year 2013 
        from the Effective Tax Rate on Adjusted Income(2)&#160;, 
        this did not result in a change in that component.
      
			
        Adjusted Diluted EPS(2): Actual and projected financial 
        results of Zoetis have been excluded for the full-year 2013 through:

        
					
            The presentation of Zoetis financial results as a discontinued 
            operation from January 1, 2013 to June 24, 2013. Zoetis was wholly 
            owned by Pfizer through February 6, 2013, and 80.2% owned by 
            Pfizer from February 7, 2013 to June 24, 2013.
          
					
            The removal of the 80.2% of Zoetis projected financial results 
            from June 24, 2013 through December 31, 2013.
          
				
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, the weighted average shares outstanding used in the 
      computation of Adjusted Diluted EPS(2) reflects the net 
      reduction(4) in shares of Pfizer&#8217;s outstanding common stock 
      as a result of the exchange offer. Because this net reduction(4) 
      occurred on June 24, 2013, Pfizer will recognize only a partial-year 
      benefit to its full-year 2013 Adjusted Diluted EPS(2).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The impact of the removal of the full-year 2013 financial contribution 
      of Zoetis as well as the impact of the partial-year benefit from the net 
      reduction(4) in shares of Pfizer&#8217;s outstanding common stock 
      due to the exchange offer resulted in a $0.04 decrease to the upper and 
      lower ends of Pfizer&#8217;s projected range for 2013 Adjusted Diluted EPS(2).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Reported Diluted EPS(3):

        
					
            As previously mentioned, the financial results of Zoetis from 
            January 1, 2013 to June 24, 2013 are presented as a discontinued 
            operation and, accordingly, continue to impact full-year 2013 
            guidance for Reported Diluted EPS(3).
          
					
            Full-year 2013 guidance for Reported Diluted EPS(3) excludes 
            the 80.2% of Zoetis projected financial results from June 24, 2013 
            through December 31, 2013.
          
					
            Full-year 2013 guidance for Reported Diluted EPS(3) reflects 
            the partial-year benefit of the net reduction(4) in 
            weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate Reported 
            Diluted EPS(3).
          
					
            Full-year 2013 guidance for Reported Diluted EPS(3) was 
            not adjusted to reflect the gain on the disposition of shares of 
            Zoetis common stock.
          
					
            The impact of the removal of the financial contribution of Zoetis 
            from June 24, 2013 through December 31, 2013, as well as the 
            impact of the partial-year benefit of the net reduction(4) 
            in shares of Pfizer&#8217;s outstanding common stock due to the exchange 
            offer, did not result in a change to Pfizer&#8217;s projected range for 
            2013 Reported Diluted EPS(3).

      (1) The 2013 financial guidance has been developed using the following 
      estimates, assumptions and approaches:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Does not assume the completion of any business development 
        transactions not completed as of March 31, 2013, including any 
        one-time upfront payments associated with such transactions, except 
        for the Zoetis exchange offer.
      
			
        Reflects the impact of the Zoetis exchange offer, except for the gain 
        on the disposition of shares of Zoetis common stock.
      
			
        Excludes the potential effects of the resolution of litigation-related 
        matters not substantially resolved as of March 31, 2013.
      
			
        Assumes exchange rates that are a blend of the actual exchange rates 
        in effect during the first three months of 2013 and the mid-April 2013

      (2) "Adjusted Income" and its components and "Adjusted Diluted Earnings 
      Per Share (EPS)" are defined as reported U.S. generally accepted 
      accounting principles (GAAP) net income(3) and its components 
      and reported diluted EPS(3) excluding purchase accounting 
      adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and 
      certain significant items. Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted Selling, 
      Informational and Administrative (SIA) expenses, Adjusted Research and 
      Development (RD) expenses and Adjusted Other (Income)/Deductions are 
      income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and, therefore, 
      components of the overall adjusted income measure. As described under Adjusted 
      Income in the Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
      Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizer's Form 10-Q for 
      the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2013, management uses adjusted 
      income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the 
      performance of the overall company. We believe that investors' 
      understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. 
      See the accompanying reconciliations of full-year 2013 guidance for 
      adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS to full-year 2013 guidance for 
      reported net income(3) and reported diluted EPS(3). 
      The adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS measures 
      are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net 
      income and its components and diluted EPS.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (3) &#8220;Reported Net Income&#8221; is defined as net income attributable to 
      Pfizer Inc. in accordance with U.S. GAAP. &#8220;Reported Diluted EPS&#8221; is 
      defined as reported diluted EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common 
      shareholders in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (4) The impact of the Zoetis exchange offer on the full-year weighted 
      average shares outstanding also includes the negative impact on 
      anticipated full-year share repurchases because of the prohibition 
      imposed by law on share repurchases during and for 10 business days 
      after the exchange offer period.

&lt;p&gt;Brazil's central bank will probably have to further accelerate
the pace of rate hikes to control inflation expectations amid a
sharp currency selloff, analysts at JPMorgan said in a research
note on Monday. The team led by Fabio Akira and Cassiana
Fernandez expect a 75 basis-point hike in July, up from an
increase of 50 basis points in May, and see interest rates
ending this year at 9.5 percent. They also cut Brazil's 2013 and
2014 growth view to 2.0 and 2.7 percent respectively, down from
2.5 and 3.5 percent previously.&lt;/p&gt;

			First Proactive Monitoring Solution with Automatic Threshold Setting 
      for Microsoft Launches
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Early Deployments of AIMS Innovation show up to 50% in IT Operational 
      Efficiencies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			AIMS 
      Innovation is launching a disruptive new technology to the U.S. 
      market today. Tailored first for system integrations based on Microsoft 
      BizTalk, it is the first intelligent monitoring solution to dynamically 
      determine monitoring thresholds and then, proactively 
      send "early warnings" before problems arise that may lead 
      to costly, disruptive downtime. This is the only technology in the 
      market to send IT experts a graphical color-coded 
      map pinpointing where an issue lies--right down to each individual 
      business process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Enterprises are failing to monitor the most critical component in the 
      IT architecture - the integration platform,&#8221;&#160;said Ivar Sagemo, CEO of 
      AIMS Innovation.&#160;&#8220;AIMS Innovations&#8217; solution will completely change the 
      way companies monitor this critical part of enterprise infrastructure 
      and essentially eliminate all downtime related to the integration 
      platform. This keeps productivity high and saves companies substantial 
      money.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At the Microsoft Worldwide Partner conference in July 7-11, AIMS 
      Innovation will also announce the first multi-tenant capability for AIMS 
      for BizTalk. Designed for any Microsoft partner that wants to monitor 
      client BizTalk, it gives these consulting companies insight into client 
      environments through a web-based dashboard without the need to log onto 
      remote client systems or VPN&#8217;s. Consulting companies can now build a 
      service business with recurring revenues as well as essentially 
      eliminate the time associated with monitoring.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AIMS Innovation&#8217;s innovative technology enables ongoing 
      self-optimization, meaning the software learns the enterprise systems&#8217; 
      normal behaviour and modifies alerts over time, becoming more accurate 
      to potential problems that can lead to downtime. Early experience with 
      live AIMS Innovation deployments so far in large enterprises indicates 
      cost reductions in IT operational efficiencies alone of up to 50% 
      representing costs savings of $800,000 dollars annually (for a medium to 
      large-sized enterprise with 1 billion USD in revenue.) Additionally, 
      estimates indicate improvements in system uptime and optimization that 
      can easily reach up to $1 million dollars annually. AIMS Innovation&#8217;s 
      patent-pending technology will also apply to other integration platforms 
      in the future.

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Final Ratings to JPMBB 2013-C12
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) assigned its final ratings to thirteen 
      classes of JPMBB 2013-C12, a $1.34 billion CMBS conduit transaction 
      collateralized by 77 commercial mortgage loans that are secured by 107 
      properties. Concurrently, we have withdrawn our preliminary ratings on 
      the certificates, which were assigned on June 5, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loans have principal balances ranging from $1.6 million to $125.0 
      million for the largest loan in the pool, Legacy Place (9.3%). Legacy 
      Place is a 575,248 sf (483,569 collateral sf) lifestyle anchored retail 
      center located in Dedham, Massachusetts, approximately 12 miles 
      southwest of Boston, Massachusetts. The top five loans, which also 
      include the Americold Cold Storage Portfolio (8.2%), IDS Center (6.7%), 
      Southridge Mall (4.1%) and Colony Hills Portfolio (3.5%), represent 
      31.4% of the initial pool balance, while the top 10 loans represent 
      45.0%. 67 loans have 10-year terms (82.0%), one loan (2.0%) has a 
      nine-year term, one loan has a seven-year term (2.8%) and seven loans 
      (13.2%) have a five-year term. Over half of the pool&#8217;s balance (55 
      loans, 51.1%) is comprised of amortizing balloon loans with no 
      interest-only periods. There are 19 loans (45.6%) that have partial 
      interest-only periods, and two full-term, interest-only loans (3.2%). 
      The collateral properties are located in 33 states. The five largest 
      state exposures represent 43.6% of the pool balance and include: 
      Massachusetts (11.9%), Texas (10.0%), California (7.7%), Minnesota 
      (7.6%) and New York (6.4%). The pool has exposure to four property types 
      with concentrations in excess of 10.0%: Retail (40.4%), Multifamily 
      (14.1%), Office (12.9%), and Hotel (12.5%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction incorporated our multi-borrower 
      rating process that begins with our analysts' evaluation of underlying 
      collateral properties' financial and operating performance, which 
      determine KBRA&#8217;s estimate of sustainable net cash flow (KNCF) and KBRA 
      value. The analysis incorporates a detailed evaluation of the underlying 
      collateral properties&#8217; financial and operating performance using our 
      CMBS Property Evaluation Guidelines to determine Kroll Net Cash Flow 
      (KNCF), which on an aggregate basis was 4.0% less than the issuer cash 
      flow. KBRA capitalization rates were applied to each asset&#8217;s KNCF to 
      derive individual property values that, on an aggregate basis, were 
      33.6% lower than third party appraisal values. The weighted average 
      capitalization rate for the transaction was 9.3%. The pool has an 
      in-trust KLTV of 96.4% and an all-in KLTV of 101.7%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The KBRA credit model deploys rent and occupancy stresses, probability 
      of default regressions, and loss given default calculations to determine 
      losses for each collateral loan, which are then used to assign our 
      credit ratings.

			Deem&#8482; Announces Partnership with Microsoft for Local Deals and Offers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Agreement is Latest Extending Deem&#8217;s Reach Across Multiple 
      Categories
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Deem&#8482; (formerly Rearden 
      Commerce) today announced a partnership 
      with Microsoft Corp. where Deem will provide local deals and offers to 
      Microsoft for distribution across their online and mobile surfaces 
      including Bing.com/offers, Outlook.com, MSN, Windows Phone and Windows 8 
      apps.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Deem will syndicate offers, promotions and daily deals, using its data 
      and analytics engine and transactional platform, to provide Microsoft 
      with a rich set of local deals optimized for targeted delivery to its 
      users. This latest announcement follows recent syndicated commerce 
      agreements Deem has entered into with a wide range of market leaders 
      including: MasterCard, SuperShuttle, Carlson Wagonlit Travel and Sabre.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Both Microsoft consumers and Deem merchants will gain benefits: 
      Microsoft consumers will experience additional local deals content while 
      merchants get an opportunity to reach larger audiences across a variety 
      of online and mobile surfaces.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Microsoft is focused on giving our diverse and discerning consumers the 
      most personal and relevant experiences we can, regardless of where they 
      are,&#8221; said Erik Jorgensen, General Manager of Local Advertising at 
      Microsoft. &#8220;Increasingly, this means enriching their engagement with 
      deals that speak to their preferences or real-time decision-making. Deem 
      providing local deals as part of our large collection of local deals 
      will help drive a more relevant experience for our consumers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;More meaningful for users and more measureable for merchants, 
      syndicated commerce enables a fundamentally better engagement model than 
      today&#8217;s primitive online and mobile advertising experience. Partnering 
      with Microsoft will further validate performance-based advertising and 
      the ability of syndicated commerce to close the gap between advertising 
      dollars at the top of the funnel and each customer at the bottom,&#8221; said 
      Patrick Grady, founder and CEO of Deem.

      Research and Markets: Indoor Location Market: Global Advancements, 
      Market Forecasts and Analysis Report 2013 - 2018 Featuring Apple, 
      Google, Microsoft, Broadcom and Cisco
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/j4xlp4/indoor_location) 
      has announced the addition of the "Indoor 
      Location Market: Global Advancements, Market Forecasts and Analysis 
      (2013 - 2018)" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This report forecasts the global Indoor Location, Indoor Positioning and 
      Indoor Navigation (IPIN) market will grow from $448.56 million in 2013 
      to $2.60 billion in 2018. This represents a Compound Annual Growth Rate 
      (CAGR) of 42.1% from 2013 to 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In recent years, there has been a substantial demand for indoor 
      positioning and navigation equipment in the marketplace across 
      verticals. The demand is surging in those industries that were early 
      'Indoor Location' adopters. With potential opportunities in emerging 
      verticals, there is good investment in Indoor Location Research, 
      Development and Innovation by the majority of market players.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Absence of satellite signals inside indoor spaces clearly highlighted 
      the need for indoor technologies; hence indoor location devices came 
      into existence. The device manufacturers and other members in the 
      ecosystem made tremendous efforts to build a culmination point for the 
      proximity electronics, surveying systems and the informatics. They still 
      strive to bring greater possibilities in the indoor location system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Some of the major vendors of indoor location are Apple Inc., Google, 
      Microsoft, Broadcom and Cisco. Many small innovative companies have also 
      surfaced and are forthcoming as the solution providers for the indoor 
      location market. The indoor location research report analyzes global 
      adoption trends, drivers and evolving platforms in this rapidly emerging 
      market. The report aims at identifying and evaluating the current market 
      size and the future market opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

			Little Busy Bodies Announces Licensing Agreement with Procter  Gamble
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The tissue aisle gets wet as the makers of Boogie Wipes&#174; 
      create a new saline product line for adults under the Puffs&#174; brand
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mom started, owned and operated, Little Busy Bodies, LLC today announced 
      it has finalized a licensing agreement with consumer products giant, 
      Procter  Gamble (NYSE: PG). Under the agreement, Little Busy Bodies, 
      creators of the hugely popular Boogie Wipes, will make and market a line 
      of saline infused products under the Puffs brand. First up and available 
      this June, Puffs Fresh Faces, a moist saline tissue for adults that has 
      been specifically designed to take on the needs of your face.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;When we first developed Boogie Wipes in 2007, we knew saline worked 
      wonders when it came to cleaning and soothing stuffy noses. We also knew 
      saline had positive effects on the skin and ultimately wanted to tap 
      into that knowledge when the time was right,&#8221; said Julie Pickens, CEO of 
      Little Busy Bodies, LLC. &#8220;Our partnership with PG has really allowed us 
      to build on the technology behind the use of saline for personal care 
      and to realize our goal of taking moist saline wipes to the next level.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Puffs Fresh Faces are built on the same quality foundation established 
      by Pickens and her team of fellow moms. But, different from kid-oriented 
      Boogie Wipes, Fresh Faces are perfect for removing make-up, cleaning or 
      refreshing the face after a long day or tough workout, and for taking on 
      sneezes and mucus-filled moments caused by colds, the flu and allergies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Little Busy Bodies came to PG as a potential Connect+Develop open 
      innovation partner, bringing to the table a solid commitment to 
      innovation, consumers and partnership. Our collaboration resulted in 
      Puffs Fresh Faces, giving consumers a new way to use a trusted brand,&#8221; 
      said Laura Becker, General Manager, Connect+Develop and Global Business 
      Development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Puffs Fresh Faces will be offered in Fresh Scent, Light Lavender, with a 
      touch of Vicks and fragrance free. Puffs Fresh Faces will be available 
      in 15-count packs for $1.99 and 45-count packs for $4.99. For more 
      information, visit www.puffsfreshfaces.com.

			About Little Busy Bodies, LLC
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Two moms out of Portland, OR developed the first-ever saline nose wipe 
      to soothe their children&#8217;s sore, red, stuffy noses. Using their business 
      backgrounds and mompreneurial spirit, they formed Little Busy Bodies 
      Inc. in May 2007 to make and market their first product, Boogie Wipes. 
      Sales of the wipes went on to reach $1 million in the company&#8217;s first 
      year of business; by 2011, Little Busy Bodies had reached $10 million in 
      sales with products sold in 50,000 retail stores across the U.S. and 
      Canada including Target, Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us, Walgreens, and Wal-Mart. 
      Co-founder and CEO, Julie Pickens, now runs the company out of 
      Cincinnati, OH after announcing a partnership with Nehemiah 
      Manufacturing. Please visit http://www.boogiewipes.com

			Research and Markets: US Small and Medium-sized Business Cloud Market 
      - 2013 Report Featuring Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Rackspace 
      Hosting, Salesforce, Verizon And Others
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/z9vmzq/small_and) 
      has announced the addition of the "Small 
      and Medium-sized Business Cloud Market in the US 2012-2016" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Small And Medium-Sized Business Cloud Market In The Us Expected To 
      Grow At A CAGR Of 18.45 Percent Over The Period 2012-2016
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TechNavio's report, the Small and Medium-sized Business Cloud Market in 
      the US 2012-2016, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis 
      with inputs from industry experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Data Centers team 
      said: 'Public cloud services are finding higher prominence among the 
      cloud-based application services. Public cloud services require lower 
      capital expenses and are available at lower costs compared to private 
      cloud hosting. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) have a lower 
      budget for operations and prefer public cloud services to meet their 
      business requirements. The pay-per-use model for billing makes it 
      feasible for the SMBs to adopt the solutions as they are liable to pay 
      only for what they use. Public cloud services can be scaled up or down 
      according to the requirements of the end-users at a faster pace compared 
      to private cloud services.'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in the market is the 
      reduced cost to enterprises using the cloud approach. The SMBs are very 
      price sensitive and are looking for options to reduce their capital and 
      operational expenditure. Cloud-based solutions are available at reduced 
      costs compared to internal provisioning of the infrastructure.

&lt;p&gt;BUCHAREST, June 25 (Reuters) - Romania's top oil and gas
firm, Petrom, majority-owned by Austria's OMV
, and ExxonMobil will resume exploration
drilling in their offshore Black Sea block at the end of this
year or in early 2014, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies have completed a 3D seismic study on the
Neptun block and contracted a drilling rig from Diamond Offshore
Drilling Inc which they will use for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil and Petrom "expect to invest up to U.S. $1
billion in the exploration programme, which comprises the 3D
survey now completed and further exploration and appraisal
drilling," Petrom said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is creating a startup three-ring circus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company is combining various startup initiatives into one coordinated global effort called Microsoft Ventures. It will include a community-evangelism program, an accelerator program, and a seed fund that supports startups around the world as they grow their customer base and products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a long history of supporting entrepreneurs, and this consolidation should give entrepreneurs a &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; to engage with the company. General Manager Rahul Sood, who previously headed up the Bing Fund, said in a blog post that startups face plenty of challenges and Microsoft is in a strong position to help them, whether it is through funding, expertise, tools, mentorship, or relationships with strategic partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more &#8220;holistic approach&#8221; will have resources for entrepreneurs at various parts of the early-stage startup cycle. Anyone with an idea can tap into Microsoft&#8217;s BizSpark resources as well as locally supported partnerships with 200 startup-focused organizations around the world. For startups that are in the development stages, Microsoft offers accelerator programs around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft launched its first accelerator in March 2012 in Israel for cloud-companies. Instead of seed funding, Microsoft offered free access to its Windows Azure cloud platform as well as BizSpark software development tools and services. It now has five accelerators in Seattle, Tel Aviv, Bangalore, Beijing, and Paris and will soon add programs in Rio de Janeiro, Berlin, and Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft established the Bing Fund in July&#160;to invest $50,000 to $100,000 in early-stage startups through standard convertible notes. The incubator also provided four to eight months of advice, design, and development help and discounted access to the Azure Data Marketplace APIs, and introductions to potential partners or customers. Microsoft Ventures will &#8220;evolve&#8221; the Bing Fund by adding more capital. It will focus on business-to-business companies that align with Microsoft&#8217;s area of expertise, including enterprise software, &#8220;big data,&#8221; security, artificial intelligence, advertising, gaming, SaaS, and cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our intent is to roll up our sleeves and help entrepreneurs take their early-stage prototypes to scalable products,&#8221; said Sood in an interview with VentureBeat last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Entrepreneur&#8221; has become a trendy career choice, and after years of high unemployment and stagnant wages, people are increasingly interested in forging their own destinies. Furthermore, the stories of startup successes (like Instagram) put a rather glamorous gloss over the industry, and startup hubs are cropping up in international markets. As a result, accelerator programs and startup networks are proliferating. There are large, well-known programs like Y Combinator and 500 Startups as well as other accelerators that focus on specific areas of expertise. Many of these programs are designed to help international entrepreneurs make inroads into the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are now so many programs that people have expressed skepticism over their actual value. The main value in accelerator programs rests in the strength of their mentor, partner, and resource networks, and in the ability to convey this value to the entrepreneurs.&#160;Y Combinator recently scaled back its most recent class after realizing that its portfolio startups weren&#8217;t getting the attention they needed. Microsoft Ventures is in an effort to stay focused, and bring all of its startup-support muscle together to provide more comprehensive benefits to entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals, Enterprise, Entrepreneur&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp released a test version of its Windows 8.1 software on Wednesday, bringing back the "start" button and adding a host of features it hopes will appeal to users, while spurring developers into writing more applications for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated Windows, which was signaled at the end of May, is aimed chiefly at soothing traditional computer users, many of whom were unsettled by Microsoft's shift towards a new "tile"-based interface that works best on touch-enabled devices, but left fans of the old-style desktop confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since we announced and shipped Windows 8, suffice it to say, we pushed boldly and yet what we found was we got a lot of feedback from users of those millions of desktop applications," said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, opening the company's annual developer conference in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I was to put it in coffee terms, 'Why don't you go and refine the blend here?' Let's remix the desktop and your modern application experience. Let's balance them better," said Ballmer, summing up user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is the reinstatement of the 'start' button, and easier ways to find and access applications, along with a highly improved search function, some of which was announced last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares closed up 2 percent at $34.35 on Nasdaq, outpacing generally higher markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also promised a "rapid release cycle" for Windows in future, abandoning its previous policy of making new versions of Windows every three years, in an effort to match Apple Inc and Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THUMBS-UP FROM WINDOWS FANS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response from the thousands of developers at the conference in San Francisco was broadly positive, although attendees tend to be Windows die-hards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, they're playing some catch up (with Apple and Google). They have been lagging behind for years now," said Jorgen Nilsson, a manager at UK-based Aveva AB, a firm that makes computer-aided design software applications. "But this release is driving it forward instead of catching up and making it work for business and personal use. This is looking really good now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of Microsoft's problem has been persuading developers to create apps for Windows 8 and the little-used Windows Phone, given that almost all smartphone and tablet owners are using Apple's iOS or Google's Android system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said Wednesday that Facebook Inc had finally agreed to work on an app especially for Windows, which should be available this autumn. That is one factor that attract the more than 1 billion Facebook users to Windows-based tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel like Microsoft can actually seriously compete in the mobile ecosystem now," said Manav Mishra, director of engineering at the Barnes &amp; Noble Inc unit that makes apps for its Nook e-reader. "Windows 8.1 finishes the journey Windows 8 started and I think it evens the playing field for Microsoft quite a bit, which wasn't the case before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE EVANGELISM NEEDED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all developers are convinced that Windows or Windows Phone are worth the trouble, given the massive built-in audience using iPhones, iPads and Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I haven't really considered it, No," said Sam Redfern of Psychic Software, maker of the 'Let's Break Stuff!' game, available on Android, iOS and even the BlackBerry PlayBook, when asked about developing for Windows. "It never seemed like a particularly worthwhile undertaking, in terms of potential revenue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markus Persson, developer at Mojang, whose 'Minecraft - Pocket Edition' is a top-seller on both iOS and Android, agreed, saying Microsoft's market was too "tiny. Both Symbian and Blackberry have more users than Windows Phone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither man attended Microsoft's developer conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said on Wednesday that the Windows Store was approaching 100,000 apps. Meanwhile, Apple is nearing 1 million, with Android not far behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Malathi Nayak in San Francisco, reporting and writing by Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by L Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

With respect to the period from and including 3 July 2013, the issue date, up to and including 31 December 2013, the amount of interest that will be payable on 1 January 2014 (or on the following business day if such date is not a business day), will amount to approximately EUR 0.03794 per Bond.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Bonds will be issued at par on 3 July 2013 and will be redeemed at par on 1 July 2018. At the option of Alcatel-Lucent, the Bonds may be subject to an early redemption under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Bonds are rated CCC by Standard  Poor's and Caa1 by Moody's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* CEO Ballmer says listened to user feedback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Promises "rapid release cycle" for Windows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Developers react favorably&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, June 26 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
released a test version of its Windows 8.1 software on
Wednesday, bringing back the 'start' button and adding a host of
features it hopes will appeal to users, while spurring
developers into writing more applications for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated Windows, which was signaled at the end of May,
is aimed chiefly at soothing traditional computer users, many of
whom were unsettled by Microsoft's shift towards a new
'tile'-based interface that works best on touch-enabled devices,
but left fans of the old-style desktop confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since we announced and shipped Windows 8, suffice it to
say, we pushed boldly and yet what we found was we got a lot of
feedback from users of those millions of desktop applications,"
said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, opening the
company's annual developer conference in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I was to put it in coffee terms, 'Why don't you go and
refine the blend here?'. Let's remix the desktop and your modern
application experience. Let's balance them better," said
Ballmer, summing up user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is the reinstatement of the 'start' button, and
easier ways to find and access applications, along with a highly
improved search function, some of which was announced last
month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also promised a "rapid release cycle" for Windows in
future, abandoning its previous policy of making new versions of
Windows every three years, in an effort to match Apple Inc
 and Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response from the thousands of developers at the
conference in San Francisco was broadly positive, although
attendees tend to be Windows die-hards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, they're playing some catch up (with Apple and
Google). They have been lagging behind for years now," said
Jorgen Nilsson, manager at UK-based Aveva AB, a firm that makes
computer-aided design software applications. "But this release
is driving it forward instead of catching up and making it work
for business and personal use. This is looking really good now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of Microsoft's problem has been persuading developers
to create apps for Windows 8 and the little-used Windows Phone,
given that almost all smartphone and tablet users are accessible
with Apple's iOS or Google's Android system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft made a big leap on Wednesday by announcing that
Facebook Inc has finally agreed to work on an app
especially for Windows, which should be available this autumn.
That is one factor that might help attract the more than 1
billion Facebook users to Windows-based tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel like Microsoft can actually seriously compete in the
mobile ecosystem now," said Manav Mishra, director of
engineering at the Barnes &amp; Noble Inc unit that makes
apps for its Nook e-reader. "Windows 8.1 finishes the journey
Windows 8 started and I think it evens the playing field for
Microsoft quite a bit, which wasn't the case before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were up 2.2 percent at $34.39 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Paris, 26 June 2013
			- Alcatel-Lucent (Euronext Paris and NYSE: ALU, the "Company") launched today an issuance of OCEANE maturing on 1 July 2018 (the "Bonds") in an initial nominal amount of approximately EUR 547.8 million. The nominal value per Bond has been set at EUR&#160;1.80, giving a premium of approximately 37% over the reference share price of Alcatel-Lucent's shares[1] listed on the regulated market NYSE-Euronext in Paris ("Euronext Paris").&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The objective of the issuance, which is part of the Shift Plan (Alcatel-Lucent's three-year program to industrially reposition the company as a specialist in IP Networking and Ultra-broadband, while significantly reducing costs and addressing its debt profile), is to extend the maturity of the group's indebtedness.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The nominal amount of the issuance may be increased by a maximum of approximately 15% to a maximum nominal amount of approximately EUR 628.9 million if the over-allotment option granted to the Joint Lead-Managers and Joint Bookrunners is exercised in full no later than 1 July 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The conversion / exchange ratio of the Bonds will be one new or existing Alcatel-Lucent share per Bond, subject to potential adjustments. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Bonds will bear interest, at an annual rate of 4.25%, payable semi-annually in arrear on 1 January and 1 July of each year, commencing 1 January 2014 (or, if it is not a business day, the following business day), i.e. approximately EUR 0.03825 per Bond and each semester. With respect to the period from and including 3 July 2013, the issue date, up to and including 31 December 2013, the amount of interest that will be payable on 1 January 2014 (or on the following business day if such date is not a business day), will amount to approximately EUR&#160;0.03794 per Bond.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Bonds will be issued at par on 3 July 2013 and will be redeemed at par on 1 July 2018. At the option of Alcatel-Lucent, the Bonds may be subject to an early redemption under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Bonds are rated CCC by Standard  Poor's and will be rated by Moody's.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Michel Combes, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, states: "This new bond issue is the first step in the EUR 2 billion reprofiling of our debt while reducing our financial costs as set out in the Shift Plan we announced last week. We are pleased by the positive market reception as evidenced by the large over-subscription. We will continue to seek out positive opportunities to further strengthen the financials underpinning of the Shift Plan."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A prospectus has been submitted to the approval of the Autorit&#233; des march&#233;s financiers (the "AMF") in order to list the Bonds on Euronext Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Bonds were only subject to a private placement in France and outside France (but not in the United States of America, Canada, Australia or Japan) to persons referred to in article L. 411-2-II of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code mon&#233;taire et financier), without public offering in any country (including France).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Company's long-term debt is rated Caa1 by Moody's (rating date: 4 December 2012), with a negative outlook since 4 December 2012 and CCC by Standard  Poor's (rating date: 21 June 2013), with a stable outlook since 21 June 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This press release does not constitute a subscription offer, and the offering of the Bonds does not constitute a public offering in any country, including France.&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Enterprise Social Networking Market 
      2012-2016 with IBM Corp., Jive Software Inc. and Telligent System Inc 
      Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/gfxwnl/global_enterprise) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Enterprise Social Networking Market 2012-2016" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Enterprise Social Networking Software 
      market to grow at a CAGR of 51.94 percent over the period 2012-2016. One 
      of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the increased 
      requirement of intranet interactivity among multiple teams in an 
      organization. The market has also been witnessing an increased use of 
      mobile enterprise social networking for sales activities. However, the 
      risk of confidential information leakage could pose a challenge to the 
      growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this market space include Communispace Corp., 
      IBM Corp., Jive Software Inc., and Telligent System Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other vendors mentioned in the report are Atlassain Pty Ltd., 
      blueKiwi Software Inc., Cisco System Inc., IGLOO Software Inc., Liferay 
      Inc., Lithium Technologies Inc., Microsoft Corp., Mzinga Inc., NewsGator 
      Technologies Inc., Open Text Corp., Saba Software Inc., Socialtext Inc., 
      SuccessFactors Inc., Telligent System Inc., Traction Software Inc., 
      TWiki Inc., and Yammer, Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Enterprise 
      Computing team said: Many product marketing companies make use of mobile 
      enterprise social networking software to convey information about 
      products and customers to mobile sales executives. As a result of the 
      ever-increasing competition in many markets, it is becoming increasingly 
      crucial for sales executives to make real-time decisions, which will 
      help them not only acquire new business but also maintain good 
      relationships with existing customers. Therefore, sales executives are 
      required to have access to product and customer-related information even 
      while on the move. To address this need, many enterprises are nowadays 
      increasingly adopting enterprise social networking software. In 
      addition, enterprise social networking software helps track the 
      activities of sales employees on the field. Thus, the increasing use of 
      mobile enterprise social networking software in the field of sales is 
      expected to contribute to the growth of the Global Enterprise Social 
      Networking market during the forecast period.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, Australia, June 27, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - Following contact with major Australian financial institutions to establish whether or not they provide credit cards to holders of the 457 Skilled Migrant Visa, comparison website creditcard.com.au has found that the banks are mostly hesitant to offer credit cards to those here on the 4 year visa, despite the high income threshold and the fact that many who are here on 457 Visas are working to train Australians in the necessary skills to perform in-demand jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Apart from Virgin Money and American Express, we found that a lot of Australia's major banks were reluctant to even answer our request and confirm whether they did or did not offer credit cards to skilled migrants. Of those that did answer, a large portion said a firm 'no'," said Kalianna Dean, Managing Editor of Credit World Pty Ltd, which operates creditcard.com.au. "We've already been told by ANZ, Bank of Queensland, Citibank, CUA, HSBC and Suncorp that they do not offer credit cards to 457 Visa holders. This was in response to requests dating back to February of this year in some cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Banks missing out by giving the cold shoulder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The common line from the banks is that there is too great a risk of a 457 Visa holder leaving the country with existing credit card or loan debt, but increasing numbers of 457 migrants continue to arrive in Australia, even as parliament is currently debating whether to introduce further restrictions on the 457 Visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	One of the major restrictions already in place is a minimum salary requirement, to avoid businesses undercutting or underpaying Australian workers if foreign workers were willing to work for less. The figures below, released by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, show that close to 70% of 457 Visa holders are highly paid managers or professionals, with a base salary of $85,400.**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It's pretty hard to understand the reluctance on behalf of the banks when these applicants have a demonstrated income and ability to pay off a credit card," adds Ms Dean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"These applicants have good salaries, many are supporting families in Australia, and in some cases living with an Australian citizen. They should be given the opportunity to apply for an Australian credit card," argues Ms Dean. "Granted, there should be some protection in place in the event of default, but surely you would think a global bank such as HSBC or Citibank could organise a way to at least allow applicants who had accounts with them back home to access an Australian credit card with a decent rate of interest. Instead, many are here in Australia but stuck with a Visa debit card option or a foreign credit card that they pay exorbitant international charges to use."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	As a credit card can be a crucial element in building up a decent credit history in Australia, and prepaid or debit cards will not count towards increasing an applicant's credit score, the most effective option for those who do want to settle in Australia is mostly cut off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	*70% of respondents to the 2013 survey conducted by the Migration Council of Australia indicated that they intend to become permanent residents. In addition 2012 saw 68,310 workers arrive in Australia with 56,760 dependents to support. The full report is titled 'More than Temporary: Australia's 457 Visa Program' and available for download in PDF format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil has taken a
long-term charter on the U.S.-flagged American Phoenix oil
tanker at a near record rate of around $100,000 per day, trade
sources said, highlighting the scarcity of vessels available to
ship oil and refined products between United States ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 339,000-barrel tanker, which was re-leased by Koch
Shipping and Supply, is thought to have been the only one of
around three dozen so-called Jones Act tankers available for
lease, with traders having snapped up others to help move
surging output from Texas's Eagle Ford shale to Gulf Coast
refiners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Phoenix had struggled over the past few months
to find a re-lease at the rates Koch was offering, and had been
available in the spot market as recently as mid-June, brokers
said, raising questions about whether the more than 50 percent
surge in Jones Act rates since last year was sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they said the relatively high rate, above the $75,000
per day that they described as the going rate for that size
ship, suggests that the Jones Act market remains tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon declined to comment on the lease and a Koch
spokeswoman could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how Exxon will use the tanker, or whether it
will seek to convert it from carrying refined, or "clean"
products to carrying "dirty" crude oil. The Phoenix was employed
for crude oil service late last year, but was converted back to
refined fuels several months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The re-lease will run for two years, until the end of Koch's
term charter from owners Mid Ocean Marine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates for Jones Act tankers, previously used primarily to
ferry gasoline and diesel from Gulf Coast refiners to Florida or
the East Coast, have surged this year as traders take up half a
dozen vessels to carry Eagle Ford from the port of Corpus
Christi to refiners up the coast in Houston or Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jones Act from 1920 requires all vessels operating
between U.S. ports to be U.S.-built, U.S.-owned and U.S.-crewed
in order to protect the United States commercial industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are fewer than 50 tankers currently moving crude oil
and refined products between U.S. ports; around a dozen of them
trade strictly between Alaskan production sites and refineries
on the West Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Phoenix is currently in Miami, Florida, after
leaving from Port Canaveral, Florida, according to historical
vessel tracks. In the past month, it has moved between Southwest
Pass, Louisiana, and ports in Florida, where it was presumably
delivering gasoline or another refined fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the civil fraud trial approaches of former Goldman Sachs Group Inc vice president Fabrice Tourre, the two sides are focusing on a key witness and whether her own legal troubles could affect her testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has said Laura Schwartz, who worked at a bond insurer, can help establish how Tourre misled investors in a complex structured mortgage transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Tourre's lawyers say that Schwartz has a motive to "shade her testimony" because she is herself under investigation by the SEC in a similar case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the trial starts on July 15, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan must decide the extent Tourre's lawyers can obtain documents related to the investigation that could be used to undermine Schwartz's testimony against Tourre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would undercut her credibility as a witness if introduced into evidence," said Stanley Twardy, a former U.S. attorney for Connecticut who is now a white-collar defense attorney at Day Pitney in Stamford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC accuses Tourre of misleading investors in a collateralized debt obligation known as ABACUS 2007-AC1 in 2007. It says he failed to disclose that the hedge fund run by billionaire John Paulson helped pick the mortgage securities behind the CDO and was also betting against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By January 2008, the SEC says almost all of the securities in the CDO had been downgraded. The investors lost more than $1 billion, while Paulson netted about the same amount from his short positions, the SEC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc agreed to pay $550 million in 2010, in the largest settlement resulting from the SEC's probe of CDOs. Paulson was not charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At trial, a key issue will be Tourre's interaction with bond insurer ACA Financial Guaranty Corp, which helped put the Abacus CDO together and which then insured it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to the court on June 10, the SEC said Schwartz, who was Tourre's "primary point of contact" at ACA, will testify that Tourre misled her into believing that Paulson was an equity investor in the CDO and not a short seller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sean Coffey, a lawyer for Tourre, said at a court hearing also on June 10 that he planned to raise questions at the trial about Schwartz's credibility, because she was being investigated as part of a probe of another CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that probe, the SEC is looking into ACA Financial Guaranty's role as collateral manager for a CDO called ACA ABS 2007-2, according to a broker report filed in February with securities industry self-regulatory body Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FINRA report said Schwartz, who left ACA in 2007, received a so-called Wells notice, which indicates SEC staff was considering recommending the commission approve taking action against her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Schwartz, Robin Alperstein, said no charges were warranted against her client.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - As the civil fraud trial
approaches of former Goldman Sachs Group Inc vice
president Fabrice Tourre, the two sides are focusing on a key
witness and whether her own legal troubles could affect her
testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has said Laura
Schwartz, who worked at a bond insurer, can help establish how
Tourre misled investors in a complex structured mortgage
transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Tourre's lawyers say that Schwartz has a motive to
"shade her testimony" because she is herself under investigation
by the SEC in a similar case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the trial starts on July 15, U.S. District Judge
Katherine Forrest in Manhattan must decide the extent Tourre's
lawyers can obtain documents related to the investigation that
could be used to undermine Schwartz's testimony against Tourre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would undercut her credibility as a witness if
introduced into evidence," said Stanley Twardy, a former U.S.
attorney for Connecticut who is now a white-collar defense
attorney at Day Pitney in Stamford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC accuses Tourre of misleading investors in a
collateralized debt obligation known as ABACUS 2007-AC1 in 2007.
It says he failed to disclose that the hedge fund run by

insurer ACA Financial Guaranty Corp, which helped put
the Abacus CDO together and which then insured it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to the court on June 10, the SEC said Schwartz,
who was Tourre's "primary point of contact" at ACA, will testify
that Tourre misled her into believing that Paulson was an equity
investor in the CDO and not a short seller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sean Coffey, a lawyer for Tourre, said at a court hearing
also on June 10 that he planned to raise questions at the trial
about Schwartz's credibility, because she was being investigated
as part of a probe of another CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that probe, the SEC is looking into ACA Financial
Guaranty's role as collateral manager for a CDO called ACA ABS
2007-2, according to a broker report filed in February with
securities industry self-regulatory body Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (FINRA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FINRA report said Schwartz, who left ACA in 2007,
received a so-called Wells notice, which indicates SEC staff was

witness list, they have made clear they are mostly concerned
about how she could help the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffey said at the June 10 court hearing that the
investigation into Schwartz could provide a "motive for her to
shade her testimony to support the merits of her own case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If in the future the SEC decides to drop the investigation
into Schwartz, that would raise questions about "what she was
willing to do at trial in order to avoid being charged," Coffey
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyers have sought to subpoena material related to
the investigation of Schwartz, which Coffey has said they could
ask her about during Tourre's trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court filings Wednesday, the SEC and Schwartz both sought
to block Tourre's subpoenas. Allowing Tourre's lawyer to probe

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms J.P. Morgan 2001-CIBC3
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed six classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp. 2001-CIBC3 commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are due to increased credit enhancement from 
      significant paydowns and stable performance of the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 33.2% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 4%, including $22.8 million (2.6% of the 
      original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has designated 
      six loans (67.7%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes three 
      specially serviced assets (44%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the June 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 96% to $34.8 million from $867.5 million at 
      issuance. Two loans (18%) are currently defeased. Interest shortfalls 
      are currently affecting classes J through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to Fitch's modeled losses is a 107,822 square 
      foot (sf) office property (29.7%) located in Newark, DE. The loan 
      transferred to the special servicer in February 2011 due to a payment 
      default and was subsequently foreclosed on in August 2012. The property 
      recently had a tenant renew their lease and take on additional space. 
      The servicer continues to stabilize the property while preparing to 
      market it for sale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to expected losses is a 85,443 sf mixed 
      used property located in Waterford, MI. The loan transferred to the 
      special servicer in April 2009. Negotiations between the servicer and 
      the borrower have ceased as the servicer continues to move forward with 
      foreclosure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating on the class G notes is expected to be stable as the credit 
      enhancement remains high. Classes H through K may be subject to further 
      downgrades as losses are realized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has affirmed the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$12.1 million class G at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$6.5 million class H at 'BBsf'; Outlook Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$6.5 million class J at 'CCCsf'; RE 75%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$7.6 million class K at 'Csf'; RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.1 million class L at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Class M at 'Dsf'; RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not rate class NR, which has been reduced to zero from $16.3 
      million due to realized losses. Classes A-1, A-2, A-3, B, C, D, E, F, 
      and X-2 have paid in full. Class X-1 has been previously withdrawn.

		&lt;p&gt;SAN ANTONIO - June 27, 2013 - Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) announced today that it has secured the rights from ExxonMobil to use the Exxon and Mobil brands at retail stations in Northern California, Oregon, Western Washington and Nevada, marketing areas strategically aligned with the Company's West Coast operations. &#160;Tesoro also secured the rights to use the Exxon and Mobil brands throughout Minnesota, Central/Eastern North Dakota and Northeastern South Dakota, marketing areas anchored by the Company's refinery in Mandan, North Dakota. &#160;Through this arrangement, Tesoro intends to assume ownership of branded-wholesale supply contracts for 54 Exxon- or Mobil-branded retail stations in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"Introducing the well-established Exxon and Mobil brands into our retail network will allow us to drive further integration between our refining and marketing businesses with brands known for their quality products and marketing programs," said Dan Romasko, Executive Vice President of Operations.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"This agreement with Tesoro provides consumers the opportunity to benefit from the reliability of supply from Tesoro along with the strength of the Exxon and Mobil brands," said John Rhodes, Americas Retail Director for ExxonMobil. &#160;"I am looking forward to working with Tesoro and to the opportunity to expand ExxonMobil's brand presence in multiple states."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota contracts are expected to be transitioned to Tesoro by the end of 2013, with subsequent market launches expected to begin in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Tesoro Corporation, a Fortune 100 company, is an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products.&#160; Tesoro, through its subsidiaries, operates six refineries in the western United States with a combined capacity of over 845,000 barrels per day.&#160; Tesoro's retail-marketing system includes over 2,200 retail stations under the Tesoro&#174;, Shell&#174;, ARCO&#174; and USA Gasoline(TM) brands, of which 595 are company operated.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 4332 Trust
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4332 'AA+/F1'; Stable Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --DRIVERs, Series 4332 'AA+'; Stable Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA+'; Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4332 
      PUTTERs and DRIVERs are based on the rating that Fitch has assigned to 
      The Regents of the University of California General Revenue Bonds, 2013 
      Series AF (rated 'AA+'; Stable Outlook by Fitch) that have been 
      deposited in the series 4332 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4332 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (rated 
      'A+/F1'; Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4332 
      PUTTERs will expire on June 26, 2014, the expiration date of the 
      liquidity facility, unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bond deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

      Fitch Affirms JPMC 2001-C1
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed six classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp.'s (JPMC) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates, series 2001-C1. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations reflect Fitch expected losses and the increasingly 
      concentrated nature and adverse selection of the remaining loans in the 
      pool. Fitch modeled losses of 16.3% of the remaining pool; expected 
      losses on the original pool balance total 4.8%, including losses already 
      incurred. The pool has experienced $47.1 million (4.4% of the original 
      pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has designated two loans 
      (37%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes one specially serviced 
      asset (36.1%), the second largest loan in the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the June 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 97.3% to $28.8 million from $1.07 billion at 
      issuance. The remaining pool is extremely concentrated with seven of the 
      original 180 loans remaining. As of the June 2013 remittance date, one 
      loan (15.9% of the pool) has defeased since issuance. Interest 
      shortfalls are currently affecting classes J through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating on class H is expected to remain stable as the class benefits 
      from defeasance and has sufficient credit enhancement to offset Fitch 
      expected losses. The distressed class J may be subject to further rating 
      actions as losses are realized
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The specially serviced loan (36.1% of the pool) is secured by a 200-unit 
      multifamily property in Holland, OH. The loan had transferred to special 
      servicing in June 2010 for monetary default. The borrower had filed for 
      bankruptcy in August 2011. The bankruptcy stay was lifted in May 2012 
      and the servicer was in process of pursuing foreclosure; however, the 
      borrower filed for bankruptcy for the second time in November 2012. The 
      servicer reported occupancy at 96% as of June 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$18.7 million class H at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$9 million class J at 'Csf'; RE 45%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$1.1 million class K at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Class L at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Class M at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Class N at 'Dsf'; RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The balances on classes L, M, and N have been reduced to zero due to 
      realized losses. The class A-1, A-2, A-3, B, C, D, E, F, G, NC-1 , NC-2, 
      and X-2 certificates have paid in full. Fitch does not rate the class NR 
      certificate. Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only 
      class X-1 certificate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group analyst Marcelo Aguiar removed U.S.-traded
shares of Brazilian mining giant Vale SA from a key
Latin America stock list, saying the stock's 35 percent
year-to-date tumble reflects growing concerns over near-term
iron ore prices. The potential for further volatility as a
result of China and iron-ore price uncertainty led Aguiar and
his team to lower Vale's 12-month price target and EBITDA
estimates for the 2013-2015 period by 18 percent on average, he
said in a client note on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization and is a widely used gauge of the
operational profitability of a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aguiar removed Vale's American Depositary Receipts from the
so-called LatAm Focus List even after remaining "positive" on
the stock on a 12-month basis. "We acknowledge that our
conviction in the name has been wrong in light of the factors
mentioned above," he said in the note.&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer Announces Final Results of Zoetis Exchange Offer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced the final results of its offer 
      to its shareholders to exchange all, some or none of their shares of 
      Pfizer common stock for shares of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE: ZTS) common stock 
      owned by Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The exchange offer expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on 
      June 21, 2013. Under the terms of the exchange offer, 0.9898 shares of 
      Zoetis common stock were exchanged for each share of Pfizer common stock 
      accepted in the exchange offer. Pfizer accepted 405,117,195 shares of 
      its common stock in exchange for the 400,985,000 shares of Zoetis common 
      stock owned by Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Because the exchange offer was oversubscribed, Pfizer accepted tendered 
      shares of Pfizer common stock on a pro rata basis in proportion to the 
      total number of shares tendered. Shareholders who owned fewer than 100 
      shares of Pfizer common stock, or an &#8220;odd-lot&#8221;, who validly tendered all 
      of their shares, were not subject to proration if they requested such 
      preferential treatment in accordance with the terms of the exchange 
      offer. All shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by eligible 
      odd-lot shareholders who requested not to be subject to proration have 
      been accepted. The final proration factor of 24.1520516% was applied to 
      all other shares of Pfizer common stock that were validly tendered and 
      not validly withdrawn to determine the number of such shares that have 
      been accepted from each tendering shareholder.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on the final count by the exchange agent, Computershare Trust 
      Company, N.A., the final results of the exchange offer are as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      The exchange agent is expected to deliver shares of Zoetis common stock 
      as follows: (1) with respect to shares tendered through the Depository 
      Trust Company (DTC), to the account of DTC on June 27, 2013, so that DTC 
      can credit each applicable DTC participant (and such participant can 
      credit its respective account holders promptly thereafter), and (2) with 
      respect to shares tendered outside DTC, to the direct registered 
      accounts of the respective holders by July 5, 2013. The exchange agent 
      will mail checks in lieu of fractional shares of Zoetis common stock to 
      tendering holders with fractional interests after the exchange agent has 
      aggregated all fractional shares and sold them in the open market. 
      Shares of Pfizer common stock tendered but not accepted for exchange 
      will be returned to tendering shareholders in book-entry form.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, BofA Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs  Co. and 
      Morgan Stanley served as the dealer managers for the exchange offer.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc analyst Marcelo Aguiar raised the
recommendation on shares of Brazilian steelmaker Gerdau SA
  to "buy," saying recent declines in the stock
are probably overdone. Aguiar and his team also increased the
price target for the shares traded in S&#227;o Paulo to 17.80 reais
and for the American depositary receipts to $8.10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is expected to increase prices for some steel
products in Brazil during the third quarter and the first
quarter of next year on the back of a weaker currency and higher
international prices for the commodity, Aguiar said in a client
note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gerdau has high exposure and operating leverage to a U.S.
nonresidential recovery and acceleration in U.S. and Brazil
infrastructure spending, which our global industrials team
expects for 2014-15," the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        World's best-selling reference series explains rich set of Microsoft 
        Lync Enterprise capabilities and how businesses can reduce monthly 
        communications expenses, while adding features like Unified 
        Communications to improve productivity and collaboration
      
			
        New publication represents the fourth collaboration between Sonus and

		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sonus 
      Networks, Inc. (Nasdaq: SONS), a global 
      leader in SIP communications, today announced the release of the 
      definitive educational guide for companies who want to best understand 
      how to maximize Microsoft Lync deployments. Lync Enterprise Voice For 
      Dummies is published in partnership with John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 
      publisher of the world&#8217;s best-selling For Dummies&#174;&#160;reference series.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Linking Today&#8217;s Enterprise Together
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Whether inside or outside the four walls of the enterprise, Microsoft 
      Lync enables users to communicate securely and stay connected with 
      colleagues and customers, from virtually wherever they choose, using 
      applications such as instant messaging (IM), collaboration, conferencing 
      and voice. A January 2013 Webtorials study titled, &#8220;Enterprises Place 
      2013 Unified Communications Bets: How Many Horses in This Race?&#8221; found 
      there is considerable enterprise awareness and interest in Microsoft 
      Lync as a platform for Unified Communications (UC) and enterprise voice. 
      Fifty-eight percent of those surveyed already plan to deploy Microsoft 
      for IM and presence, and it appears to have the inside track with many 
      buyers when it comes to more advanced UC functions like web meetings, 
      desktop sharing and advanced directory services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Lync Enterprise Voice For Dummies examines new features and 
      capabilities enabled by Lync Enterprise Voice and how companies large 
      and small can use Lync to increase productivity while reducing 
      communications expenses. The book also educates readers about the 
      critical role of leveraging session border controllers (SBCs) to realize 
      the full benefits of a Lync Enterprise Voice deployment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SBCs serve a critical role in enabling and activating UC platforms, such 
      as Microsoft Lync, across enterprise Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 
      networks. These powerful network devices protect, secure, simplify and

      integrated management platform that enables organizations to efficiently 
      manage data centers, client devices and hybrid cloud IT environments. 
      The Hortonworks management packs for System Center will provide

			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/tsdqqv/global_public) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Public Cloud Market 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Global Public Cloud Market To Grow At A CAGR Of 29.96 Percent Over 
      The Period 2012-2016
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TechNavio's report, the Global Public Cloud Market 2012-2016, has been 
      prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry 
      experts. The report covers the Americas, and the EMEA and APAC regions; 
      it also covers the Global Public Cloud market landscape and its growth 
      prospects in the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of 
      the key vendors operating in this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Data Centers team 
      said: "Many countries across the globe are witnessing the introduction 
      of high bandwidth communication services such as 3G and 4G. With the 
      increasing bandwidth support, advanced applications such as Gtalk, 
      Skype, and BB Messenger are being widely used by end-users. These 
      applications are supported over smartphones and tablets which creates a 
      need for high-speed communication networks to be implemented. Many 
      end-users are storing their data in the cloud infrastructure and 
      accessing voice- and video-based applications, which is one of the major 
      trends in the Global Public Cloud market."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, enterprises are experiencing increasing

&lt;p&gt;The one thing missing from Euny Hongs wonderful dive into the all-night adventure that is the Goldman Sachs scavenger hunt is an explanation of what, to any Goldman type, is surely the most interesting bit of all: the finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong does tell us that there were 20 teams, made up mostly but not entirely of some 180 Goldman Sachs employees, and that after paying $270,000 in expenses, they raised $1.4 million for charity. So, each employee ponied up about $9,300, of which about $7,800 was tax-deductible, right? Of course not. This thing was structured by a Goldman partner, Elisha Wiesel, so it was obviously much more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wiesel came up with a solution: He would charge no entry fee, and he would launch the event as a non-profit fundraiser for Good Shepherd Services, where he is a board member. The roughly $270,000 of operating expenses were covered by Goldman Sachs Gives, a philanthropic fund financed by the firm and directed by its partners, through a grant made at his recommendation. &#8220;I wanted to be able to tell donors that every dollar they donated would go to the charity and not to operating costs,&#8221; he said. He appealed to his Goldman colleagues&#8217; competitive spirit by asking them to support one or more teams with their own grant recommendation or donation to Good Shepherd Services, a New York-based non-profit that provides support for over 25,000 at-risk youth and their families every year. The event netted $1.4 million for the organization, the bulk of which executive director Sister Paulette LoMonaco said would go toward giving high school dropouts the training needed to finish school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to note here, in terms of structured finance, is the weird and really rather clever use of the grant from Goldman Sachs Gives. Most philanthropic funds like to see their money put directly to good use. Goldmans $270,000, by contrast, was spent on putting together one of the most lavish scavenger hunts the world has ever seen. Is it really a good philanthropic use of money to develop an iPad app which changes the color of the Bank of America tower? In Goldmans eyes, yes, it is: because once Goldman was covering the expenses of the event, another $1.4 million poured into the coffers of Good Shepherd Services. By directing its money towards for-profit game designers rather than what non-profits like to call program activities, Goldman effectively managed to multiply its grant by an impressive multiple of more than 5X. No one knows better than Goldman that money is fungible; as a result, Goldman Sachs Gives doesnt mind that it wasnt their money which went to Good Shepherd Services. Truly this is a structure worthy of a Goldman partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, of course, theres the tax angle. If Wiesel had simply sold 180 tickets at $9,300 each, then only $7,800 of each ticket would have been tax deductible, since each of the scavenger hunters received $1,500 (!) in scavenger-hunt value over the course of their sleepless night. Instead, under Wiesels structure, the full $1.67 million ended up being fully tax-deductible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trick here is to note that there was no entry fee: tickets, if they existed, were free. Wiesel separated out capital and labor, in the scavenger-hunt stack, as elegantly as he might create differing tranches of a collateralized debt obligation. Heres how he explained it in an email to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The important thing to understand about last years event is that  for the most part, there are always exceptions  there were payers and there were players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior professionals, mostly partners, at GS ponied up the $70k/team. For the most part this population did not play the game. These are the payers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More junior professionals, again with rare exceptions, gave up their weekend and spend 15 grueling hours racking their brains and undergoing sleep deprivation, and did not pay for this privilege. These are the players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made my own GS Gives recommendation and covered the $13.5k/team operational costs such that the $70k/team raised was net rather than gross proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of this as you would a private equity deal. First, you have the founders, who arent rich but who are willing to put in sweat equity; theyre the talent, and without them nothing could happen. In this case, the founders are the teams  the 180 sleepless Goldmanites who ran around Manhattan all night solving clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But founders cant do anything without money  they need people who are willing to invest in them. So you have the limited partners  the investors who put up the bulk of the cash. Here, the LPs are the Goldman partners, and other senior Goldman types, who ponied up $70,000 for charity so that they could sponsor teams in the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, theres the general partner, the architect of the whole thing, the person who makes it happen and who multiplies his initial investment. Clearly, the GP here is Wiesel, who managed to tun a $270,000 donation into a $1.4 million donation by dint of funding a scavenger hunt. (And in typical GP style, even that money wasnt fully his: it came from the bigger Goldman Sachs Gives pot.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the players arent contributing any money, they dont need to worry about whether their contribution is fully deductible or not. Because the payers arent directly receiving the benefit of running around Manhattan all night, they dont need to subtract the cost of the event. And because Goldman Sachs Gives gave the $270,000 to Good Shepherd Services rather than directly to the organizers of the scavenger hunt, that donation too was fully deductible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its all quite admirable, in its own convoluted way: pretty much what youd expect when Eli Wiesels son joins Goldman Sachs. Im something of a connoisseur of Goldman Sachs charitable adventures: buy me a drink one day, and Ill tell you the story of Hank Paulson, Tierra Del Fuego and the Bronx Zoo. This one isnt nearly at that level, but its clever all the same, and I hope it gets repeated. Although at some point you do have to wonder whether they really needed to spend that much money on the game design.&lt;/p&gt;

			Labor Unions and Chevron Reach Agreement to Build Richmond Refinery 
      Modernization Project
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Chevron Richmond Project expected to reduce emissions, create up to 
      1,000 union construction jobs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Contra Costa Building and Construction Trades Council leaders this week 
      entered into a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) with Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 
      ensuring construction jobs created by the Refinery&#8217;s Modernization 
      Project are reserved for Building Trades&#160;members.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The PLA is a major milestone for local labor and the Refinery&#8217;s 
      Modernization Project, which is an important capital investment project 
      that, when approved by the City of Richmond, would benefit the local 
      community by reducing overall emissions at the refinery and creating up 
      to 1,000 union construction jobs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is a fantastic next step for local Building Trades men and women 
      and our community because the Refinery&#8217;s Modernization Project will 
      generate union jobs that our workforce badly needs,&#8221; said Greg Feere, 
      Chief Executive Officer of the Contra Costa Building and Construction 
      Trades Council. &#8220;Our members are anxious to get to work on this project, 
      and we look forward to partnering with the Richmond Refinery to help it 
      modernize its facility so that it can continue to serve as a major 
      economic engine and jobs creator for Richmond and the region. With this 
      agreement in place we will also be promoting local jobs, apprenticeship 
      opportunities and the Helmet to Hardhats Program.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By updating and replacing older equipment with new technologies, the 
      project will make the refinery inherently safer and achieve zero net 
      greenhouse gas emissions without changing the basic function of the 
      refinery. In addition, the Modernization Project will ensure the 
      refinery continues to drive economic growth in Richmond through the 
      continued production of motor and jet fuels, and lubricant products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Modernization Project will create a newer, cleaner and safer 
      refinery that is better for the community,&#8221; said Kory Judd, General 
      Manager of the Richmond Refinery. &#8220;We look forward to partnering with 
      labor to move the project forward in an open and transparent permitting 
      process.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The PLA signed by the Contra Costa Building and Construction Trades 
      Council and Chevron outlines the basic terms of how jobs will be filled 
      for the Modernization Project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The City of Richmond is currently working to produce the project&#8217;s 
      environmental impact report, which is expected to be released in early 
      2014. Final approval of the project by the City Council is anticipated 
      in late 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Procter  Gamble&#8217;s (PG) ground-breaking African-American consumer 
      campaign My Black is Beautiful (MBIB) will bring its thought-provoking Imagine 
      a Future documentary to Los Angeles as part of the first-ever BET 
      Experience at LA. Live, this June 28-30. As a sponsor, the brand will 
      offer an exclusive sneak peek at its compelling documentary, directed 
      and produced by Academy Award nominated Lisa Cort&#233;s, renowned director 
      Shola Lynch and executive producer Beverly Bond of BLACK GIRLS ROCK!, 
      that documents the current state of black beauty and provides an 
      in-depth look at the influences &#8211; people, fashion, music, pop culture &#8211; 
      of young black girls. This special event leads up to the highly 
      anticipated national BET broadcast premiere of the Imagine a 
      Future documentary on July 5, 2013 at 10 PM ET/9 PM CT and on 
      Centric on July 6th at 9 PM ET/8 PM CT.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;BET represents a preeminent media source for our African American 
      consumer and serves as the perfect platform to bring our Imagine a 
      Future documentary to the masses,&#8221; said Grace Janes, Brand Manager, 
      My Black is Beautiful. &#8220;With the sponsorship of the inaugural BET 
      Experience at L.A. Live and the national BET airing, our hope is to not 
      only spread a positive message about being your best self, but to also 
      act as a catalyst for open-dialogue. Let&#8217;s change the conversation 
      together.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Imagine a Future is a poignant first-hand story of 
      African-American teen Janet Goldsboro as she travels from Delaware to 
      South Africa on a journey of self-acceptance and self-discovery while 
      examining historical and contemporary beauty and self-esteem challenges 
      faced by many black women and girls. The documentary is infused with 
      perspectives of their own personal journeys from renowned media 
      personalities and luminaries such as Gabourey Sidibe, Michaela Angela 
      Davis, Gabrielle Douglas, Tatyana Ali, Melissa Harris-Perry and more. 
      This documentary challenges viewers to change the conversation by 
      re-thinking and re-imagining standards of beauty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We are so proud to be a part of such a moving and powerful documentary 
      that tears down the boundaries of beauty and redefines what it means to 
      be beautiful," said Debra Lee, CEO and Chairman of BET Networks. "The 
      premiere of Imagine a Future on BET is one of many initiatives 
      that exemplify our continued commitment to the network's longstanding 
      partnership with PG and My Black Is Beautiful."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Immediately before the national BET premiere on July 5, 2013, MBIB will 
      engage consumers by hosting a live Twitter party to encourage fans to 
      view the documentary and change the conversation. And, the dialogue 
      continues after the credits with the airing of &#8220;Girl Talk,&#8221; a 
      summit-style discussion featuring Imagine a Future star Janet 
      Goldsboro, the documentary director and producer team and African 
      American female leaders, also on BET.

&lt;p&gt;* Rescue fund aims to sell Postbank, Proton by mid-July&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Sale agreed with troika in order meet bailout conditions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Hires Goldman and Rothschild to advise on sale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Greek banks Alpha, Eurobank, National seen as bidders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By George Georgiopoulos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATHENS, June 28 (Reuters) - Greece's bank rescue fund has
hired Rothschild and Goldman Sachs as advisers on the
sale of lenders Proton and Hellenic Postbank (TT), which are
most likely to be bought by bigger Greek banks, officials told
Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TT and Proton, victims of Greece's economic crisis, were
split into "good" and "bad" parts and are fully owned by the
Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF), a capital backstop
with 50 billion euros ($65 billion) of bailout money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greece agreed with its international lenders - the European
Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the European
Central Bank - to sell the two banks by mid-July in order to get
more bailout funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is the sell-side adviser on Hellenic Postbank,
Rothschild on Proton," said one of the officials. The two were
most likely to be bought by bigger Greek banks - Alpha
, National or Eurobank, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior Alpha Bank executive told Reuters on Friday Alpha
would look into buying TT. "Yes, we are interested in Postbank,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piraeus Bank has said it will not make any more
acquistions in the near future after taking over Societe
Generale's and Millenium BCP's Greek units
and the local operations of three Cypriot banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eurobank is one of the possible buyers, a lot will depend
on what the other banks do. The advisers will approach all of
them," a second banker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities wound down TT in January after efforts to sell
it failed. They stripped out bad loans from its portfolio and
transferred less risky assets and deposits to a new entity
called New Hellenic Postbank. The bad loans are being
sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HFSF pumped 4 billion euros into the bank to cover its
funding gap - the difference between assets and liabilities -
and a further 500 million to recapitalise it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other Greek lenders, TT was hit by writedowns on Greek
bonds and loan impairments as the country endures its sixth year
of deep recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eurobank, Alpha and National had expressed interest in the
old TT but withdrew in January, leading authorities to wind it
down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The healthy TT has assets of 13.7 billion euros, deposits of
10.7 billion and a network of about 200 branches. Proton is a
much smaller bank with deposits of one billion euros and 1.3
billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;

      The Hon. Craig Cannonier, JP, MP, Premier of Bermuda offered the 
      following statement today regarding recent comments by United Kingdom 
      Governor of Bermuda, George Fergusson, and United States Consul General 
      to Bermuda, Robert Settje, at the Insurance Day Summit Bermuda

      Bermuda economy:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Bermuda government is focused on strengthening the Bermuda economy 
      and creating jobs and opportunities for Bermudians. We appreciate the 
      support of the U.K. Governor and the U.S. Consul General. Their 
      recognition that Bermuda provides real value to the U.S. in the form of 
      insurance, reinsurance, international investment and the need to deliver 
      that message around the world is very much appreciated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/dmdpqj/healthcare) 
      has announced the addition of Wintergreen Research, Inc's new report "Healthcare 
      Decision Support and IBM Watson: Market Shares, Strategies, and 
      Forecasts, Worldwide, 2013 to 2019" to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worldwide healthcare cognitive computing markets are poised to achieve 
      continuing growth as the healthcare delivery system responds to new 
      products. Growth is achieved in response to changing technology, better 
      analytics, and new information systems that leverage natural language, 
      and changing market conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Healthcare decision support markets consist of traditional market 
      participants led by McKesson and Watson from IBM. IBM Watson offers 
      structured and unstructured data in combination. This represents a major 
      breakthrough in what kind of decision support can be offered.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM Watson can provide a far more differentiated testing assessment. 
      Watson knows what tests are relevant to further characterize a 
      particular patient condition and what tests are not. It is a great help 
      to physicians to have an assistant that is able to have read the latest 
      journal articles and is loaded with medical information to recommend 
      what tests may be relevant in a particular situation. Wrong tests, tests 
      that are not useful in a particular situation, account for 30% of the 
      costs of healthcare delivery in the US. This is a lot. To have a new 
      system available that addresses these issues is great.

      Research and Markets: Global IBM Software Innovation: Market Shares, 
      Strategies, and Forecasts to 2019
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/vj36lg/ibm_software) 
      has announced the addition of Wintergreen Research, Inc's new report "IBM 
      Software Innovation: Market Shares, Strategies, and Forecasts, 
      Worldwide, 2013 to 2019" to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM concentrates on building end to end systems that are able to adapt 
      of market changes. While this may make the IBM product set seem overly 
      heavy in the short run, in the long run, this is of enormous value to 
      clients as proved by the company market leading position in innovation 
      software.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The enterprise uses software innovation to transition to higher quality 
      automated process, middleware to support smarter computing, and cloud 
      computing in an era of smart phones. IBM is profiled as the leader in 
      this software innovation initiative. The ability to federate and spread 
      workloads securely between private and public clouds is "hybrid cloud 
      computing." One mission of software innovation is to lead customers on 
      the journey to hybrid cloud computing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Physical convergence with digital representations of the physical world 
      is creating complexity. Communication between machine to machine has 
      caused an inflection point for the need for a quickened pace for the 
      management and design of assets with software representing a significant 
      aspect of innovation implementation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Software is able to support innovation in enterprise markets because 
      software is so much easier to change than physical devices.

		&lt;p&gt;
      In honor of the 60th anniversary of Walt Disney Imagineering and the 
      origins of Disney Parks and Resorts, Imagineering is hosting an &#8220;open

      discussions on Sunday, August 11, celebrating their 60 magical years of

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW/LONDON, June 28 (Reuters) - Russian coal producer
Mechel, under pressure to cut debts of more than $9
billion, has hired investment bank JP Morgan to sell its
U.S. business, Mechel Bluestone,  sources familiar with the
matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechel, Russia's largest producer of coal for the steel
industry, acquired Bluestone in 2009 from private owners for
$425 million plus shares, a deal valued at the time at around
$800 million, including $135 million of Bluestone debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of the U.S. asset is unlikely to be easy at a time
when major mining companies are putting a host of assets on the
market to slim down and boost profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the sources suggested a price tag for U.S. business
in the current market would be roughly half the original value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechel Bluestone is facing an oversupplied market in Asia
and falling exports from the United States. It was forced to
idle U.S. mines at the end of last year due to poor market
conditions, restarting major operations earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russian parent, however, needs to cut debts that stand
at more than six times its current market capitalisation. These
were built up when the group expanded before the 2008 financial
crisis sent steel and coal prices tumbling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Mechel pushed back development of its
key Elga coal deposit in Russia - one of the world's largest
untapped coking coal deposits - by up to five years. Poor market
conditions have also delayed Mechel's plans to sell up to 25
percent of its entire mining division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bluestone operates three mining complexes in West Virginia,
producing mostly steel-making coal for customers in United
States but also Canada, Europe, Asia and South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, according to its annual report, Bluestone sold 2
million tonnes of coking and steam coal. Roughly 70 percent of
the coking coal is exported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of last year, Mechel temporarily idled its
Bluestone mines due to "high levels of coal inventories and
adverse market conditions." It has since restarted production at
several of the key mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechel, which produces coal but also iron ore and
semi-finished steel products, is the world's 10th largest coking
coal exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan and Mechel declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Lubricant Market - 2013 Report Featuring 
      Leading Players Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil, BP And Others
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/p5z23v/global_lubricant) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Lubricant Market 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Global Lubricant Market To Grow At A CAGR Of 2.68 Percent Over The 
      Period 2012-2016
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Lubricant Market 2012-2016 report has been prepared based on 
      an in-depth analysis of the market with inputs from industry experts. 
      The report covers the Americas, and the EMEA and APAC regions; it also 
      covers Global Lubricant market landscape and its growth prospects in the 
      coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors 
      operating in this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Engineering team 
      said: ''The growth of the Global Lubricant market is a result of the 
      increase in technological innovation across the globe. Currently, 
      technological advancement is being witnessed across various 
      manufacturing industries such as the Automotive, Food and Beverage, 
      Textile, Agriculture, and Power industries. As efficiency and 
      productivity have become the primary goals of any industry, 
      organizations across industries need high-quality reliable 
      energy-efficient manufacturing equipment which can operate at a high 
      temperature and improve the productivity of plants. Therefore, several 
      lubricant manufactures across the globe have started developing more 
      thermally-stable and less volatile fluids that can be used in 
      manufacturing equipment. Thus, this advancement in the field of 
      technology will increase the demand for highly efficient lubricants with 
      increased functional and operational competency during the forecast 
      period.''
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main drivers is the increasing 
      demand for superior-quality lubricants from the Motor Vehicle 
      Aftermarket segment. Vehicles such as passenger cars, light trucks, and 
      vans are increasingly being adopted across the globe, especially in 
      developing countries such as India and China. These vehicles utilize 
      various types of lubricants at regular intervals for their consistent 
      performance.
