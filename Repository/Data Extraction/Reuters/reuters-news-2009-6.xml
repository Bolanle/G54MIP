&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft introduces "Project Natal"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Controller-free technology for Xbox 360 game system&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft integrates Facebook, Twitter into Xbox Live
 (Recasts; adds Project Natal details, executive comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Franklin Paul&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, June 1 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Monday
offered a glimpse into a future where the Xbox 360 console is
the centerpiece of any living room, and games, social
interaction and communications are controlled with the wave of
a hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At a star-studded event at the annual E3 video game
conference that drew appearances by Paul McCartney and Steven
Spielberg, the company unveiled "Project Natal," which uses a
camera to track a user's movements via full skeletal mapping.
It also recognizes voices and vocal commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The technology obviates the need for a controller or remote
device to enable a player for instance to drive a car in a
game, interact with a character on screen or show pictures and
information to other Xbox 360 users over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You are the controller," Shane Kim, Microsoft's vice
president of strategy and business development for videogames,
said in an interview in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That's a very powerful piece of technology -- full body
gesture tracking, not just two hands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, Microsoft also said it planned to boost its Xbox
360 gaming console by integrating music-streaming service
last.fm, Web social network Facebook and microblogging site
Twitter into its Xbox Live online community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The announcements underscore how the interactive gaming
industry, a growing business with estimated annual sales of
about $50 billion despite the economic downturn, is looking
into ways to attract new gamers while retaining their core
audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps with an eye on the economy, Don Mattrick, senior
vice president of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment
Business, said the "Natal" technology can refresh the gaming
experience without making consumers buy a new device, which
typically costs $250 to $500. Microsoft would also avoid hefty
manufacturing and marketing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We can leap into a new era of interactive entertainment
without launching a new console," Mattrick told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kim declined to detail when "Project Natal" games and
service will be available, saying only that "it's not a 2009
thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IN LIVING COLOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft's Game Studios, said
the technology has been well received by software developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's pretty obvious that the controller is not going away,
but the ability to augment the gaming experience that people
are used to is one of the paths that people will take," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For now, Microsoft is focusing on beefing up its fledgling
Xbox Live service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Users of Xbox Live will be able to keep tabs on and
communicate with friends using popular Internet services such
as Facebook and Twitter, without needing to use a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move broadens Microsoft's goal of transforming the
console system -- a distant No. 2 to Nintendo Inc's Wii machine
-- into the center of the living room and more than just a
game-playing box. That goal is echoed by Sony Corp, whose
PlayStation 3 console also hosts community and entertainment
features as well as game playing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This expands the reach of Xbox live," Kim said. "We have
had an effort of making Xbox live a next-generation social and
entertainment network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The event was kicked off by a demonstration of the upcoming
version of Viacom Inc's MTV Networks' Rock Band franchise
featuring songs by The Beatles. Taking the stage briefly were
surviving Band members Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, and Yoko
Ono and Olivia Harrison, widows of John Lennon and George
Harrison, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For more details of Microsoft's event, click

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, June 1 (Reuters) - The Sunrise 545-megawatt
natural gas-fried power plant in Kern County, California,
returned to nearly full production after a short shutdown,
according to a Monday report by the California Independent

&lt;p&gt; Cal ISO said the plant, which went offline on May 28, was

Edison International (EIX.N) of Rosemead, California, and half
by San Francisco-area based Chevron Corp (CVX.N). It is
operated by Edison Mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Edison International's biggest unit is utility Southern
California Edison, one of the largest utilities in the United
States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In California, a megawatt can power between 650 and 700
average homes under normal conditions.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and American Express Co (AXP.N) on Monday announced plans to sell $5.5 billion of common stock, hoping to position themselves to quickly repay funds from the government's bank bailout plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will sell $5 billion of stock and American Express will sell $500 million. The JPMorgan offering will be priced by Tuesday morning, a person close to the matter said. The person was granted anonymity because the timing is not public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both New York-based companies were among the 19 U.S. lenders to recently undergo the government "stress tests" of their ability to weather a deep recession, and were among the nine that regulators said did not need more capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Monday the government will announce next week which of the 19 will be allowed to repay the government. One condition for repayment is that they are able to raise money in the public equity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan took $25 billion from the Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program, and said it expects to repay the sum this month. It said repayment is in "the best interests of the country and the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express took $3.4 billion from TARP, and Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault said his company has always viewed TARP as a "temporary" program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many banks have criticized TARP for its restrictions, including on compensation, and a perception among investors that recipients are desperate for capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, in April called it a "scarlet letter" for a bank to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONDITIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed said that to repay aid, banks must show their ability to sell equity, sell long-term debt not backed by the government, foster lending, maintain sufficient capital, meet their funding needs and obligations, and be a source of "strength" to their subsidiaries. [ID:nN01218884]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect regulators to let some of the nine companies found to need no capital to repay TARP soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies include JPMorgan, American Express, Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), BBT Corp (BBT.N), Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), State Street Corp (STT.N) and U.S. Bancorp (USB.N). MetLife Inc (MET.N), the ninth company, did not take money from TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also expect Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N), found to have small capital holes, to soon be eligible to repay the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was expected on Monday to sell up to $1.9 billion of shares in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS) (1398.HK). It took $10 billion from TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10 banks ordered to plug capital shortfalls have until June 8 to win regulatory approval of their capital plans. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) has said it has plugged close to $26 billion of its $33.9 billion shortfall, while SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N) on Monday set plans to fill a $2.2 billion hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Additional reporting by Tim Ahmann and Mark Felsenthal in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Other Phase 3 Advanced Breast Cancer Trials of Sunitinib Continue
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc today announced the discontinuation of the SUN 1094 Phase 3 study
that evaluated SUTENT&#174; (sunitinib malate) plus paclitaxel versus bevacizumab
plus paclitaxel for the first line treatment of patients with advanced breast
cancer. The independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) found that treatment
with sunitinib in combination with paclitaxel would be unable to meet the
primary endpoint of superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the
combination of bevacizumab and paclitaxel. No new safety issues were identified.


"While we are disappointed that this trial did not meet its primary endpoint, we
are continuing to study sunitinib in different breast cancer populations and
with different regimens," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of
Clinical Development and Medical Affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit.
"Pfizer remains committed to evaluating sunitinib in advanced breast cancer
through its two other Phase 3 clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of
Sutent in combination with standard of care chemotherapies." 

One Phase 3 trial (SUN 1064) is a comparison of SUTENT plus docetaxel vs.
docetaxel for the first line treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer,
and the second (SUN 1099) is a Phase 3 trial of SUTENT plus capecitabine vs.
capecitabine for the second line treatment of patients with advanced breast
cancer. These trials are ongoing with an analysis expected by the end of the
year or early next year. 

Pfizer has notified clinical trial investigators involved in the study and
regulatory agencies of these findings. 

These results do not affect the approved indications with sunitinib as
monotherapy. Sunitinib is currently approved for both gastrointestinal stromal
tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate,
and advanced / metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) based on efficacy and
safety data from large, randomized Phase 3 clinical trials. Sunitinib has played
an important role in reshaping the treatment landscape for these two
difficult-to-treat cancers. To date, more than approximately 58,000 patients
globally have been treated with sunitinib. 

Sunitinib Clinical Research Program

Pfizer Oncology is committed to helping to improve the lives of breast cancer
patients and is dedicated to further developing agents for the treatment of
patients in the advanced breast cancer setting - a patient population with
significant unmet medical needs. 

Pfizer is also continuing to study the potential role of sunitinib in the
treatment of various other solid tumors including advanced non-small cell lung
cancer, advanced colorectal cancer, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and
advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer, in Phase 3 trials. 

Healthcare professionals who are interested in learning more about sunitinib
trials that are open for enrollment can visit the SUN program web site at
www.suntrials.com. Patients with questions should contact their treating
physician. 

About Advanced Breast Cancer

Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related
death among women globally. Compared to early stage breast cancer, effective
therapy for advanced breast cancer, which includes inoperable locally advanced
and metastatic disease, remains a clinical challenge in the oncology community.
Additional treatment options are desperately needed to address this continuing
unmet medical need. 

About SUTENT() (sunitinib malate)

SUTENT is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of GIST
after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate and advanced /
metastatic RCC. 

SUTENT works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important SUTENT targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. SUTENT also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Important SUTENT() (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of childbearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on SUTENT. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with SUTENT. 

The most common adverse reactions in GIST and RCC clinical trials were fatigue,
asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal
pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin discoloration,
altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

selling common stock, and to price the offering by Tuesday
morning, a person close to the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, the nation's second-largest bank, was among 19
U.S. lenders to recently undergo government "stress tests" of
its ability to weather a deep recession, and was one of nine
that regulators said did not need more capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said that once it completes its latest capital
raising, it will have met all the conditions to repay the $25
billion it took from the Treasury Department's Troubled Asset
Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said it expects to repay the government "before the end
of June," and that doing so "is in the best interests of the
country and the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many banks have criticized TARP for its restrictions,
including on compensation, and the percetion among investors
that recipients are desperate for capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has called it a
"scarlet letter" for a bank to be involved in TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares closed Monday down 79 cents at $36.11 on
the New York Stock Exchange.

The Company Believes That It Has Met All Conditions and Will Fully Redeem the

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced today that it intends to raise $5
billion in common equity to satisfy a supervisory condition that the largest
bank holding companies redeeming TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) preferred
capital demonstrate access to the equity capital markets. While approval has not
been granted, the company believes that upon completion of this capital raise it
will have satisfied the criteria for fully redeeming the TARP preferred capital
and expects to do so before the end of June. 

JPMorgan Chase expects to have Tier One Capital of approximately $118 billion or
9.3% and Tier One Common of approximately $93 billion or 7.3% at the end of the
second quarter, after the capital raise and the TARP preferred capital
redemption. The company also expects to maintain its extremely strong capital
ratios, even in the event of a more highly stressed environment over the next
two years. 

JPMorgan Chase believes that redeeming the TARP preferred capital is in the best
interests of the country and the company, and that these funds can be used by
the Government for other critical purposes. JPMorgan Chase also reaffirms its
commitment to continued robust lending to consumers, small businesses,
non-profits, municipalities, corporations and others.

&lt;p&gt;  PORTLAND, OR, Jun 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Webtrends, a global analytics leader with world class data collection and
analysis, today announced the ability to fully track and analyze search
data generated from Microsoft's new search site, called Bing. Bing is
Microsoft's most current upgrade to Live Search and is the company's most
aggressive challenge to competing search products from Google and Yahoo!.
Webtrends is the first web analytics company to announce full support of
Bing.

    With Webtrends On Demand software, available immediately, Webtrends
customers are able to track specifically which traffic comes to their site
from Bing.com. All search engine reporting, including paid or organic
search, keywords and phrases, will automatically include detailed analysis
of Bing.com data and traffic.

    "Once Bing.com was announced at the 2009 All Things D conference,
Webtrends engineering immediately began work to ensure our customers are
able to track all search results from the new engine," said Jascha
Kaykas-Wolff, vice president, marketing, Webtrends. "Our customers expect
this kind of nimble, quick integration and we are proud to say that all
analytics customers can analyze changes in search traffic to their site
from Bing.com versus other search engines immediately."

    Search has become the main tool used by people to surf the web and
continues to innovate across paid and organic channels. As search services
like Bing push new features to users, such as Bing's table of contents, a
navigation rail that allows users to refine their searches, changing with
each individual query, customers will look toward Webtrends to provide
detailed analysis of that data.

    With insights into search engine adoption and usage of Microsoft's Bing,
Webtrends customers across its eight vertical industries will be better
positioned to analyze online advertising campaigns across all search
results.

    In April 2009, Microsoft accounted for 8.2 percent of searches in the
United States, which pales in comparison to Google's 64.2 percent,
according to ComScore. Yahoo's share was 20.4 percent.

    About Webtrends Inc.

    Webtrends is a trusted analytics advisor in the business of collecting,
analyzing, delivering and ultimately transforming data into understanding.
Webtrends delivers the industry's most recognized search engine marketing,
visitor intelligence, and analytics solutions to enable companies to

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Jun 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Editors Note: A video and photo are included with this press release.

    Xenos Group Inc. (TSX: XNS) today announced Xenos ePresentment(TM) for
IBM(R) Content Manager OnDemand (CMOD), the latest addition to the suite
of Xenos solutions that complement IBM Enterprise Content Management
(ECM) software.

    Xenos ePresentment is a fully integrated online solution that provides a
central interface for IBM CMOD to control the load and retrieval of
business-critical content - such as customer bank, credit card or
brokerage statements and insurance declaration documents - generated in
high-volume print stream and image formats.

    Xenos ePresentment simplifies the integration between corporate portals,
web presences, and the IBM CMOD archive. It captures, transforms, indexes
and packages a wide variety of print stream formats for loading IBM CMOD
via its ARSLOAD utility. On the retrieve side, Xenos ePresentment
integrates seamlessly with the IBM CMOD OnDemand Web Enablement Kit
(ODWEK) interface to provide document search, hit list display,
transformation on-the-fly and document presentment functionality.

    With Xenos ePresentment for IBM CMOD organizations can:

    - Meet corporate and customer service level agreements (SLAs) for online
document delivery performance;

    - Rapidly and cost-effectively implement a new online customer channel by
extending the IBM CMOD implementation;

    - Ensure document fidelity and delivery format flexibility by providing a
single interface for capturing, processing and packaging a wide variety
of print stream, image, and PDF format types;

    - Extract, deliver and repurpose content for either internal corporate
operations or customer-facing communication;

    - Reduce document archive storage costs when used in combination with the
Xenos DSR(TM) (Document Storage Reduction) solution.

    "Today customers, partners and internal stakeholders demand web access to
accurate, timely, and pertinent business information," said Stuart Butts,
Chairman and CEO, Xenos Group Inc. "Driven by competitive pressure to
continually improve the customer experience, organizations are moving
rapidly to an online model for customer interaction. For companies using
IBM CMOD, this solution enables seamless online information access.
Customer service representatives can now see the same information as
clients and react promptly to in-person or telephone service requests.
This provides a marked competitive advantage and can dramatically reduce
operational costs."

    Xenos provides a range of product and service offerings that complement
IBM ECM software, and was recently named IBM ECM ValueNet Strategic
Technology Partner of the Year for 2008. Over the last six months, Xenos
also launched the following complementary IBM solutions:

    - Xenos Loader(TM) for IBM FileNet P8 platform and IBM CMOD: Imports high
volumes of print stream documents, images and associated metadata
seamlessly into IBM FileNet P8 and/or IBM CMOD. This offering enhances
the value of an existing IBM FileNet P8 implementation by logically
breaking up high volumes of stacked files into individual document
objects. It transforms formats as required and can extract additional
indexing information directly from the content during processing.

    - Xenos DSR(TM) - Document Storage Reduction for ECM: Dramatically
reduces the amount of physical storage consumed by high-volume documents
retained within corporate archives and repositories. The solution
intelligently separates and stores duplicate print and composition
resources from the unique transactional content found within a
high-volume document batch.

    The Xenos suite of solutions is built on the Xenos Enterprise Server(TM)
(Xenos ES) component-based Java architecture. Xenos ES resolves the
challenge of rationalizing business information architecture and flow for
both structured and unstructured data by streamlining enterprise
information supply chains, making information available where, when and
how it is needed.

    Xenos ePresentment is available immediately. For pricing information,

&lt;p&gt;* Twenty teachers to take math and science knowledge into New Orleans classrooms

* Part of extensive training program at Xavier University 
* ExxonMobil has contributed $10 million to math and science education

NEW ORLEANS--(Business Wire)--
Twenty New Orleans-area middle school math teachers were honored last Friday by
Louisiana First Lady Supriya Jindal for completing the initial phase of an
extensive training program at the Math and Science Teacher Institute through
Xavier University of Louisiana - part of a $10 million commitment from the
ExxonMobil Foundation to help restore and enhance math and science education in
New Orleans. 

Through the ExxonMobil grant, the institute provides training and support to
local math and science teachers to help them build content knowledge, integrate
effective instructional methods and enhance classroom strategies. It was created
in partnership with Xavier University, which has developed and hosted the
training. 

"One of the best drivers of student success is the quality of classroom teachers
and the spark and encouragement they can provide," said Gerald McElvy, president
of the ExxonMobil Foundation. "When you impact a teacher`s knowledge-base, you
can impact more than 100 students per day. ExxonMobil is proud to partner with
Xavier University to start up the Math and Science Teacher Institute, and we
know this program will make a huge difference for New Orleans school children." 

The fourth through eighth grade teachers were selected through an application
process based on their willingness to improve their knowledge and skills, strong
commitment to closing the achievement gap and their commitment to remaining a
teacher in the Greater New Orleans area for at least two years after completing
the program. 

"We salute the ExxonMobil Foundation for recognizing the critical need for math
and science teachers and for funding this type of program," said Xavier
University President Dr. Norman C. Francis. "Xavier is committed to enhance
teacher preparation in New Orleans, specifically the teaching of mathematics and
science in the middle school years. It is an opportunity to make a major
difference in the education of a new generation of students." 

In addition to the initial training that consisted of a two-week summer
institute, teachers will meet twice a month for the remainder of the school year
with top local, national and international math educators who have developed
concepts for improving performance levels for all students.

Corporation in the United States. The Foundation and the Corporation engage in a

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) was on Monday selling up to about $1.9 billion worth of shares in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (1398.HK)(601398.SS) at a discount of 4 percent to 6 percent to the Chinese lender's Monday closing price, according to a term sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  PRINCETON, NJ, Jun 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Walt MacDonald has been appointed Executive Vice President, Programs and
Services for Educational Testing Service (ETS). MacDonald was formerly
Senior Vice President of Higher Education and School Assessments at ETS.

consolidation, we'll be able to make rapid decisions and move faster than
ever to meet the evolving needs of our clients and customers."

in what was then the College Board Division. Since then, he has held a
number of leadership positions of increasing responsibility at ETS. In
1987, he became Director of Test Development for the National Assessment

Education.

    In 1993 he was promoted to Executive Director of the area managing The
College Board's Advanced Placement Program. In 2002, MacDonald was named
Associate Vice President for College Board Programs, School &amp; College

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Investors Seek to Make Owners Rent

In some select markets, even with foreclosures still looming, bidding wars are
actually occurring. 

In Phoenix for example, a large supply of foreclosed families who can no longer
qualify for a loan has spurred investor interest to turn as many of these
families as possible into rent-paying tenants in the very homes they used to
own. The bidding war is generally from absentee buyers (investor or vacation
properties), which currently represents 4 out of 10 homes sold in the Phoenix
metropolitan area as of April. This is about double the level experienced for
2007. 

Homes that sold originally for $225,000, now have been sold for $80,000-110,000.
Great news for the investor, unless the population contracts. 

Similar antidotal data appears to be occurring in the California markets of such
as Carlsbad, Oceanside and Vista, but only at much higher prices in the
$350,000-400,000 range. 

For the banks such as (but not limited to) Citigroup (NYSE: C), Bank of America
(NYSE: BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), US Bancorp (NYSE: USB), JPMorgan Chase
(NYSE: JPM), their respective Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) levels may not
expand as these homes sell, but we would expect the need for additional
substantial write-offs and provisions from the valuation of these sold homes has
been cut more than in half.

 (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, June 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) was on
Monday selling up to about $1.9 billion worth of shares in
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (1398.HK)(601398.SS) at
a discount of 4 percent to 6 percent to the Chinese lender's
Monday closing price, according to a term sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shares represent nearly 20 percent of Goldman's 4.93
percent stake in the Chinese bank, which is the world's biggest
lender by market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman pledged earlier this year to keep 80 percent of its
ICBC stake until April 2010. Under an earlier lockup agreement,
Goldman would have been permitted to sell half of its stake in
the state-controlled bank this past April and the rest in
October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street bank was selling 3.03 billion shares at
HK$4.80-HK$4.90 each, the term sheet said. ICBC's Hong Kong
shares rose 4.7 percent to close at HK$5.11 each on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs, which was managing the sale, declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC's Hong Kong-listed shares have jumped nearly 43 percent
since Goldman announced plans to extend its investment in the
bank, which was also the day ICBC posted flat fourth-quarter
profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index .HSI has risen nearly 39
percent over the same period, including a 3.95 percent surge on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Battered western banks including Bank of America (BAC.N),
Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and UBS (UBS.N)(UBSN.VX) have
sold stakes in big Chinese banks in recent months in order to
raise capital.

DEMONSTRATION DETAILS

 WHAT:     Virtutech, Inc., the leader in Virtualized Systems Development (VSD), will demonstrate an integration of its Simics, Ready for Rational platform with IBM Rational Build Forge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 WHY:      Today`s systems include an increasing number of multi-CPU/ASIC/FPGA/DSP, platforms or network connected servers. As a result, the complexity and effort of developing, building, testing and integrating these systems has become a major challenge to many development teams.                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
           These challenges are eased through the adoption of VSD; the process of developing, integrating and testing full systems software like OS, driver, communication and application software, on a virtual system instead of real hardware. The use of a flexible virtualized system instead of rigid physical hardware dramatically improves "what-if?" scenarios for design exploration, early-integration, development team collaboration and debugging.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
           IBM Rational Build Forge is a flexible, adaptive framework capable of adding process automation, acceleration, notification and scheduling capabilities to existing software for building, testing, packaging and deploying solutions. Now with the integration of Simics and IBM Rational Build Forge, the benefits of VSD extend to cover the software build, test, package and deploy cycle.

&lt;p&gt;Research explores biomarkers as potential predictors of sensitivity to treatment
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer announced today results from studies evaluating the company`s
investigational anti-insulin growth factor- type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) antibody,
figitumumab (CP-751,871), in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A
total of three abstracts were presented at the 45th Annual American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Orlando. 

"As we try to find the right drug to use in the right setting for each patient,
we are encouraged by these data, suggesting a relationship between tumor
histology and response to figitumumab," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice
president of clinical development and medical affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology
Business Unit. "Given that patients with advanced NSCLC face a poor prognosis,
it is important to be able to identify specific patients who may benefit most
from different treatment options." 

Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. NSCLC accounts for about 85
percent of lung cancer cases and remains difficult to treat, particularly in the
metastatic setting. Nearly 60 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed late with
Stage IIIB/IV advanced disease. In Stage IV patients, the five-year survival
rate is only two percent. For all stages of NSCLC, the five-year survival rate
is only 15 percent. 

Over 60 Percent Response Rate Observed in 56 Patients with Squamous Cell
Carcinoma NSCLC Treated with Chemotherapy Plus Figitumumab

A single-arm extension cohort (n=56) was conducted to confirm the preliminary
findings from a randomized Phase 2 study of 156 patients, which evaluated
overall response with figitumumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel
in patients with NSCLC. The Phase 2 study suggested a dose-response relationship
in patients with squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. 

In the extension cohort study, 56 patients with non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC
(squamous cell, large cell, and not otherwise specified) were enrolled and
treated with figitumumab (20 mg/kg), plus carboplatin (AUC of 6) and paclitaxel
(200 mg/m2). As measured by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors), 27 out of 42 squamous cell patients (64.3 percent) demonstrated a
response. One complete and 26 partial responses were observed. In fifteen of the
26 partial responses, there was a 50 to 95 percent reduction in tumor size. Of
10 patients with large cell carcinoma/not otherwise specified tumors, two
partial responses were seen. 

"Despite improvements in treatment, NSCLC is a heterogeneous disease that
remains difficult to control," said Dr. Daniel Karp, director of The University
of TexasM. D. Anderson Cancer Center Clinical and Translational Research Center
(CTRC). "The striking reductions in tumor size seen in squamous NSCLC patients
treated with figitumumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel are
encouraging for this patient population with limited treatment options." 

Twenty patients received single-agent figitumumab upon discontinuation of
chemotherapy. Reductions in tumor size with figitumumab maintenance treatment
were observed in two patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.7
months for the overall extension cohort (n=56), 5.9 months for patients with
squamous cell carcinoma (n=46) and 3 months for patients with large cell
carcinoma and not otherwise specified tumors (n=10). 

Figitumumab was generally well-tolerated in the extension cohort. The most
common grade 3/4 adverse events were hyperglycemia (11 percent), fatigue (7
percent), and neutropenia (5 percent). Hyperglycemia almost always occurred
within the first treatment cycle and was generally manageable with standard
measures. 

Free IGF-1 as a Plasma Biomarker That May Predict Response to Figitumumab

Results from translational research conducted as part of the randomized Phase 2
study of figitumumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in NSCLC
patients suggest that the amount of biologically active free IGF-1 (fIGF-1) in
plasma may help predict which patients will respond to figitumumab therapy. A
total of 156 patients were enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the study.
Baseline blood samples were obtained from 116 patients. 

High fIGF-1 appeared to be a marker for resistance to chemotherapy, with median
PFS as low as 2.1 months for patients in the highest fIGF-1 quartile (P=0.11).
Patients with elevated baseline fIGF-1 levels appeared particularly sensitive to
figitumumab. Study findings showed that adding figitumumab (20 mg/kg) to
chemotherapy in patients with high levels of fIGF-1 increased PFS, versus
treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (by 3.4 months, 6 months vs. 2.6
months, respectively, P=0.001 for patients with fIGF-1 &gt;0.6 ng/mL, and by 3.9
months, 6 months vs. 2.1 months, respectively, p=0.001, for patients with fIGF-1
&gt;0.9 ng/mL). 

In summary, results from this study suggest that determining baseline levels of
free IGF-1 may contribute to the identification of patients who may respond to
treatment with figitumumab. 

Exploring Additional Biomarkers As Predictors of Sensitivity To Figitumumab In
NSCLC

Data presented at ASCO reports on IGF-1R pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) biomarkers that may inform the design of future trials of
figitumumab in advanced NSCLC. 

In this study, authors analyzed 151 blood samples from 42 patients enrolled in
the randomized Phase 2 study of figitumumab in combination with carboplatin and
paclitaxel in NSCLC patients. They observed elevated plasma levels of fIGF-1 in
patients with adenocarcinoma compared with those with squamous cell carcinoma
(P=0.0326) and with large cell carcinoma (P=0.026). 

In patients with squamous cell carcinoma, expression of fIGF-1 was greatest in
patients with objective partial responses, compared with those with stable
disease or progressive disease (P=0.02). 

A PFS advantage was observed with the addition of figitumumab to the
chemotherapy regimen of adenocarcinoma patients with fIGF-1 levels in the
highest quartile. In patients with adenocarcinoma, those receiving the highest
figitumumab dose (20 mg/kg) in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin and
in the highest quartile of fIGF-1, experienced the longest median PFS
(P=0.0039). 

In summary, these results suggest that IGF-1R overexpression and increased free
IGF-1 may be key independent mechanisms of sensitivity to figitumumab in NSCLC.
These findings warrant further investigation.

About Figitumumab (CP-751,871)

Figitumumab, an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody, is a highly
specific inhibitor of the insulin growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway. The
IGF-1R pathway is thought to be one of the fundamental signaling pathways that
leads to uncontrolled growth and survival of tumor cells, and may represent a
resistance mechanism against EGFR inhibitors and other anti-cancer therapies. 

In addition to NSCLC, Pfizer is studying figitumumab in clinical trials for the
potential treatment of other cancers, including prostate, breast and colon
cancers, and Ewing`s sarcoma. To date, more than 1,000 patients have
participated in figitumumab clinical trials in multiple tumor types.

&lt;p&gt;Novel c-Met/ALK Inhibitor is the First Agent in Clinical Development to
Selectively Target Sub-group of NSCLC Patients
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer announced today results from four studies highlighting clinical data with
targeted treatment approaches in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Data on the company`s oral c-Met and ALK inhibitor (PF-02341066), an
investigational agent that selectively targets cancer-causing genes implicated
in the progression of many cancers, will be presented at the 45th American
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Orlando. Additionally,
data on investigational agents PF-00299804 (pan-HER inhibitor), figitumumab
(CP-751,871) and axitinib (AG-13736) will also be presented at the meeting. 

"Pfizer is committed to improving outcomes for patients with NSCLC," said Dr.
Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of clinical development and medical
affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit. 

"We are learning that NSCLC is not a single entity but a family of cancers
driven by distinct molecular processes. We are using that information to develop
treatments that selectively shut down these processes. By knowing which process
may be driving a particular patient`s cancer, we move one step closer to
matching the right drug, in the right setting, for each patient." 

Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. NSCLC accounts for about 85
percent of lung cancer cases and remains difficult to treat, particularly in the
metastatic setting. Nearly 60 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed late with
Stage IIIB/IV advanced disease. For Stage III/IV NSCLC, the five-year survival
rate is only 12 percent. 

c-Met/ALK Inhibitor Shows Early Clinical Activity

New study results from an expansion cohort of a Phase 1 study in patients with
NSCLC carrying the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinases) fusion gene showed early
clinical activity with PF-02341066, a dual inhibitor of mesenchymal epithelial
transition growth factor (c-Met or hepatocyte growth factor), a receptor
commonly altered in human cancers across a variety of solid tumor types, and ALK
translocation genes. PF-02341066 is the first agent in clinical development that
selectively targets a unique genetic feature of cancer cells, echinoderm
microtubule-associate protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK translocation, present in some
NSCLC patients. 

In this expansion cohort study, among 19 NSCLC patients who had an EML4-ALK
mutation treated with PF-02341066, 10 have had a partial response, with three
unconfirmed; the duration of response has ranged from 2+ to 23+ weeks.
Additionally, five patients have had stable disease, with the duration of
response ranging from 8+ to 40 weeks. 

"PF-02341066 represents a new compound that is thought to inhibit two cancer
targets, c-MET and ALK. Inappropriate activation of one or both genes can lead
to cancer and drug resistance. Our Phase 1 trial was expanded to enroll patients
whose tumors had abnormalities in these genes to determine the effect of
PF-02341066 against their tumors," said Dr. Rothenberg. "We are encouraged by
the high proportion of patients whose tumors shrank substantially or stopped
growing. These data support further study of PF-02341066 for the potential
treatment of NSCLC and possibly other difficult-to-treat cancers." 

This expansion cohort was part of a dose-escalation study which enrolled 37
advanced cancer patients with various tumors, including NSCLC, colorectal,
pancreatic, sarcoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma tumors. The maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) was 250 mg twice daily. In this study, the most common
adverse events were nausea, emesis, fatigue and diarrhea. Three dose limiting
toxicities were observed and reversible, including Grade 3 ALT (alanine
aminotransferase) increase in one patient at 200 mg/day and Grade 3 fatigue in
two patients at the 300 mg/twice daily dose level.2

Phase 2 Results of Irreversible Pan-HER Inhibitor

An ongoing Phase 2 study of PF-00299804, an irreversible, oral, selective
pan-HER (human epidermal growth factor receptor) inhibitor, evaluated patients
with NSCLC whose tumors have progressed despite at least one chemotherapy
treatment and also prior treatment with erlotinib(&#8804;8 week). In pre-clinical
studies, PF-00299804 has been shown to block the signaling in both wild type and
mutant EGFR NSCLC, including forms which are resistant to reversible HER
inhibitors.3

The HER pathway, which includes HER-1, HER-2, HER-3 and HER-4 receptors, plays
an important role in human malignancies and mutations. 

Fifty-three patients with progressive NSCLC were treated with PF-00299804 (45
mg/day) and enrolled in two study arms: adenocarcinoma (n=47) and
non-adenocarcinoma (n=6). In the 43 patients evaluated for response, three
patients (7 percent) achieved a partial response and 26 patients (60.5 percent)
achieved stable disease &#8805;6 weeks, as measured by RECIST (Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors). Additionally, seven patients treated with PF-00299804
experienced clinical benefit, as defined by partial response plus stable disease
&#8805;6 months, including 5 adenocarcinoma and 2 non-adenocarcinoma patients. 

In the study, the most common Grade 3 adverse events included skin disorders
(15.1 percent) and diarrhea (13.2 percent). Three patients experienced Grade 4
pulmonary embolus/dyspnea, which was deemed possibly treatment-related. 

Figitumumab Shows Activity in NSCLC Patients with Squamous Histology

A single-arm extension cohort was conducted to confirm the preliminary findings
from a randomized Phase 2 study of 156 patients, which evaluated overall
response with figitumumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in
patients with NSCLC. 

In the extension cohort, 56 patients with non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC (squamous,
large cell, and not otherwise specified) were enrolled and treated with
figitumumab (20 mg/kg), plus carboplatin (AUC of 6) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2).
As measured by RECIST, 27 out of 42 squamous cell patients (64.3 percent)
demonstrated response. One complete response and 26 partial responses were
observed. Among the 26 partial responses, 15 patients had 50-95 percent
reduction in tumor size. Maintenance treatment (n=20) with figitumumab resulted
in tumor size reductions in two patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS)
was 5.7 months for the overall extension cohort, 5.9 months for patients with
squamous cell carcinoma and 3 months for patients with large cell/not otherwise
specified tumors. 

Figitumumab was generally well-tolerated in the extension cohort. The most
common Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were hyperglycemia (11 percent), fatigue (7
percent), and neutropenia (5 percent). Hyperglycemia almost always occurred
within the first treatment cycle and was generally manageable with standard
measures. 

Figitumumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, is a highly specific inhibitor
of the insulin growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway. The IGF-1R
pathway is thought to be one of the fundamental signaling pathways that leads to
uncontrolled growth and survival of tumor cells, and may represent a resistance
mechanism against EGFR inhibitors and other anti-cancer therapies. 

Axitinib in Combination with Chemotherapy

Findings from a Phase 1 study of axitinib in combination with
paclitaxel/carboplatin or gemcitabine/cisplatin in patients with advanced NSCLC
and other solid tumors are being presented at ASCO. 

A total of 49 patients were enrolled in the study, including 28 in the axitinib
plus paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC of 6) arm, and 21 patients in
the axitinib plus gemcitabine (1,250 mg/m2) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2) arm.
Predominant tumor types in the study included NSCLC (34 percent), melanoma,
ovarian, and pancreatic cancer (8 percent each). 

In the study, 17 patients (34.7 percent) achieved an objective response,
including three complete responses (6.1 percent) and 14 partial responses (28.6
percent). An additional 14 patients had stable disease for 8 weeks. Objective
responses were observed in patients with the following tumor types: NSCLC (n=6),
ovarian (n=3), melanoma (n=3), head and neck, breast, cervical and carcinoid
(n=1 each). 

The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of axitinib was 5 mg twice daily, with no
apparent overlapping toxicities when combined with the standard chemotherapy
regimens. The most common treatment-related adverse events for axitinib combined
with either paclitaxel/carboplatin or gemcitabine/cisplatin were hypertension
(34.7 percent), diarrhea (30.6 percent) and fatigue (30.6 percent). 

Axitinib is an oral and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth
factor receptors 1, 2 and 3 (VEGFR 1, 2, 3). Axitinib is an investigational
agent and is being studied as both a single agent and in combination with other
agents across many tumor types.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and several other banks said they have raised more than $19 billion as lenders scramble to extricate themselves from Washington's grip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lenders are trying to show regulators they are capable of functioning without government support. The Federal Reserve will announce next week which of the 19 big lenders that underwent "stress tests" will be allowed to repay government bailout funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Markets are providing an avenue for banks of all sizes and stripes to raise money unless you are at death's door," said Gary Townsend, co-founder of Hill-Townsend Capital in Chevy Chase, Maryland. "The market also seems to be making an assessment that credit problems are manageable and that the environment is improving. In my view, that is correct."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold $5 billion of stock, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) $2.2 billion and American Express Co (AXP.N) $500 million at a discount to Monday's prices after the Fed imposed new capital-raising requirements on large banks hoping to repay the Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), which also hopes to exit TARP, sold $1.9 billion of its stake in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS) (1398.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Bank of America said it has raised close to $33 billion since early May, including $7 billion over six days, closing nearly all of the $33.9 billion capital shortfall that regulators found through its stress test. The largest U.S. bank said it expects to "comfortably exceed" that sum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, KeyCorp (KEY.N) said it has raised $1.3 billion, including $1 billion from selling stock, to help plug a $1.8 billion shortfall, while SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N) late Monday sold $1.4 billion of stock to help fill a $2.2 billion hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 19 banks to undergo stress tests that assessed their readiness for a deep recession, 10 were ordered to raise $74.6 billion. The others had enough capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express shares closed down 4.9 percent to $24.71, Bank of America rose 1.8 percent to $11.41, Goldman fell 0.8 percent to $143.13, JPMorgan fell 4.5 percent to $34.50, KeyCorp rose 1.7 percent to $4.82, Morgan Stanley rose 0.7 percent to $30.09 and SunTrust rose 15.5 percent to $15.94.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW RULES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed said large banks hoping to repay TARP must show an ability to access public equity markets, sell long-term debt without government backing, lend sufficiently, meet their funding obligations and support their subsidiaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express, Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), BBT Corp (BBT.N), Goldman, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street Corp (STT.N) and U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) have signaled their intent to repay the government, people familiar with the matter have said. Some of the requests have not been made public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many banks have complained about the increased government scrutiny and pay restrictions that accompany TARP funds. To free themselves from Washington, banks still need to buy back or get rid of government warrants to buy their shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For any bank that can raise capital and pay off TARP, they should so they can get the government out of their hair," said Joseph Gordon, president of Gordon Asset Management LLC in Durham, North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repaying TARP could leave banks "free and clear, like a real American free citizen, corporate citizen, like we were in the past," JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 600 banks took TARP money, and about 20 have paid it back, Treasury Department data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express took $3.4 billion, Bank of America $45 billion, Bank of New York Mellon $3 billion, BBT $3.1 billion, Goldman $10 billion, JPMorgan $25 billion, KeyCorp $2.5 billion, Morgan Stanley $10 billion, State Street $2 billion, SunTrust $4.9 billion and U.S. Bancorp $6.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder and Jonathan Stempel; editing by John Wallace, Richard Chang.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world's largest payment network, said on Tuesday that U.S. legislation curbing certain practices by credit card companies would force the industry to restructure as revenue expectations shrink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's going to cause the whole industry to rethink itself," Visa's Chief Executive Joseph Saunders said in an interview. "It will result in less credit being offered to less people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill, due to go into effect in February 2010, will restrict the ability of credit card issuers' to raise interest rates on cardholders' existing balances, to charge certain fees, and to impose penalties on consumers that the government deemed unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc (C.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), American Express Co (AXP.N), Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), and Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) have over 80 percent of the U.S. credit card industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies enjoyed hefty gains in recent years due to an explosion in credit, but now they are losing billions as debt-burdened Americans lose their jobs and default on credit card payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans owed more than $945 billion in credit card debt in March. And even though that has declined from $962 billion in December, credit card indebtedness is still up about 25 percent over a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa is partially insulated from the global credit crisis because it processes transactions rather than lending funds. However, its revenue growth has slowed along with transaction volume as consumers try to reduce their indebtedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saunders said any slowdown in credit card use would be offset by a secular change from cash and checks to electronic payments, and by increased use of debit cards. He said debit cards represented "a significant part of the company's future".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending on debit cards surpassed credit volume in the United States in the first three months of 2009 for the first time in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saunders said Visa does not expect to change its earnings or revenue forecast due to the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't look like we are going to fall off a cliff. It isn't a tsunami. It is going to be an issue that we are going to have to deal with," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think it is going to particularly change our guidance or our notion of where we are going. Of course, if things never changed we would have had more transactions, but I don't think that this does anything to slowdown the momentum of the change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa expects annual net revenue growth of high single digits in 2009 and of between 11 to 15 percent in 2010. It also forecast annual adjusted diluted Class A common stock earnings per share will grow over 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLOW ECONOMIC RECOVERY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saunders said he saw some signs of economic improvement in the United States, particularly stronger consumer confidence. but he said he did not expect a speedy recovery. He said the economy would be more solid in the first half of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are not doing things that they have normally done because they are concerned about employment, they are concerned about if they are prepared in the event that something happens," Saunders said, but added that "at some point in time, people will want to enjoy things they enjoyed in the past."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings in April as the processing network company increased prices, slashed expenses and consumers used debit cards more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Saunders reiterated Visa's net income will come under pressure in the current quarter, as the company faces shrinking cross-border transactions, and a stronger dollar hurts revenue overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings should start to improve by the second half of 2009, as foreign exchange headwinds ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company could also benefit as JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) is expected to shift part of its huge Washington Mutual debit card portfolio to Visa's network from MasterCard Inc (MA.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that as a result of this our debit card business will grow," Saunders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio; Editing by Toni Reinhold, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) argued before an appeals court on Tuesday that its Outlook calendar date-picker tool did not infringe an Alcatel-Lucent (ALUA.PA) patent and asked for a $358 million jury verdict to be overturned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is the last remaining after Alcatel-Lucent and Microsoft settled other patent fights in December. The case was appealed from a district court in San Diego, where a jury ruled that Microsoft did infringe and ordered it to pay $358 million, or $511 million including interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit had also been viewed as an opportunity for the Federal Circuit to address the damages issue in patent reform pending in Congress although it was not immediately clear if the court would do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's attorney, Constantine Trela of Sidley Austin LLP, argued that the patent for the technology, which allows Outlook users to click on a date to open it rather than typing it in, was invalid because it was an obvious extension of earlier technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trela further argued that if the patent was found to be valid, it was not Microsoft which infringed but Outlook users. And Alcatel-Lucent failed to show that anyone used a mouse to choose a date in Outlook, said Trela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to show that somebody did it," said Trela. "There's no proof here that it happened. That's the fundamental problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguing for Alcatel-Lucent, John Desmarais of Kirkland Ellis LLP disputed Trela's assertion that the patent should not have been granted because it was a small, obvious improvement on existing technology. "What you're talking about here, in 1985, 1986, nobody was doing it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has also asked the patent office to reassess the patent. The patent office declared it invalid although Alcatel is in discussions with the patent office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft is found guilty of infringing, Trela argued that the jury damages were excessive because the award was based on Outlook's entire market value. "The thing that drives demand for Outlook is email. That's what people use it for," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Tuesday its new Windows 7 operating system will be generally available on October 22, well ahead of its original schedule and in time for the holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new operating system, which will replace the unpopular Vista, was originally planned for roll-out at the beginning of next year, but Microsoft confirmed last month that it would hit the market in time for the year's busiest buying period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of the new system is a big event for the computing world, as more than 90 percent of the world's PC's run on Windows, and strategically important for Microsoft, which gets more than half of its profit from its operating system unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest release is crucial to win back public confidence after the disappointing launch of Vista in 2007. Vista was incompatible with some low-power machines and perceived by many to be too complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company also faces new threats to its dominance in operating systems, especially in the fast-growing "netbook" market for small, portable PCs ideal for surfing the Internet and sending e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Tuesday, netbook pioneer Acer Inc (2353.TW) said it plans to sell small PCs that run on Google Inc's (GOOG.O) new Android operating system, making it the first manufacturer to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will send Windows 7 code to PC makers to load onto new machines -- known in the industry as "release to manufacturing" -- around the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By October 22, people will be able to buy new computers with Windows 7 installed, or pick up the software off the shelf to install on their old computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft confirmed that it will run a program whereby people who buy PCs with certain versions of Vista before October 22 can get a free upgrade to Windows 7, but it has not yet released details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were up 7 cents at $21.47 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) argued before an appeals court on Tuesday that its Outlook calendar date-picker tool did not infringe an Alcatel-Lucent (ALUA.PA) patent and asked for a $358 million jury verdict to be overturned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is the last remaining after Alcatel-Lucent and Microsoft settled other patent fights in December. The case was appealed from a district court in San Diego, where a jury ruled that Microsoft did infringe and ordered it to pay $358 million, or $511 million including interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit had also been viewed as an opportunity for the Federal Circuit to address the damages issue in patent reform pending in Congress although it was not immediately clear if the court would do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's attorney, Constantine Trela of Sidley Austin LLP, argued that the patent for the technology, which allows Outlook users to click on a date to open it rather than typing it in, was invalid because it was an obvious extension of earlier technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trela further argued that if the patent was found to be valid, it was not Microsoft which infringed but Outlook users. And Alcatel-Lucent failed to show that anyone used a mouse to choose a date in Outlook, said Trela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to show that somebody did it," said Trela. "There's no proof here that it happened. That's the fundamental problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguing for Alcatel-Lucent, John Desmarais of Kirkland Ellis LLP disputed Trela's assertion that the patent should not have been granted because it was a small, obvious improvement on existing technology. "What you're talking about here, in 1985, 1986, nobody was doing it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has also asked the patent office to reassess the patent. The patent office declared it invalid although Alcatel is in discussions with the patent office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft is found guilty of infringing, Trela argued that the jury damages were excessive because the award was based on Outlook's entire market value. "The thing that drives demand for Outlook is email. That's what people use it for," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, UK and WALTHAM, MA, Jun 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
PrecisionPoint Software, an international Microsoft Gold Partner
specializing in Business Intelligence (BI) for Microsoft Dynamics
business applications, announced today that its  Business Warehouse for
Dynamics NAV (BW4NAV) product, has passed the Software Solution Test and
completed the other requirements to achieve the Certified for Microsoft
Dynamics(R) status.

    Certified for Microsoft Dynamics (CfMD) is Microsoft Corp.'s highest
standard for partner-developed software. This certification represents a
significant step in elevating the standard for partner-developed software
solutions for business applications. Solutions with a successful software
test have demonstrated development quality and compatibility with the
Microsoft Dynamics product. VeriTest, a service of Lionbridge, performed
independent and rigorous testing on PrecisionPoint's integration with
Microsoft Dynamics. This certification reinforces PrecisionPoint
Software's commitment to the Microsoft partner certification process
adding to its existing Gold Partner status with the ISV Competency.

    "By requiring the software solution to meet our highest standards,
Microsoft is assuring customers that these certified solutions work with
their investments in Microsoft Dynamics," said Doug Kennedy, vice
president, Microsoft Dynamics Partners. "Microsoft congratulates
PrecisionPoint Software on earning the Certified for Microsoft Dynamics
designation." Certified for Microsoft Dynamics solutions will get top
choice and priority ranking from Microsoft for doing such things as
helping to move across borders into other geographies.

    PrecisionPoint Business Warehouse for Dynamics NAV is a patent-pending,
out-of-the-box data warehouse solution based on Microsoft Business
Intelligence; it reduces BI implementation times by over 80% by automating
the building and management of the data warehouse platform. The advanced
data model, unique to PrecisionPoint BW, enforces superior data integrity
by integrating all key Dynamics transaction ledgers (tables) and then
reconciles data from across the ERP system. This enhances user
productivity for self-service reporting and analytics and can also save
users days of manual reconciliation effort each month. The data warehouse
model also covers all aspects of business performance reporting,
monitoring and analytics from finance, sales and profitability, to supply
chain, project management and operations.

    PrecisionPoint recently supported a Microsoft Dynamics Client for Office
(DCO) partner training exercise for Microsoft Dynamics NAV partners in the
UK. Microsoft Dynamics Client for Office allows customers to license the
full functionality of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server Enterprise,
including BI tools such as Microsoft Excel Services and Microsoft
PerformancePoint Services, as a low cost add-on to their existing
Business-Ready License for Dynamics. "We strongly advocate adoption of the
Microsoft Dynamics Client for Office (DCO) as a new and highly accessible
means of delivering self-service BI," said Gary Turner, Product Director,
Dynamics for Microsoft UK. "With the work they have done with the new
Microsoft Dynamics Client for Office (DCO), PrecisionPoint have built a
compelling new solution for presenting key performance data drawn straight
from the data warehouse layer, but presented in a highly accessible
Microsoft SharePoint context thanks to PrecisionPoint's use of the DCO as
the front-end user interface. PrecisionPoint Business Warehouse is the
only Business Intelligence ISV solution to be Certified for Microsoft
Dynamics in the UK and US."

    PrecisionPoint Software founder, Dr Nigel Geary, added, "PrecisionPoint
Software continues to innovate to accelerate the delivery of self-service
BI to the mid-market based exclusively on the Microsoft BI technology
stack. Achieving this Certification for Microsoft Dynamics demonstrates
our commitment to Microsoft and the Dynamics partner channel. We are
working closely with the Dynamics team to provide training and
demonstration materials, such as a Dynamics BI Virtual PC, to help
Dynamics partners sell and deliver BI solutions based on Dynamics Client
for Office (DCO) in a fraction of the time it would take to build a data
warehouse from scratch or using solutions from Microsoft's competitors."

&lt;p&gt;From Toy Story to Disney Princess to Disney Channel Franchises, World`s Largest
Licensor Announces Stellar Content and Product Lines at Licensing International
Expo 2009


LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Disney Consumer Products (DCP) today announced new content and product line
extensions behind its renowned portfolio of character franchises starting with
the return of the classic Toy Story franchise, the addition of two Disney
Princess characters, new Mickey Mouse initiatives, a new Winnie the Pooh
theatrical movie and the expansion of the Disney Fairies film series. Disney
Channel also announced major milestones for the global sensational hit Hannah
Montana as the series is renewed for a fourth season and the award-winning Handy
Manny preschool series adds two primetime specials and a new 20 episode
short-form series. 

Editor`s Note: High resolution images and video footage will be available at
www.disneyconsumerproducts.com/press/us/licensingexpo

"Everything we do is inspired by the magic and creativity that only Disney can
deliver," said Andy Mooney, chairman of Disney Consumer Products. "Each product
tells a story and this year sets off an unprecedented slate of entertainment
offering many storylines that will translate into global merchandise programs
uniquely positioning DCP for breakout growth." 

Handy Manny adds Short-form Series, Two Primetime Specials

Disney Channel's hit multicultural animated preschool series Handy Manny has
quickly become a breakout Disney character franchise. A Top 10 player among
series geared towards kids age 2-5, Handy Manny will add two primetime specials
to debut in 2009 and 2010 and an all-new 20 episode short form series, "Handy
Manny's School for Tools," scheduled for a 2010 premiere. DCP opened Licensing
Expo with an appearance by Wilmer Valderrama, star of Handy Manny, along with
the Handy Manny character and Rich Ross, president, Disney Channel Worldwide,
who joined Andy Mooney as they announced the expansion of the Handy Manny
franchise. 

"Handy Manny is a strong, compassionate and distinctive character that
preschoolers love and identify with, and while we`re most proud that each
episode helps kids learn how to get along with others, we're thrilled that Handy
Manny consistently delivers top ratings and has made its mark at retail," said
Rich Ross. 

Mooney added,"Based on the retail success of the first Handy Manny product line,
released last fall with an award-winning toy assortment, DCP is also expanding
the line beyond toys into apparel and accessories, books, a magazine, home
furnishings, stationery and food products." 

Hannah Montana Renewed for 4th Season

The tween business segment remains a focal point for DCP as Disney Channel
continues to deliver captivating content for a new generation of tweens and
inspired product lines evolve with new trends. Gary Marsh, president,
entertainment, Disney Channel Worldwide, announced today that the Hannah Montana
series has been renewed for a fourth season with a storyline twist in the works.


"Kids and tweens around the world have responded to Hannah Montana, its
relatable characters, music and consumer products. We're thrilled to announce we
will be moving forward with a fourth season of the series that catapulted Miley
Cyrus to superstardom, and will resume production early next year in Hollywood
-- but with a brand new twist as the Stewarts grapple with moving out of their
Malibu beach house." 

Toy Story Back With Three Theatrical Releases &amp; All New Product Lines

Backed by new content and companywide initiatives, Toy Story is primed for
long-term growth opportunities setting the perfect stage for optimal
merchandising and retail programs worldwide. The classic film franchise returns
with the re-release of the first two movies in 3D for a two week engagement this
October, a third new movie next summer and a spectacular array of new
merchandise releasing this fall - from light up apparel and home d&#233;cor to
innovative toy lines such as the motor-powered Ultimate Buzz Lightyear robot
which responds to 25 voice commands as well as an assortment of collectible
figures and food, personal care, stationery and party items. 

"The `Toy Story` films and characters will always hold a very special place in
our hearts. We`re excited to bring the first two films back for audiences to
enjoy in a whole new way with the latest Disney Digital 3D technology," said
John Lasseter, Chief Creative Officer, Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios,
Academy Award-winning filmmaker and director of Toy Story and Toy Story 2. "As
new technologies present great new possibilities in the art of animation, they
also create opportunities for true innovation in product development making it
possible to create very cool merchandise that stays true to the characters and
brings them to life right in the homes of families and playgrounds all over. I`m
obviously a huge fan of toys and the new Toy Story toy line will push
imagination boundaries - it`s truly fascinating to see characters you created
come to life that way." 

To showcase the excitement "building" around the Toy Story franchise and the
enthusiasm around LEGO`s first ever Toy Story line releasing next spring, a
5-foot tall LEGO model of Buzz Lightyear, constructed from 40,000 LEGO bricks in
250 hours by 3 Master Builders, was unveiled by LEGO and DCP at the Licensing
International Expo. 

New Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh Initiatives

Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh remain among the company`s key character
franchises; for a broad cross-section of consumers, these two classic characters
boast a deep emotional connection and an unrivaled affinity like no other. In
support of this, DCP has developed comprehensive plans to propel the growth of
these classic character properties and keep them "top of mind" across
demographics. 

Beginning with Winnie the Pooh, DCP and Walt Disney Animation Studios today
announced a new theatrical film planned for spring 2011, making it Pooh`s first
theatrical release in six years since Pooh`s Heffalump Movie in 2005. DCP will
focus merchandise strategy on moms of infants and toddlers, with a secondary
focus on women. Other Disney businesses, including Disney Publishing, are
developing Pooh content for a new generation of consumers that will further
drive the growth potential of this classic character. 

No other character - classic or contemporary - occupies a similar space in the
hearts and minds of people from around the world as does Mickey Mouse. Mickey
remains a global icon and the company`s top character franchise. To that end,
DCP has developed a comprehensive global brand plan for Mickey and his friends
Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Goofy and Pluto to connect them to
consumers in every age segment, from infants and preschoolers to older kids and
fashion-conscious young adults. 

DCP`s plan will address each consumer target in a specific manner:

* For preschoolers, Disney Channel`s top-rated Mickey Mouse Clubhouse series has
contributed to a 60% increase in Mickey and friends merchandise sales at key
retail accounts. As Disney Channel plans new episodes and prime-time specials
coupled with new title releases on Disney DVD, the core of Mickey`s preschool
business should continue to grow. 
* For kids and adults, Disney Have-A-Laugh is a new companywide initiative that
will showcase the rich library of original Mickey cartoon shorts across a
variety of formats and platforms, including television, online and DVD starting
this fall. The Mickey of "Have a Laugh" is young, funny, a bit mischievous, and
contemporary. DCP will reflect the humor and fun from these Mickey moments into
products for kids that will incorporate editorial, fun designs and fresh images.

* For young adults, DCP will focus on fashion. Mickey was first depicted as a
fashion icon in 2003 with the launch of the Mickey vintage t-shirt line that
went on to grace the pages of global fashion magazines influencing taste makers
and celebrities alike. A merchandise line quickly evolved across product
categories and retail tiers. Similarly in 2010, DCP will launch "Mickey By," a
program centering on possibly the most recognized Mickey image - an iconic pose
taken from one of the original character model sheets. DCP is commissioning
well-known artists to interpret the pose for art that will serve as the
foundation for fashionable applications across many product categories. "Mickey
By" will be global in scope and ambition, but with locally relevant execution.
Consumers will also have a chance to personalize product using "Mickey By"
images through our on-line shopping portal, DisneyStore.com.

Disney Princess Adds Princess Tiana &amp; Rapunzel to Royal Court

A perennial favorite for girls ages 2-6, the Disney Princess franchise remains
the top girls brand worldwide. Coming up Disney`s royal court prepares for
incremental growth as it celebrates the homecoming of two new characters and the
release of two classics from its vault: beginning this holiday with its newest
princess in more than 10 years, Princess Tiana from Walt Disney Animation
Studios The Princess and the Frog releasing this November with an incredible
assortment of merchandise. Also this fall, families will fall in love all over
again with "the one that started it all," Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as the
film is released from the Disney Vault in high-definition Blu-ray for the first
time ever. 

Then in 2010, the fairytale continues as Disney releases Rapunzel theatrically
adding its second new Princess character to the Disney Princess franchise and
complementing this new Princess story with a classic one as Beauty And The Beast
is planned for re-release from the Disney Vault. 

This bookend strategy to introduce new Disney Princess fairytales in conjunction
with re-releasing classic ones for a new generation is expected to enable
licensees and retailers alike to grow their Disney Princess programs globally. 

Disney Fairies Expands with 5th Film Title

The Disney Fairies franchise continues to reach new heights- among key
milestones are: Tinker Bell, the first installment in the Disney Video Premiere
series, sold millions of copies leading it to become the #1 Direct-To-DVD
release of 2008; millions of Disney Fairies products are now sold across the
globe at major retailers; DisneyFairies.com is now available in 20 countries
boasting the creation of more than 16 million unique fairy avatars; Disney
Fairies magazines are now available in 28 countries and 18 million books have
sold globally; and the interactive meet and greet attractions at Walt Disney
World Resort and Disneyland Resort featuring walk-around characters of Tinker
Bell, Fawn, Iridessa, Rosetta, and Silvermist, have become popular destinations
for park visitors to meet their favorite fairies. 

Backed by this renowned success and reinforcing the expected growth surrounding
the Disney Fairies franchise, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment recently
announced it will continue the wondrous adventures in a fifth installment beyond
the previously announced four films, with Tinker Bell: Race Through the Seasons
(working title), which is currently in development.

&lt;p&gt;Interns and Agencies Kick-off Summer-Long Program and Honor 2009 Community
Champions During Reception
DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
Today at the Dallas Arboretum, 75 interns and agencies officially kicked-off the
19th annual ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs Program (CSJP). The eight-week paid
internship program, now in its 38th year nationally, offers nonprofits
much-needed help during the busy summer months and encourages college students
to pursue careers in the nonprofit sector and to be active members of their
communities. ExxonMobil provides more than $267,000 to cover intern salaries and
program administration expenses. 

"The ExxonMobil CSJP is much more than a paycheck or a summer job, it is an
opportunity for our community to interact with the leaders of tomorrow and
encourage them in their careers and futures. It is also an opportunity for the
interns to become active participants in their own communities," said Robert
Lanyon, manager, corporate citizenship and community investments, ExxonMobil. 

"Our hope is that at the completion of the summer, these 75 interns will return
to their universities, prepared to take on the challenges of today`s world with
a unique understanding of the nonprofit sector." 

Along with welcoming the 2009 interns and agencies, the reception honored the
2009 Community Champions, alumni of the program who have gone on to pursue
careers in the nonprofit sector. 

The 2009 Community Champions are Brandolon Barnett and Skyler Harper. Barnett
interned with Globe Aware as part of the 2006 CSJP. During his internship, he
had the unique opportunity to travel to Costa Rica to create a volunteer
training video for the agency. As a result of his internship, Globe Aware hired
Barnett full-time as the director of program development and media after his
graduation from the University of Pittsburgh. 

Harper participated in the 2003 CSJP and worked with Make-A-Wish Foundation as a
special events intern. Today, Harper is an event manager with Big Brothers Big
Sisters and he credits much of his success in the nonprofit world to his time as
a CSJP intern. 

"Our partnership with ExxonMobil is one that strives to engage interns and
agencies with one another to promote the importance of involvement and
volunteerism in our community," said Phyllis Bernstein, chair, Volunteer Center
of North Texas` Dallas County Council on Volunteerism. "This reception is an
opportunity for the 2009 interns and agencies to set the tone for a
community-focused summer and celebrate past interns such as Brandolon and
Skyler. These Community Champions truly represent the spirit of CSJP and deserve
recognition for the hard work they have continued beyond their involvement with
the program." 

The Dallas program is administered by the Volunteer Center of North Texas, which
manages the internships and trains agencies to better recruit, interview and
select candidates. Each nonprofit is responsible for interviewing and hiring its
own interns. This process helps ensure that the unique needs of each agency are
best met. 

Since the program began in 1971 in New York City, ExxonMobil has provided more
than $9.3 million to support 4,300 community summer job internships. Today it is
active in 10 states, including Alabama, Alaska, California, Kansas, Louisiana,
Montana, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Monday offered a glimpse into a future where the Xbox 360 console is the centerpiece of any living room, and games, social interaction and communications are controlled with the wave of a hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a star-studded event at the annual E3 video game conference that drew appearances by Paul McCartney and Steven Spielberg, the company unveiled "Project Natal," which uses a camera to track a user's movements via full skeletal mapping. It also recognizes voices and vocal commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology obviates the need for a controller or remote device to enable a player for instance to drive a car in a game, interact with a character on screen or show pictures and information to other Xbox 360 users over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are the controller," Shane Kim, Microsoft's vice president of strategy and business development for videogames, said in an interview in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a very powerful piece of technology -- full body gesture tracking, not just two hands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Microsoft also said it planned to boost its Xbox 360 gaming console by integrating music-streaming service last.fm, Web social network Facebook and microblogging site Twitter into its Xbox Live online community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcements underscore how the interactive gaming industry, a growing business with estimated annual sales of about $50 billion despite the economic downturn, is looking into ways to attract new gamers while retaining their core audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps with an eye on the economy, Don Mattrick, senior vice president of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business, said the "Natal" technology can refresh the gaming experience without making consumers buy a new device, which typically costs $250 to $500. Microsoft would also avoid hefty manufacturing and marketing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can leap into a new era of interactive entertainment without launching a new console," Mattrick told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim declined to detail when "Project Natal" games and service will be available, saying only that "it's not a 2009 thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN LIVING COLOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft's Game Studios, said the technology has been well received by software developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's pretty obvious that the controller is not going away, but the ability to augment the gaming experience that people are used to is one of the paths that people will take," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Microsoft is focusing on beefing up its fledgling Xbox Live service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users of Xbox Live will be able to keep tabs on and communicate with friends using popular Internet services such as Facebook and Twitter, without needing to use a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move broadens Microsoft's goal of transforming the console system -- a distant No. 2 to Nintendo Inc's Wii machine -- into the center of the living room and more than just a game-playing box. That goal is echoed by Sony Corp, whose PlayStation 3 console also hosts community and entertainment features as well as game playing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This expands the reach of Xbox live," Kim said. "We have had an effort of making Xbox live a next-generation social and entertainment network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event was kicked off by a demonstration of the upcoming version of Viacom Inc's MTV Networks' Rock Band franchise featuring songs by The Beatles. Taking the stage briefly were surviving Band members Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, and Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison, widows of John Lennon and George Harrison, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more details of Microsoft's event, click twitter.com/MediaFile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Kemp Powers; Editing by Edwin Chan and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The latest variant of EDGE will further cement the GSM-family set of
technologies as viable options for upgrading mobile networks throughout the
world, according to a new Visant Strategies report. The impact of EDGE Evolution
on both emerging and established mobile markets will be apparent during the next
five years, the study finds, as the technology offers robustness at an
attractive price point. 

"EDGE has always been a good alternative for many mobile networks and now EDGE
Evolution makes it an even stronger hand," said Andy Fuertes of Visant
Strategies. "While many are going forward with WCDMA LTE, many others are now
looking at EDGE Evolution and its improvements on EDGE and how, for such a lower
cost, it can deliver many things needed in the mobile network today; high
speeds, good data carriage and an attractive price per subscriber." 

"EDGE Evolution makes sense in mobile markets throughout the world, especially
in those that have a lot of subscribers who are looking for excellent voice and
appreciable data speeds at a reasonable price, and as the mobile penetration
rate continues to climb, it is these kinds of subscribers that are going to be
available," said Larry Swasey of Visant Strategies. 

EDGE Evolution, for example, will account for almost 15% of all subscribers in
2015, according to "EDGE EVOLUTION 2009: Competitive Air Interface for the Next
Decade," while EDGE subscribers, those not yet utilizing EDGE Evolution, will
account for almost 20% of all mobile subscribers in 2015. The report also finds
the Asia-Pacific, Middle East/Africa and Latin America regions will lead in EDGE
Evolution base station deployments through 2015. 

The report identifies and analyzes key drivers as well as the challenges that
EDGE Evolution will face. Global and regional figures include EDGE Evolution,
EDGE and GSM subscribers as well as all mobile subscribers and handset
shipments. Yearly EDGE Evolution base station shipments and deployments as well
as EDGE Evolution device shipments and revenues by region are also given.

ICBC stake until April 2010. Under an earlier lockup agreement,
Goldman would have been permitted to sell half of its stake in
the state-controlled bank this past April and the rest in
October.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Sachs Electronic Trading (GSET) announced today the upcoming release of
its latest functionality for its SIGMASMsmart router for clients who trade
Canadian and US stocks. SIGMA inter-listed routing seeks best prices across US
and Canadian stock trading venues while taking into account real time foreign
exchange rates, allowing for single currency settlement. 

"In the past two years the market structure in Canada has changed at a very
rapid pace," said Todd Lopez, head of international sales for GSET North
America. "With nearly 200 stocks currently inter-listed on the Toronto Stock
Exchange (TSX) and US exchanges, traders need to access liquidity seamlessly in
both markets while automatically hedging their currency exposure in real time." 

SIGMA works by simultaneously scanning multiple trading venues and routing the
order to the venue where there is the best opportunity for optimal execution.
GSET clients are able to access the SIGMA router for inter-listed trading via
REDIPlus&#174;, GSET`s proprietary execution management system, or through
third-party trading systems. With this new functionality, GSET is offering
cross-border smart order routing capabilities for all dually-listed Canadian and
US stocks. Clients also benefit from SIGMA by trading via GSET algorithms, which
utilize the SIGMA router to make order placement decisions. 

The SIGMA router also gives clients access to the diverse, high-quality
liquidity found within our SIGMA X non-displayed liquidity pool for US stocks.
SIGMA X traded more than 312 million US stocks per day in April, 2009. The SIGMA
smart router has been in existence since 2002, when it was designed to address
the growing fragmentation across US equity markets. Since its launch, SIGMA has
been enhanced to provide optimal routing for trades. It is available for equity
trading in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, as well as for US listed options. 

About REDIPlus and Goldman Sachs

The REDIPlus trading platform allows clients to trade equities, options,
futures, foreign exchange and synthetics from a single application. Clients can
use REDIPlus to access Goldman Sachs algorithmic strategies in the U.S., Canada,
Europe and Asia. Additionally, clients can user REDIPlus to route orders through
our SIGMA smart router and post orders directly to the SIGMA X crossing network.
Clients trading baskets of securities benefit from integrated portfolio and
spread trading functionality and an embedded suite of pre-, during, and
post-trade analytics.

clients with the necessary tools to manage their trades across asset classes and
global markets. Clients access these products via FIX or via REDIPlus.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Citigroup Moves Up Morgan JV

It would seem that Citigroup (NYSE: C) is far from just taking it on the chin
[after being dropped from the Dow components this morning]. To that end, both
Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Citigroup today announced that they have closed
their previously announced wealth management joint venture ahead of schedule.
The joint venture was targeted for completion during 3Q09. The joint venture
will operate under the banner Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. 

The entity combines Morgan Stanley's Global Wealth Management Group with Citi's
Smith Barney in the U.S., Quilter in the UK, and Smith Barney Australia retail
units. This newly combined global new wealth management firm currently has
18,500 financial advisers in 1,000 brokerage locations. 

With Citigroup`s removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, that just leaves
two traditional banks remaining within the index -- Bank of America (NYSE: BAC)
and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). The inclusion of Travelers (NYSE: TRV) could be
viewed as an attempt to restore some of the financial industry`s representation
in the Dow.

&lt;p&gt;Larry Kuhl, Henry Marcy to discuss innovation in the utility-customer
relationship
BURLINGTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Microsoft and Whirlpool Corporation executives will participate in discussions
at the KEMA second annual Utility of the Future executive conference June 17-19,
2009 in Washington DC. 

Microsoft and Whirlpool Corporation are each developing advanced consumer-based
technologies and applications that will change the way customers interact with
their electric utilities. Microsoft has been working with its partner ecosystem
to develop and deploy online software applications that will provide near
real-time energy consumption information and enhance customer contact
experiences. Whirlpool Corporation is innovating smart appliances that will
connect with SmartGrid technology to better manage home energy use by making
energy consumption visible to customers. Combined with emerging Home Area
Networking (HAN) technologies, these information technology (IT) innovations
will empower utility customers of the future to make more informed, efficient
energy-use decisions. 

Microsoft`s Larry Kuhl, manager of Worldwide Utilities business development and
alliances, and Whirlpool`s Henry Marcy, vice president of technology, will join
other innovators as part of the Utility of the Future conference "Customer
Focus" panel. They will discuss what the smart grid and the utility of the
future mean in terms of product and service innovations for utilities and their
customers. 

"At Microsoft, our goal is to make every customer touch point matter," says
Kuhl. "We do this by helping utilities create valuable customer relationships by
improving their experiences across multiple interaction channels - phone,
e-mail, chat and web - combining disparate information from different
applications into one view to optimize each customer interaction." 

"We recently announced that all electronically controlled appliances made by
Whirlpool Corporation anywhere in the world will be SmartGrid compatible by
2015," says Dr. Henry Marcy, vice president of technology for Whirlpool
Corporation. "This is a critical step forward in creating a demand response
environment in which energy reduction is systematically controlled across
10,000's of homes at a time, providing automatic energy reduction without any
inconvenience to consumers. In addition, overall energy generation would be made
more effective as utilities could run at optimum output and avoid purchasing
spinning reserves which lowers costs and significantly reduces carbon
emissions." 

The KEMA Utility of the Future executive conference, "Navigating
sustainability," will gather senior executives from across the energy and
utility industry to discuss the changing rules and relationships underlying the
transformation of the energy future. Discussions will cover regulatory and
policy directions, operating a smart grid infrastructure, developments in
generation, energy storage, plug-in vehicles, and implications for utility
products and customers.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc announced today that Toviaz&#8482; (fesoterodine fumarate) extended release
tablets and the YourWay&#8482; plan (www.ToviazYourWay.com),a comprehensive,
customizable support plan for overactive bladder patients, are available in the
United States. Toviaz is a once-daily prescription treatment for patients with
symptoms of overactive bladder, which include frequent and sudden urges to
urinate and wetting accidents. Toviaz works by helping to calm the bladder
muscle that causes frequent, sudden urges to urinate. 

Overactive bladder affects an estimated 33 million Americans, yet remains
under-treated. One possible reason for this is that patients may be embarrassed
to discuss their overactive bladder symptoms with a physician and often develop
coping strategies, such as planning "escape routes" to restrooms in public
places, which allow them to delay seeking treatment. 

"Given Pfizer`s long heritage in the overactive bladder market with Detrol and
Detrol LA, we understand that experiences and challenges with overactive bladder
differ from patient to patient," said Olivier Brandicourt, president and general
manager of Pfizer`s Primary Care Business Unit. "To help address these
challenges for both physicians and patients, Pfizer is proud to introduce
Toviaz, which offers the flexibility of two efficacious doses to treat patients
based on individual need, plus the innovative YourWay program." 

The YourWay plan is a free, simple 12-week program designed to help physicians
educatepatients about their condition and treatment expectations, and to
encourage and empower patients to become more engaged in their treatment.
Developed in collaboration with experts in adherence, behavioral change, and
patient education and communication, the YourWay plan includes four components:

* Learning how to make more informed diet choices 
* Learning bladder training techniques, which may help patients wait longer
between bathroom visits 
* Tracking daily progress on the plan 
* Learning how Toviaz works and what to expect from treatment with Toviaz and
participation in the YourWay program

The basic YourWay plan is offered to patients who receive a Toviaz sample pack
or prescription from their doctor. Patients also may enroll in the plan by
calling 1-877-796-8792 or visiting www.ToviazYourWay.com. 

Participants can choose to receive an added level of customized support from the
YourWay plan:

"Behavior change is an important part of overactive bladder treatment, yet many
overactive bladder patients don`t receive behavioral intervention," said Dr.
Pamela Ellsworth, associate professor of urology, Warren Alpert Medical School
at Brown University and consultant for the YourWay plan. "The YourWayplanis
great news for patients because it emphasizes that change doesn`t happen
overnight, and can motivate patients with ongoing encouragement, realistic goals
and tangible changes they can make each day." 

Toviaz Provides Dosing Flexibility for Physicians, Patients

Toviaz is available in two efficacious doses, 4 mg and 8 mg, allowing dosing
flexibility to optimize treatment based on the individual patient response and
tolerability. Toviaz was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in
October 2008. 

The approval of Toviaz was based on two large 12-week Phase 3 clinical studies
that showed once-daily Toviaz can significantly reduce bothersome symptoms for
24 hours - all day and all night. The recommended starting dose of Toviaz is 4
mg once daily. Based upon individual response and tolerability, the dose may be
increased to 8 mg once daily. Doses greater than 4 mg are not recommended in
patients with severe renal insufficiency or in patients taking a potent CYP3A4
inhibitor; in patients taking a weak or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, careful
assessment at 4 mg is advised prior to increasing to 8 mg. 

Toviaz treats the symptoms of overactive bladder (leaks, strong, sudden urges to
go, going too often). 

Important Safety Information for Toviaz

If patients have certain stomach problems, glaucoma, or cannot empty their
bladder, they should not take Toviaz. 

Medicines like Toviaz can cause blurred vision, drowsiness, and decreased
sweating. Patients should use caution when driving, doing unsafe tasks, or in
especially hot environments, until they know how Toviaz affects them. Drinking
alcohol while taking medicines such as Toviaz may cause increased drowsiness. 

The most common side effects are dry mouth and constipation. 

Toviaz has benefits and risks. There may be other options. 

Important Safety Information for Detrol LA

Patients should not take DETROL LA if they have certain types of stomach
problems, glaucoma, or cannot empty their bladder. The most common side effect
is dry mouth. Other side effects may include headache, constipation, and
abdominal pain. 

Detrol LA (tolterodine tartrate extended release capsules) treats the symptoms
of overactive bladder (leaks, strong sudden urges to go, going too often). 

DETROL LA has benefits and risks. There may be other options. 

About Overactive Bladder

Overactive bladder is a treatable medical condition associated with involuntary
contractions of the bladder muscle, and is defined by urinary urgency (a sudden
compelling desire to pass urine that is difficult to defer) with or without
urgency incontinence (the involuntary leakage of any amount of urine, associated
with or immediately preceded by urgency), usually with increased daytime urinary
frequency and nocturia.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc announced today that Toviaz&#8482; (fesoterodine fumarate) extended release
tablets and the YourWay&#8482; plan (www.ToviazYourWay.com),a comprehensive,
customizable support plan for overactive bladder patients, are available in the
United States. Toviaz is a once-daily prescription treatment for patients with
symptoms of overactive bladder, which include frequent and sudden urges to
urinate and wetting accidents. Toviaz works by helping to calm the bladder
muscle that causes frequent, sudden urges to urinate. 

Overactive bladder affects an estimated 33 million Americans, yet remains
under-treated. One possible reason for this is that patients may be embarrassed
to discuss their overactive bladder symptoms with a physician and often develop
coping strategies, such as planning "escape routes" to restrooms in public
places, which allow them to delay seeking treatment. 

"Given Pfizer`s long heritage in the overactive bladder market with Detrol and
Detrol LA, we understand that experiences and challenges with overactive bladder
differ from patient to patient," said Olivier Brandicourt, president and general
manager of Pfizer`s Primary Care Business Unit. "To help address these
challenges for both physicians and patients, Pfizer is proud to introduce
Toviaz, which offers the flexibility of two efficacious doses to treat patients
based on individual need, plus the innovative YourWay program." 

The YourWay plan is a free, simple 12-week program designed to help physicians
educatepatients about their condition and treatment expectations, and to
encourage and empower patients to become more engaged in their treatment.
Developed in collaboration with experts in adherence, behavioral change, and
patient education and communication, the YourWay plan includes four components:

* Learning how to make more informed diet choices 
* Learning bladder training techniques, which may help patients wait longer
between bathroom visits 
* Tracking daily progress on the plan 
* Learning how Toviaz works and what to expect from treatment with Toviaz and
participation in the YourWay program

The basic YourWay plan is offered to patients who receive a Toviaz sample pack
or prescription from their doctor. Patients also may enroll in the plan by
calling 1-877-796-8792 or visiting www.ToviazYourWay.com. 

Participants can choose to receive an added level of customized support from the
YourWay plan:

* Personalized weekly e-mails 
* A website that offers expert tips, advice and videos, and delivers appropriate
content according to how far along a patient is in the 12 week plan 
* Regular mailings and/or automated phone calls to help participants learn all
about the plan and stay on track

&lt;p&gt;The new title in the Disney Fairies video game series will launch this October,
coinciding with the upcoming Blu-ray and DVD release of the all-new movie


BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney Interactive Studios today announced Disney Fairies: Tinker Bell and the
Lost Treasure for Nintendo DS. The game will launch in North America the same
day as the all-new Blu-ray and DVD release from Walt Disney Studios Home
Entertainment and connects with the Disney Fairies Pixie Hollow
(www.PixieHollow.com) virtual world from Disney Online in new ways. Disney
Fairies:Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure follows last year`s successful debut
of the Disney Fairies franchise on Nintendo DS. 

"Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure allows fans to once again play as one of the
most enduring characters in Disney history, in the beautiful world of Pixie
Hollow," said Craig Relyea, senior vice president of global marketing, Disney
Interactive Studios. "Fans can play through memorable scenes from the film, let
their imaginations run wild when creating and customizing their very own Fairies
and experience new levels of integration with the Pixie Hollow virtual world." 

Disney Fairies: Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure expands on the forthcoming
movie in which the Disney Fairies prepare for the Autumn Revelry, where Tinker
Bell has been selected to create the prestigious Fall Scepter that can
rejuvenate the Pixie Dust tree. When good friend Terence offers to help, Tinker
Bell`s stubbornness and temper get the best of her, causing her to shatter her
creation - the scepter`s fragile moonstone and her friendship with Terence. To
make things right, Tinker Bell must now embark on a perilous quest to north of
Never Land and find the Mirror of Incanta, which will grant her one wish. 

In the game, players have a choice of roles. They can create and customize up to
five of their very own Fairies, and help prepare for the Autumn Revelry by
participating in a series of mini-games, quests and puzzles. Players can collect
a variety of items, such as snowflakes, sunflower seeds and spider silk, to
create clothing, accessories and items to decorate their home. Fans can also
engage in exciting movie-based game play as Tinker Bell to find the lost
treasure north of Never Land. 

Similar to last year`s release of Disney Fairies: Tinker Bell, the player
experience expands beyond the DS game into the online world of Pixie Hollow. For
the first time, players can upload an original customized Fairy avatar from the
DS to the virtual world, where more than 16 million Fairies have been created to
date. Once a Fairy has been uploaded from their DS game, players will gain
access to an exclusive online quest, and when completed will unlock a special
item both in the online world of Pixie Hollow and in the DS game. 

Players can also transfer various gatherables collected in the DS game to
PixieHollow.com, which can then be integrated into pre-existing online
inventories. The link between the two platforms is further strengthened with the
ability for fans to receive up-to-date news and polls from the online world on
their DS. The synergy between the two platforms translates into a unique
experience only Disney can provide to fans around the world. 

Also included in Disney Fairies:Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure is DGamer, the
online community exclusive to Disney gamers on Nintendo DS, allowing players to
connect with others and unlock additional items in their DS game. 

Developed by Hyde, Disney Fairies: Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure will be
available this fall for Nintendo DS.

&lt;p&gt;ABU DHABI (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron (CVX.N) could deploy a technique to boost oilfield output across the neutral zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in 2017, a top Chevron executive said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If successful, the technique could be rolled out worldwide and add billions of barrels to global reserves, said Guy Hollingsworth, Chevron's president for exploration and production in Europe, Eurasia and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We could go to full-field in 2017," Hollingsworth told reporters on the sidelines of an energy conference in Abu Dhabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is testing the impact of steam flooding in the oilfields in the neutral zone to help boost output of heavy oil. Steam raises the temperature below ground and loosens up crude that is otherwise difficult to pump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. firm would begin the second stage of the testing program in July, Hollingsworth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This stage, pumping steam underground through 16 injection wells to produce crude from 25 wells, would run for three years and give a better idea of how much recovery could be improved through the process, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first stage, already completed, used just one injection well and one producing well. It was unclear from that how much recovery could be improved, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia and Kuwait share the estimated 550,000 barrels per day (bpd) output from the Neutral Zone. Kuwait Gulf Oil Company, operator on the Kuwait side, detailed plans last month to invest $11 billion with Saudi Arabia to boost output to 900,000 bpd over the next 20 years in the zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia renewed Chevron's concession in the neutral zone last year. It is the only concession that survived the nationalization of the Saudi oil industry in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's net production after royalties is 110,000 barrels per day, mostly heavier grades that trade at a discount to benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The zone is a region between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that dates back to 1920s treaties to establish regional borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by James Jukwey)&lt;/p&gt;

LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(Business Wire)--
Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM), a leading health-benefits company, announced today a
unique collaboration with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures that will impact
children`s health in a fun and innovative way. "Operation Planet Savers" is a
game developed and sponsored by Humana`s Innovation Center "Games for Health"
team that combines real-world and online game play. The game offers kids a cool
way to participate in physical, mental and social challenges this summer while
getting excited about Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Films` G-Force,
arriving in theaters July 24. 

G-Force is about a team of secret agent guinea pigs on a mission to save the
planet. Players of Operation Planet Savers, OPS for short, complete weekly
training missions that require real-world activity and train the young
game-players to become G-Force agents. Players can earn virtual prizes, like new
G-Force holograms - unique to Humana and Disney - and sneak peeks at G-Force
movie clips. OPS players also compete each week for prizes like an iPod nano and
the grand prize - walking the red carpet at the G-Force movie premiere in Los
Angeles. 

"OPS is much more than an online game; it`s `on the ground` as well - a unique
game that gets kids out in their backyards playing and having fun," said Grant
Harrison, Vice President of Consumer Innovation at Humana. "Being inactive as
kids can impact their long-term health, which is one reason we`ve created a game
that gets kids off the couch, out of the house and on a mission. We couldn`t
have a better association for a game like this than with Disney." 

"We are thrilled to be collaborating with Humana for the very first time on our
summer release of G-Force. It`s the perfect film with which to showcase Humana`s
Operation Planet Savers game, using the latest technologies in an amazing game
experience for kids and families alike. We are pleased to be part of such an
inspiring program that is designed to get kids moving while having fun," said
Cherise McVicar, Senior Vice President, National Promotions and Mobile Marketing
- Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. 

The OPS game has now begun and continues through June 28. The game is free and
open to anyone under age 16, but is geared to 7-9 year olds. The OPS website is
secure, and every child who wishes to play must have a parent or guardian`s
permission before they can embark on their "missions." For more information,

world is in their paws. Tapped for the G-Force are guinea pigs Darwin (voice of
Sam Rockwell), the squad leader determined to succeed at all costs; Blaster
(voice of Tracy Morgan), an outrageous weapons expert with tons of attitude and
a love for all things extreme; and Juarez (voice of Penelope Cruz), a martial
arts pro; plus the literal fly-on-the-wall reconnaissance expert, Mooch, and a
star-nosed mole, Speckles (voice of Nicolas Cage), the computer and information
specialist. Along the way, the G-Force encounters myriad other members of the
animal kingdom, including pet shop layabout Hurley (voice of Jon Favreau) and
the rabidly territorial hamster Bucky (voice of Steve Buscemi).

DEMONSTRATION DETAILS

 WHAT:     Virtutech, Inc., the leader in Virtualized Systems Development (VSD), will demonstrate an integration of its Simics, Ready for Rational platform with IBM Rational Build Forge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 WHY:      Today`s systems include an increasing number of multi-CPU/ASIC/FPGA/DSP, platforms or network connected servers. As a result, the complexity and effort of developing, building, testing and integrating these systems has become a major challenge to many development teams.                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
           These challenges are eased through the adoption of VSD; the process of developing, integrating and testing full systems software like OS, driver, communication and application software, on a virtual system instead of real hardware. The use of a flexible virtualized system instead of rigid physical hardware dramatically improves "what-if?" scenarios for design exploration, early-integration, development team collaboration and debugging.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
           IBM Rational Build Forge is a flexible, adaptive framework capable of adding process automation, acceleration, notification and scheduling capabilities to existing software for building, testing, packaging and deploying solutions. Now with the integration of Simics and IBM Rational Build Forge, the benefits of VSD extend to cover the software build, test, package and deploy cycle.

About Simics

Simics is a high performance full-system simulator that enables engineers to
develop, debug, test and run their entire software application stack on a
virtual representation of their target hardware named virtual platform. The
overall engineering development efforts are reduced through advanced
capabilities normally not available with physical hardware: non-invasive
debugging and tracing, saving and later resuming execution, full deterministic
behavior, built-in networking capabilities, forward and reverse execution,
ability to examine, control, and break on any internal device and to inject
faults, and the ability to save system state and later replay it. Simics runs
unmodified production-quality binaries and can be used with third party software
development tools. 

About Virtutech

&lt;p&gt;New Solution Helps Organizations Save Cost and Eliminate Risk of Project Failure


ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
iRise&#174;, the world`s leading visualization solutions company, today announced the
immediate availability of iRise Connect for IBM&#174; Rational Requirements Composer.
This integration, built on IBM`s scalable and extensible Jazz platform, will
make high fidelity iRise visualizations instantly accessible from within the IBM
Rational Requirements Composer product. As a result, the combination of IBM and
iRise now provides a richer requirements definition solution supporting a
variety of elicitation and definition methods. This integration is designed to
eliminate wasteful cost overruns and delays by ensuring IT organizations are
documenting and tracking the right business needs - the first time. 

iRise Connect for IBM&#174; Rational Requirements Composer is being demonstrated at
the IBM Rational Software Conference in Orlando, FL at the Walt Disney World
Swan &amp; Dolphin Resort from May 31st through June 4th in the iRise booth 710. 

"Interactive, immersive software visualization is an important component to
solving the endemic problem with requirements on software projects," said
Michael Loria, vice president of business development, IBM Rational Software.
"iRise is leading the way with this capability, having proven the benefits of
visualization across a broad set of industries and application types." 

iRise Connect for IBM Rational Requirements Composer gives requirements
professionals the ability to embed live, high fidelity software visualizations
directly into the Requirements Composer product by leveraging iRise SmartView, a
wrapper technology similar to popular YouTube video embedding. Using iRise
Connect, business analysts, business stakeholders, developers, projects managers
and other IBM users can interact with `live` visualizations and fully experience
simulated pages, scenarios and masters directly within the Requirements Composer
environment. The visualization assets are published in real time from iRise to
the Requirements Composer repository and can be linked into the web of other
Requirements Composer requirements artifacts. 

For the first time, fully functional, high fidelity visualizations now
complement other definition assets contained and managed in the Requirements
Composer environment, ensuring that the right application requirements are being
captured, defined, traced, collaborated on and managed throughout the project
life cycle. 

"The combination of software visualization from iRise with comprehensive
requirements definition and management from IBM is a powerful weapon in the
fight to eliminate waste and cut risk on business application projects," stated
Emmet B. Keeffe III, CEO and co-founder of iRise. "Fixing the requirements
problem is a huge win for IT organizations that develop custom or packaged
applications. This complete visualization, requirements definition and
management solution is the best way to eliminate the risk of project failure." 

IBM Premier Business Partner, Ascendant Technology, has widely adopted iRise and
has developed preconfigured simulations for WebSphere Portal, WebSphere Commerce
and Lotus Connections. "We are working to create the most efficient experience
with our customers," said Jim Deters, president of Ascendant Technology. "By
leveraging iRise and Rational software tools, we have created a seamless
execution process from initial vision and strategy through all stages of
development and testing." 

Software Visualization - The Ultimate Change Agent

iRise visualization software gives business and IT leaders a powerful way to
"move the needle" and cost-effectively drive change in their organizations.
iRise is the only enterprise grade, real-time collaborative software definition
platform on the market today. By enabling global organizations to "test drive"
and fully experience critical business systems early in the process, iRise is
now an essential strategy to modernize their systems, consolidate applications,
cut cost, accelerate delivery and leverage global sourcing partnerships without
the usual confusion and risk. 

With thousands of projects completed successfully, the value of visualization
has proven to be enormous for businesses in highly competitive markets:

* Get to market twice as fast; 
* Eliminate 30% of project cost; 
* Ensure success of global sourcing strategies; and, 
* Dramatically improve customer experience.

Pricing and Availability

iRise Connect for IBM Rational Requirements Composer is available now. Contact

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Walt Disney Studios has a new Winnie the Pooh hand-drawn animated theatrical release in the works, and it's also creating two primetime TV specials starring the main character of the animated series "Handy Manny."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcements are planned for Tuesday at the Licensing International Expo in Las Vegas, where executives also will discuss plans to pump more enthusiasm into the world's largest licensed character franchise: Mickey Mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That effort, said consumer products chairman Andy Mooney, could include classic footage of an animated Mickey mashed up with contemporary Disney properties, with the resulting creations running on the Disney Channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Through extensive research with kids, we found they actually love the original Mickey Mouse property," Mooney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Pooh, the movie's planned release for spring 2011 will follow by six years "Pooh's Heffalump Movie," which was panned by critics and earned just $18 million at the domestic box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the "Handy Manny" front, one TV special is set for this year and another for next, and a new 20-episode short-form series called "Handy Manny's School for Tools" will debut next year as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on revenue, Disney's consumer products unit is its second smallest, after interactive media, but in the latest quarter it was the fastest growing, mostly because of the company's decision to take back ownership of Disney Stores North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's licensing-show event also will feature chief creative officer John Lasseter discussing plans for the re-release of "Toy Story" and "Toy Story 2" in 3-D in October followed by "Toy Story 3" in summer 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Toy Story" merchandise in the works includes a Buzz Lightyear robot that responds to 25 voice commands and a line of LEGO products based on the film franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced today that it intends to raise $5
billion in common equity to satisfy a supervisory condition that the largest
bank holding companies redeeming TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) preferred
capital demonstrate access to the equity capital markets. While approval has not
been granted, the company believes that upon completion of this capital raise it
will have satisfied the criteria for fully redeeming the TARP preferred capital
and expects to do so before the end of June. 

JPMorgan Chase expects to have Tier One Capital of approximately $118 billion or
9.3% and Tier One Common of approximately $93 billion or 7.3% at the end of the

redemption. The company also expects to maintain its extremely strong capital
ratios, even in the event of a more highly stressed environment over the next
two years.

interests of the country and the company, and that these funds can be used by
the Government for other critical purposes. JPMorgan Chase also reaffirms its
commitment to continued robust lending to consumers, small businesses,
non-profits, municipalities, corporations and others.

&lt;p&gt;Two Other Phase 3 Advanced Breast Cancer Trials of Sunitinib Continue
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc today announced the discontinuation of the SUN 1094 Phase 3 study
that evaluated SUTENT&#174; (sunitinib malate) plus paclitaxel versus bevacizumab
plus paclitaxel for the first line treatment of patients with advanced breast
cancer. The independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) found that treatment
with sunitinib in combination with paclitaxel would be unable to meet the
primary endpoint of superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the
combination of bevacizumab and paclitaxel. No new safety issues were identified.


"While we are disappointed that this trial did not meet its primary endpoint, we
are continuing to study sunitinib in different breast cancer populations and
with different regimens," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of
Clinical Development and Medical Affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit.
"Pfizer remains committed to evaluating sunitinib in advanced breast cancer
through its two other Phase 3 clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of
Sutent in combination with standard of care chemotherapies." 

One Phase 3 trial (SUN 1064) is a comparison of SUTENT plus docetaxel vs.
docetaxel for the first line treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer,
and the second (SUN 1099) is a Phase 3 trial of SUTENT plus capecitabine vs.
capecitabine for the second line treatment of patients with advanced breast
cancer. These trials are ongoing with an analysis expected by the end of the
year or early next year. 

Pfizer has notified clinical trial investigators involved in the study and
regulatory agencies of these findings. 

These results do not affect the approved indications with sunitinib as
monotherapy. Sunitinib is currently approved for both gastrointestinal stromal
tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate,
and advanced / metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) based on efficacy and
safety data from large, randomized Phase 3 clinical trials. Sunitinib has played
an important role in reshaping the treatment landscape for these two
difficult-to-treat cancers. To date, more than approximately 58,000 patients
globally have been treated with sunitinib. 

Sunitinib Clinical Research Program

Pfizer Oncology is committed to helping to improve the lives of breast cancer
patients and is dedicated to further developing agents for the treatment of
patients in the advanced breast cancer setting - a patient population with
significant unmet medical needs. 

Pfizer is also continuing to study the potential role of sunitinib in the
treatment of various other solid tumors including advanced non-small cell lung
cancer, advanced colorectal cancer, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and
advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer, in Phase 3 trials. 

Healthcare professionals who are interested in learning more about sunitinib
trials that are open for enrollment can visit the SUN program web site at
www.suntrials.com. Patients with questions should contact their treating
physician. 

About Advanced Breast Cancer

Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related
death among women globally. Compared to early stage breast cancer, effective
therapy for advanced breast cancer, which includes inoperable locally advanced
and metastatic disease, remains a clinical challenge in the oncology community.
Additional treatment options are desperately needed to address this continuing
unmet medical need. 

About SUTENT() (sunitinib malate)

SUTENT is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of GIST
after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate and advanced /
metastatic RCC. 

SUTENT works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important SUTENT targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. SUTENT also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Important SUTENT() (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of childbearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on SUTENT. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with SUTENT. 

The most common adverse reactions in GIST and RCC clinical trials were fatigue,
asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal
pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin discoloration,
altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

2009. Pfizer assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements
contained in this release as the result of new information or future events or
developments.

This release contains forward-looking information about certain potential
additional indications for Sutent, including their potential benefits, that
involves substantial risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties
include, among other things, the uncertainties inherent in research and
development; decisions by regulatory authorities regarding whether and when to
approve any supplemental drug applications that may be filed for additional
indications for Sutent as well as their decisions regarding labeling and other
matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of any such
additional indications; and competitive developments.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive James Dimon on Wednesday shared his personal plan for success with Harvard business graduates but stopped short of discussing real world issues facing U.S. banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who earned a Harvard business degree and now runs the second-largest U.S. bank, ticked off a long list of attributes required for success in the business world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discipline, fortitude and openness are critical, Dimon told the graduating class at its Class Day festivities. It is also important to avoid playing politics, set things up for success and to look at the facts in a "cold-blooded way," Dimon, named one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking freely and quickly, Dimon dug into his past to describe the day he was fired from Citigroup but offered only little advice about the real world of business, warning graduates to watch out for what he called "aggressive accounting" and to make sure top executives "get the compensation right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't care what the PL says, do the right thing anyway," Dimon said on the lawn of Harvard Business School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said he expects the country to make it through its worst financial downturn since the Great Depression. "We are going to get through this crisis," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon took his own advice to be disciplined and refused to discuss any current hot-button topics, including the government bailout money his bank wants to pay back fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan received $25 billion under the Troubled Asset Relief Program designed to stabilize the U.S. financial system. He previously called the money a "scarlet letter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week the out-spoken CEO made headlines with a tongue-in-cheek message to the Obama administration in a mock letter penned to U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geither.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dear Timmy, we are happy to be able to pay back the $25 billion you lent us," Dimon said, reading the brief letter at an industry conference in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, Dimon focused only on the students and their success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accompanied by his wife, also a Harvard Business School graduate, and his daughter, who will soon enter the school, Dimon mingled with graduates and their parents. He posed for pictures, asked where graduates will work, and offered encouragement to those who have not yet landed a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

It is also important to avoid playing politics, set things up for success and to look at the facts in a "cold-blooded way," Dimon, named one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking freely and quickly, Dimon dug into his past to describe the day he was fired from Citigroup but offered only little advice about the real world of business, warning graduates to watch out for what he called "aggressive accounting" and to make sure top executives "get the compensation right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't care what the PL says, do the right thing anyway," Dimon said on the lawn of Harvard Business School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said he expects the country to make it through its worst financial downturn since the Great Depression. "We are going to get through this crisis," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon took his own advice to be disciplined and refused to discuss any current hot-button topics, including the government bailout money his bank wants to pay back fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan received $25 billion under the Troubled Asset Relief Program designed to stabilize the U.S. financial system. He previously called the money a "scarlet letter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week the out-spoken CEO made headlines with a tongue-in-cheek message to the Obama administration in a mock letter penned to U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geither.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dear Timmy, we are happy to be able to pay back the $25 billion you lent us," Dimon said, reading the brief letter at an industry conference in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, Dimon focused only on the students and their success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accompanied by his wife, also a Harvard Business School graduate, and his daughter, who will soon enter the school, Dimon mingled with graduates and their parents. He posed for pictures, asked where graduates will work, and offered encouragement to those who have not yet landed a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - An ExxonMobil oil tanker had a dead humpback whale on its bow when it arrived at the Valdez marine terminal, federal officials said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear whether the tanker, operated by Exxon Mobil's SeaRiver Maritime shipping unit, struck the whale or how the animal died, the U.S. Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't know the condition of the whale when it was struck, or where. What we do know is it was on the tanker bow in Valdez," said Sheela McLean, a NOAA spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have any definitive answers about it," she said, adding that she could not confirm reports that the whale was 50 feet long. Marine biologists say adult humpback whales can grow to be around 50 feet long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery was made late Monday afternoon, when the Kodiak arrived at the Valdez marine terminal of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A SeaRiver Maritime spokesman said the whale was discovered just as the Kodiak was being prepared for docking, and while the ship was moving very slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither crew members on the Kodiak nor those aboard the tugs that escorted the tanker during the final approach to Valdez noticed anything out of the ordinary during the transit, said Ray Botto, external affairs manager for SeaRiver Maritime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was nothing that suggested any deviation from standard operating practice," he said, adding the poor condition of the whale, which had a noticeable stench, suggests it had been dead for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident comes twenty years after the Exxon Valdez supertanker spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaskan waters, fouling 1,300 miles of coastline and disrupting or killing marine wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Yereth Rosen; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oneida Will Become First Gaming Operator with More Than 2,000 Slot Machines to
Implement Bally`s New Windows-Based SDS Version 11 Slot System Solution
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Bally Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: BYI), a leader in slots, video machines, and
casino-management systems for the global gaming industry, was awarded a contract
with the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin to provide a comprehensive system solution
for its eight casinos in Wisconsin. 

After a highly competitive selection process, the Oneida Nation chose to replace
another gaming manufacturer`s system that it currently uses with a Bally system
including 2,375 iVIEW patron-communication network displays, Bally Business
Intelligence Solutions, TableView Real-Time Table Rating and Player-Tracking
System, and Bally`s full suite of Power Bonusing, casino marketing,
player-tracking, and promotions tools. 

"Changing our systems vendor was not a decision we took lightly, but we could
not ignore the passion, integrity, and experience of Bally`s employees, their
remarkable commitment to customer support and service, their track record of
standing behind their products for the long term, and their complete focus on
Systems as a business unit," said Joe Olujic, Assistant General Manager-Finance
for Oneida Bingo &amp; Casino. "Implementing a new system is not an easy or
inexpensive endeavor, but we are convinced that Bally`s systems products will
pay us rich dividends with their innovative player-centric marketing and
promotions tools as well as their solutions like Business Intelligence and
TableView that deliver true operating efficiencies." 

The Oneida Nation will become the first casino with more than 2,000 slot
machines to go live with Bally`s SDS Version 11 slot system across an
eight-casino network. The significantly upgraded, Java-based solution provides
an easy and familiar user interface and a single code base that supports
multiple hardware platforms and databases - making it the industry`s first truly
open system product, allowing casino operators true flexibility and choice. 

"We are very excited and proud to be the first casino of our size to go live on
Bally`s new Java-based SDS Version 11 running on Windows," Olujic said. "We look
forward to partnering with Bally as they drive their innovation forward
effectively, and we know Bally will stand behind its products now and into the
future." 

Ramesh Srinivasan, Executive Vice President of Bally Systems, said, "The Oneida
Nation is a very progressive gaming operator and we are extremely honored and
humbled to become their systems partner for the future. We look forward to
helping the Oneida Nation take their gaming operation to the next level. The
fact they will become the first casino of their size to go live on SDS Version
11 makes this partnership even more exciting for us." 

The Oneida Nation will go live late this summer with Bally`s fully networked
floor systems solution over the gaming operator`s new high-speed Ethernet floor
network.

&lt;p&gt;Teens Encouraged To Submit Video Expressing Their Individuality 

ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
What`s your formula? That`s the question Coca-Cola is asking as it launches its
summer program celebrating African American teens` passion for self-expression
and connectivity. Coca-Cola is partnering with one of Black Entertainment
Television`s (BET) most popular properties - music series 106 &amp; Park - to bring
the program to life. 

Beginning now and running for 13 weeks, teens tuning in to watch 106 &amp; Park will
be asked "What`s YourFormula?" Teens will be encouraged to submit video entries
to www.bet.com/mycokerewards describing their "formula"&#8230;in other words, how they
express themselves and what makes them unique. The winning entry will receive a
trip to visit the set of 106 &amp; Park in New York City. To complement the
promotion, Coca-Cola is also hosting the Studio Red Room during 106 &amp; Park`s
weekly talent show "Wild-Out Wednesday." Interviews and unique content from the
show will be featured on www.bet.com/mycokerewards, giving teens
behind-the-scenes exclusive access to the program. 

"Our partnership with BET provides us the opportunity to connect with teens in a
meaningful way by delivering a relevant program that will make them feel
empowered, inspired and unique as they find their formula for success," said
Yolanda White, assistant vice president, Coca-Cola North America. 

"We`re thrilled to be partnering with Coca-Cola on this exciting new program for
our 106 &amp; Park audience," said Alvin Bowles, senior vice president, Integrated
Marketing, BET Networks. "BET is committed to providing our viewers with ways to
express who they are, what they stand for, and what they`re aspiring to become,
so the `Coca-Cola What`s Your Formula?` promotion is a great chance for them to
do just that." 

Rounding out the partnership is an opportunity for teens to win a chance to
attend the BET Hip Hop Awards. To enter, teens purchasing 20-ounce bottles of
Coca-Cola and Coke Zero from June 1 - August 31 can text the under-the-cap code
plus the word "BET" to 844778 (THIRST) to be entered for a chance to win a trip
to the show`s taping in Atlanta in October. 

"We designed this partnership to refresh teens in a way that only Coca-Cola can
do by leveraging their number one passion point - music," said White. "They will
experience an uplifting and fun summer program that is yet another example of
our commitment to engaging African American teens with our brands."

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) has
hired a crude tanker vessel to store gas oil off Malta's coast,
shipping sources said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The U.S. investment bank declined to comment.
Storing any light, refined oil products in a crude oil
tanker is unusual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But one shipping source said the vessel, Front Queen, was a
new very large crude carrier (VLCC) which had never had a cargo
on board meaning that its tanks were clean and able to carry
refined products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tanker was able to carry up to 2 million barrels of oil,
the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, a shipping source said another new VLCC had been
fixed to store gas oil off Malta's coast by a trading house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VLCC freight rates have been depressed in recent months due
to weak demand for crude, while clean tanker rates have enjoyed
some gains partly due to arbitrage opportunities to ship
products from Europe to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some oil traders said that might have encouraged the
companies to store gas oil in crude tankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fall in oil demand this year has forced oil companies to
store crude oil and middle distillates, mainly gas oil for
heating and jet fuel, in tanks on land and tankers anchored at
sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bulk of middle distillates stored in tankers have been
held in floating storage in Europe, where oil demand has been
falling more sharply than the rest of the world and a steep
contango on the futures market, or discounts on prompt contracts
to longer-dated, has still been attracting inflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jonathan Saul, editing by Ikuko Kao and Keiron

&lt;p&gt;   * Palladia approved for canine mast cell tumors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Pfizer to begin selling drug in early 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* First cancer treatment specifically designed for dogs
 (Adds therapy details, no comment on price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Berkrot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) efforts
to develop new cancer drugs have yielded a breakthrough -- for
dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the
first cancer treatment specifically designed to treat dogs,
Pfizer and the agency announced on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug Palladia was approved to treat canine mast cell
tumors, a potentially serious type of cancer that accounts for
about 20 percent of canine skin tumors, and one that can spread
to other parts of the body, including lymph nodes, if not
treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All cancer drugs now used in veterinary medicine originally
were developed for use in humans and are not specifically
approved for use in animals, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This cancer drug approval for dogs is an important step
forward for veterinary medicine," Bernadette Dunham, director
of FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Prior to this approval, veterinarians had to rely on human
oncology drugs without knowledge of how safe or effective they
would be for dogs," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it would begin selling Palladia in early 2010,
but will make the oral drug available to certain veterinary
oncology specialists prior to that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Palladia works by killing tumor cells and by cutting off
the blood supply to the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pill must be taken every other day and the dog will
likely have to be on the therapy for several months or longer,
depending on tumor response, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer declined to divulge the cost of the treatment or to
forecast what annual Palladia sales might be. The world's
biggest drugmaker said it will likely announce the price of the
drug sometime this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Treatment with new cancer drugs for humans tends to cost
tens of thousands of dollars per patient, and the majority of
pet owners do not have health insurance for their dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In clinical trials, some 60 percent of dogs treated with
Palladia, known chemically as toceranib, had their tumors
disappear, shrink or stop growing, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Animal Health estimates 1.2 million new canine
cancer cases are reported in the United States every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares fell 14 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $14.84 in
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;DEERFIELD, Ill.--(Business Wire)--
Walgreens has reached an agreement with Microsoft to provide pharmacy patients
access to their personal prescription history through Microsoft HealthVault, a
Web-based platform that helps people gather, store and share health information.


In addition to prescription information, people can use HealthVault to store
copies of their health records obtained from their other providers, insurance
plans, government or employers; upload information from health and fitness
devices; and share information with health care providers and trainers.
Connecting Walgreens.com with HealthVault will offer patients a simple way to
track their medications and share that vital information with health care
providers, who can help patients get the most benefit from their drug therapy. 

Registered Walgreens.com users are already able to access their complete
prescription history for convenient refills, tax purposes or personal use.
Patients who enroll in this new service will be able to securely add their
Walgreens prescription history to HealthVault, and the information will be
automatically updated daily. Users will then be able to share their most
up-to-date health information with their providers. 

Walgreens participation in HealthVault is due to begin later this year. 

"While many patients are already using Walgreens online pharmacy to access their
prescription history, they don't always provide that information to their
doctors," said Don Huonker, Walgreens senior vice president of health care
innovation. "This service will make it easier for patients to share their
information with multiple health care providers and even their caretakers, who
can also be granted access to a patient`s account with their permission." 

Offering health care providers access to complete medication history can help
improve overall health outcomes through more coordinated care, Huonker said. 

HealthVault will also allow parents to track their children`s medical history as
well as older relatives whom they may be caring for. 

"Through our cooperative efforts, we will enable consumers to make informed
choices regarding their health and the health of their families by putting them
in control of their health information," said David Cerino, general manager of
consumer health for Microsoft Health Solutions Group. "Providing consumers with
the tools to track and share their prescription histories is critical to
delivering on the promise of connecting and improving health care." 

Walgreens has a long history of pharmacy technology innovation. In the early
1980s, the company was the first retail pharmacy chain to computerize all of its
pharmacies nationwide and link them via satellite. In 1992, Walgreens invented
the electronic prescription, which is seen today as one of the leading ways to
enhance pharmacy safety and lower prescription costs. More recently, Walgreens
was the first pharmacy to fully integrate its online pharmacy with its retail
pharmacies and was the first to offer prescription label directions and patient
consultation in 14 different languages. 

"All of these initiatives, including our HealthVault agreement, are aimed at
improving patient care and lowering health care costs," Huonker said.

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Kicks-off Summer-Long Program and Honors 2009 Community Champions
During Reception
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Today at Houston`s Hospice Garden, 65 interns and non-profit agencies, together
with Houston`s First Lady, Angela White, officially kicked-off the annual
ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs Program. 

The eight-week paid internship program, now in its 38th year nationally, offers
nonprofit organizations much-needed help during the busy summer months and
encourages college students to be active members of their communities.
ExxonMobil provided grants totaling $211,250 for intern salaries and Volunteer
Houston expenses associated with the program. 

"The ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs Program is much more than a paycheck or a
summer job, it is an opportunity for our community to interact with the leaders
of tomorrow and encourage them in their careers and futures. It is also an
opportunity for the interns to become active participants in their own
communities," said Neil Chapman, president ExxonMobil Global Services Company. 

"This ExxonMobil program continues to be one of the most successful signature
programs we have been a part of to date," said Carrie Moffitt, executive
director of Volunteer Houston. "Among our goals at Volunteer Houston are to make
people aware of the importance of volunteering, offer a birds-eye view of the
needs in our community and encourage volunteerism. This program accomplishes all
of those things and more," she said. 

Along with welcoming the 2009 interns and agencies, Houston`s first lady Andrea
White presented the Community Champion Awards to former CSJP interns Melinda
Wood and Za`ndra Jackson. Wood interned with Ronald McDonald House as part of
the 2006 CSJP. During her internship, she had the unique opportunity to assist
the development department in fundraising, as well as relationship
management.Jackson participated in the 2002 Community Summer Jobs Program and
worked with Crisis Intervention of Houston. Today both are working with leading
not-for-profit agencies in Houston. Wood is a communications manager at American
Cancer Society. As for Jackson, she is manager of volunteer and community
outreach at Depelchin Children`s Center. 

During the reception Melanie Lawson, KTRK-TV 13 news anchor and mistress of
ceremonies, announced the fourth annual Volunteer Spirit Award, which was
presented to Ellen Hetherington for her continuous support and dedication
through volunteerism with area nonprofits, including Memorial Assistance
Ministries. 

Volunteer Houston administers the program and assists in training the agencies
on recruiting, interviewing and selecting an intern candidate, as well as how to
organize and manage the summer internships. The interns are selected by the
participating agencies and must be full-time college students. In addition to
regular job responsibilities, interns are required to attend seminars structured
to give them broader exposure to the nonprofit sector, community needs and
volunteerism. Through the seminars, students also engage in professional
development and community service activities. 

Since the program began in 1971 in New York City, ExxonMobil has provided more
than $9.3 million to support almost 4,300 community summer job internships in
ten states including: Alabama, Alaska, California, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana,
Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming, and internationally in Angola. In the
Houston program alone, ExxonMobil has provided more than $1.6 million to place

&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI (Reuters) - Microsoft's (MSFT.O) new Windows 7 operating system will not run on netbooks powered by ARM (ARM.L) chips, Microsoft said on Wednesday, a blow to the British firm's hopes of becoming a big player in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news comes days after ARM said it planned to grab a foothold in the fast-growing netbook market this year, and that it was aiming for a 30 percent share of the entire market next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARM previously said netbooks using its chipsets would run on an operating system based on the open-source Linux system, which it says it prefers for its lower cost and the fact programmers can tailor it to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For people who want a PC, albeit a different chipset, we don't think those will work very well," Steve Guggenheimer, Microsoft's corporate vice-president for original equipment manufacturers, told Reuters during an interview at Computex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We sort of learnt in the last year that if it looks like a PC and acts like a PC, people want the features and benefits of a PC."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one at ARM was immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guggenheimer also said he did not think consumers would begin choosing Google's (GOOG.O) Android operating system over Microsoft, pointing to possible compatibility issues, its Linux core and a lack of supporting software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His comments come a day after Acer (2353.TW) became the first company to announce it would sell a PC running on Android, a move that could threaten Microsoft's stranglehold on the PC operating system market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm somewhat skeptical that consumers will begin running to Android right now. You'll still want your printer to work, you'll still want your software to work," Guggenheimer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lack of a complete ecosystem around Android."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also does not expect the same problems with its new Windows 7 operating system that it saw with Vista, as both programs work on the same core, Guggenheimer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said on Tuesday Windows 7 would be launched on October 22, and would be released to manufacturers in late July, ahead of its original schedule and in time for the peak holiday shopping season at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vista had some issues at the start because we were starting from a new core. This time, any computer that works with Vista will work with Windows 7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kelvin Soh, editing by Will Waterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Animal Health Receives Approval for PALLADIATM
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Animal Health today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has approved the first canine cancer therapy in the U.S. - PALLADIATM
(toceranib phosphate) - which was developed by Pfizer to treat mast cell tumors
in dogs. Pfizer made the announcement to veterinarians attending the 2009
American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) Forum and Canadian
Veterinary Medical Association Convention. 

"Pfizer Animal Health is proud to bring the first canine cancer therapy approved
by the FDA to U.S. specialists, their patients and caregivers," said George
Fennell, vice president, Companion Animal Division, Pfizer Animal Health. "In
the weeks and months ahead, Pfizer will introduce PALLADIA to boarded
specialists to expand the body of clinical experience with this new therapy. The
experience gained during this time will enable us to support veterinarians more
effectively when we make the product available for purchase in early 2010,"
Fennell said. 

Pet caregivers should continue to consult with their local veterinarians about
options for their dogs with cancer, who may then refer appropriate cases to
specialists for treatment with PALLADIA. 

A new option to treat canine mast cell tumors

According to the Morris Animal Foundation, cancer is a leading cause of death in
dogs. 1

Pfizer Animal Health estimates 1.2 million new canine cancer cases are reported
in the U.S. every year. 2 Mast cell tumors are the second most common tumor type
and are often seen as lumps in the skin. These tumors are classified as grade I,
II or III, with grade III being the most severe. If not treated, they can spread
to other parts of the body including lymph nodes. 

Prescription-only PALLADIA is an oral therapy indicated to treat Patnaik grade
II or III recurrent cutaneous mast cell tumors with or without regional lymph
node involvement. PALLADIA belongs to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) class
of compounds. It works by blocking the activity of key receptors important for
the development of blood vessels that supply tumors, as well as receptors
critical for tumor survival. 

"PALLADIA is an exciting, new treatment option for dogs with mast cell tumors,"
said Cheryl London, DVM, PhD, board certified medical oncologist and associate
professor at The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine. 

"At the completion of a PALLADIA clinical study, approximately 60% of dogs had
their tumors disappear, shrink or stop growing. Also, we determined that dogs
whose tumors responded to PALLADIA experienced an improved quality of life,"3
said Dr. London, who has helped Pfizer Animal Health`s Veterinary Medicine
Research &amp; Development to develop PALLADIA since 2000. 

Further Information about PALLADIA

PALLADIA can be administered in a veterinary clinic or in the home by a dog`s
caregiver. PALLADIA is not for human use and is only available in the U.S.
Adverse events with PALLADIA can be serious but most are mild to moderate and
are generally manageable. The most common side effects of PALLADIA involve the
gastrointestinal tract and signs include diarrhea, decreased appetite, lethargy
and vomiting. Life-threatening adverse events are rare but possible and early
recognition is critical. Children should not come in contact with PALLADIA. In
addition, all individuals, including children and pregnant women, should avoid
direct contact with broken or partially-dissolved PALLADIA tablets or biological
waste from dogs treated with PALLADIA. For specific dosing and prescribing
information, visit www.palladia-pi.com.

&lt;p&gt; June 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised its price targets
on several internet companies, including Amazon.com (AMZN.O)
and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), and said advertisers may increase
budgets for online media if they see queries, transactions and
order values improving.

 Analyst James Mitchell said he sees a return to moderate
economic growth in the United States and overseas in 2010 and
added that he expects "internet sector revenue to share in the
macro recovery".

 Mitchell sees online advertising spend growing 12 percent
year-over-year in 2010, after a fall of 4 percent in 2009,
driven by 10 percent growth in page views.

 E-commerce and online travel spend are expected to grow 12
percent and 9 percent, respectively, in 2010, he said.

 "Amazon is our favorite U.S. internet stock based on our
positive view of its franchise, online-offline expansion
strategy, share gains in a still-expanding e-commerce market,
and downloadable content initiatives," Mitchell wrote.

 He expects Amazon to take share of whatever consumer
spending exists given low pricing, wide product selection and
digital initiatives such as its electronic reader Kindle.

&lt;p&gt;  TIGARD, OR, Jun 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
FaxBack, the VoIP Fax Solutions Company, today announced the first ever
VoIP plug-in for Microsoft Fax. FaxBack has developed a new VoIP fax
plug-in that enables users of Windows operating systems the ability to
send and receive faxes using Microsoft Fax when connected to a VoIP phone
system. This capability was previously unachievable without expensive or
complex hardware configurations. FaxBack's VoIP Plug-in for Microsoft Fax
provides a no cost, Microsoft based, VoIP fax solution that adds further
value to a company's VoIP investments.

    "Small businesses migrating to VoIP can now take advantage of the
Microsoft Fax application that comes with Windows," said Mike Oliszewski,
Chief Technology Officer at FaxBack. "This simple download enables these
users to have a reliable, yet simple VoIP faxing solution that offers
additional faxing options and Microsoft Office integration."

    Microsoft Fax is one of the easiest fax clients to use and most convenient
because it is already included in business versions of Windows operating
systems. Connecting it to your VoIP infrastructure is very simple and will
allow all users in your business the ability to fax from their desktop.
VoIP systems include: Microsoft Response Point, local VoIP media gateways
and VoIP Service Providers supporting SIP T.38.

    Routing inbound faxes to specific users with DID routing is
straightforward with the Free Edition of the VoIP Plug-in for Microsoft
Fax. By simply adding routing rules on your local VoIP media gateway,
users will be able to automatically route inbound faxes directly to the
intended recipients desktop.

    Users can also install the VoIP Plug-in for Microsoft Fax on their
Microsoft Small Business Server (SBS) to provide a VoIP fax server that is
always available to receive faxes to further enhance their Microsoft Fax
solution. With the SBS version of the VoIP Fax Plug-in for Microsoft Fax,

&lt;p&gt;  TIGARD, OR, Jun 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
FaxBack, the VoIP Fax Solutions Company, today announced the first ever
VoIP plug-in for Microsoft Fax. FaxBack has developed a new VoIP fax
plug-in that enables users of Windows operating systems the ability to
send and receive faxes using Microsoft Fax when connected to a VoIP phone
system. This capability was previously unachievable without expensive or
complex hardware configurations. FaxBack's VoIP Plug-in for Microsoft Fax
provides a no cost, Microsoft based, VoIP fax solution that adds further
value to a company's VoIP investments.

    "Small businesses migrating to VoIP can now take advantage of the
Microsoft Fax application that comes with Windows," said Mike Oliszewski,
Chief Technology Officer at FaxBack. "This simple download enables these
users to have a reliable, yet simple VoIP faxing solution that offers
additional faxing options and Microsoft Office integration."

    Microsoft Fax is one of the easiest fax clients to use and most convenient
because it is already included in business versions of Windows operating
systems. Connecting it to your VoIP infrastructure is very simple and will
allow all users in your business the ability to fax from their desktop.
VoIP systems include: Microsoft Response Point, local VoIP media gateways
and VoIP Service Providers supporting SIP T.38.

    Routing inbound faxes to specific users with DID routing is
straightforward with the Free Edition of the VoIP Plug-in for Microsoft
Fax. By simply adding routing rules on your local VoIP media gateway,
users will be able to automatically route inbound faxes directly to the
intended recipients desktop.

    Users can also install the VoIP Plug-in for Microsoft Fax on their
Microsoft Small Business Server (SBS) to provide a VoIP fax server that is
always available to receive faxes to further enhance their Microsoft Fax
solution. With the SBS version of the VoIP Fax Plug-in for Microsoft Fax,
the Plug-in is installed on the SBS server instead of individual
workstations.

    The free plug-in is available at www.faxback.com/msfax/release.

    The FaxBack technology is certified by Microsoft and leading carriers
including AT, Qwest, and Global Crossing, among others.

    About FaxBack

    One of the early pioneers in fax, FaxBack has developed fax solutions for
the world's technology and telecom leaders including Western Union, Intel,
Microsoft, AT, ITT WorldCom, Symantec, Dialogic, IBM, and many of the
world's leading companies. FaxBack is the outright VoIP Fax leader for the

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), American Express (NYSE: AXP), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Banks Seek Cash to Avoid TARP

The Fed is expected to announce repayment approvals for some of the banks during
the next week, and periodically thereafter. 

In addition to other criteria laid down earlier, like demonstrating an ability
to access the debt markets without reliance on the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity
Guarantee Program (TLGP) and maintaining an extra capital cushion to protect
against a worsening economy, the banks now must also demonstrate an ability to
successfully access the public equity markets. 

As a result, some of the big banks (including those which were not required to
do so by the regulators after the stress tests) have announced additional
capital-raising plans to demonstrate their ability to access the public equity
markets. Yesterday, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) announced its plans to raise $5
billion in common equity and it hopes to repay TARP before the end of this
month. American Express (NYSE: AXP) also announced a $500 million offering of
its common stock, saying it may use the funds to repay TARP. 

This morning, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) also joined the bandwagon with the plans
to raise $2.2 billion in common equity. At the same time, Bank of America (NYSE:
BAC) said that it had raised almost $33 billion of the $33.9 billion required by
regulators after the stress tests. 

As the credit markets have improved a lot now, the stronger banks are issuing
debt without guarantee from the FDIC. And as the hopes for the recovery of the
economy are getting stronger, the banks are having no problem raising the
equity. 

Cautious on The Medicines Company

Management at The Medicines Co. (Nasdaq: MDCO) has notified all clinical
investigators to halt future testing of Cangrelor in the CHAMPION setting.
Discontinuing CHAMPION will save The Medicines Company approximately $5 million
in R costs during the second half of the year. 

But the failure is significant to our forward-looking income statement. We had
previously believed that Cangrelor would be on the market and posting sales of
$125 million in 2012, growing to $185 million in 2013. The removal of all
Cangrelor sales drops our 2012 EPS estimate from $1.02 to $0.53, and our 2013
estimate from $1.24 to $0.44.

&lt;p&gt;Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement Terminated
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc today announced the successful completion of its offering of &#8364;5.85
billion and &#163;1.50 billion of senior unsecured notes (totaling approximately
$10.5 billion). The notes consist of:

* &#8364;1.85 billion of 3.625% notes due 2013 
* &#8364;2.00 billion of 4.75% notes due 2016 
* &#8364;2.00 billion of 5.75% notes due 2021 
* &#163;1.50 billion of 6.50% notes due 2038

The notes were offered in a private placement pursuant to Regulation S under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Pfizer intends to use the net offering
proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of the
purchase price of the pending Wyeth acquisition and the refinancing of existing
debt. 

As a result of the completion of this offering, the Company`s 364-Day Bridge
Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated March 12, 2009, which Pfizer had entered into
in connection with its financing of the pending Wyeth acquisition, has been
terminated. No amount had been drawn down under that facility. 

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent
registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This
press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an
offer to buy any of the notes, nor shall there be any sale of the notes, in any
jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior
to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.


Additional Information 

In connection with the pending acquisition of Wyeth, Pfizer has filed with the
SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-4 that includes a proxy statement of
Wyeth that also constitutes a prospectus of Pfizer. Wyeth will mail the proxy
statement/prospectus to its stockholders. Pfizer and Wyeth urge investors and
security holders to read the proxy statement/prospectus regarding the pending
acquisition when it becomes available because it will contain important
information. You may obtain copies of all documents filed with the SEC regarding
this transaction, free of charge, at the SEC`s website (www.sec.gov). You may

Information regarding the persons who may, under the rules of the SEC, be deemed
participants in the solicitation of the Wyeth stockholders in connection with
the pending acquisition is set forth in the proxy statement/prospectus. You can
find information about Pfizer`s executive officers and directors in its
definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 13, 2009. You can find

&lt;p&gt; (Adds dateline, new throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) is
disbanding its stand-alone Principal Investment Management
Group's hedge-fund business and private-equity division and
shifting staff from this unit to sit within existing
businesses, according to a person familiar with the
reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main goal is to better align principal investing with
JPMorgan's traditional investment banking business lines, the
person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's commodities group, for example, already has a
principal investment management team attached to it -- and more
businesses will be set up this way after the reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's Asia-based private equity team will be
incorporated into its global emerging markets and credit
trading unit, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan declined comment.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday its new Windows 7 operating system will be generally available on October 22, well ahead of its original schedule and in time for the holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new operating system, which will replace the unpopular Vista, was originally planned for roll-out at the beginning of next year, but Microsoft confirmed last month that it would hit the market in time for the year's busiest buying period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of the new system is a big event for the computing world, as more than 90 percent of the world's PC's run on Windows, and strategically important for Microsoft, which gets more than half of its profit from its operating system unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest release is crucial to win back public confidence after the disappointing launch of Vista in 2007. Vista was incompatible with some low-power machines and perceived by many to be too complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company also faces new threats to its dominance in operating systems, especially in the fast-growing "netbook" market for small, portable PCs ideal for surfing the Internet and sending e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Tuesday, netbook pioneer Acer Inc said it plans to sell small PCs that run on Google Inc's new Android operating system, making it the first manufacturer to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will send Windows 7 code to PC makers to load onto new machines -- known in the industry as "release to manufacturing" -- around the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By October 22, people will be able to buy new computers with Windows 7 installed, or pick up the software off the shelf to install on their old computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft confirmed that it will run a program whereby people who buy PCs with certain versions of Vista before October 22 can get a free upgrade to Windows 7, but it has not yet released details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were up 7 cents at $21.47 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI (Reuters) - Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system will not run on netbooks powered by ARM chips, Microsoft said on Wednesday, a blow to the British firm's hopes of becoming a big player in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news comes days after ARM said it planned to grab a foothold in the fast-growing netbook market this year, and that it was aiming for a 30 percent share of the entire market next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARM previously said netbooks using its chipsets would run on an operating system based on the open-source Linux system, which it says it prefers for its lower cost and the fact programmers can tailor it to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For people who want a PC, albeit a different chipset, we don't think those will work very well," Steve Guggenheimer, Microsoft's corporate vice-president for original equipment manufacturers, told Reuters during an interview at Computex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We sort of learnt in the last year that if it looks like a PC and acts like a PC, people want the features and benefits of a PC."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one at ARM was immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guggenheimer also said he did not think consumers would begin choosing Google's Android operating system over Microsoft, pointing to possible compatibility issues, its Linux core and a lack of supporting software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His comments come a day after Acer became the first company to announce it would sell a PC running on Android, a move that could threaten Microsoft's stranglehold on the PC operating system market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm somewhat skeptical that consumers will begin running to Android right now. You'll still want your printer to work, you'll still want your software to work," Guggenheimer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lack of a complete ecosystem around Android."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also does not expect the same problems with its new Windows 7 operating system that it saw with Vista, as both programs work on the same core, Guggenheimer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said on Tuesday Windows 7 would be launched on October 22, and would be released to manufacturers in late July, ahead of its original schedule and in time for the peak holiday shopping season at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vista had some issues at the start because we were starting from a new core. This time, any computer that works with Vista will work with Windows 7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kelvin Soh, editing by Will Waterman)&lt;/p&gt;

Investment Corp (GIC) and Kerry Coal, a firm linked to
Malaysian billionaire Robert Kuok, had a combined 25 percent
stake in Adaro as part of a consortium at the time of the
company's IPO last July. The IPO priced at 1,100 rupiah per
share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IPO raised eyebrows among domestic investors and some
global funds, who were shut out of the country's biggest public
offering as shares were distributed to connected parties.

AMSTERDAM--(Business Wire)--
Gemalto (Euronext NL0000400653 GTO), the world leader in digital security, today
announced that its Optelio banking card has been certified to the Saudi Arabian

card functionality deployed in Saudi Arabia. The Gemalto product is also
compatible with the GlobalPlatform specifications (the standard for smart card

Arabia," commented Philippe Cambriel, EVP Secure Transactions Business Unit at
Gemalto. "These certifications confirm that Gemalto has the widest portfolio in
the industry, covering all applications and technology platforms."

&lt;p&gt;AMD Previews Significant Improvements to the Digital Media and Gaming
Experience, Commits to Bring DirectX 11 to Market First


TAIPEI, Taiwan--(Business Wire)--
At a press conference in Taipei, Taiwan today, AMD (NYSE: AMD) publicly
demonstrated the world`s first Microsoft DirectX&#174; 11 graphics processor. The
series of demonstrations shed new light on the significantly improved computing
experience set to debut at the end of 2009.1 The fusion of AMD`s new
ground-breaking graphics processors with the forthcoming DirectX 11 programming
interface is set to forever change both applications and PC gaming for the
better. To illustrate, AMD showed numerous examples of faster application
performance and new game features using the world`s first true DirectX 11
graphics processor.

* Get ready for a revolution: Games and other applications are about to get a
lot better as a result of AMD`s new graphics hardware and DirectX 11. DirectX 11
features such as tessellation will bring consumers higher quality, superior
performing games making use of 6th generation AMD technology. Another DirectX 11
feature, the compute shader, will enable AMD`s DirectX 11 graphics cards to help
make Windows 7 run faster in a wide number of applications and in a manner
that`s completely transparent to users, for example, in seamlessly accelerating
the conversion of video for playback on portable media players through a
drag-and-drop interface.2
* DirectX 11 done right on AMD: The development of DirectX 11 has been broadly
influenced by AMD graphics technology. Each new version of DirectX builds on the
versions thatcame before it, and many of the capabilities of DirectX 11 were
pioneered on AMD GPUs, including DirectX 10.1, tessellation, compute shaders,
Fetch4, custom filter anti-aliasing and high-definition ambient occlusion
shading. 
* Bringing consumers DirectX 11 sooner: The preview of the world`s first DirectX
11 graphics processor at Computex 2009 validates AMD`s commitment to delivering
leading technologies to market before anyone else, and to continuing to foster
innovation in computing. 
* Fueling developer demand: It`s not just consumers who are excited about the
prospects of DirectX 11, game developers are also incredibly enthusiastic about
taking advantage of new DirectX 11 hardware to bring even better games to
market, in large part due to AMD`s readiness to meet their DirectX 11 needs.
Many developers have indicated their commitment to building DirectX 11 games
initially on AMD`s DirectX 11 hardware, delivering superior performance and
compatibility.

"AMD has a long track record of delivering pioneering features that have gone on
to become mainstays in the DirectX experience, and we`re doing it again with two
mature, AMD-developed technologies in DirectX 11 - tessellation and the compute
shader - both of which enable a better DirectX 11 experience for consumers,"
said Rick Bergman, Senior Vice President, AMD Products Group. "Today, we`re
previewing AMD`s DirectX 11 graphics processor to build enthusiasm for this key
technology so developers will have games available at launch and shortly
thereafter. With the benefits it delivers to gaming, applications and Windows 7,
developers are lining up to get their hands on our hardware, and we`re confident
that consumers will too."

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - Embattled French tennis player Richard Gasquet, who tested positive for cocaine in March, said Friday he had never knowingly used the banned substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I have never taken any cocaine in my life, I can swear it," world number 21 Gasquet told French radio Europe 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was something small, they found 150 nanograms, I have been told it is the equivalent of one tenth of a line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gasquet, who was provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) last month, tested positive at the Sony Ericsson Open in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had pulled out of the Miami tournament without playing a match, citing a shoulder injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Gasquet fails to clear his name, he could face a two-year suspension from the sport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 22-year-old, who started his "own investigation," hinted he could have taken the recreational drug without knowing it during a party before the Sony Ericsson Open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have been trying to know what happened. I can't sleep at night because of this," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I saw a person who was at that party and this person told me he/she was offered cocaine that night, that there was a lot of cocaine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not clear whether the person Gasquet referred to was male or female.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I did not see it. Had I seen it, I would have left that night club."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ian Ransom)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
plans to make more than $10 billion of new loans to U.S. cities
and states before year end and the bank may be one of the few
still willing to make large loans to local governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; New Jersey said on Wednesday it chose to borrow up to $2
billion from JPMorgan Chase because the bank was the only one
willing to arrange the line of credit without selling portions
to investors. [ID:nN0388716]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan can make bigger loans than many competitors
because it has sidestepped the worst of the credit crunch,

recession bites into state and local tax revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The phone's been ringing off the hook," since Wednesday,
said James Lansing, head of debt capital markets and syndicate
for tax-exempt capital markets at the New York-based bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Municipal finance has long been seen as a backwater on Wall
Street, but that may change as state and local governments
borrow more to make up for their shrinking tax receipts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The National Governors Association said in a report
released on Thursday that deficits could hit $200 billion to
$250 billion over the next three years. [ID:nN04206080].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's willingness to make big loans "makes us stand
out, that we're willing to commit like that," said Jeff
Bosland, head of tax-exempt capital markets and public
finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank has made or refinanced about $20 billion of loans
to tax-exempt borrowers, including cities and states, in the
last six months. JPMorgan does not disclose the total size and
composition of its portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the bank's staffing efforts would imply it is making
more muni loans. JPMorgan has added about 10 people to its

banks cut staff and resources in this area in the last few
years and it is driven by Chief Executive James Dimon himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the CEO has been outspoken in his distaste for the
$25 billion JPMorgan received as part of the government's bank
bailout program in the fall -- he previously called the funds a
"scarlet letter" -- he has also said the bank should be a good
corporate citizen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But ultimately, it is JPMorgan's balance sheet that allows
it to make large loans, setting it apart from competitors and
winning it business from states and cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Balance sheets are a pretty scarce commodity these days,"
Bosland added.

&lt;p&gt;Oil Giant Continues to Deceive Shareholders
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Battered by negative publicity and shareholder pressure over a potential $27
billion environmental liability in Ecuador, Chevron`s legal team is
mischaracterizing the scientific evidence in a lawsuit to try to claim billions
of gallons of toxic waste it dumped in the Amazon pose no risk to human health,
representatives of the Amazon communities charged today. 

"Chevron is again distorting the scientific evidence as part of a public
campaign to mislead the public and shareholders about material information,"
said Julio Prieto, a lawyer in Ecuador who represents farmer and indigenous
communities that have brought the lawsuit against Chevron. 

Texaco (now Chevron) is accused in the lawsuit of dumping 18 billion gallons of
toxic-laden waste water into the Amazon and abandoning more than 900 unlined
waste pits which continue to leach toxins into fresh water sources and soils.
The pollution has decimated the traditional lifestyles of six indigenous groups
and caused 1,400 excess deaths from cancer, according to a team of 15 scientific
experts assigned by the court to review the evidence in the case. 

The 4,000-page expert report found that Chevron could owe up to $27.3 billion in
damages, an amount that analysts believe would create solvency problems for the
company. A final decision by the court is expected later this year. 

Separately, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has launched a probe of
Chevron management - done at the request of Chevron shareholders -- to determine
if the company is putting out misleading information to downplay the Ecuador
liability. 

On Wednesday, Chevron claimed in a Dow Jones report that results collected
during a final series of eight judicial inspections in March of this year
demonstrate that a remediation performed in the mid 1990s by Texaco was
effective. The assertion - made without any supporting documents -- contradicts
the evidence in the case as confirmed by independent laboratories and seems
bizarre given that only two of the final eight sites inspected had been
"remediated" by Texaco. 

At the March inspections themselves, oil was visible on the ground and Chevron`s
lawyers exploded in anger when a court-appointed expert began to take soil
samples that clearly contained oil contamination, according to news reports. The
evidence from the March inspections has yet to be released officially to the
court by a technical expert, so it seems "suspicious" that Chevron is making
pronouncements about it, said Prieto. 

All 94 sites previously inspected as part of the trial, in a process that began
in 2004, found extensive levels of toxic contamination at Chevron`s former
sites. Numerous results were thousands of times higher than Ecuadorian norms
that establish when human health is at risk. 

For example, Chevron claimed to have remediated a well site called Lago 2 to
less than 5,000 parts per million of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs), which
measures oil contamination in soils (Ecuadorian law stipulates that TPH
contamination cannot be higher than 1,000 ppm). Yet evidence taken in 2006 at
the trial found TPHs at the same site at 325,000 ppm, or hundreds of times
higher than maximum tolerances under U.S. law and far above what Chevron had
certified to Ecuador`s government to get the remediation approved. 

A similar pattern was found at 100% of Texaco`s formerly "remediated" sites,
according to the expert court report. Two Chevron lawyers and seven former
Ecuadorian government officials are now under indictment for lying about the
results of the remediation so the company could obtain a release from government
claims. 

The Dow Jones report quoted a Chevron press release claiming that all water
samples of the region taken by the company during the trial show there is no
risk to human health. In fact, roughly nine out of ten water samples taken by
scientists for the communities show levels of hydrocarbon contamination that
threaten human health, according to the court report. 

"Chevron`s mischaracterization of the evidence against it in Ecuador is a clear
example of insensitivity to human suffering and a failure to comply with the
company`s legal obligations," said Pablo Fajardo, the lead lawyer in Ecuador for
the Amazon communities. 

Chevron`s purported remediation also covered only 16% of the total number of
waste pits that it built, according to the court report. 

"It has become a pure money game for Chevron," Fajardo added. "Chevron has
decided it is cheaper to let poor people die from cancer than pay for a
clean-up, but they are running a major risk because ultimately the liability
issue will be decided by the courts." 

Chevron`s latest mischaracterization of the evidence follows a stunning rebuke
last week of Chevron management over growing human rights problems in Ecuador,
Burma, and Nigeria. Three stockholder resolutions questioning the company`s
handling of these problems garnered the support of shareholders holding more
than $79 billion in Chevron stock at the company`s annual meeting. 

It is likely that more than half of Chevron`s $133 billion in outstanding shares
voted to defy company management on one or more of the three human
rights-related shareholder resolutions, said Mitch Anderson, who monitors
Chevron`s human rights record for Amazon Watch, an environmental group based in
San Francisco. Those voting against Chevron`s management included some of the
nation`s largest pension funds, including two from Chevron`s home state of
California. 

"Chevron`s management is reeling from increased media focus on the Ecuador
humanitarian disaster and a general worsening of Chevron's human rights record,"
Anderson said. "As a result, [Chevron CEO] O`Reilly just suffered a major vote
of no confidence from a good portion of his own shareholders."

processing fees that cost the average household more than $400 a year. 

"Between the momentum built up since this bill passed the Judiciary Committee
last year, the intense scrutiny of the financial services industry seen during
the current economic crisis, and the credit card reform law signed last month,
we think the perfect storm exists for Congress to do something about these
unjustified hidden fees," NRF Senior Vice President and General Counsel Mallory
Duncan said. "In the middle of one of the worst recessions seen in decades,
consumers can`t continue to pay artificially inflated prices just so the credit
card industry can skim profits off the top. It`s time for these fees to be
brought under control." 

House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers, D-Mich., today introduced H.R.
2695, the Credit Card Fair Fee Act of 2009. The measure is similar to the
version of the bill that was approved by the committee in July 2008 and would
require Visa and MasterCard banks to negotiate with merchants on "interchange"
fees that are currently imposed on merchants on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. 

Interchange is a fee averaging close to 2 percent that Visa and MasterCard banks
charge merchants every time a credit card is used to pay for a transaction. Visa
and MasterCard effectively force merchants to pass the fees on to consumers by
requiring them to be included in the advertised price of merchandise and making
cash discounts difficult. Interchange is largely unknown to most consumers
because Visa and MasterCard keep merchants from disclosing it on receipts and
don`t disclose the fees on consumers` monthly statements. 

Interchange collections totaled $48 billion in 2008, up from $16.6 billion when
NRF started tracking the fees in 2001. The higher prices that result from the
fees cost the average household an estimated $427 last year, up from $159 in
2001. 

The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 signed
into law May 22 by President Obama includes a provision requiring the Government
Accountability Office to conduct a study of how interchange drives up retail
prices, why the card industry refuses to disclose the fees to consumers and how
card companies keep retailers from offering cash discounts, among other issues. 

"We expect the GAO to do a serious study that will reveal the negative impact of
interchange on the U.S. economy," Duncan said. "The debate over interchange that
occurred as Congress considered the credit card reform bill helped shine a
spotlight on this issue and make more members of Congress and the public aware
of how much the card industry is making off these fees. Congress can`t claim to
have fixed credit cards without addressing interchange, but they are clearly on
the path to finishing the job." 

The National Retail Federation is the world's largest retail trade association,
with membership that comprises all retail formats and channels of distribution
including department, specialty, discount, catalog, Internet, independent
stores, chain restaurants, drug stores and grocery stores as well as the
industry's key trading partners of retail goods and services. NRF represents an
industry with more than 1.6 million U.S. retail establishments, more than 24
million employees - about one in five American workers - and 2008 sales of $4.6
trillion. As the industry umbrella group, NRF also represents more than 100
state, national and international retail associations. www.nrf.com.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Walter Brown, a partner at Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe LLP, attorney for
David Sambol, former president and chief operating officer of Countrywide
Financial Corporation, issued the following statement in response to a civil
complaint against Sambol over Countrywide`s disclosures that was filed today by
the SEC: 

"The SEC has no case against David Sambol. The SEC wrongly asserts that
Countrywide's disclosures to its investors regarding its lending criteria should
have been more extensive, and that Mr. Sambol is somehow responsible for
insufficient disclosure. The SEC thus wholly disregards Countrywide's detailed
credit risk disclosures and the incontrovertible fact that the media widely
reported these disclosures and that Countrywide's investors, bondholders, rating
agencies, and the financial industry were all well aware that mortgage lending
practices were liberalized at Countrywide and almost all other financial
institutions during the relevant time period. Indeed, Dave's own statements
during investor presentations and earnings calls demonstrate that he provided
the detailed, accurate information the SEC now falsely asserts was absent from
Countrywide's public filings. 

For more than 20 years, Dave dedicated his life to Countrywide and its
borrowers. He always acted with the highest degree of integrity and business
ethics, demanded the same from those who worked with him, and steadfastly
discharged his disclosure duties in full accordance with Countrywide's policies.


The unfortunate reality is that this baseless complaint against Dave Sambol is
the result of the tremendous political pressure the SEC is facing given its
well-publicized enforcement failures. Making groundless allegations and losing
in court will not help the SEC restore its reputation. When the facts are fully
aired before an impartial fact-finder immune from political pressure, I am
confident that Mr. Sambol will be vindicated completely."

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman Sachs raises end-2009 oil price forecast

 * U.S. jobless claims fall, productivity rises

 NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures were up
more than 3 percent Thursday, rallying on news that the number
of U.S. workers filing new jobless benefits fell for the third
straight week, which reinforced hopes that the recession was
easing.

 Gains were also built on a higher end-of-2009 price
forecast from Goldman Sachs (GS.N).

 Crude futures bounced back after slumping more than 3
percent on Wednesday on data from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration showing a surprise 2.9-million-barrel increase
in domestic crude supplies last week. [EIA/S]

 "Yesterday's sell-off opened up an opportunity for buying
today and there also has been some short-covering," said Peter
Beutel, president of trading consultants Cameron Hanover in New
Canaan, Connecticut.

 "As has been the case lately, constructive economic data
has been used as an indicator that the economy will improve and
that oil demand will follow. But fundamentals at this point do
not justify the current prices for crude futures," he added.

 Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits
fell for a third straight week last week and the number of
people staying on benefit rolls after collecting an initial
week of aid fell for the first time in January, the Labor
Department said. [ID:nN04201550]

 In another report, the department said nonfarm productivity
was much stronger than initially estimated in the first
quarter.

General Walt Natynczyk, Chief of the Defence Staff, issued the following
statement today on the occasion of Canadian Forces Day:

    "On Canadian Forces Day, we who enjoy the privilege of serving our
country in uniform are expected to stand still and accept the

unprecedented high operational tempo of recent years.

    Over the past year, my first as Chief of the Defence Staff, I have

goodwill.

    I simply cannot overstate how thankful I am that Canadians everywhere,

wonderful ways. Whether it be generous support to the Military Families'
Fund, taking part in a Red Rally, hosting CF members and their families
at sporting events, or simple gestures such as wearing a yellow ribbon
pin, talking to soldiers at the airport or bus stop or writing a message
to a deployed soldier, sailor airman or airwoman. These signs of your
appreciation make a tremendously important positive impact on the morale
of our troops when they are on the high seas, in the skies and on foreign

    Our men and women in uniform take pride in serving Canada at home and

&lt;p&gt; * Agency says cutting Windows XP deliveries was violation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says demand for XP continues during switch to Vista&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Government continues to order Windows XP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds quotes from anti-monopoly statement, background on
previous antitrust claims against Microsoft)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOSCOW/AMSTERDAM, June 4 (Reuters) - Russia's state
anti-monopoly service launched a probe of Microsoft Corp
(MSFT.O) over cutbacks in supplies of the Windows XP operating
system in Russia, it said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency said it thought Microsoft had violated
antimonopoly legislation by cutting delivery of Windows XP to
Russia both separately and pre-installed on personal computers,
as well as in its pricing policy on the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Analysis of the market for various operating systems shows
that the transfer to the new Windows Vista operating system is
occurring while demand for the previous operating system,
Windows XP, continues," the service said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Demand for separately packaged and pre-installed verions of
Windows XP is also confirmed by retailers and the number of
orders from the government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said it would consider the case on July 24, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's Moscow office said it had not received an
official query from the anti-monopoly service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We (have) always answered antimonopoly service questions in
full and intend to continue this practice in future," Microsoft
spokeswoman Marina Levina said by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The anti-monopoly service is regularly in contact with
Russian companies but full-scale investigations are not common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The suit bears no immediate resemblance to past antitrust
claims against Micorosoft, target of a U.S. antitrust lawsuit in
the United States a decade ago, and which was fined 500 million
euros ($708.4 million) by the European Commission in 2004 for
anti-competitive behaviour in media player and server software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The commission later fined Microsoft an additional 900
million euros for non-compliance but the software maker is
appealing against that ruling.

Liliana Carrillo attending Hillsborough High School,and Monica Isava of Marjory
Stoneman Douglas High School were recognized as the 2009 Gold, Silver and Bronze
Medallion winners of the Hispanic Heritage Youth Awards. A regional awards
ceremony was held at Miami Dade College on May 28, 2009. 

Rivera received a $3,000 scholarship as the Gold Medallion winner and will
attend Harvard to study mathematics and political science; Carrillo received
$2,000 as the Silver Medallion winner and plans to study chemical engineering at
Columbia University and Isava, attending Massachusetts Institute of Technology
to pursue engineering, received $1,000 in educational grants as the Bronze
Medallion winner. The award winners are three of 18 Hispanic high school seniors
from Miamiwho were recognized for individual achievements and strong commitments
to their community and their heritage. 

"We congratulate all of the winners for their outstanding accomplishments --
academically and as role models for their peers," said Rex W. Tillerson,
chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation. 

"ExxonMobil is a proud sponsor of the Hispanic Heritage Youth Awards and its
efforts to honor and promote our next generation of math and science leaders
from the Hispanic community."

high school seniors in 12 cities: Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami,

engineers, scientists and other technically trained workers in the near future.
To help address the nation`s math and science crisis, ExxonMobil supports
programs and organizations such as the National Math and Science Initiative
(NMSI) that focus on improvements in these areas from pre-school through higher
education.

students in each of six categories in 12 cities-will be honored and receive
educational grants during special ceremonies. Subsequently, one National Youth
Award Winner will be chosen from the pool of regional winners in each category
and will receive an additional educational grant, a laptop computer, a free trip
to the National Youth Award presentation and to the national Hispanic Heritage
Awards ceremony in Washington, D.C. where they will be presented with their
award on stage.

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman Sachs raises end-2009 oil price forecast

 * U.S. jobless benefits claims fall for 3rd week

 NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures rose on
Thursday on news that the number of U.S. workers filing new
jobless claims fell for the third straight week and continuing
claims fell for the first time since January.

 Crude futures had been up earlier on a higher end-of-2009
price forecast from Goldman Sachs (GS.N).

 "Crude and products futures reversed course overnight,
after yesterday's steep decline, as Goldman Sachs raised its
price forecast for oil," Addison Armstrong, analyst at
Tradition Energy, said in a research note.

 The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless
benefits fell for a third straight week last week, government
data showed on Thursday.

 "The market really liked those (jobless claims) numbers,"
said a California-based broker.

 The number of people staying on the benefit rolls after an
initial week of aid fell in the week ended May 23 for the first
time since the week of Jan. 3. It was also the first time in 17
weeks that they did not set a record. [ID:nN04201550]

 The U.S. Energy Information Administration's report
Wednesday showed domestic crude inventories rose 2.9 million
barrels, against forecasts of a drawdown. [EIA/S]

 Gasoline supplies dipped 200,000 barrels, against a
forecast for a 400,000-barrel build. Distillate stocks rose 1.6
million barrels, more than had been forecast.

 The EIA natural gas storage report will be released at
10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT). A Reuters analyst survey yielded a
forecast for supplies to be up 114 billion cubic feet.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY and HOUSTON, TX, Jun 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Paltalk, the leading real-time, video-based community, announced it has
settled a lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. for infringement on two Paltalk
patents numbers 5,822,523 and 6,226,686, which detail methods for
deploying interactive applications over hosted networks and group
messaging servers. The patents were originally filed in 1996 by MPath
Interactive, a pioneer in the field of on-line video games and Paltalk
acquired these patents from MPath in 2001.

    The Paltalk patents protect the company's proprietary technology platform
that enables server group messaging for interactive applications on the
internet. The technology has many applications, including video games,
video conferencing and disseminating live communications from an
organization to a large audience.

    Paltalk filed suit against Microsoft Corp. on September 12, 2006,
represented by Susman Godfrey L.L.P. and Heim Payne &amp; Chorush L.L.P.
Paltalk alleged Microsoft was using Paltalk's patented technology for its
video game systems, specifically Halo 2 and Halo 3 running on Xbox LIVE.
Paltalk defeated Microsoft's motions for summary judgment, clearing the
way for a trial between the two parties that began on March 9, 2009 in the
Eastern District of Texas. The parties settled on the fourth day of trial
with Microsoft agreeing to take a license to the two Paltalk patents for
an undisclosed sum of money.

    "After litigating with Microsoft for over two years to protect our
intellectual property, it is gratifying to resolve this matter with
Microsoft taking a license to Paltalk's patents," said Jason Katz, Founder
and CEO of Paltalk.

    Paltalk was represented by lead attorney Max Tribble, Brooke Taylor and
Kalpana Srinivasan of Susman Godfrey L.L.P. and by Michael Heim, Doug
Wilson, and Micah Howe of Heim Payne &amp; Chorush L.L.P.

BEND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--

attained Gold Certified Partner status in the Microsoft Partner Program with a
competency in ISV/Software Solutions, recognizing Alchemy`s expertise and impact
in the technology marketplace. As a Gold Certified Partner, Alchemy has
demonstrated expertise with Microsoft technologies and a proven ability to meet
customers` needs. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners receive a rich set of
benefits, including access, training and support, giving them a competitive
advantage in the channel.

mainframe-based legacy systems, they are increasingly adapting these systems for
the Windows environment. Alchemy`s market-leading software preserves and extends
customers` investments in their legacy mainframe systems by modernizing
applications during the process of being migrated to the Microsoft .NET
environment. 

"With 425,000 certified members, the Microsoft Partner Program is the gold
standard for helping software and other technology providers to grow their
businesses and maximize profitability," said Ron Langer, COO and Group
President, Alchemy Solutions. "Their innovative technologies such as .NET

customer experience with our technologies. Today, Microsoft recognizes Alchemy
Solutions as a new Gold Certified Partner for demonstrating its expertise in

unique set of requirements and benefits, formulated to accurately represent the
specific skills and services that partners bring to the technology industry. 

Within select Competencies, there are Specializations that focus on specific

&lt;p&gt;June 4 (Reuters) - Sanford C. Bernstein upgraded Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) to "outperform" from "market perform," saying the
firm will continue to seize "up for grabs" share in the fixed
income market and benefit from a recovery in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman and Morgan Stanley will both gain from
opportunities in the credit market, but Goldman will emerge as
the "clear winner" during a credit recovery and normalization
of the fixed income market, said a team of analysts lead by
Brad Hintz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Goldman posted a $1.66 billion profit in the first quarter
helped mainly by trading gains in fixed income, currencies and
commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised its price target on Goldman to $176
from $113 and increased its 2009 earnings per share forecast to
$15.33 from $10.91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the coming years, the brokerage expects Goldman to
reallocate capital within its business portfolio and to pursue
regulatory relief by becoming a financial services holding
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernstein also raised Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) price target
by $10 to $37 and said the company will likely capture more
business than it did in the first quarter as it was more
comfortable with its funding and capital positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares were up more than 1 percent at $144.14 in
trading before the bell Thursday on the New York Stock
Exchange, while Morgan Stanley shares were up 28 cents at
$30.00.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

The Commercial Loan Disconnect

In what appears to be a significant number of cases after about a year of
negotiations, the crevasse between buyer and seller has yet to be crossed. We
agree that many of these loans are not worth 100% of the face amount, and most
will not sell for 30% of the face amount either. Unfortunately, we suspect that
in the financial institutions were to sell these loans at what could be fetched
current in the market; in many cases, the losses that would need to be recorded
could ultimately become basically insolvent overnight. 

The answer for many institutions -- put some money into the project and become
landlord. As such, many of these properties are performing "satisfactorily" now
as income properties, but are willing to be sold at a "reasonable" price
(whatever that many be). 

However, the next big unknown is what the future will hold for commercial
property valuation. Currently, commercial property valuations are down 25-30%
nationwide. As such, the commercial markets nationally are not expected to
recover until mid-2010. This would lead us to believe there will be continued
earnings uncertainty over the near-term for institutions such as, but not
limited to, Citigroup (NYSE: C), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), JPMorgan Chase
(NYSE: JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) and Corus Bankshares (Nasdaq: CORS).

Oil Takes Stock of Crude Realities

While the future may be better than the present, today`s inventory report is a
crude reminder not to lose sight of the existing oil glut. 

We continue to believe that there are good fundamental underpinnings for the
ongoing oil rally. Having said that, it would be useful for the budding economic
recovery as well as the sustainability of the rally if the commodity can pause
for sometime to consolidate recent gains. Today`s inventory report and
potentially weak payroll numbers on Friday will do just that, in our view. 

We continue to favor early-cycle leverage through oilfield service names, such
as Weatherford (NYSE: WFT) and Ensco (NYSE: ESV). Our long-term favorites remain
Exxon (NYSE: XOM), Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) and Diamond Offshore (NYSE: DO).

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Medtronic's (NYSE: MDT) story is improving -- product approvals and launches,
and a renewed focus on operating margins should drive healthy near-term EPS
growth. While sales growth has been hampered by weak U.S. end-markets, the
company produces solid free cash flow to be used for acquisitions. 

Full-year results showed resilience despite a weak Q409. Good execution moves
our estimates to the top of management's FY10 guidance. 

Further, we see valuation rising inline with peers, rather than below it. Our
recommendation moves up to BUY. 

Bear of the Day: 

At the outset of the summer driving season, we are downgrading Valero (NYSE:
VLO) shares to Sell to reflect our weak outlook for margins and a growing list
of medium- to long-term macro challenges. A combination of weak demand, excess
production capacity, and narrowing crude quality spreads are expected to weigh
on near-term margins. 

The medium- to long-term outlook also remains cloudy, with unfavorable
regulatory changes weighing on demand growth and capacity creep limiting margin
gains. 

Being the largest independent refiner, Valero remains particularly exposed to
this unfavorable macro backdrop. Our current target price is $15 per share. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

GameStop Getting Played Out?

GameStop (NYSE: GME) shares sold-off about 6% on Tuesday due to concerns that
the world`s largest video game retailer is quickly becoming the next Blockbuster
(NYSE: BBI) or Sam Goody. 

Specifically, at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Microsoft (Nasdaq:
MSFT) announced that it is going to roll out a new service called "Games On
Demand." Xbox 360 console owners will be able to download full video games (not
just demos) to their hard drives. The downloading service is scheduled to begin
on August this year. Initially, "Games On Demand" will offer 30 videogames,
including Mass Effect, BioShock and Call of Duty 2, and will add new games each
week. 

The initial take on this announcement is that Microsoft is plotting to cut out
the middleman, i.e., retailers like GameStop. We disagree. While we like the
idea of being able to download certain videogames, we do not believe the
download service will be a substitute for regular visits to GameStop. Microsoft
plans to offer a limited selection of older games and will probably avoid
selling newer games that are still selling well in retail stores. 

By limiting the selection to older titles, it is unlikely that "Games On Demand"
will replace GameStop anytime soon. Xbox Live general manager, Marc Whitten,
shares our view. He indicated that Microsoft has been working closely with its
retail partners. And Whitten personally believes that "going into a store and
seeing that back of the box of the game, talking about the game - that's not
going away."

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects headline and paragraph 1 to show that Goldman did
not upgrade the U.S. autos sector)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 4 (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales are likely to improve in
the second half of 2009, said Goldman Sachs, which rates the
sector "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry-wide auto sales in May, fewer distractions from
bankruptcy-related headlines, and greater clarity on issues
likeremaining brands, dealerships, and warranties at General
Motors Corp GMGMQ.PK and Chrysler set the stage for an
improvement in sales, analyst Patrick Archambault said in a
research note. Industry-wide auto sales for the month reached
nearly 10 million units on an annualized basis -- a better
result than most economists had expected with the industry
reeling from auto bankruptcies. May represented the highest
sales rate so far this year. [ID:nN02511678]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see this as a positive for the industry, as we are
finally seeing someevidence of a sales bottom driven by
increased consumer confidence, andimproved affordability from
the recent decline in auto loan interest ratesparticularly at
captive finance arms," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Archambault also said Ford Motor Co (F.N) was well
positioned to gain share, given its stronger product presence.

allow thousands of fans around the globe to see the real solid-gold trophy in
person. 

The Trophy Tour, which will begin its journey from the FIFA Headquarters on
September 21, 2009, will travel around the world before arriving in the host
country of South Africa on May 4, 2010. The total distance the tour will travel
is 134,017 kilometers (83,274 miles), or more than three times the circumference

the chance to get close to the real trophy. We`re especially looking forward to
taking the trophy to every single country in Africa." 

The 2009/10 FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour draws on the huge success of the first
global Trophy Tour held in 2006. In 2006, the tour visited 31 cities in 29
countries, covering 102,570 kilometers (63,734 miles) with millions of fans
around the world enjoying the chance to have a closer look at football`s most
famous prize. 

The authentic FIFA World Cup trophy is presented to the winning team on the
field of play at each tournament. The iconic trophy measures 36.8 centimetres
(14.5 inches) high, weighs in at 6,175 grams (13.61 pounds) and is made of
solid, 18-carat gold. The base contains two layers of semi-precious malachite,
while the bottom side of the Trophy bears the engraved year and name of each
FIFA World Cup winner since 1974.

&lt;p&gt;Silver Reef 3 is 15th land syndication completed by Walton in Arizona growth
corridor
CALGARY--(Business Wire)--

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings places the following classes of JPMCC 2006-LDP7 commercial
mortgage pass-through certificates on Rating Watch Negative: 

--$310.3 million class A-J 'AAA'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$78.8 million class B 'AA'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$44.3 million class C 'AA-'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$14.8 million class D 'A+'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$39.4 million class E 'A'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$39.4 million class F 'A-'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$49.2 million class G 'BBB+'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$39.4 million class H 'BBB'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$44.3 million class J 'BBB-'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$14.8 million class K 'BB+'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$14.8 million class L 'BB'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$19.7 million class M 'BB-'; Rating Watch Negative. 

The Rating Watch Negative placements are due to the increased number of Fitch
Loans of Concern (9.85%), which includes 13 specially serviced loans (3.53%).
The largest loan in special servicing (1.48%) is collateralized by a California
office building and transferred to the special servicer due to delinquent
payment. The loan is currently 30 days delinquent. 

Fitch expects to resolve the Rating Watch Negative status of these classes as it
completes the analysis of the 2006 through 2008 fixed rate transactions and will
incorporate updated information on the specially serviced loans as it becomes
available. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
The mixed sentiment toward Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) continued on Thursday, as the
bulls and bears battled in the options arena. According to data from
WhatsTrading.com, the credit card concern saw roughly 38,600 calls and 22,400
puts change hands, more than doubling its average daily volume of about 16,400
calls and 9,300 puts, respectively. 

On that same note, while the stock's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio
(SOIR) remains at an annual pessimistic peak of 0.95, the latest data from the
International Securities Exchange (ISE) points to a bullish bias. During the
past couple of weeks, traders on the ISE have bought to open more than twice as
many calls than puts on V.

&lt;p&gt;NEEDHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
The SOA Consortium today announced that a podcast and slide deck of the
presentation by JP Morgenthal, EA, SOA, BPM &amp; Cloud Computing Strategist on
"Disassembling the SOA &amp; BPM Relationship," recorded at the March 2009 meeting
of the SOA Consortium in Washington, D.C. are now available. To access the
podcast, visit http://www.soa-consortium.org/pr-dc-jpm. 

JP Morgenthal gave a provocative talk on "Disassembling the SOA &amp; BPM
Relationship." Morgenthal opened with his contention that SOA and BPM are not
the hand-in-hand partners that the technology press and vendors would like
everyone to believe. More so, SOA is not a prerequisite for BPM success. In
backing these assertions, Morgenthal described BPM as a practice that
encompasses modeling, testing, implementing and measuring business processes,
with supporting methodology to gather requirements, document processes, define
KPIs, capture metrics, analyze results and optimize outcomes. 

This view of BPM as a business discipline comes straight from the business
practitioners whom Morgenthal interacts with on a regular basis. The confusion
on the SOA-BPM relationship comes from IT professionals, who solely focus on the
execution engine (BPMS) of any BPM initiative. As Morgenthal pointed out, many
successful BPM initiatives have no underlying technology implementation. 

Morgenthal`s perspective provided for a lively discussion with meeting
attendees. The prevailing counter case was that SOA also has a business design
element, that many businesses are organized as business services, with
supporting process implementations. A supporting point was that business
personnel are more likely to think in terms of services than processes. 

To hear the entire presentation and discussion, download the 52-minute podcast

&lt;p&gt;Allows members to store their HealthPartners information in HealthVault
BLOOMINGTON, Minn.--(Business Wire)--
At the Microsoft Connected Health Conference,HealthPartners announced that
members can now transfer information from their HealthPartners account directly
to Microsoft HealthVault. Members will be able to permanently access their
health information and share it free of charge, even if they change jobs, health
plans or doctors. 

"This is an enhancement to our healthpartners.com strategy to make it easier to
access information," said Andrea Walsh, HealthPartners executive vice president
and chief marketing officer. Currently, about 1.2 million members have the
ability to transfer information from their account to HealthVault. Initially,
members will be able to transfer their HealthPartners explanation of benefits.
Later this year, 450,000 members will be able to transfer additional
health-related information to their HealthVault account, including: benefits and
co-pays, lab results, immunizations, allergy and medication lists, health and
wellness information such as results from HealthPartners health assessments, and
other information stored in HealthPartners Clinics and Regions Hospital
electronic medical records. To transfer information, members can access
HealthVault from www.healthpartners.com. 

"HealthPartners continues to push the online movement enabling consumers to
better access and manage their health information," said David Cerino, general
manager of the Consumer Health Solutions Group at Microsoft. "By allowing
consumers to connect their health and wellness data digitally and share it
securely, they are able to make better choices to improve their health and the
health of their families." 

HealthVault is an open platform designed to put people in control of their
health information. HealthVault enables the exchange of data among different
health solutions - giving people easy access to and more control over their
health information. People can use HealthVault to store copies of their health
records obtained from their providers, plans, pharmacies, government, or
employers; upload information from health and fitness devices; share information
with healthcare providers and trainers; and access products and services. 

"Giving consumers access to, and control of their personal health information is
essential to managing costs and improving health," said Carolyn Pare, president
and CEO of The Buyers Health Care Action Group. "HealthPartners has been an
advocate and leader in industry efforts to introduce a universal health records
platform, and we're pleased that they are one of the first organizations to
introduce this to their members and patients." 

"We`re pleased that HealthPartners is one of the first in the state to join this
effort which will simplify information for consumers and improve quality and
reduce costs by eliminating duplication and making information quickly available
to any doctor or hospital not just in the state but in the world," said Nathan
Moracco, director, Employee Insurance Division, Minnesota Management &amp; Budget.

&lt;p&gt;PALO ALTO, California (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's chief software architect said on Thursday the profit margins on providing online services -- broadly known as cloud computing -- would likely yield a lower profit margin than the company's existing software business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The margins on services are not like the margins on software, so it (cloud computing) will increase our profit and it will increase our revenue, but you won't have that margin," said Ray Ozzie on Thursday at a Silicon Valley technology event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozzie is the main driving force behind the world's largest software company's gradual move toward a cloud-based approach to its products. He has been in charge of Microsoft's long-term technical strategy since co-founder Bill Gates announced he was stepping down from day-to-day involvement with the company three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has made only tentative steps into the cloud arena so far, but has been investing in data centers to house customers' data and later this year is expected to unveil its 'Azure' platform, which will allow developers to write applications to work on Microsoft's cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The margins at the low level, at the Azure level, are going to be lower than the top level, where you're delivering a solution or something like Exchange," said Ozzie, referring to Microsoft's popular e-mail and calendar application. "You're pricing that solution around a business value more than cost so the margins are still very, very good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies have historically run their software locally, on servers, but as the Internet has grown in speed and ubiquity, some are starting to use the cloud to run their applications. In theory at least, customers save money on hardware and maintenance while suppliers get a new source of fees by storing data and providing services online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early pioneers of cloud computing have been Amazon.com Inc, Google Inc and Salesforce.com Inc, which may eventually pose a threat to Microsoft, whose software is still chiefly run on local systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights XTO Energy (NYSE: XTO) as the Bull of the Day
and Patriot Capital (Nasdaq: PCAP) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on Colgate Palmolive (NYSE: CL), Johnson &amp;
Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

XTO Energy (NYSE: XTO) remains well positioned to provide another record
performance in 2009 on the back of its impressive portfolio of producing assets
and industry-leading cost metrics. The company is expected to post 16% volume
growth this year and generate free cash flow in excess of $2 billion, of which
at least $1.25 billion will go towards debt reduction. 

Also, having already locked in nearly 80% of 2009 production at very attractive
prices, the company has smoothed out the commodity-price risk. As such, we are
maintaining our Buy recommendation on XTO shares. 

Our new $60 price objective, raised from $45 before, reflects 2009 P/CF and
EV/EBITDA multiples of 7.0x and 5.0x, respectively, well within historical
trading ranges. 

Bear of the Day: 

Patriot Capital's (Nasdaq: PCAP) 1Q09 NOI of $0.24 per share was a penny short
of consensus. Net loss for the quarter came in at $0.50 per share, primarily due
to $11.6 million of realized loss on investments. 

Though the overall credit quality remained stable, four of the portfolio
companies were on non-accrual status. Further, the company has not been able to
renew its revolving credit facility as yet, and is currently in negotiations
with its lenders. As a result, the auditors have expressed doubt about PCAP as a
going concern. 

The company has also postponed its dividend payment decision and, we do not
expect any dividend declaration in FY09. Based on the uncertainty and concerns
surrounding the credit facility, we are maintaining our Sell recommendation on
the shares. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Jobless Claim Data Mixed

Old-time recessions had a tendency to see both new and continuing claims rise
quickly when the economy headed south, but then fall just as fast. The last two
recessions followed a much different path -- remaining elevated for well over a
year after the economy started to recover. I would expect the "mesa" to be even
broader this time around. 

The economy is likely to stay very sluggish for an extended period of time. It
is no longer crashing, but not being in a freefall is not the same thing as
rebounding. I think that this environment should favor solid well capitalized
"Steady Eddie"-type firms. The additional benefit of such companies is that they
have not run up too much in the rally since early March and thus still have very
attractive valuations. Some names to consider would be Colgate Palmolive (NYSE:
CL), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM).

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG), Del Monte (NYSE: DLM), Winnebago (NYSE: WGO),

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Q1 More Productive

The service sector far outperformed manufacturing since manufacturing
productivity was down 2.7% in the quarter. Within manufacturing, there was a
serious divergence between durable goods, where productivity plunged 10.4%, and
non-durable manufacturing, where it rose 1.9%. Manufacturing productivity is
always more volatile than service sector productivity, but this is a big, big
difference, especially with durable goods. 

Part of that is due to the inherently more unstable nature of manufacturing,
particularly durable goods relative to services, and part is due to different
methods the government uses to do the calculations. However, the same
calculations are done for durables and non-durables. 

This data clearly indicates that non-durable firms should be doing better than
durable goods firms. Stick to firms where people need to buy the stuff on a
regular basis, not things that can easily be put off. For example, stick with
firms like Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG) and Del Monte (NYSE: DLM), not Winnebago
(NYSE: WGO) or Harley Davidson (NYSE: HOG). 

Fifth Third Raising Capital

Earlier today, Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq: FITB) announced the completion of
its $1.0 billion secondary stock offering (early 158 million shares at an
average price of $6.33 per share) as part of the FITB`s commitment to increase
capital by $1.1 billion following the recent "stress test." The proceeds from
this completed stock offering will be available for general corporate purposes.
This will include funding the cash portion of the company's offer to exchange
cash and common shares for Series G convertible preferred depositary shares, as
well as future repayment of preferred shares held by the government. 

This secondary offering largely fulfills FITB`s commitment under the stress
tests' "worst-case scenario." The company also stated it expects that through
this offering and other alternative capital raises, it could general about $2.0
billion for its Tier 1 capital buffer, as well as removing the government's
caveats with respect to the management pay caps.

&lt;p&gt;PALO ALTO, Calif., June 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's
(MSFT.O) chief software architect said on Thursday the profit
margins on providing online services -- broadly known as cloud
computing -- would likely yield a lower profit margin than the
company's existing software business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The margins on services are not like the margins on
software, so it (cloud computing) will increase our profit and
it will increase our revenue, but you won't have that margin,"
said Ray Ozzie on Thursday at a Silicon Valley technology event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ozzie is the main driving force behind the world's largest
software company's gradual move towards a cloud-based approach
to its products. He has been in charge of Microsoft's long-term
technical strategy since co-founder Bill Gates announced he was
stepping down from day-to-day involvement with the company three
years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has made only tentative steps into the cloud arena
so far, but has been investing in data centers to house
customers' data and later this year is expected to unveil its
'Azure' platform, which will allow developers to write
applications to work on Microsoft's cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The margins at the low level, at the Azure level, are going
to be lower than the top level, where you're delivering a
solution or something like Exchange," said Ozzie, referring to
Microsoft's popular e-mail and calendar application. "You're
pricing that solution around a business value more than cost so
the margins are still very, very good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Companies have historically run their software locally, on
servers, but as the Internet has grown in speed and ubiquity,
some are starting to use the cloud to run their applications. In
theory at least, customers save money on hardware and
maintenance while suppliers get a new source of fees by storing
data and providing services online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early pioneers of cloud computing have been Amazon.com Inc
(AMZN.O), Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N),
which may eventually pose a threat to Microsoft, whose software
is still chiefly run on local systems.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jennifer Tan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR, June 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said
on Tuesday it had secured customers in Japan and South Korea
for about 70 percent of liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply from
its multi-billion dollar Gorgon project in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. oil major has a total of seven LNG projects in its
portfolio in various stages of maturity. By 2015, LNG
production is expected to more than triple to about 300,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron has signed non-binding heads of agreements with
three utility companies in Japan and GS Caltex in South Korea
for Gorgon," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Approximately 70 percent of Chevron's LNG off-take is
expected to be purchased through these agreements," a company
spokeswoman said in an emailed response to questions from
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron won conditional approval in late April from the
Environmental Protection Agency of Western Australia to
increase the size of Gorgon to 15 million tonnes per annum
(mtpa), after having received approval for a 10 mtpa project in
2007. [ID:nSYD355497]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, India's Petronet LNG (PLNG.BO) inked an
agreement with ExxonMobil (XOM.N) to buy 1.5 million tonnes a
year of Gorgon LNG for its terminal in Kochi in southern India.
[ID:nDEL309556]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The formal sale pact would be signed this month with
ExxonMobil's subsidiaries, Australia Resources Co Pty Ltd and
Mobil Exploration  Producing Australia Pty Ltd, and Petronet
said there was potential for additional supplies for the
20-year deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has a 50 percent stake in the project, while
ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) own 25 percent each.
The three companies are marketing their share of gas
separately.

&lt;p&gt;Some of the banks expected to get the green light to pay back TARP money include Goldman, JPMorgan, American Express Co, Morgan Stanley, State Street Corp and U.S. Bancorp, the New York Post said on Monday, without saying where it got the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These banks, as well as BBT Corp, have already signaled their intent to repay TARP money to the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later this week, the government is expected to disclose which of the 19 largest U.S. banks will be allowed to repay some or all of their TARP money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks recently underwent "stress tests" of their ability to handle a deep recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators ordered 10 of the banks to raise more capital.

* ExxonMobil to apply deepwater expertise in new Black Sea venture

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) today announced the Turkish government
approved an agreement between its affiliate ExxonMobil Exploration and
Production Turkey B.V. and the Turkish national oil company T&#252;rkiye Petrolleri
Anonim Ortakl&#305;&#287;&#305; (TPAO) to explore two deepwater blocks in the Black Sea. 

ExxonMobil and TPAO signed the agreement in November 2008 to jointly explore
deepwater prospects in the Samsun Block, which measures approximately 2 million
acres (8,500 square kilometers) and the eastern portion of 3921 Block, which
measures approximately 5 million acres (21,000 square kilometers). Water depths
reach an approximate 6,500 feet (2,000 meters). 

ExxonMobil will be the operator and will earn a 50% interest in both offshore
blocks. TPAO and ExxonMobil intend to collaborate and utilize the skills and
operational abilities of both companies during all phases of the block
evaluation and potential development. 

"We wish to thank the Turkish government for this approval and with it we look
forward to exploring with TPAO the hydrocarbon potential of these deepwater
Black Sea blocks," said Russ Bellis, Exploration Director, ExxonMobil
International Limited. "We are bringing our global deepwater experience to this
prospective unexplored area." 

TPAO President and CEO Mehmet Uysal said, "TPAO and ExxonMobil will be working
closely together to assess the potential of these blocks. I believe that we will
find commercial quantities of oil and gas." 

In December 2008 ExxonMobil announced that it had further expanded its presence
in the Black Sea by signing an agreement with Petrom to explore deepwater
portions of the Neptun Block offshore Romania. ExxonMobil affiliates are
currently exploring for hydrocarbons in deepwater areas offshore Angola, Brazil,
Canada, Greenland, Indonesia, Ireland, Libya, Nigeria, The Philippines and the
United States, among others.

resource recoveries and project plans and schedules, could differ materially due
to changes in market conditions affecting the oil and gas industry or long-term
oil and gas price levels; political or regulatory developments; the results of
exploration; the outcome of commercial negotiations; and other factors discussed
under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in the Investor Information

About TPAO

TPAO, Turkey's sole national oil company, was founded in 1954. Since its
foundation, TPAO has made pioneering efforts in all branches of petroleum
industry and implemented significant and strategic investments successfully. In
addition to vast onshore and shallow water operating experience in Turkey, TPAO
has interests in various projects in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Libya. In 2004,
TPAO announced its objective to meet Turkey's increasing oil and natural gas
demand through domestic and international exploration and production projects.
Since then TPAO has significantly increased its domestic investments by setting
a new exploration strategy by extending its activities to unexplored basins of
Turkey, especially offshore.

About ExxonMobil and its presence in Turkey

ExxonMobil affiliates or predecessor companies have been operating in Turkey for
more than 100 years. In 1905, the Vacuum Oil Company began selling lubricating
oils in Turkey and in 1911 the Standard Oil Company of New York began selling
kerosene. Mobil Oil became the first international company to receive an oil
exploration permit in Turkey when the Grand National Assembly (Meclis) passed
the new Petroleum Law in 1954. Today, ExxonMobil`s presence in Turkey includes a
lubes blending plant in Istanbul as well as finished lubricants, aviation fuels
and marine fuels sales in important markets throughout the country. 

ExxonMobil is a global company present in most countries of the world with an
industry-leading inventory of discovered oil and gas resources, a strong
portfolio of proprietary technology and substantial growth opportunities. The
corporation`s resource base is 72 billion oil-equivalent barrels and it has more
than 100 major new development projects and global gas and power marketing
activities underway. Global production of oil and gas extends from Australia to
Alaska and from West Texas to West Africa. The company is the world's largest
non-governmental marketer of equity natural gas, the largest global refiner,
manufacturer of lube basestocks, and supplier and marketer of petroleum
products, and one of the world`s leading manufacturers of a wide range of
petrochemicals and specialty chemical products.

&lt;p&gt;Report provides companies a framework to effectively build and manage an HSA
program
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan today issued a report titled "Best Practices for Implementing a
Health Savings Account (HSA) Program" providing a step-by-step guide for
employers who want to offer an HSA program to employees. 

Many companies are finding that the addition of an HSA option to their
healthcare benefits menu presents a practical solution to the health insurance
challenges they face. The adoption of HSAs has seen significant growth since
they were created in 2004. By year-end 2008, there were an estimated three
million HSAs with deposits of over $3 billion - and the number of HSA accounts
is expected to quadruple by 2012, according to Celent. 

"HSAs provide an affordable health insurance option and continue to grow in
popularity," said David Josephs, head of consumer-directed healthcare at J.P.
Morgan. "This report shares the lessons learned in areas that have resulted in
successful programs for many of our clients and provides a framework to ensure
that a company`s benefit offering is competitive in the marketplace and offers
the best value for both the employees and the company. 

J.P. Morgan was one of the first banks to offer HSAs and has extensive
experience in the consumer-directed healthcare industry. The bank administers
HSA programs for nearly 10,000 companies and provides HSA cash and investment
services for hundreds of thousands of individuals nationwide. 

The best practices presented in this report reflect J.P. Morgan`s experience
meeting the needs of companies representing the full spectrum of American
employers - ranging from small companies with two employees to large firms with
more than 100,000 employees. 

Some of the best practices highlighted in the report include the following:

* Designing an HSA program to meet short and long-term enrollment goals.
Companies that are successful at introducing an HSA plan do so by designing a
plan that is simple to understand and easy to use; usually provides 100%
coverage for preventive care services; offers a line of credit to cover any
unexpected medical expenses; generally contributes to employee HSAs; and
promotes employee education on healthcare costs. 
* Selecting an HSA administrator with requisite expertise and core capabilities
to meet a firm`s and its employees` needs. Companies should choose an HSA
administrator that offers a simple enrollment process with customizable employee
communication and enrollment materials; provides comprehensive reporting with a
dedicated support team; and has a strong reputation and balance sheet to depend
on during difficult times. 
* Effectively communicating the benefits of an HSA to employees. Companies have
learned that a well thought-out, staged employee communications plan rolled out
over several months in advance of the actual enrollment period allows employees
time to fully understand the new benefits - and reduces confusion during the
busy enrollment season. Professionally developed, extensive communication tools
can answer questions and address concerns about HSAs.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Raising MannKind to Hold

We believe that MannKind`s (Nasdaq: MNKD) Afresa offers distinct advantages over
traditional needle-based insulin therapy. The key advantage is the convenience
of an inhaled delivery. Diabetes patients using Afresa will no longer have to
worry about a needle injection. Along with convenience, Afresa offers rapid
uptake into the bloodstream. MannKind has developed Afresa to produce a profile
of insulin levels in the bloodstream that approximates the first-phase insulin
spike normally seen in healthy individuals following the beginning of a meal. 

Elimination of competition may help Afresa's sales ramp 

The diabetes market is perhaps one of the largest opportunities in
pharmaceuticals. At present, traditional needle-based insulin therapy dominates
the market. 

Competition in the inhaled insulin field, which was crowded with late-stage
drugs under development at large-cap pharmaceutical companies one year ago, is
virtually nil now. 

The change in the competitive landscape began with the withdrawal of Exubera
from the market by Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE: PFE) in October 2007. This was followed
by the discontinuation of the AER-X program by Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) in
January 2008 and then the announcement by Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) in March 2008 to
discontinue the development of the AIR Insulin (co-developed with Alkermes
Pharmaceuticals [Nasdaq: ALKS]). While Pfizer blamed the pullout on poor sales
of the drug (only $12 million in the first three quarters of 2007), others cited
the lack of confidence in the regulatory environment and market prospect for an
inhaled insulin product.

&lt;p&gt;Using the Entire Portfolio of SPSS Predictive Analytics Software, Procter &amp;
Gamble Puts the Consumer First
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is among the growing number of consumer
companies turning to Predictive Analytics to gain a complete view of customer

Pampers&#174;, Pantene&#174; and Crest&#174; products, is a pioneer in the use of Predictive
Analytics. Having relied on SPSS Predictive Analytics Software for nearly a
decade, P has gained a deep understanding of consumers and market trends.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is
expected to say Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), JPMorgan Chase
 Co (JPM.N) and perhaps a few other banks will be allowed to
repay money to the Troubled Asset Relief Program, The Wall
Street Journal said on Monday, without saying where it got the
information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Some of the banks expected to get the green light to pay
back TARP money include Goldman, JPMorgan, American Express Co
(AXP.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), State Street Corp (STT.N) and
U.S. Bancorp (USB.N), the New York Post said on Monday, without
saying where it got the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These banks, as well as BBT Corp (BBT.N), have already
signaled their intent to repay TARP money to the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later this week, the government is expected to disclose
which of the 19 largest U.S. banks will be allowed to repay
some or all of their TARP money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The banks recently underwent "stress tests" of their
ability to handle a deep recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulators ordered 10 of the banks to raise more capital.
Among the banks mentioned above, only Morgan Stanley had a
shortfall, and that bank said it had since more than filled it.
Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) also had no shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monday is the deadline for regulators to approve

&lt;p&gt;
HARTFORD, Conn., June 8, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- After only 40 minutes of
deliberations, a Connecticut Superior Court jury in Willimantic, Conn. recently
returned a verdict in favor of the defendant, the Exxon Mobil Corporation
(ExxonMobil). The law firm of Shipman &amp; Goodwin LLP represented ExxonMobil.

The June 2, 2009 decision was the culmination of a three-day trial that involved
a claim by the plaintiff, Janet Dilisio of Killeen, Tx., that ExxonMobil was at
fault for a January 22, 2006 fall she had at a highway gas station. The property
on I-395 South in Plainfield, Conn. is owned by the Connecticut State Department
of Transportation (DOT) and is leased by ExxonMobil. The trial judge was Michael
Riley.

In 2007, Dilisio, who was a Nashua, NH resident at the time of the incident,
filed a lawsuit against both the DOT and ExxonMobil seeking compensation for
medical bills, lost wages, and past and future pain and suffering. However, one
week before the trial began, Ms. Dilisio's attorneys, the law firm of Faulkner
and Boyce, withdrew her claim against the DOT, charging that ExxonMobil alone
had control over the area at issue and therefore was solely responsible for the
accident and all reparations.

"This is one of the few cases in the U.S. where a jury has decided that a
commercial tenant, which operates a facility on the premises where a defect
existed, was not found to be in control of the area," explains Atty. Robert R.
Simpson of Shipman &amp; Goodwin LLP, the lead trial attorney for ExxonMobil.

"What is particularly interesting is that the plaintiff apparently thought she
had a better chance of winning financial retribution if a major corporation was
solely to blame, even though ExxonMobil did not own the property and was not in
control of the area," says Atty. Simpson. "It is significant that after
listening to all of the testimony and reviewing the operative lease, the jury
decided the case on its merits and did not grant the plaintiff the six-figure
award she was seeking."

During the trial, Atty. Simpson and ExxonMobil raised serious questions about
how the fall occurred, pointing out that the plaintiff and her husband testified
they were prepared to bring a lawsuit from the moment she fell. There also were
inconsistencies in Ms. Dilisio's story about her fall. The issue of possible
negligence was not addressed because it was decided that ExxonMobil did not
control the premises.

In addition, it was established in court that the DOT was clearly in control of
the property. Two months after the alleged fall, the DOT repaired the area in
question. Rather than being an absentee landlord, it was shown that the DOT
inspected the gas station property at least two to four times a month and
prepared a repair task sheet for ExxonMobil during each inspection. The DOT also
handled all landscaping and snowplowing of the property.

On June 2, the jury received the case at 4:05 p.m. They were asked to determine
"whether the plaintiff proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the
ExxonMobil had control over the area at issue." At 4:45 p.m., they delivered
their answer, "No" and entered a verdict for the defendant.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Opponents of a new hydrogen plant under construction at Chevron Corp's San Francisco Bay-area refinery in Richmond, California, plan to ask a California judge to stop the project because of a flawed environmental impact report, an attorney said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have a good case for requesting the permits for the project be withdrawn," said Will Rostov of Earthjustice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Contra Costa County Judge Barbara Zuniga agreed with Earthjustice and two community groups that the project's environmental impact report failed to depict how pollution from the refinery might be changed by the project and provide a greenhouse gas mitigation plan as required by California law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Zuniga did not say whether her ruling meant permits based on the report and authorizing construction of the hydrogen plant, which began in September, along with a cogeneration unit would have to be withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's up to the judge to determine what happens next," said Richmond City Attorney Randy Riddle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Richmond City Council granted the permits last summer after a contentious debate over the $1-billion project. Opponents believe the hydrogen plant will allow the refinery to run heavier grades of crude oil, which they say contain higher amounts of pollutants like mercury and selenium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokesman said the company believed the project had been properly approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are reviewing the specifics of the decision and then will determine a course of action in consultation with the City of Richmond," said Chevron's Brent Tippen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuniga has not set a date to issue future rulings in the case, Rostov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has said the new units are needed to replace outdated equipment and to make the refinery more competitive in today's markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Militants say oil pumping station damaged * Unclear if any Nigerian oil output affected    (Adds details, background) By Nick Tattersall LAGOS, June 10 (Reuters) - Nigeria's main militant group said on Wednesday it had sabotaged a Chevron (CVX.N)-operated oil pumping station in the southern Delta state, the second attack against the U.S. energy company in two weeks. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), responsible for attacks that have shut one-fifth of Nigeria's oil output in the last three years, said it attacked the Otunana pumping station late on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear if any oil production in the OPEC member country was affected. The Niger Delta is the heartland of Africa's biggest oil and gas industry. A major 'cordon and search' operation by MEND commenced today ... with devastating effects on the heavily fortified Chevron Otunana flow station, the group said in a statement sent by email. It was not possible to independently verify MEND's statement. No comment was immediately available from the Nigerian military or Chevron officials. MEND  declared an all-out war against the military last month and sabotaged a Chevron pipeline that caused the shutdown of 100,000 barrels per day. The militant attacks followed last month's launch of the military's biggest offensive in years against Niger Delta gunmen. Security forces bombarded militant camps from the air and sea and sent three battalions of troops to hunt down rebels believed to have fled into surrounding communities. MEND says it is fighting for a fairer share of the natural resources in the Niger Delta, but criminal gangs involved in industrial-scale theft of crude oil and kidnapping for ransom are profiting from the insecurity. MEND, a loose coalition of militant factions, promised on Tuesday for the second time in 10 days to release a British oil worker held hostage in the Niger Delta for the past nine months. The group has said several times in the past that it would release Matthew Maguire, who was seized on Sept. 9, but he remains captive.

are "pleased with the direction of ABC and their ability to

last fall, and Staggs said in May that those conditions had
continued in the current quarter. Broadcast's ad-supported
business model is under pressure from newer forms of online
entertainment that are pulling away its audience, and media
experts forecast ad sales to be down by around 15 percent
during this year's upfront market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked about potential cuts at Disney Studios, which has had
three consecutive quarters of earnings declines, partly on
comparisons to previous year hits and on slowing DVD sales,
Staggs said the company would stick with its approach of
producing fewer big-event films aimed at families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That is going to continue to be our focus," Staggs said.
"I feel confident that is the right strategy for that
business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High definition technology could pave the way to growth for
the studio as more consumers buy high definition DVD players
and pay higher prices for Blu-ray discs with enhanced features,
Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through its partnerships with online distributors like Hulu
and iTunes, Disney will continue to experiment with release
windows and pricing "to make sure we are supporting the great
value that multichannel providers offer," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Interactive Media Group will spend about $30 million
more than the $170 million it invested last year to grow its
video game offerings, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That will take some time to reach fruition," Staggs said,
adding that he was "studiously avoiding saying when that will
be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Disney closed unchanged on Tuesday at $25.33 on

Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said on Tuesday the company

&lt;p&gt; (Refiled to fix typographical error in "Mexico" in first
paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, June 9 (Reuters) - Mexico's top broadcaster,
Televisa (TLVACPO.MX), and its U.S. licensee Univision returned
to federal court in Los Angeles on Tuesday to litigate which
has rights to post Televisa-made programs on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies earlier this year settled a long-running
lawsuit over royalties that Univision owed to Televisa as part
of the 25-year Program Licensing Agreement (PLA) signed in
1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The settlement did not, however, resolve a dispute over
original contract language written before the Internet's
capabilities were fully known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Univision contends that Televisa ceded to Univision the
exclusive right to broadcast programs into its territories by
"all electronic forms or other means now known or hereafter
developed of transmission and retransmission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa believes the PLA gives Univision rights only to
distribute programs on its broadcast network, and not on the
Internet, which it considers a separate "network," according to
testimony on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first witness in the bench trial, held before a judge,
was former Univision Chairman and Chief Executive Jerry
Perenchio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perenchio, 78, appeared via videotaped deposition because
of ill health, Univision attorneys said on Tuesday. He sold
Univision to a private investor group in 2006 but retained a
stake in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his testimony, Perenchio described a decades-long
conflict with Televisa to protect the U.S. network's exclusive
broadcast rights, starting with Televisa's attempt under late
boss Emilio Azcarraga Milmo's to carve out an exception for
satellite transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S.-born Azcarraga Milmo, known as "The Tiger" for his
aggressive business tactics, was one of Mexico's leading
businessmen who enjoyed for decades of a comfortable monopoly
in the country's television market helped by his top political
connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The signatures were barely dry before the fireworks
started," Perenchio said of the 1992 PLA agreement that sealed
the partnership between Televisa, Univision and Venevision,
Venezuela's leading private television company run by the
Cisneros family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Univision's exclusive right to the U.S. markets in the
25-year contract term was "highly important," and "there would
be no deal without it," Perenchio testified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The conflict escalated after Azcarraga Milmo died in 1997
and his son, Emilio Azcarraga Jean, took over the company,
Perenchio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They never liked it ... they never thought it was fair to
Televisa," he said of the PLA. "They took the position that
they had rights for their programming for the Internet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies exchanged a series of letters but
struggled to come up with a viable compromise, Perenchio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "One of our greatest fears is if we loose the noose,
Televisa will enter the U.S. market with some or all of its
programming and destroy or severely wound Univision," Perenchio
wrote in a 1999 letter to Azcarraga Jean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He acknowledged that a 2001 amendment to the PLA, in which
he did not participate, changed language that pertained to
retransmission rights that Televisa retained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither company has attempted to post full-length episodes
of the Televisa shows on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bench trial is expected to conclude on Friday. A
decision is not expected immediately, lawyers for both sides
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the settlement of the main dispute in January,
Univision paid $65 million per year worth of advertising from
privately held Univision from 2009 to 2017, and signed an
amended PLA giving Televisa royalty payments for more types of
programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Televisa S.A. and Grupo Televisa S.A. vs.
Univision Communications, Case No. 05-3444, in U.S. District
Court in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Gina Keating; Editing by Richard Chang)

&lt;p&gt;Users Vulnerable to Online Attacks When Viewing Infected URLs
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Core Security Technologies, provider of CORE IMPACT, the most comprehensive
product for proactive enterprise security testing, today issued an advisory
disclosing a vulnerability that could affect millions of individuals and
businesses using Microsoft`s Internet Explorer web browsing software. 

A vulnerability researcher working in CoreLabs, the research arm of Core
Security Technologies, discovered that in some cases when affected versions of
Internet Explorer are used to access an external website, the browser does not
apply the appropriate security permissions, thus allowing unknown sites or
applications to be treated as trusted URLs. This could potentially lead to
malicious or infected URLs remotely executing scripts on systems running the
affected versions of IE, via either drive-by or downloaded attacks, without the
end user`s knowledge or permission to do so. 

"This is a tangible threat to millions of individuals and organizations that use
Internet Explorer to browse the web and the discovery of this vulnerability in
IE highlights the reality that no vendor is immune to the perils of client
application security," said Ivan Arce, CTO of Core Security Technologies. "This
issue also illustrates the fact that a group of seemingly unrelated weaknesses
can be combined to construct attacks that are effective beyond the narrow scope
of exploiting just a single bug. Likewise, the available workarounds show that,
beyond simply deploying patches, a combination of security defenses and
mitigation strategies can effectively prevent attacks." 

Vulnerability Specifics

CoreLabs initially discovered the vulnerability in Internet Explorer as part of
its ongoing research efforts. The flaw specifically affects IE versions 5, 6 and
7 under Windows 2000/2003/XP and Vista. Although it is present, the
vulnerability cannot be exploited when a vulnerable version of IE is used in a
security-enhanced mode called "Protected Mode." Protected Mode is enabled by
default in IE 7 for Vista. At the time of the original report, Internet Explorer
8, then in the pre-release Beta phase, was also found to be vulnerable. However,
the problem was fixed in the commercially released version of IE 8 and this
version is therefore no longer vulnerable. 

Internet Explorer utilizes a feature known as "URL Security Zones," which
defines a set of privileges for websites and applications depending on their
apparent level of trustworthiness. IE zone settings include Internet Zone, Local
Intranet Zone, Trusted Sites Zone (for URLs that are considered to be more
reputable or trustworthy), Restricted Sites Zone (for websites that contain
content that can cause or have previously caused problems) and Local Machine
Zone (an unrestricted special zone that is used only by internal components of
the operating system). 

Internet Explorer users can assign specific websites or domains to any of the
available zones except for the Local Machine Zone. The ability for a given
website to perform security-sensitive operations on the web browser is
determined by the Security Level of the zone to which the site was assigned.
Each zone can be set to one Security Level out of three available pre-sets
(Medium, Medium-High or High) or one customized by the user or system
administrator. 

By default, all websites that are determined not to be on the Intranet Zone and
are not explicitly listed in the Restricted Sites or Trusted Sites Zones are
assigned to the Internet Zone, which has a default Security Level setting of
Medium-High. Thus, for most IE users the security-sensitive actions that a
browser can perform while connected to a site on the Internet are those allowed
by the security policy settings of the Internet Zone at the Medium-High Security
Level. 

A vulnerability that allows a website to perform security-sensitive actions that
are disallowed by the Security Level of a given Security Zone is known as a
Security Zone bypass or Security Zone elevation vulnerability and may lead to
breach of other security policies, for example circumventing same domain policy
restrictions. 

Based on CoreLabs research, in some cases a malicious website may leverage a
vulnerability and a combination of security weaknesses in the affected versions
of Internet Explorer to bypass Security Zone restrictions by first serving HTML
content that IE will cache in known locations in the user`s computer, and then
redirecting the browser to load it from the local file system and render it as
HTML. In this manner, arbitrary content provided by a potentially malicious site
would able to run scripting code or ActiveX controls on vulnerable browsers and
gain read access to any file stored in the user`s computer. 

Exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to retrieve security and
privacy-sensitive data such as authentication credentials, HTTP cookies and
other details of HTTP session state, as well as the contents of any local file.
To successfully execute an attack, the attacker must either obtain or guess the
username of the user visiting the website that delivers the exploit in order to
predict the exact pathname to the cached content. In that context, lack of
egress filtering for SMB connections, username leakage flaws or simple brute
forcing of known usernames can facilitate attacks. 

Active exploitation can be prevented by using several workarounds, which include
setting the Security Level for the Internet Zone (and if necessary the Intranet
Zone) to High; disabling ActiveX controls and scripting for the Internet Zone;
using IE`s Protocol Lockdown feature control to restrict use of the "file:"
protocol; or running IE in Protected Mode when available. These workarounds may
limit or disrupt functionality of certain web applications that rely on
security-sensitive actions to run properly. 

The vulnerability is a variation of a similar issue catalogued by Microsoft as
an Outlook Express/Windows Mail problem that involved serving HTML in the
contents of HTTP cookies and remotely forcing IE to render it, which Core

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft issues security patches for record 31 flaws&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Affects Windows, Office, data center programs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, June 9 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) issued
software to fix 31 security flaws in its programs, a single-day
record for the company whose products are targeted by hackers
because they sit on the vast majority of computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The patches repair vulnerabilities in Windows, Office and
Internet Explorer, as well as key pieces of software that
businesses use in their data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once hackers are alerted to such vulnerabilities, they
quickly start developing malicious software to exploit them.
Such programs can be used for cybercrimes such as identity
theft, sending spam and taking control of computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alerting hackers to the flaws presents a challenge for
businesses as they need time to test the patches before
installing them on their computer systems. They need to make
sure that the new software does not interfere with existing
programs because patches can sometimes cause systems to crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Patching will be especially challenging for enterprises,"
said Dave Marcus, a senior researcher with McAfee Inc MFE.N,
the world's No. 2 security software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will be easier for consumers to address the threat as
they can can quickly download patches over the Internet, easily
eliminating their exposure to attack. Such patches rarely cause
stand-alone PCs to crash.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM said on Tuesday it is seeking to bolster sales partnerships to boost revenue in a weak economy and compete more effectively with other large technology firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp, which sells computer servers as well as software and technology services, said that more cooperation among equipment and software vendors can help corporate customers invest in technology more efficiently, such as by preventing the duplication of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivals like computing and software maker Hewlett-Packard Co and network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc have also announced myriad partnerships in recent months, from licensing deals to stronger sales tie-ups to offer clients more comprehensive, "one-stop shop"-like services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clients' needs are clear: save money, preserve capital and reduce costs," Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano said in a speech to the company's business partners. "With your partnership, we help them do that ... You are critical to IBM's success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 30 percent of IBM's sales go through its 100,000 channel partners, who help sell the company's hardware and software. In many cases the relationship is mutual, with IBM helping to sell its partners' products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich Hume, general manager of IBM's global business partner organization, said the company is seeking to expand such partnerships. He also announced on Tuesday that IBM is launching new social networking sites so partners can discuss and develop better products for their mutual customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has been changing its policy to give partners more incentives to help sell its products. This year, it has allowed partners who sell IBM products to earn rewards right away, rather than after meeting specific sales targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also expanded its financing options through the company's global leasing and financing unit. Hume said such incentives benefit partners which earn finders' fees by selling IBM products to new customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of this has been primarily in response to the fact that things are slow. We have to have our customers continue to invest in IBM," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources told Reuters late last month that IBM was in talks with network equipment maker Juniper Networks Inc for an OEM or original equipment manufacturer deal, in which IBM would resell Juniper equipment as part of its own family of products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has already announced an OEM deal with Brocade Communications Systems Inc, which makes data storage and other network equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO (Reuters) - VisaNet, the Brazilian affiliate of credit card network Visa Inc (V.N), said on Tuesday its initial public offering may reach 7.2 billion reais ($3.66 billion), the biggest stock sale in the country in almost a year.&lt;/p&gt;

Sales have dwindled since the turmoil in global markets worsened late last year, and IPO volumes in Brazil had their worst start of the year since at least 2002, according to government data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial sales of notes, stocks and asset-backed securities plummeted 54 percent to 9.49 billion reais in the first five months of the year, the least in four years, according to data released on Brazil's securities regulatory agency's web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VisaNet would be the first company to go public in Brazil since June 2008, when energy company OGX Petroleo e Gas (OGXP3.SA) sold shares in an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offering would also be the second in Brazil this year, after Citigroup's (C.N) sale of a stake in its credit card affiliate Redecard RDCD3.SA, which was already publicly listed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VisaNet is controlled by Bradesco (BBDC4.SA), with a 39 percent stake; Banco do Brasil (BBAS3.SA), with 31 percent; and Spain's Santander (SAN.MC), with 14 percent. Visa Inc unit Visa International is also part of the control group with a 10 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bradesco, Banco do Brasil, Visa Inc, Santander and the Brazilian unit of HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) would be among the VisaNet shareholders selling stock in the credit card processing company and would receive proceeds from the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VisaNet stock would trade under the symbol VNET3.SA  VNET3.SA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=1.966 reais)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elzio Barreto and Guillermo Parra-Bernal, editing by Gerald E.

in an announcement published in Valor Economico newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock sale would be Brazil's biggest since a 19.43
billion real offering by giant miner Vale (VALE5.SA) last
July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VisaNet's offering could rise to 9.7 billion reais if
underwriters exercised a so-called greenshoe option to sell
additional shares to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brazil's market for stock offerings was among the hottest
in the world for years, with sales reaching successive records
between 2004 and 2007. Sales have dwindled since the turmoil in
global markets worsened late last year, and IPO volumes in
Brazil had their worst start of the year since at least 2002,
according to government data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Initial sales of notes, stocks and asset-backed securities
plummeted 54 percent to 9.49 billion reais in the first five
months of the year, the least in four years, according to data
released on Brazil's securities regulatory agency's web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VisaNet would be the first company to go public in Brazil
since June 2008, when energy company OGX Petroleo e Gas
(OGXP3.SA) sold shares in an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The offering would also be the second in Brazil this year,
after Citigroup's (C.N) sale of a stake in its credit card
affiliate Redecard RDCD3.SA, which was already publicly
listed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VisaNet is controlled by Bradesco (BBDC4.SA), with a 39
percent stake; Banco do Brasil (BBAS3.SA), with 31 percent; and
Spain's Santander (SAN.MC), with 14 percent. Visa Inc unit Visa
International is also part of the control group with a 10
percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bradesco, Banco do Brasil, Visa Inc, Santander and the
Brazilian unit of HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) would be among the
VisaNet shareholders selling stock in the credit card
processing company and would receive proceeds from the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VisaNet stock would trade under the symbol VNET3.SA

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Credits Palo Alto With WebDAV IIS Vulnerability, Another In a Steady
Stream of Discoveries From Palo Alto Networks
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Palo Alto Networks, the leader in next-generation firewalls, today announced
that its Threat Research Team has discovered a vulnerability rated as
"important" in severity in Microsoft`s Patch Tuesday security bulletin published
today. 

Microsoft credits Palo Alto Networks` Threat Research Team for finding an
elevation of privilege vulnerability (CVE: CVE-2009-1122) that could allow an
attacker to bypass an authentication requirement to access content on a
Microsoft IIS Server. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on
the URL in a WebDAV request, leading to a bypass on IIS directories. 

Palo Alto Networks` next-generation firewalls are unique in the industry in
their ability to see and control applications, users and content - not just
ports, IP addresses and packets. Traditional port-blocking firewalls do not have
the content intelligence to identify a possible exploit such as this, which can
allow an attacker to bypass authentication controls on private IIS directories
using a specially crafted requested URL in the WebDAV extension. 

The Palo Alto Networks Threat Research Team is active in the research community,
aggressively pursuing both new vulnerability research and mitigation of all
types of threats. Leveraging its expert understanding of today`s applications,
threats and how vulnerabilities get exploited, the team is a consistent
contributor in support of Microsoft`s Patch Tuesday releases. 

Palo Alto Networks` next-generation firewalls are the industry`s most powerful
firewall products, enabling enterprises to see and control applications, users
and content - not just ports, IP addresses and packets. This is a critical need
for enterprises` management of risk as industry studies continue to show
enterprises lack visibility into and control of application traffic due to the
outdated functionality of legacy security technology.1 Palo Alto Networks`
next-generation firewalls enable enterprises to create granular,
business-relevant security policies and safely control new enterprise and
consumer applications as business enablers instead of the block-or-nothing
approach offered by traditional port-blocking firewalls. 

About Palo Alto Networks

Palo Alto Networks is the leader in next-generation firewalls, enabling
unprecedented visibility and granular policy control of applications and content
- by user, not just IP address - at up to 10Gbps with no performance
degradation. Based on patent-pending App-ID technology, Palo Alto Networks
firewalls accurately identify and control applications - regardless of port,
protocol, evasive tactic or SSL encryption - and scan content to stop threats
and prevent data leakage. Enterprises can for the first time embrace Web 2.0 and
maintain complete visibility and control, while significantly reducing total
cost of ownership through device consolidation. For more information, please

&lt;p&gt; * IBM wins $594 mln 5-yr deal with Telstra&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Deal extends previous contract, adds more automation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) said on Tuesday
that it had won a $594 million, five-year contract with
Australian telecommunications provider Telstra (TLS.AX) to
provide more automation and remote management of its technology
systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Computer hardware, software and IT services company
International Business Systems Corp already helps manage
Telstra's servers and software. The deal will extend that
relationship through 2014 and include new services to help
Telstra move to a more cost-efficient model, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the past decade, IBM has shifted its focus to software
and services from increasingly commoditized hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's first-quarter revenue fell 11 percent, or
around 4 percent at constant currency, from a year earlier, but
analysts have said IBM would have fared worse without its focus
on software and cost-cutting services like technology
consulting and outsourcing.

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - The global crisis means China and other emerging market powers will overtake developed world economies even more quickly, the Goldman Sachs economist who coined the BRIC concept told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Chief Economist Jim O'Neill said China's economy was now likely to overtake the United States in less than 20 years time and the four BRIC countries combined -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- could dwarf the G7 over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their relative rise appears to be stronger despite the rather pitifully thought out views by some a few months ago that the BRIC 'dream' could be shattered by the crisis," he said in a telephone interview from London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill invented the term BRIC in 2001 when he forecast that Brazil, Russia, India and China would overtake some of the world's top economies in the first half of the 21st century, becoming building blocks of a new world order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We now conceive of China challenging the U.S. for number one slot by 2027 and ... the combined GDP of the four BRICs being potentially bigger than that of the G7 within the next 20 years," he added. "This is around 10 years earlier than when we first looked at the issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is forecasting that the world economy will contract by 1.1 percent this year while BRIC economies will grow by an average of 4.8 percent, O'Neill added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are dominating the world growth picture even more than when the world was booming, and this is despite a revised very weak forecast for Russia in 2009," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China has had a good crisis. In terms of China's role in the world the crisis has arguably been very helpful because it has forced China to realize that the next stage of their development cannot be led by export growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is forecasting Chinese growth of 8.3 percent in 2009 and 10.9 percent in 2010, while it sees the world economy growing by just 3.3 percent next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is predicted to grow at an average rate of 6.3 percent from 2011 to 2050, China 5.2 percent, Brazil 4.3 percent and Russia -- constrained by forecasts of a declining population -- just 2.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRIC POWER?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four BRIC countries have been trying to form a political club to convert their growing economic power into greater geopolitical clout. But is unclear how such different countries will work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India and China will meet in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg on June 16 for the first summit since the international downturn struck their economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Arguably because China is the biggest of the four in terms of its current size and potential, they are the ones who are most disinterested in the BRIC grouping," O'Neill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is primarily Russia, but also Brazil, that is interested in having these get-togethers and meetings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill said BRIC was unlikely to become a powerful political institution on the world stage but could serve a temporary purpose -- to prompt reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think BRIC as an institution is a very useful threat and inter-temporal political grouping to force more realistic change of global institutions," O'Neill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the G8 should be reformed, with China, India and Brazil taking the places of eurozone members Germany, France and Italy, which he said should be represented by the EU and European Central Bank. Russia is already a member of the G8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill said the idea floated by Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of China, to make the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights (SDR) the basis of a new supranational currency was a fascinating idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he thought the idea meant that China would have to allow more convertibility of the yuan and that the idea of including yuan in the SDR in six years' time was conceivable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Tim Pearce)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young`s appointment underscores Microsoft`s relationship with PC Laptops as PC
Laptops sold a higher percentage of computers in 2008 pre-loaded with Microsoft
Windows and Office than any other manufacturer or reseller in North America


SOUTH JORDAN, Utah--(Business Wire)--
PC Laptops today announced that its President and Founder, Dan "The Laptop Man"
Young, has been appointed to Microsoft`s Partner Advisory Council. 

Microsoft has more than 1.4 million partner companies around the world1 that
sell and support Microsoft products. Conversely, PC Laptops is one of fewer than
2,800 Microsoft Gold Certified Partners in the United States2, the highest level
of distinction Microsoft awards to its partners and a position PC Laptops has
held since 2005. 

Microsoft`s Partner Advisory Council is comprised of a select group of key
executives from a diverse range of influential partners around the world, from
computer manufacturers to systems integrators and from software developers to
resellers. As a member of the Microsoft Partner Advisory Council, Young has
become a part of a select group of technology executives who regularly
participate in face-to-face and Web-based meetings with each other and Microsoft
executives to gather and disseminate strategic feedback on Microsoft products,
sales and marketing programs, and future initiatives. The end result is tighter
integration with Microsoft and its partners and better products and customer
services. 

"Dan`s extensive experience in the computer industry makes him a valued member
of the Microsoft Partner Advisory Council," said Megan Both, U.S. OEM Sales
Director. "PC Laptops had the distinction of selling a greater percentage of
computers pre-loaded with Microsoft Windows and Office in 2008 than any other
computer company in North America. Obviously we are very proud to have Dan join
our council board and look forward to the many great ideas he will bring to
product planning at Microsoft." 

Under Young`s direction, PC Laptops now boasts nine retail outlets in Utah and
Nevada, and was included in two consecutive Inc. 500rankings of the fastest
growing companies in the United States. PC Laptops is also a three-time member
of the Utah 100, an annual ranking compiled by the MountainWest Capital Network
of the 100 fastest-growing companies in Utah. 

"Joining the Microsoft Partner Advisory Council gives PC Laptops the ability to
drive great solutions to the customer even faster and allows us to help market
leaders drive new product innovation," Young said. "PC Laptops is now a
contributing part of the research and development team for Microsoft and
provides insights into what customers are looking for. This Council also helps
Microsoft know what to focus on in future developments and how best to
distribute its products to the customers, and I`m honored to be invited to join
Microsoft`s Partner Advisory Council."

Practices in Corporate Responsibility


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) confirmed that it has received permission
today from U.S. regulators to repay in full the $25 billion preferred investment
it accepted through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The company plans
to repay the funds in full and with accrued dividends at a closing time
determined by the U.S. Treasury. 

JPMorgan Chase is included in the first group of institutions granted permission
to repay TARP given its strong financial position and its fulfillment of
conditions outlined recently by the U.S. Federal Reserve. In early May, the
company successfully completed an extensive stress testing program for major
banking institutions, in which the Government reviewed each bank`s capital and
financial strength under various difficult scenarios and determined that
JPMorgan Chase did not need additional capital. 

JPMorgan Chase is committed to maintaining its fortress balance sheet through
these challenging times. Following the repayment, the company`s capital position
is expected to remain extremely strong, with Tier One Capital of approximately
$118 billion, or 9.3%, and Tier One Common of about $93 billion, or 7.3%
anticipated at the conclusion of second quarter 2009. The company also holds
over $28 billion in its allowance for credit losses, and it continues to
generate significant pre-tax, pre-provision earnings from its industry-leading
franchises. 

"Paying back TARP at this time is the right thing for JPMorgan Chase, and it`s
the right thing for our country," said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer. He added, "We feel it`s best for our Government to be able to use these
funds for other critical purposes." Dimon reiterated the company`s "commitment
to continued robust lending and to doing the right thing for the company`s
customers, communities, employees and shareholders." 

JPMorgan Chase also reiterated today its commitment to safe, sound and robust
lending. The company made more than $150 billion of loans in the first quarter
to consumers, small businesses, non-profits, municipalities, corporations and
others, including 4.5 million new loans to individual consumers. The company
plans to help more than 650,000 families avoid foreclosure and stay in their
homes. Going forward, J.P. Morgan Chase plans to build on these efforts -
continuing to provide credit and liquidity to consumers, companies, communities
and non-profits around the world, while maintaining its safe and sound lending
standards. 

JPMorgan Chase also emphasized today its commitment to best practices in
business and corporate responsibility. In addition to safe and sound lending,
other best practices include: 

Building a healthy, vibrant company for the long term: JPMorgan Chase remains
committed to investing in its businesses for the long-term, maintaining
management rigor and discipline, protecting and strengthening its fortress
balance sheet, and continuing to be an employer of choice. It believes that
building a healthy, diverse and vibrant company is the best way to create new
jobs and exciting career opportunities for its employees, as well as to support
local communities in which it operates. 

Commitment to our communities: Last year alone, JPMorgan Chase and its
Foundation made charitable contributions of more than $100 million in markets
across the United States; and over the past five years the firm has given more
than $600 million to 13,500 organizations globally. The company also has 220,000
dedicated employees around the world who are active in the communities they
serve. 

Community development and lending to not-for-profits: JPMorgan Chase is making
millions of loans totaling billions of dollars to consumers for automobiles,
homes and other purchases; and the company is helping small businesses,
non-profits, communities, lower income families and others achieve their goals
through the firm`s safe-and-sound lending efforts. The firm is committed to
community lending and investment, particularly efforts that provide affordable
housing, community development, and access to credit in low- and moderate-income
communities. 

Executive compensation: The company is committed to paying employees based on
long-term, sustained, risk-adjusted performance; paying a significant portion of
compensation in company stock; and requiring senior executives to retain at
least 75% of their equity awards. The company does not provide golden
parachutes, special contracts, change-of-control provisions, or special
retirement plans or severance programs for its senior executives.

&lt;p&gt;Major "No Confidence" Vote By Large Pension Funds
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
A new analysis of shareholder votes at Chevron`s annual meeting in late May
indicates the company`s management suffered a far more serious rebuke over its
growing human rights problems in Ecuador and elsewhere than originally had been
reported, representatives of the Amazon Defense Coalition said today. 

It turns out that one of the resolutions asking for the company to adopt a
"verifiable" human rights policy garnered a whopping $37 billion in voting
shares out of $133 billion outstanding. A second resolution received $33 billion
in voting shares, while a third received $9 billion. 

Company management, led by CEO David O`Reilly, had lobbied fiercely against all
three resolutions. Chevron`s public relations department had touted the results
as a triumph for company management. 

"It is now clear that O`Reilly suffered a major no confidence vote from a large
number of his own shareholders over human rights," said Mitch Anderson, who
monitors Chevron`s human rights record for Amazon Watch, an environmental group
in San Francisco. "These votes are an embarrassing defeat for Chevron and
reinforce the notion the company is falling behind its peers when it comes to
human rights issues." 

"Given the massive number of shares controlled by management, it is extremely
rare to see human rights resolutions opposed by management garner this level of
support," added Dan Orlow, a private American investor who is advising the
Amazonian communities. 

The resolutions stemmed primarily from concern over three human rights problems
- the company`s $27 billion potential environmental liability in Ecuador, its
partnership with the repressive Burmese military government in a pipeline
project, and fallout from the killings of Nigerian villagers who had been
protesting environmental damage caused by Chevron to their homeland. 

At a time when it has launched a major "green" advertising campaign, Chevron has
been battered by negative publicity on human rights issues - particularly in the
Ecuador case, where the matter was featured in May on 60 Minutes. Texaco, bought
by Chevron in 2001, is accused of abandoning more than 900 unlined waste pits
and dumping more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways,
according to indigenous and farmer communities. 

Because shareholder resolutions not supported by management rarely pass - the
recommendation of company management traditionally informs the voting of a
majority of shares - their success is judged on the level of support, which in
this case reached extremely high levels. 

The resolutions, and their final votes, are as follows:

* One resolution, sponsored by all Jesuit provinces in the U.S., requested that
Chevron adopt a comprehensive and verifiable human rights policy. It was
supported by 28% of the votes cast, or approximately $37 billion worth of
Chevron stock. 
* A second resolution requested that Chevron prepare a report on the company`s
criteria for investment in specific countries. It was supported by 25% of the
votes cast, or approximately $33 billion worth of Chevron stock. 
* A third resolution requested that Chevron prepare a report on whether it
complies with host country laws and environmental regulations. This resolution,
against which Chevron engaged in an intensive lobbying campaign, was supported
by 7% of the vote, or approximately $9 billion worth of stock.

All told, more than $79 billion in votes were cast which defied company
management in supporting at least one of the three resolutions. Backing one or
more of the resolutions were several of the nation`s largest public pension
funds, including CalPERS. located in Chevron`s home state of California. 

The Ecuador case, which is being heard in Ecuador at Chevron`s request, is
expected to be decided by the end of the year. Lawyers for the affected
communities have asserted they will attempt to enforce any favorable judgment
immediately in U.S. courts because Chevron has publicly stated that it will
refuse to satisfy any judgment from Ecuador`s judiciary. 

About the Amazon Defense Coalition

The Amazon Defense Coalition represents dozens of rainforest communities and
five indigenous groups that inhabit Ecuador`s Northern Amazon region. The
mission of the Coalition is to protect the environment and secure social justice
through grass roots organizing, political advocacy, and litigation. Two of its
leaders, Luis Yanza and Pablo Fajardo, are the 2008 winners of the prestigious
Goldman Environmental Prize.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said on Tuesday the average daily trading value of its new "dark pool" platform soared 12-fold in the last two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upcoming Axway Webcast on B2B and Managed File Transfer to Feature P


PHOENIX--(Business Wire)--
As part of its ongoing initiative to be a supply chain leader and optimize
trading partner relationships, consumer products leader Procter &amp; Gamble (P)
uses Axway`s business-to-business (B2B) solution for their external managed file
transfers (MFT). The solution delivers secure file transfer with real-time
visibility and control, improving communication within and outside P It also
offers the agility P needs to respond quickly to changes in its supply chain. 

Currently, orders, invoices, shipment notifications and other message files flow
through the Axway gateway daily at P, for a total of more than one million
files per month - all of which must be processed automatically and on time for
business to flow. Transmission failures and system downtime would interrupt
P`s entire supply chain, negatively impacting production and revenue. 

"With Axway we are innovating our supply chain," said P`s Chuck Patterson,
service manager, enterprise application integration. "With our global, diverse
supply chain, it is crucial we have the flexible partner onboarding and
management as well as the reliable and secure file transfer capabilities the
Axway solution provides. A seamless supply chain is good news for P and good
news for our customers and consumers. It`s all about getting our brands to
consumers efficiently and effectively." 

Benefits of the Axway solution include:

* Consolidation of diverse MFT communications into a single framework; 
* Automation of manual processes, creating efficiencies and reducing costs; 
* Easy onboarding of new partners, regardless of technical capabilities,
allowing P to extend its partner community and gain competitive advantage; 
* Peer-to-peer networking with active dual site failover that yields near 100
percent uptime keeping the supply chain in motion; and 
* Visibility, security and management of file transfers creating better overall
communication, guaranteed compliance to standards and lower data risk.

A live Axway-hosted Webcast, "Increased Efficiency, Security and Visibility of
File Transfers at Procter &amp; Gamble," will air Wednesday, June 24 at 1:30 p.m.
EDT. The Webcast will feature representatives of P to talk about the solution,
its implementation and use, and P`s future plans around B2B. Axway solutions
specialists will provide insight into B2B and MFT technologies. 

"Today, smart companies are creating a co-innovation infrastructure to enable
higher-level innovation. P is a leader in this, leveraging their relationships
with partners and other companies, improving success rates with aggressive
sustainability and product innovation goals, while realizing increased cost
savings. We are thrilled to be a part of P`s strategy, and we look forward to
continuing our long-standing relationship with the Company to help bring quality
products to market faster," said Dave Bennett, chief technology officer, Axway.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, June 9 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said on
Tuesday the average daily trading value of its new "dark pool"
platform soared 12-fold in the last two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The New York bank launched its SIGMA X Hong Kong product in
March as a fully licensed alternative trading system that
allowed "dark pool" trading of stocks listed on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said in a statement that the rapid increase is a
sign that investors in Hong Kong-listed securities are turning
to alternative liquidity pools more rapidly than other markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dark pools are trading platforms where buyers and sellers
can anonymously match large blocks of stock, keeping details of
the deals and prices concealed to prevent distorting prices in
the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demand for alternative trading products in markets such as
Japan and Hong Kong has increased amid an influx of global
investors to Asia and other emerging markets in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are seeing diversity not only in the types of clients
participating, but also in the way they are interacting with
SIGMA X," said Goldman Managing Director Shuya Kekke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SIGMA X has been facilitating $10-$30 million of trading
volume on a daily basis in Hong Kong's still nascent
alternative trading markets, outstripping the growth seen in
the United States and Japan in their early stages, Kekke told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Average daily turnover on the Hong Kong exchange rose to
HK$79 billion ($10.1 billion) in January-March from below HK$45
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But dark pool trading is still fledgling in Asia, making up
about 1 percent of the average daily turnover as compared with
more than 10 percent in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulatory inconsistencies across Asia's fragmented markets
are often cited as inhibiting dark pools in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other dark pool operators in Asia include Credit Suisse
(CSGN.VX), Liquidnet, CLSA with its Blocsec, International
Technology Group (ITG.N) and the Instinet unit of Nomura
Holdings (8604.T).

&lt;p&gt; * Zhang retired from Goldman in February&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Zhang joined Shanghai-based Trust Bridge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Trust Bridge runs a $400 million China fund
 (Adds quotes, details and background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By George Chen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, June 9 (Reuters) - Zhang Yi, former co-head of
Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) Asia Special Situations Group (ASSG), has
joined a Chinese private equity firm to run a newly established
$400 million fund, sources told Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zhang, a top China dealmaker, helped Wall Street bank Goldman
to make high-profile investments in China, including meat
processor Shuanghui 000895.SZ and Western Mining (601168.SS),
during his days with Goldman's ASSG in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zhang left Goldman earlier this year and recently joined as a
partner of Shanghai-based Trust Bridge, a fund launched in late
2008 with a focus on high-growth Chinese private enterprises,
said the sources with direct knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He has high influence and good reputation for dealmaking in
China and it is natural for him to follow the industry trend to
join the private equity world after his long-time investment
banking career," said one of the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And of course, it's good for you to join when the market has
not yet fully recovered, which means there are still quite a lot
of opportunities for you," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokesman confirmed to Reuters that Zhang, who
joined Goldman in 1994, retired from the firm in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources declined to be identified as they were not
authorised to speak to the media. Trust Bridge was not
immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EX-GOLDMAN DEALMAKERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trust Bridge was founded by several industry veterans,
including Zhou Donglei, a former senior executive for a leading
Chinese internet firm, Shanda Interactive Entertainment Ltd
SNDA.O, said the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zhou worked for an Asia fund of Japan's Softbank (9984.T) and
Morgan Stanley (MS.N) before she joined Shanda in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of Trust Bridge's investment focuses will be telecoms,
media and technology, including related areas such as
consumer-driven internet business or the new media sector, said
one of the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zhang has become the latest senior Goldman banker to join the
private equity industry, while China remains as a focus for
dealmakers despite the global credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In January, Mount Kellett Capital Management, a private
equity firm run by former Goldman partner Mark McGoldrick - known
as 'Goldfinger' - raised at least $1.5 billion and was on the
hunt for investments, Reuters reported. [ID:nHKG151908]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In November, FountainVest, led by Frank Tang, a former senior
executive for Singapore's Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] who was also
a former senior Goldman banker, said it had raised nearly $1
billion for its first private equity fund. [ID:nSHA102967]

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with comment from Goldman spokesman in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TEL AVIV, June 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) CEO
Lloyd Blankfein said on Wednesday he believed a current upturn
in world markets was probably not a full recovery from crisis
and said he expected a further long recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think it's going to be a long protracted recession," he
told an international regulators conference in Tel Aviv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Addressing a current upturn in markets, he said: "There is
no reason to think this is it ... So many things have to be
sorted out. Why would this be the recovery?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The chances are it's not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After Blankfein's remarks, Goldman spokesman Lucas van
Praag in New York said the CEO was trying to convey that the
markets are evidently much less concerned about the worst-case
scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Lloyd Blankfein's view is that some people might think
we're experiencing a long protracted recession, others might
think we're experiencing a recovery," von Praag said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He believes that it seems a little early to be calling a
recovery but, whether you think we're in a protracted recession
or already experiencing a recovery, the increase in asset
prices reflects the fact that the market has priced out a
worst-case scenario."

&lt;p&gt; * Probe concerns use of pre-installed Microsoft OS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Agency says Microsoft is involved as a third party&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Follows separate probe into Microsoft launched last week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft says hopes to resolve some issues soon
 (Recasts, adds details, further Microsoft comments,
background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Maria Kiselyova&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOSCOW, June 10 (Reuters) - Russia's anti-trust regulator
on Wednesday launched a probe into laptop makers whose machines
contain pre-installed Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) software -- the
second Russian probe to hit the U.S. company in under a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The watchdog said it was investigating Acer Inc (2353.TW),
Asustek (2357.TW), Toshiba Corp (6502.T), Hewlett-Packard
(HPQ.N), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Dell Inc DELL.O
over "coordinated actions" when selling laptops with the
pre-installed Windows operating system, and was treating
Microsoft as a third party in the probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dell declined to comment. Acer, Asustek, Toshiba, HP, and
Samsung could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is already the subject of a probe by the Russian
regulator over whether it broke competition law by holding back
supplies of its Windows XP operating system to the Russian
market. [ID:nL435248]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A statement on the regulator's website about the laptop
maker probe said: "The signs of violation of the anti-monopoly
legislation are seen in coordinated actions by laptop makers
which have been pre-installing an operating system of the one
same producer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Russian agency said that, in most cases, customers were
unable to buy a laptop from the above-mentioned producers
without the pre-installed Windows OS, or were not able to
refuse to use the operating system they were given with the
laptops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft does not disclose the size of its Russian sales
but says they had approached those in European markets in
2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft spokeswoman Marina Levina said the company had
not received any notification from the Federal Anti-monopoly
Service (FAS), the regulator, which will review the case on
July 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top Russian officials, including Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin, have repeatedly criticised the anti-monopoly service for
being a ceremonial agency which lacks real power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, its head, Igor Artemiyev, promised to turn the
agency into a powerful tool to enforce market principles, and
since then has slapped a number of fines on powerful Russian
oil firms for price fixing in the domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Russian probes into Microsoft come on top of ongoing
charges by European regulators that it stymied rivals by tying
the firm's Web browser to its dominant Windows system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Commission said Microsoft shielded its
Internet Explorer browser from head-to-head competition with
rival products by bundling its Internet Explorer with Windows
harming innovation and reducing customer choice.
[ID:nN16306677]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and the EU have been engaged in a running spat
over competition for years, and the U.S. company has been fined
several times for allegedly abusing its 95 percent dominance of
personal computer systems through its Windows software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REVENUE STREAM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bulk of Microsoft's revenue comes from corporate
customers, who make payments on long-term licensing contracts
allowing them to upgrade to the newest versions of its
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In reality, however, most customers do not upgrade
immediately, forcing Microsoft to support older versions of the
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is keen to move customers onto newer versions,
both to save on costs and to get them to adopt newer standards
and systems that lock them into Microsoft's technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has largely stopped selling Windows XP to
retailers and major computer makers, forcing customers into
using its successor, Windows Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At last week's launch of the probe into sales of the XP
operating system, the Russian regulator said it thought
Microsoft violated anti-monopoly legislation by cutting
delivery of Windows XP to Russia both separately and
pre-installed on personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief executive of Microsoft Rus LLC, Nikolai
Pryanishnikov, told Reuters on Wednesday the company hoped to
resolve some of the issues raised in the probe by providing
information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Further, if there is dialogue and some solutions are
required, we will cooperate and meet all demands, and continue
to work in Russia for the good of consumers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said in a separate comment the Windows XP OS was
still available to Russian customers and many PC manufacturers
and the company and its partners would continue to offer
technical support for Windows XP until 2014.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is taking much more trading risk than rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N), and some analysts wonder if the largest investment bank could be making itself vulnerable to another downturn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman's supporters say the bank is keeping to a strategy that served it well during the financial meltdown: fund itself in bond markets and trade actively, both for clients and its own account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman is also forgoing many of the safety measures that competitors like Morgan Stanley have embraced, such as building businesses less dependent on trading activity and finding reliable sources of cheap deposit funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the economy deteriorates and bond markets seize up again, the bank could find itself posting big losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no question, Goldman is taking a risk," said James Ellman, president of hedge fund Seacliff Capital in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight months ago, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were in a full-blown crisis, paralyzed by the credit crunch and watching some of their long-time competitors, like Lehman Brothers, disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their share prices sinking and investor confidence depleted, both banks in September agreed to become bank holding companies and each accepted $10 billion of bailout funds from the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the months after those dark hours, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive John Mack began rethinking the bank's business. He encouraged the bank's retail brokers to sell certificates of deposit to decrease Morgan Stanley's reliance on fickle bond markets for funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mack also began thinking about acquisitions, ultimately deciding to buy a controlling stake in Citigroup Inc's (C.N) Smith Barney retail brokerage business. That deal will allow Morgan Stanley to gather more deposits and reduce its reliance on sales and trading businesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Morgan Stanley experienced a near-death experience," said Bill Hackney, chief investment officer of Atlanta Capital Management Co, which owns Goldman and Morgan Stanley shares. "And as a result of that, the company was interested in pursuing a less risky model going forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies seem to have recovered at least partly from their difficulties last year. The Treasury on Tuesday approved repayment of the money they borrowed under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Morgan Stanley will benefit from less competition, as rivals like Lehman Brothers are no longer in business. Both have reaped fee bonanzas in recent months amid a boom in secondary offering activity, although MA activity, another big traditional fee source, has been moribund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN GOES BACK TO THE FUTURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's increasing uneasiness with taking risk is evident from data it released last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's "value at risk," a measure of the maximum possible losses the bank will face on 95 percent of its trading days, on average, was $115 million in the quarter ended March 31, up 12 percent from the first quarter a year earlier. Compare that with Goldman Sachs's 52 percent increase in value-at-risk (VaR) to $240 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag said VaR is an imperfect measure of risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, the bank's chief executive, hinted on Wednesday that Goldman may be positioning itself for uncertain times ahead and questioned whether the economic recovery has begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it is going to be a long protracted recession," Blankfein said at a conference in Tel Aviv, Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's supporters see the bank as expert at managing risk, which they say means it can stay the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has a reputation for recruiting the elite of Wall Street's talent and its traders are famous for their sang-froid. Moments after planes crashed into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, its traders shed riskier assets and bought government bond options, steps that generated big profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are just Goldman. They are different. They are special," said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimism about how both banks will perform with fewer competitors has helped lift their share prices. Morgan Stanley shares traded at $30.98 on Tuesday, up 362 percent from its 52-week low of $6.71 in mid-October. Goldman, at $149.31, is up 215 percent from its 52-week low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman is also trading at a higher valuation, around 1.5 times its book value, compared with Morgan Stanley's 1.1 times, meaning it could have farther to fall if it takes a wrong step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it may. The bank has made some bad calls, as when it took profits on short positions in areas like mortgages last year earlier in the credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holding onto Goldman shares now demands faith that the bank's track record of strong risk management will allow it to navigate even the turbulent waters that may be ahead. And some investors are short on faith these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are vulnerable to a bad trade, that's just a fact," said Walter Todd, a portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital Associates who views the bank's risk as potentially affecting future earnings -- although not crippling the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Dan Wilchins; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

Microsoft would "soon" make a trial version, or product beta, available via its website, he added, but declined to provide a specific date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symantec shares fell 0.5 percent on Nasdaq and McAfee fell 1.3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, while Microsoft was up 2.1 percent. The Nasdaq composite index was down 0.47 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are closely monitoring the free service, code-named Morro after Brazil's Morro de Sao Paolo beach, amid concern it could hurt sales of products from Symantec and McAfee, which generate billions of dollars of revenue a year protecting Windows PCs from attacks by hackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a long-term competitive threat," said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets, though he added that the near-term impact was minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said that Morro will offer basic features for fighting a wide range of viruses, which would likely make it comparable to low-end consumer products from Symantec and McAfee that cost about $40 per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their top-selling products are security suites that come with features including encryption, firewalls, password protection, parental controls and data backup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, Microsoft entered that market with Live OneCare, which turned out to be a commercial flop. It announced plans in November to kill that product suite, saying it would launch the free Morro service by the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said they are looking forward to Morro's beta to see exactly how its features compare to those in products from competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it will provide protection from several types of malicious software including viruses, spyware, rootkits and trojans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials with Symantec and McAfee have said they do not see Morro as a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's free product is basically a stripped down version of the OneCare product Microsoft pulled from the shelves," said Symantec Consumer division president Janice Chaffin. "A full Internet security suite is what consumers require today to stay fully protected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joris Evers, a spokesman for No. 2 security software maker McAfee, said his company is already enjoying strong growth despite competition from free anti-virus products that are on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On a level playing field, we are confident in our ability to compete with anyone who might enter the marketplace," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Trend Micro Inc, the No. 3 player, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Brian Moss, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of International Business Machines
Corporation (IBM) and IBM International Group Capital LLC (IIGC), an indirect,
wholly owned subsidiary whose debt is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
IBM, as follows: 

IBM: 

--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; 

--Senior unsecured credit facility at 'A+'; 

--Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; 

--Short-term IDR at 'F1'; and 

--Commercial paper (CP) rating of 'F1'. 

IIGC: 

--Long-term IDR at 'A+'; 

--Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; 

--Short-term IDR at 'F1'; and 

--CP paper rating of 'F1'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's action affects approximately $41 billion
of debt, including the company's undrawn $10 billion credit facility. 

The ratings and Outlook reflect IBM's: 

--Solid credit protection measures for the 'A+' rating category, especially core
(non-financing) metrics; 

--Significant liquidity supported by a solid cash position and strong and
consistent free cash flow; 

--Considerable recurring revenue from information technology (IT) services,
software and financing, which in aggregate account for approximately 50% of
total revenue and partially mitigate revenue and profit volatility; 

--Highly diverse customer base from both an industry and geographic perspective;


--Breadth and quality of product and service offerings, resulting in leading
market share in IT services, middleware software, servers and number two share
of the total disk storage market. 

Ratings concerns include: 

--Risk of core debt (non-financing) increases to achieve financial and/or
business objectives, such as sizable debt-financed share repurchases and/or
acquisitions, resulting in a material reduction of credit protection measures; 

--Consistent, material increases in cash dividends long-term, which could
pressure free cash flow and financial flexibility in the absence of commensurate
growth in profitability, thereby necessitating further increases in core debt to
fund acquisitions and/or share repurchases. 

--Increase in legally mandated cash pension contributions to IBM's worldwide
defined benefit (DB) pension plan due to negative double-digit investment
returns on pension assets in 2008 amid weak financial markets. 

IBM's total credit protection measures improved in the latest 12 months (LTM)
ended March 31, 2009 due to an 11% decline in financing-related debt as the weak
economic environment pressured new financing originations for hardware, a nearly
15% decline in core debt and a lower interest rate environment. Fitch estimates
total leverage (total debt/ operating EBITDA) declined to 1.4 times (x) at March
31, 2009 from 1.7x in the prior year. Total interest coverage (operating EBITDA/
gross interest expense) improved to nearly 16x from approximately 14x. In the
year ended March 31, 2009, core leverage (core debt/ core EBITDA) remained flat
at 0.4x and core interest coverage improved slightly to 34x from nearly 29x due
to lower interest rates. Fitch does not anticipate material changes in either
core or total credit protection measures in the near term. 

IBM has superior financial flexibility and liquidity as of March 31, 2009
supported by $12.3 billion of cash and equivalents, including $8.2 billion
located in the U.S., and an undrawn $10 billion revolving credit facility, which
expires on June 28, 2012. Liquidity is further supported by strong and
consistent free cash flow (post-dividends), which increased to $11.9 billion for
the LTM ended March 31, 2009 from nearly $9.5 billion in the corresponding year
ago period. Despite the global recession that has adversely affected IT
spending, especially for discretion hardware and project-based consulting &amp;
systems integration engagements, Fitch expects IBM's free cash flow to exceed
$10 billion in 2009 due primarily to continued profit margin expansion,
reflecting a favorable revenue mix and continued cost discipline. 

Fitch expects IBM to continue to use free cash flow to aggressively repurchase
shares, pursue acquisitions to further strengthen its position in the software
and services industries and pay cash dividends to shareholders. Although IBM's
worldwide DB plan was underfunded by $12.8 billion at year-end 2008 compared
with overfunding of nearly $9 billion at year-end 2007, Fitch believes the
company has more than ample liquidity to satisfy the total legally mandated
pension funding requirements, estimated at approximately $5.6 billion through
2013, including a 10% increase in 2009 to $1 billion. Furthermore, Fitch notes
the estimated total mandated pension contribution for the next five years is 23%
lower than IBM's actual contributions of $7.3 billion in the prior five-years
ended 2008, but will be greater on an annual basis relative to recent
contributions in 2007 ($503 million) and 2008 ($917 million). Depending on
financial market conditions in 2009, the amount of legally mandated minimum
contributions could increase due to more frequent remeasurement of funded status
in certain non-U.S. countries. 

Total debt was nearly $31 billion as of March 31, 2009, consisting of
approximately $9.9 billion of short-term debt, including $837 million of CP, and
$21.1 billion of long-term debt. Fitch estimates $23.4 billion, or 75%, of total
debt is attributable to IBM's global financing business with the remaining debt
attributable to core (non-financing) operations. IBM has significant upcoming
long-term debt maturities in the next 12 months totaling $7.4 billion, the
overwhelming majority occurring in 2009. Fitch believes IBM will refinance the
vast majority of the upcoming debt maturities in order to maintain a targeted
debt/equity ratio of approximately 7x for the financing business and maintain a
permanent amount of core debt in the capital structure. 

For the purpose of financial evaluation, Fitch analyzes IBM's core business and
financing activities separately since they are capitalized differently and have
dissimilar cash flow characteristics. Although IBM Global Finance (IGF)
contributed approximately 10% of IBM's pre-tax earnings in 2008, it constituted
the largest component of IBM's balance sheet, representing approximately 33% of
total assets and 34% of total liabilities at year-end 2008. 

The main purpose of IGF is to provide financial and capital management products
and services to IBM's customers and business partners. IGF has a solid long-term
operating record, provides strategic advantages to IBM in terms of attracting
and retaining customers by delivering total solutions, and generates an
annuity-like revenue stream associated with multi-year leases. Near-term
performance measures could be pressured somewhat by portfolio contraction and
higher bad debt expenses, but asset quality metrics have remained relatively
solid, despite the economic downturn, given a relatively conservative
underwriting culture and strong risk management capabilities. IGF's
capitalization remains solid for the rating category and leverage levels
continue to hover near management's target of 7x. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance

&lt;p&gt;   * Microsoft prepares to unveil free anti-virus service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Will soon put beta version on website&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Company employees testing it internally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares rise 2.1 percent
 (Adds Symantec comment, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jim Finkle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, June 10 (Reuters) Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is
getting ready to unveil a long-anticipated free anti-virus
service for personal computers that will compete with products
sold by Symantec Corp (SYMC.O) and McAfee Inc MFE.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Microsoft spokesman said on Wednesday that the world's
biggest software maker is testing an early version of the
product with its own employees. Microsoft would "soon" make a
trial version, or product beta, available via its website, he
added, but declined to provide a specific date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Symantec shares fell 0.5 percent on Nasdaq and McAfee fell
1.3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, while Microsoft was
up 2.1 percent. The Nasdaq composite index .IXIC was down
0.47 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors are closely monitoring the free service,
code-named Morro after Brazil's Morro de Sao Paolo beach, amid
concern it could hurt sales of products from Symantec and
McAfee, which generate billions of dollars of revenue a year
protecting Windows PCs from attacks by hackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a long-term competitive threat," said Daniel Ives, an
analyst with FBR Capital Markets, though he added that the
near-term impact was minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has said that Morro will offer basic features for
fighting a wide range of viruses, which would likely make it
comparable to low-end consumer products from Symantec and
McAfee that cost about $40 per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their top-selling products are security suites that come
with features including encryption, firewalls, password
protection, parental controls and data backup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three years ago, Microsoft entered that market with Live
OneCare, which turned out to be a commercial flop. It announced
plans in November to kill that product suite, saying it would
launch the free Morro service by the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said they are looking forward to Morro's beta to
see exactly how its features compare to those in products from
competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has said it will provide protection from several
types of malicious software including viruses, spyware,
rootkits and trojans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials with Symantec and McAfee have said they do not
see Morro as a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft's free product is basically a stripped down
version of the OneCare product Microsoft pulled from the
shelves," said Symantec Consumer division president Janice
Chaffin. "A full Internet security suite is what consumers
require today to stay fully protected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joris Evers, a spokesman for No. 2 security software maker
McAfee, said his company is already enjoying strong growth
despite competition from free anti-virus products that are on
the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On a level playing field, we are confident in our ability
to compete with anyone who might enter the marketplace," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for Trend Micro Inc (4704.T), the No. 3
player, declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;Refuses to Talk About Ecuador At Commonwealth Club in San Francisco
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Battered by a shareholder revolt and negative publicity related to a potential
$27 billion environmental liability in Ecuador, Chevron CEO David O`Reilly is
refusing to appear at a public debate tonight unless the Ecuador issue is taken
off the table as a discussion topic, Amazon Watch reported today. 

"We have confirmed that David O`Reilly indicated he will refuse to show up to
debate tonight unless the Ecuador issue is taken off the table," said Mitch
Anderson, who monitors the company's human rights record for Amazon Watch, an
environmental group in San Francisco. 

"If O`Reilly truly believes the rhetoric Chevron has been putting out about the
Ecuador case, then why won`t he talk about the issue?" Anderson asked. "This
runs counter to the very concept of open debate and really projects an image of
weakness." 

O`Reilly is scheduled to debate Carl Pope, the Executive Director of the Sierra
Club, at what is being billed as a "first ever" meeting to discuss their
differing visions of America`s energy future. The debate is scheduled for today
at 6:30 p.m. PST at the Nikko Hotel in San Francisco and is being hosted by the
Commonwealth Club, which prides itself on being the nation`s "premier" public
affairs forum. 

The debate is scheduled to be moderated by Alan Murray, the online editor of the
Wall Street Journal. Last year, Pope blasted Chevron in a Sierra Club blog for a
series of contradictory arguments the company was making about Ecuador. 

O`Reilly is increasingly identified with what scientific experts consider the
worst oil-related contamination on the planet in Ecuador`s Northern Amazon
region. While operating a large oil concession in the area from 1964 to 1990,
Texaco systematically dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into
Amazon waterways and abandoned more than 900 unlined waste pits, causing a spike
in cancers and other oil-related health problems. 

Thousands of Amazonian residents filed a lawsuit against Texaco in 1993 in U.S.
federal court, with the case being shifted to Ecuador at the oil giant`s
request. Chevron inherited the lawsuit when it purchased Texaco in 2001. Last
year, a team of court experts estimated damages at up to $27.3 billion. 

On May 27, O`Reilly suffered a stunning rebuke when a total of at least $37
billion in Chevron shares voted to defy his recommendation and support a
shareholder resolution calling on the company to develop a "verifiable" human
rights policy. Another human rights resolution received $33 billion worth of
voting shares, out of $134 billion outstanding. 

The high levels of support - which came in part from several large pension funds
- amounted to a shareholder "revolt" over the company`s ongoing problems in
Ecuador and other countries, said Anderson. 

In Ecuador, six indigenous groups say their traditional lifestyles have been
decimated by Texaco`s pollution while an independent court expert estimated
1,401 cancer deaths can be attributed to Texaco`s sub-standard operational
practices. 

O`Reilly also has been heavily criticized for partnering with Burma`s repressive
military government in a pipeline project; refusing to accept responsibility for
the deaths of Nigerian villagers protesting pollution caused by Chevron; and
hiring William Haynes, one of the six so-called "torture lawyers" from the Bush
Administration, to run Chevron`s legal department. 

"O`Reilly is a CEO who is clearly running way behind the curve on human rights
issues relative to most other corporate leaders," said Anderson. "By refusing to
talk about Ecuador, he is acting like the company is guilty of committing the
abuses that have been alleged. The whole thing reeks of cowardice." 

O`Reilly also received criticism for refusing to be interviewed by 60 Minutes
when it aired a highly unflattering report in May on Chevron`s Ecuador
liability. Instead, the company used a low-level lawyer as spokesperson, and she
stumbled badly in the interview by comparing the contamination in the Amazon to
oil in her own makeup. 

About Amazon Watch

Amazon Watch`s mission is to work with indigenous and environmental
organizations in the Amazon Basin to defend the environment and advance
indigenous peoples' rights in the face of large-scale industrial development-oil
and gas pipelines, power lines, roads, and other mega-projects.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Actor/singer Mitchel Musso, beloved by fans for his co-starring role on the hit
Disney Channel series "Hannah Montana", debuted at #19 on Billboard`s 200 chart

achievements in engineering and mathematics by ExxonMobil and the Hispanic
Heritage Awards Foundation. 

Award recipients Kathleen Ferraren from TJ High School for Science and
Technology, Julius Vazquez attending Thomas S. Wootton High School and Elisa
Jacome of Walt Whitman High School were recognized as the 2009 Gold, Silver and
Bronze Medallion winners of the Hispanic Heritage Youth Awards. A regional
awards ceremony was held June 9th on Capitol Hill. 

Ferraren received a $3,000 scholarship as the Gold Medallion winner; Vazquez
received $2,000 as the Silver Medallion winner and Jacome received $1,000 in
educational grants as the Bronze Medallion winner. The award winners are three
of 18 Hispanic high school seniors from the Washington, D.C.-areawho were

&lt;p&gt;Harry Anderson to Lead Global Business and Technology Services, Ann Taylor to
Head Global Business Services and Jeremy Faa to Lead Global Finance
Transformation

The Company to Recommend that the Board of Directors Elect Kathy Waller as
Controller and Appoint Connie McDaniel as Chief of Internal Audit
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
In support of its ongoing productivity and transformation initiatives, The
Coca-Cola Company today announced the formation of a new structure that will
integrate three core functions: Global Business Services, Global Information
Technology and Transformational Productivity. The newly formed organization,
Global Business and Technology Services (GBTS), will enable the Company to
deliver global business services such as compensation and benefits
administration, accounting and financial reporting, and application development
and support -- services that are highly dependent on technology and standardized
processes - to its business units in a more effective and efficient way. 

Effective July 1, Harry Anderson, currently vice president and controller, will
lead this new organization and report to Alex Cummings, chief administrative
officer, and Gary Fayard, chief financial officer. 

Mr. Anderson joined the Company in 2001 and, prior to his most recent role,
served as chief financial officer of Coca-Cola North America from 2004-2007. In
2003, he was named vice president and director of Supply Chain and Manufacturing
Management. Before joining the Company, he served in roles of increasing
responsibility at Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., where he was executive vice
president of Finance and Operations for Turner Entertainment Group. Prior to his
roles at Turner Broadcasting, Mr. Anderson worked in Audit and Accounting
Services at Price Waterhouse. He has a bachelor's degree in accounting from the
University of Alabama. 

The Company`s management will recommend at the July Board of Directors meeting
that the Board elect Kathy Waller as controller, effective August 1. Ms. Waller
is currently vice president and chief of internal audit. Ms. Waller is a
Certified Public Accountant who joined The Coca-Cola Company in 1987 as a senior
accountant in the Accounting Research Department. Three years later, she became
principal accountant for the Northeast Europe/Africa Group and, in 1991, she
became marketing controller for the McDonald`s Group. Ms. Waller was then named

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Cocaine use in England rose substantially in the five years to 2008 because of its cheapness, availability and increased social acceptance, a nationwide study said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London was described as the epicenter of cocaine use in England, with an estimated 47,000 users. Other regions are catching up and all sections of society are part of the trend, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also found that women's cocaine use had shot up and almost matched men's consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're very much in an age of chemical enhancement and a pill for every ill," said Jim McVeigh, head of substance use at the Center for Public Health at Liverpool John Moores University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing it both within the most deprived areas ...(and) the affluent ones which have traditionally been associated with cocaine being a champagne type drug," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The England-wide average of individuals aged 16-59 who had used cocaine at least once in their lifetime rose from 55.7 per thousand people in 2002/3 to 72.5 per thousand in 2007/8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major reason for the increased usage is the price of cocaine, which has fallen to an average 40-60 pounds ($65.56) per gram from around 100 pounds ($164) in the 1980s, making it a cheaper option than drinking for friends who can share one gram, splitting it into several lines to be snorted, McVeigh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason is what McVeigh calls Britain's "medicalized society" where all kind of pills can be bought on the internet for anything from increasing sexual performance to dieting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes another chemical compound, such as cocaine, seem instantly more acceptable, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think people at one time saw drugs as a homogenous group of substances which they either engaged in or they didn't ... I think now there's a lot more merging (of habits)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest patterns, researchers said, was that women's cocaine consumption had soared, catching up with that of men as they became more independent and drank more, with drinking and cocaine use closely linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, 7.2 percent of men aged 10-25 had used cocaine in their lifetime compared with 6.66 percent of women. In 2003 the difference was far greater with 8.2 percent of males having used cocaine compared with only 4.8 percent of women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report pulled together data including household surveys, hospital records and drug treatment statistics available from 2002/3 to 2007/8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be found at www.cph.org.uk/ndtms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paul Lauener; editing by Tim Pearce)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Cross-border volume decline accelerates in April-May&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Global processed transactions grow 8 pct in April-May&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares are up 0.32 percent at $68.88
 (Updates with CFO and analyst comments, adds byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Juan Lagorio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) said the pace
of decline in U.S. payment volumes stabilized in April and May,
helped by a more intensive use of debit cards, but the
contraction of cross-border volumes accelerated, as consumers
cut back on spending and travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said at an
investor conference on Wednesday that the growth in the number
of global processed transactions accelerated in April and May,
as people used their cards more often but for smaller
transactions. He said the trend reflected a movement from cash
and checks to electronic payment systems such as debit and
credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pollitt said U.S. payment volumes -- the amount cardholders
spend using Visa's network -- fell 3 percent in April and May,
compared with the same period of 2008, in line with the decline
seen in the January-March second fiscal quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Pollitt said it was too early to consider this an
"inflection point" in the downward trend sparked last year by
the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added that the debit business, which is driven by
spending in nondiscretionary items such as gasoline and
groceries, supported the trend, as debt-burdened Americans trim
their borrowing and use their credit cards less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a shift to debit from credit. That is a function
of the deleveraging of the world," said Robert Lutts, president
and chief investment officer at Cabot Money Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spending on debit cards surpassed credit volume in the
United States in the first three months of 2009 for the first
time in the history of Visa, the world's largest payment
network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cross-border payment volumes continued to fall, by 9
percent in April and May compared with the same period last
year -- a deterioration from the 6 percent decline reported for
the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cross-border volumes have continued to drift down,"
Pollitt said at the William Blair conference in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pollitt also said global processed transaction growth
accelerated to 8 percent in April and May, from a 6 percent
increase in the January-March period, as more people around the
world replace cash for credit or debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa is partially insulated from the global credit crisis
because it processes transactions rather than extends credit.
However, revenue growth has slowed along with transaction
volume as consumers try to reduce their debts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The business is going to look much better by the end of
this year," Lutts said, betting on a global economic recovery
by the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa shares rose 0.26 percent to $68.81 in afternoon
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up 28
percent in 2009.

&lt;p&gt;  BELLEVUE, WASHINGTON, Jun 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Simba Technologies Inc., industry's source for standards-based data
connectivity solutions, announces the release of its custom ODBC driver
that connects a multitude of familiar applications, including Microsoft
Excel and Access, to Microsoft HealthVault. The ODBC driver gives users a
convenient way to access, view and use data uploaded into a HealthVault
account from various health and fitness devices. HealthVault is a privacy
and security-enhanced data storage and sharing platform that helps
consumers enable an easy, ongoing exchange of data among different health
applications and devices in a centralized location.

    "There is an entire ecosystem of amazing, smart health devices and
software applications that interface with and enable central information
storage on HealthVault," said Amyn Rajan, CEO of Simba Technologies.
"Simba's custom ODBC driver for HealthVault enables users to access data
uploaded from their smart health devices and do things like review it and
chart it in familiar software applications like Excel."

    Simba's ODBC driver provides users with a choice in which application
they choose to review and track their health data. Users can upload data
into HealthVault from a wide variety of smart health devices, including
heart rate monitors, pedometers, glucose meters and asthma inhalers, and
then pull the data into applications to graph and review it. For example,
a user can test their blood sugar levels with a glucose meter, sync the
data to HealthVault and then use an application such as Excel to graph it
and look for patterns. Similarly, with patient permission, a doctor can
use an application to review and chart a patient's data.

    "We're excited to see the number of tools available to consumers and
their physicians to track and monitor health information expanding," said
David Cerino, General Manager of the Consumer Health Solutions Group at
Microsoft. "Simba's offering bridges online record management with
offline analysis in familiar desktop tools. This exemplifies our goal of
putting the consumers at the center of their health information by giving
them more choices for better managing their health."

    Simba is distributing the ODBC connectivity driver for free on its
website at http://www.simba.com/ODBC-Driver-for-HealthVault.htm.

    The ODBC driver, based upon Simba's proven ODBC data connectivity
technology, leverages Simba's expertise in building connectivity
solutions - in this case, standards-based data connectivity to a
web-based data source like HealthVault. Although, Rajan noted that
Simba's software expertise and driver development capabilities extend far
beyond.

    "Simba has been developing custom data drivers and device drivers for
many years," said Rajan. "Through our software development division we
have helped numerous companies develop specialized connectivity and
software. Our expertise includes device drivers for HealthVault
connectivity, as well as general software development services. We've
built this custom ODBC driver and have chosen to freely distribute it to
help people get better connected; it's also an example of what can be
done."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - The New York Times Co (NYT.N)
has hired Goldman Sachs to manage the possible sale of The
Boston Globe, and plans to request bids in the next couple of
weeks, The Boston Globe reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The report comes after the Globe's largest union, the
Boston Newspaper Guild, rejected a $10 million package of
concessions aimed at cutting costs at the city's largest daily
newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, the Guild petitioned the U.S. government's
National Labor Relations Board to block the Times Co's plan to
slash union members' pay by 23 percent to get the savings the
newspaper publisher says it needs. [ID:nN09131313]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Media industry watchers have been expecting the Times Co to
put the 137-year-old Globe up for sale, saying the cost-cuts
were designed to streamline the newspaper and attract bidders.
The Times has said the Globe is on track to post an $85 million
operating loss this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Globe's Wednesday story quoted an unidentified
potential buyer as saying the Times was willing to entertain
bids on "any and all" of its New England properties, including
the Globe and the Worcester Telegram and Gazette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the report, another potential buyer said the
process may take time, with the Times Co exploring options over
the summer. Two other people involved in potential bids did not
expect submissions until the Guild situation is resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most U.S. newspaper publishers are reeling from sharp drops
in advertising revenue, as the weak economy added to pressures
caused by competition from Internet news sites and other new
media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Times also is trying to pay off hundreds of millions of
dollars in debt, and is looking for someone to buy its 17.5
percent stake in the company that owns the Boston Red Sox
baseball team, the Fenway Park ball field and other properties
in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment bank Goldman Sachs is fielding offers on New
England Sports Ventures, the Red Sox's parent company. It also
is working on the Globe process, the paper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A New York Times spokeswoman was not immediately available
for comment.

&lt;p&gt; * Militants claim attack on oil pumping station&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Army says cause of fire is accidental, denies attack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * No oil output loss, facility idle for several months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
  (Refiles to add dropped word in paragraph 2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Austin Ekeinde&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, June 10 (Reuters) - Nigeria's main
militant group said on Wednesday it had sabotaged a
Chevron-operated (CVX.N) facility in the Niger Delta but the
military denied an attack had taken place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND),
whose attacks have shut one-fifth of Nigeria's oil output in the
last three years, said the Otunana pumping station in Delta
state was engulfed in fire after a militant raid late Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A major 'cordon and search' operation by MEND commenced
today ... with devastating effects on the heavily fortified
Chevron Otunana flow station," the group said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The military said the fire at the oil facility was
accidental and not caused by any militant activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The fire was caused by a system failure, either chemical or
electrical. It has been contained and there was no damage to the
facility and no loss of life," said Colonel Rabe Abubakar,
spokesman for the military task force in the Niger Delta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is not an ounce of truth to MEND's claim that they
attacked it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron confirmed the fire at its facility, which was shut
down before the incident. It did not say how the fire was
started. [ID:nLA603043]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Security forces last month launched their biggest offensive
in years against militants in Delta state, bombarding militant
camps from the air and sea and sending three battalions of
soldiers to hunt down rebels in surrounding communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In response, MEND has declared an "all-out war" against the
military and bombed a Chevron pipeline, forcing a loss in oil
output of 100,000 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEND says it is fighting for a fairer share of the natural

&lt;p&gt;  MURRAY HILL, NJ, Jun 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
iEnterprises (http://www.ienterprises.com), the global desktop and
wireless customer relationship management (CRM) experts, was named winner
of the Software as a Service Innovation category in the 2009 IBM Beacon
Awards competition for delivering outstanding value and innovative
approaches to helping clients address unique business challenges.

    iEnterprises' Web-based CRM product with built-in wireless capabilities
for the BlackBerry, iPhone and Windows Mobile smartphones, Empower CRM,
was chosen by an independent panel of industry experts in recognition of
iEnterprises' value and innovative pricing model that allows customers to
respond rapidly to changing market conditions.

    The IBM Beacon Awards are an integral part of IBM's PartnerWorld program,
which provides industry recognition, increased visibility and promotional
opportunities to IBM global Business Partners. Members of IBM PartnerWorld
benefit from global marketing and technical enablement initiatives to

    "We're excited about winning this year's IBM Beacon award and to be using
IBM's cutting edge technology to continually improve Empower CRM for our
customers," said John Carini, CEO of iEnterprises. "Our customers
frequently tell us that after conducting extensive searches, they found
that while many CRM providers offer "bells and whistles," they come at a
high price, with hidden costs and they did not have built-in wireless
capabilities or the high configurability. IBM's flexible technology
footing has enabled us to help small and mid-sized companies gain advanced
technology that's affordable and easy to use."

    iEnterprises' Empower CRM is a Web-based CRM solution that helps small
and medium-sized companies manage all aspects of their daily business
life while in or away from the office. It is deployed as a SaaS model
within hours and can be moved behind the firewall if needed. User
configurations can easily be achieved with Empower CRM and built-in
wireless functionality helps small and medium sized companies connect
their customer relationship management and Lotus Notes applications to
smartphones. All updates can be made in real-time and captured right into
the system due to SOA mobile integration. This increased productivity is
made possible by the IBM SaaS program as well as various IBM other
technologies including Lotus Notes, WebSphere Application Server and DB2.

    The IBM Beacon Awards recognize excellence in the development and delivery
of solutions and services that Business Partners deliver to clients around
the world. More than 340 nominations were judged by a team of leading
industry journalists, analysts and IBM executives, who selected winners
and finalists in the 22 award categories.

    "IBM is dedicated to helping our global Business Partners deliver
innovative solutions that enable our joint clients transform their
business operations," said Rich Hume, general manager, IBM Global
Business Partner Organization. "iEnterprises was recognized in the
Software as a Service Innovation category based on their technology
leadership and commitment to delivering customer value. This award is a
testament to their commitment to delivering on IBM's smarter planet

&lt;p&gt;KnowledgeTree 3.6.1 Aims at Helping Companies with Compliance and Document
Management by Adding Configurable Electronic Signatures, Document Type Alerts
and Seamless Integration with Microsoft Office


SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
KnowledgeTree, a leading provider of commercial open source document management
software, today announced the release of version 3.6.1 of its flagship solution
and version 1.0 of its Microsoft Office Add-in. 

This release focuses on helping companies ease the burden of compliance,
provides improved usability and ensures increased interoperability between
KnowledgeTree and other productivity tools. Significant new features and
enhancements include:

* Document Type Alerts make it possible to manage document retention policies,
contracts and other time-based events with less effort by applying alerts to
groups of documents. 
* Configurable Electronic Signatures ensure accountability and compliance with
regulations such as the US Food and Drug Administration`s (FDA) Title 21 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11, Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act(HIPAA) and others by requiring a user to re-authenticate when
changing a document.

"KnowledgeTree can significantly ease the compliance burden for smaller
companies," said Daniel Chalef, CEO of KnowledgeTree. "The combination of
electronic signatures with a complete audit trail fulfills regulatory
requirements, while the affordable price appeals to decision-makers." 

Also featured prominently in this release is the Microsoft Office Add-in, which
integrates KnowledgeTree seamlessly with the entire Office suite. Microsoft
users can open, edit, save and email documents that reside in the KnowledgeTree
repository from within Office applications, exactly as they would if that
document was located on a shared drive. In addition, a powerful built-in search
makes it even easier to find documents in the repository from within Office
applications. 

"The Microsoft Office Add-in allows users to enjoy the benefits of collaboration
and version control afforded by KnowledgeTree without changing the way they
work," noted Philip Arkcoll, product manager at KnowledgeTree. "Customers using
this feature report enhanced productivity as a result of the streamlined
process." 

One such customer is Australian intellectual property services firm, 1 Place
Patent Attorneys and Solicitors. "We are extremely happy with KnowledgeTree due
its ease of use, cost effectiveness and reliability. The Microsoft add-in allows
our staff to open a document and save it with a simple point and click. In
addition, the superior search functionality and bulk upload options are ideal
for companies in the legal space," stated Dr. Michael Bates, registered patent
attorney and solicitor at 1 Place Patent Attorneys and Solicitors.

enhanced features. The company, which is funded by Hasso Plattner Ventures, has

required to perform advanced simulations and improve the accuracy and
reliability of virtual prototypes and manufacturing process simulations in the
pre-design phase of product development.

P selected MSC.Software as the ideal provider to enable them to meet these
goals based on the abilities of SimManager to manage virtual build &amp; tests, and
SimXpert to capture and share automated best-practices allows manufacturers to

high performance compute resources. MSC.Software's SimManager and SimXpert
solutions offer P the framework to accomplish each of these goals."

Future plans include leveraging the best practice templates created by P
experts in the detailed design phase of new product development by extending

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), Citibank (NYSE: C), Royal

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

A Stress-Test Do-Over?

The good thing is that, with the exception of the unemployment rate, things have
not been worse than the more adverse scenario, and the banks have been able to
raise the capital needed to withstand that scenario. The release of the original
stress test results focused almost exclusively on the more-adverse scenario.
Thus, provided the economy does not turn out to be "more adverse than the more
adverse," none of the "too big to fail" 19 is likely to actually fail. 

That, however, does not provide much of a margin of safety. It is sort of ironic
that the chief overseer of the program is coming out with this call on the very
day that 10 of the 19 have gotten approval to withdraw from the program. On the
other hand, the stress test did provide pretty clear delineation between the
strong banks like J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), which
are at the front of the line to get out from under the TARP, and the weaker
institutions like Citibank (NYSE: C) and GMAC (a.k.a. Ally Bank), which are a
long ways away from being free of the need for government help. 

Royal Caribbean`s Flu Impact

Royal Caribbean (NYSE: RCL) announced this morning that the outbreak of the H1N1
virus, or "swine flu," would negatively impact the company`s earnings by
approximately $0.22 per share. 

Last month, Royal Caribbean`s competitor Carnival Corporation (NYSE: CCL)
announced that it would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.05 per share,
with the potential for an additional negative $0.05 per share going forward. 

The fact that the impact of the outbreak was notably greater to Royal Caribbean,
relative to Carnival, is not surprising. The flu outbreak occurred just prior to
the scheduled launch of a new Royal Caribbean product, Pacific Dream, targeting
Mexican nationals. The company was forced to cancel the launch, and the ship sat
idle. The associated expenses and lost revenue added to the expense of changing
existing itineraries away from Mexican ports.

requirements," he said. "I think those are parallel things."

&lt;p&gt;The Internet company said on Tuesday that its new software can easily transfer data from a Microsoft Exchange server to Google's cloud-based online service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new product allows business users to continue using the Outlook client for email and other tasks, but the back-end functionality and data storage would move to Google, instead of residing on a company's internal servers running Microsoft software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product, Google Apps Sync for Microsoft Outlook, will be available immediately as part of the existing Premier version of Google apps, which costs $50 per business user but is also available to educational and nonprofit customers for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google product manager Chris Vander Way said the new product does not signal that Google is backing away from efforts to convince businesses to use its Web-based email, dubbed Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look at this as a way to provide choice for users who like to do things the old, Outlook way," said Vander Way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it currently has 1.75 million business users, including Genentech and Avago. Dave Girouard, president of Google's enterprise business, would not break down how many of those customers use the fee-based version of Google apps and how many use the free, ad-supported versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girouard said the enterprise apps business generates "hundreds of millions" of dollars in revenue a year and is profitable and growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40 Percent of Respondents Plan to Travel Abroad in the Next Two Years; 83
Percent Modifying Plans Based on Economic Environment

Fewer Than One in 10 U.S. Adults Say Swine Flu (H1N1) Has Impacted Travel Plans
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Despite a challenging environment, spending by visitors to the U.S. increased to
$52 billion in 2008, up $7 billion from 20071, as measured by spending on
Visa-branded payments cards by international visitors. At the same time,
Americans exercised a similar desire for international travel, spending $42.4
billion on their Visa cards abroad in 2008, up 3 percent from 20072. This is
according to Tourism Outlook: USA, a new report released by Visa Inc. (NYSE: V).


While there is continued interest in international travel, both U.S. inbound and
outbound spending declined between January and March 2009 compared with the same
period in 2008. Despite this, nearly half of Americans surveyed (47 percent) in
Tourism Outlook said the economic environment has not impacted their desire to
travel outside the U.S., and 18 percent are even more willing to travel
internationally. However, 83 percent plan to modify their travel plans based on
the economic environment. Nearly half of respondents (46 percent) plan to travel
during the off-peak season to take advantage of lower prices, while 31 percent
plan on traveling closer to home. The Visa Tourism Outlook survey evaluated
travel intentions and attitudes among 5,539 travelers in 11 nations, including
the U.S., who have traveled internationally in the past two years. 

"The U.S. continues to be a major source market for global tourism. Americans`
travel intentions have not diminished for 2009 and 2010. However, travelers are
increasingly price sensitive and seeking greater value when planning travel,"
said Bill Sheedy, President, North America at Visa Inc. "As travelers are
discerning in their choice of destinations and time of year for travel, Visa`s
insight into tourist behavior and attitudes in the U.S. and globally can support
the tourism providers in capturing tourism revenues." 

Swine Flu Has Minimal Impact on 2009 Travel Intentions

In addition, Visa Inc. recently commissioned a survey of 1,000 U.S. adults in
late May 2009 on how swine flu (H1N1) impacted their travel plans for 2009. Only
7 percent of respondents stated that H1N1 had impacted their 2009 travel plans.
The majority (84 percent) said that the H1N1 virus has not changed their
intention to travel. In addition, 84 percent said they felt sufficiently
informed about the H1N1 situation. While the overall impact of H1N1 on
respondents` 2009 travel was minimal, there are still a variety of factors that
are preventing people from traveling this year. When asked what factors might
impact their decision not to travel in 2009, respondents cited the cost of
travel (61 percent), economic concerns (54 percent) and personal safety concerns
(21 percent). 

Economic Concerns, Quest for Value Impact Q1 2009 Tourism Spending

While consumer research indicates that Americans remain determined to travel in
2009, the desire for more value and economic concerns have likely impacted
tourism spending during early 2009. Visa Inc. saw a decline in tourism spending
by U.S. travelers abroad in the first three months of 2009 compared with one
year ago. From Jan. 1 - March 31, 2009, spending by U.S. travelers abroad on
their Visa cards was down 9 percent, at $9.3 billion compared with $10.2 billion
during the same period in 20083. 

In comparison, for the calendar year 2008, spending by American travelers abroad
totaled $42.4 billion, up 3 percent from 20074. Canada ($5.5 billion), the
United Kingdom ($4.4 billion), Mexico ($3.5 billion), Germany ($1.6 billion),
France ($1.6 billion) and Italy ($1.5 billion) were the most popular
destinations for Americans in 2008, as measured by spending on Visa payment
cards. The United Arab Emirates recorded significant year-over-year growth, with
U.S. visitors spending $732.6 million on their Visa cards in 2008, up 85 percent
from 2007. 

Consistent with 2007 and 2008 spending trends, and the desire to reduce costs by
traveling closer to home, Mexico and Canada ranked in the top five international
destinations among U.S. survey respondents for the second year, along with the
U.K., the Caribbean and Italy. 

U.S. Remains Top Destination for Global Travelers

During the first three months of 2009, total inbound tourist spending on Visa
cards totaled $11 billion, down from $12.9 billion in 2008. However, while
spending decreased slightly year over year, the U.S. remains a top destination
for international tourists. The majority of survey respondents who have been to
the U.S. (79 percent) have visited multiple times. And three out of four survey
respondents believe they are likely to visit the U.S. in the next two years,
with strong interest from potential travelers from Canada, Mexico, South Korea
and Japan. 

Florida, New York and California Top Contributors to U.S. Tourism Revenues

Where and on what are U.S. visitors spending? In 2008, the two largest merchant
segments for international visitors to the U.S., based on Visa transaction
volume, were general retail at $18.8 billion and lodging at $5.8 billion. States
with the largest share of spending on Visa payment cards by inbound visitors
included Florida, New York, California, Texas and Nevada. While Nevada was fifth
overall in transaction volume, the average transaction amount for the state was
the highest at $160.94. 

VisaVue&#174; Travel Reports

This month, Visa launched VisaVue&#174; Travel Reports, a strategic tool for the
tourism industry based on analysis of Visa cardholder spending patterns
worldwide. Visa`s network of 30 million merchants and 1.7 billion cards provides
a unique and global view into international tourist spending. VisaVue&#174; Travel
Reports evaluates spending of both leisure and business travelers worldwide, and
it analyzes purchase patterns based on travelers` origin country and across
various merchant categories - from airlines to restaurants. 

"Visa is committed to providing a reliable global payment acceptance network for
our cardholders, and supporting state and local governments in their efforts to
grow tourism revenues by providing tourism data and insights that show where and
how visitors spend their money," said Sheedy. 

About Tourism Outlook: USA

For the Visa international tourism survey, 5,539 adult consumers aged 18+ were
interviewed as part of an online panel survey hosted by GMI (Global Market
Insite, Inc). Field work took place between December 11, 2008 and January 8,
2009. During the research process, questions are posed to a panel of consumers
and data is collected until various predefined sampling quotas are reached. The
results are then analyzed and sig-tested at a 95 percent confidence level. For
this summary, the main differences that are interesting and statistically
significant have been described accordingly. 

Visa cardholder spending data cited is based upon a review of tourism spending
on Visa-branded payment cards by international visitors from key source
countries while visiting the United States during the calendar years 2008
(January 1 - December 31, 2008) and 2007 (January 1 - December 31, 2007). These
findings are based upon VisaVue&#174; Travel data. Visa introduced the VisaVue&#174;
Travel tourism reports to a pilot group of U.S. tourism organizations in early
2008 and is now available to a broader audience of state and convention and
visitors bureau destination marketing entities.

&lt;p&gt;* Africa Businesswomen`s Network (ABWN) launched at the World Economic Forum on
Africa 
* ABWN will build and support a network of businesswomen`s organizations in
Sub-Saharan Africa 
* Network hubs underway in Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and
Uganda

CAPE TOWN, South Africa--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Vital Voices Global Partnership today
joined with local businesswomen`s organizations throughout Africa to announce
the launch of the Africa Businesswomen`s Network (ABWN) at the World Economic
Forum on Africa. 

The ABWN aims to build and support a network of businesswomen`s organizations in
Africa to expand the number of women succeeding as entrepreneurs and leaders in
the corporate world; to raise the profile and credibility of women in business;
to foster global networking opportunities among businesswomen; and to advocate
for policies that expand economic opportunity for women. Network Hubs are now
underway in Sub-Saharan African countries including Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya,
Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda. 

"Women entrepreneurs are vital to reducing poverty and driving economic growth
in Africa," said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of
ExxonMobil. "ExxonMobil is proud to support the Africa Businesswomen`s Network
to stimulate the invaluable knowledge-sharing, networking and collective action
that will enable women business leaders to join forces to unleash the untapped
economic potential of other African women and ultimately fuel greater economic
growth." 

"The ABWN will address some of the unique barriers women entrepreneurs face,
including negative and unsupportive policy and social environments; poor access
to input and output markets and technologies; and inadequate access to
information," said Alyse Nelson, President and CEO, Vital Voices. "The launch of
the ABWN is a testament to the incredible potential of female entrepreneurs to
effect positive social and economic change in Africa, and the integral role
companies like ExxonMobil can play in supporting women`s economic
opportunities." 

"Research demonstrates that networks are a powerful mechanism to enable economic
organizing among female entrepreneurs and are a proven catalyst for business
growth," said Lorie Jackson, Manager of ExxonMobil`s Educating Women and Girls
Initiative. "Women`s business networks and associations combine existing
resources to make use of the size and scale that individuals and micro or small
enterprises alone do not enjoy and collectively address fundamental barriers to
women`s economic success." 

Recognizing the integral role that women play as drivers of economic and social
change, in 2005 ExxonMobil launched the Educating Women and Girls Initiative,
which provides training, resources and support networks to help women in
developing countries fulfill their economic potential. The ExxonMobil Foundation
has committed grants totaling nearly $20 million for programs including
intensive leadership and skills development programs for women from 27 African
countries.

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, June 12 (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs
JBWere sees contract iron ore prices rebounding 10 percent next
year and spot prices also firming, as global seaborne trade
picks up and Chinese imports rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "After conceding contract price cuts in 2009 ranging from
28 percent to 48 percent we believe the balance of pricing
power will shift back in favour of the suppliers in 2010 and we
have raised our benchmark price forecast for Australian iron
ore fines to (an increase of) 10 percent, it said in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broker previously expected prices to be unchanged
between the 2009/10 and 2010/11 shipping years, which end March
31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also raised its forecast for spot prices over the next
three to six months to $70-$80 a tonne, delivered in China on
the basis that the seller pays for shipping and the buyer for
insurance. The forecast is also based on 62 percent iron
content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spot prices currently stand at around $$76.50 a tonne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see significant upside risk to this view if non-Chinese
steel production recovers sooner and stronger than we currently
expect," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources contacted by Reuters on Thursday said Japan's
Nippon Steel (5401.T) and JFE (5411.T) agreed with BHP Billiton
(BHP.AX) (BLT.L) to cut fine iron ore prices by 33 percent,
matching a benchmark deal reached with Rio Tinto (RIO.AX)
(RIO.L) [ID:nSYD358426].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But China, the world's largest steel producer, continues to
hold out for a price cut of at least 40 percent, straining the
benchmark pricing mechanism.

&lt;p&gt; *Televisa CEO: Spillover clause allows satellite signal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *Televisa EVP: Internet streaming would enhance ratings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *Trial to end on Friday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Reuters) - Televisa (TLVACPO.MX)
(TV.N) executives testified on Thursday they kept the right to
stream popular Spanish-language shows to U.S. audiences over
the Internet in a licensing agreement with Univision, and said
the arrangement would benefit its U.S. licensee's ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa is battling in a federal court in Los Angeles this
week for the right to transmit on the Web some of the same
programs it has licensed to Univision for U.S. markets through
2017. Univision says the Program License Agreement (PLA) the
two companies signed in 1992 gives it exclusive rights to
distribute the programs, including popular telenovelas, in the
territory where its stations operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa Chief Executive Emilio Azcarraga Jean testified on
Wednesday and Thursday that a contract clause that addresses
"spillover" of broadcast signals to TV stations along the
U.S.-Mexico border essentially allows satellite transmission of
Internet service into the United States "because of the
capacity that satellites have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The spillover provision, originally written in 1992, held
Televisa harmless for any bleeding of its signal a few dozen
miles into U.S. border markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the case of satellites, it's different," Azcarraga Jean
testified. "Because of the capacity that satellites have -- 500
miles, 1,000 miles (over the border) -- that's all right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you would think that a 500-mile spillover would be
spillover (under the disputed contract provision) then I would
agree with you," Azcarraga said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Azcarraga Jean, who stepped into the long-running dispute
between his late father and former Univision Chairman and CEO
Jerry Perenchio in 1997, also said he understood the contract
permitted Televisa to transmit programs "in any electronic form
from Mexico ... (and) the Internet is electronic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What I understand is ... that we would give the rights to
Univision for a royalty ... to broadcast those programs over
the air and on cable and we had the right to send those
programs from Mexico on the satellite," Azcarraga Jean said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies agreed in a 2001 contract amendment to
call a "truce" in which neither would attempt to mount Internet
streaming of the shows. The programs are available on
Televisa's Web site but are geographically blocked in the
United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia
testified that the void created by having no Internet presence
for the Televisa shows in the United States had fueled vigorous
pirating, which appeared not to have hurt Univision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Those programs are being captured by pirate sites ... so
that hasn't affected Univision," de Angoitia said. "If you look
at their ratings, they are at an all-time high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, the availability of the shows, albeit illegally,
had enhanced viewership by helping consumers not lose track of
their favorite telenovelas, de Angoitia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a promotional tool," he said. "We don't believe it
would destroy anyone. If we were to send our programming into
the U.S. on the Internet it would promote and enhance TV
viewership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bench trial, held without a jury before U.S. District
Judge Philip Gutierrez, is set to conclude on Friday but it is
not clear whether he will rule immediately in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judge's ruling is expected to deal only with whether
Televisa has Internet rights in U.S. markets for its programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Televisa S.A. and Grupo Televisa S.A. vs.
Univision Communications, Case No. 05-3444, in U.S. District
Court in Los Angeles.

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE/CALGARY (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Thursday it has joined TransCanada Corp's effort to build a $26 billion Alaska natural gas pipeline, giving the long-sought project key support from one of the main Arctic gas players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, TransCanada will retain a majority stake in the massive project to bring North Slope gas to market. But it and Exxon Mobil will share responsibility for all technical, commercial, regulatory and financial aspects, executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, one of Alaska's three main producers, and TransCanada, a major North American pipeline operator, will spend $150 million on development through the process of soliciting shippers in 2010, TransCanada vice-president Tony Palmer said. That is up from a previous budget of $83 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TransCanada and its predecessors have envisioned the project since the 1970s. Now it and Exxon Mobil are proceeding despite low gas prices, high costs and a competing pipeline proposal from BP Plc and ConocoPhillips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is our belief that working with TransCanada and the state of Alaska ... provides the best opportunity to bring together all the necessary parties to deliver a successful project," Marty Massey, Exxon Mobil's U.S. joint interest manager, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've made our choice as to which pipeline project we're going to support, and it's the TransCanada project," he added. "I find it hard to believe that we would commit our gas to a project that we're not supporting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the plan, the partners will devise a new cost estimate for the project in the first quarter of 2010. Plans call for start-up of the pipeline in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil's involvement would mark progress in its efforts to rehabilitate its reputation in the state, 20 years after the Exxon Valdez oil spill fouled more than 1,200 miles of Alaskan coastline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot of bad blood, there's a lot of resentment over the Exxon Valdez and the handling of the payments," state Sen. Bill Wielechowski, an Anchorage Democrat who co-chairs the state Natural Resource Committee, said. "At the same time, they're valid leaseholders on the North Slope and it's very hard to build the gas line without them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project would unlock as much as 35 trillion cubic feet of gas stranded within Arctic oil fields. The line would run about 1,700 miles to TransCanada's pipeline network in Alberta from Prudhoe Bay, delivering 4 billion to 4.5 billion cubic feet a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts have said recent shale-gas discoveries close to major markets in the Lower 48 states threaten development of Arctic gas, which requires the massive transport system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Palmer said he believes Alaskan gas can be competitive if the partners can keep development costs within budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, TransCanada won a state license for the pipeline under a bidding process championed by Gov. Sarah Palin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That license remains intact with Exxon Mobil's involvement, Palin said. Exxon Mobil said it aims to become a fully certified as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By recognizing the value of Alaska's relationship with TransCanada, Exxon Mobil has made a strategic decision that I believe makes good sense," she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Palin's Alaska Gasline Inducement Act, TransCanada is eligible for a $500 million subsidy and a pledge that the state will not negotiate with any competitors as long as a series of commitments are met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palin administration officials said the new pact is evidence that the governor's AGIA strategy is working. But Palin did not bring the parties together or participate in the deal, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were no negotiations," said state Revenue Commissioner Pat Galvin, part of the administration's gas pipeline team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palin did want to hear from the companies' chief executives, though, and that is why she traveled to Dallas, Galvin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was meeting with the CEOs to confirm the Exxon Mobil-TransCanada commitment to this proposal," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state's only role was to review the arrangement to determine whether it required any changes in the law, said Galvin and Marty Rutherford, deputy state commissioner of natural resources. State officials concluded that no changes were necessary, Rutherford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The issue for us is whether the ownership of the license has changed. In this transaction, it has not," Galvin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a partner with TransCanada, Exxon will be eligible for a state match of money spent to advance the project up to $500 million, under the terms of AGIA, Palmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $150 million investment through the planned July 2010 open season will be shared by TransCanada and Exxon, and both companies will share in the state reimbursement, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Exxon does not assume any part-ownership of the AGIA license unless a new deal is struck, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massey said the new partners will keep trying to attract support for their project from BP and ConocoPhillips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may not be easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BP-ConocoPhillips proposal, called Denali, has been designed outside of the AGIA process. Exxon Mobil declined an invitation to join that project last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Denali is moving forward. This doesn't change that," BP spokesman Steve Rinehart said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denali partners also intend to solicit shippers next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil shares rose 21 cents to $74.05 on the New York Stock Exchange, while TransCanada shares rose 68 Canadian cents to C$33.68 in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=$1.10 Canadian)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

Mississippi settled an antitrust suit with Microsoft Corp
(MSFT.O) for $100 million on Thursday and said businesses,
individuals, schools and local government were eligible for a

&lt;p&gt;The abrupt reversal comes shortly before the European Commission is due to rule on antitrust charges brought against Microsoft in January, claiming that the world's largest software company abuses its dominant position by bundling its Internet Explorer browser, shielding it from head-to-head competition with rival products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, Microsoft has claimed that the browser was an integral part of the operating system and should not be pulled out, but it now plans to do that for a European version of Windows 7, due to be rolled out later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the pending legal proceeding, we've decided that instead of including Internet Explorer in Windows 7 in Europe, we will offer it separately and on an easy-to-install basis to both computer manufacturers and users," said Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Dave Heiner in a blog post on the company's website on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European regulators, which had suggested Microsoft offer a choice of browsers on its operating system to open up choice for consumers, gave a frosty response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has apparently decided to supply retail consumers with a version of Windows without a web browser at all," the European Commission said in a statement reacting to Microsoft's move. "Rather than more choice, Microsoft seems to have chosen to provide less."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission is still weighing whether Microsoft's bundling of the browser has been abusive, and what sanctions to bring as a result. It is still possible that the Commission will force Microsoft to include other browsers with its operating system, a move the company has been determined to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOOGLE, OPERA COULD BENEFIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's move could yet be a boon for competing browser makers such as Google Inc, the Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software, whose complaints spurred the European Commission case against Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser is used for about 60 percent of global Internet traffic, Mozilla's Firefox has about 30 percent, and Opera is at 4 percent, just ahead of Google and Apple Inc's Safari, according to Web analytics firm StatCounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares rose 1.2 percent to $22.83 on Nasdaq, while Google's fell 0.8 percent to $429. Shares of Norway's Opera closed up 7.1 percent in Oslo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a long history of wrangles with regulators over how it packages its own applications with its Windows operating systems, which run more than 90 percent of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last five years, it has been fined more than $2 billion by the European Commission for violations and failing to carry out remedies over the bundling of its Windows Media player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2000, a U.S. judge decided that Microsoft had broken the law after it combined its Internet Explorer browser and the Windows operating system. The most serious violations of the law were upheld on appeal, but the company continued to bundle its operating system and browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE/CALGARY (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Thursday it has joined TransCanada Corp's effort to build a $26 billion Alaska natural gas pipeline, giving the long-sought project key support from one of the main Arctic gas players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, TransCanada will retain a majority stake in the massive project to bring North Slope gas to market. But it and Exxon Mobil will share responsibility for all technical, commercial, regulatory and financial aspects, executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, one of Alaska's three main producers, and TransCanada, a major North American pipeline operator, will spend $150 million on development through the process of soliciting shippers in 2010, TransCanada vice-president Tony Palmer said. That is up from a previous budget of $83 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TransCanada and its predecessors have envisioned the project since the 1970s. Now it and Exxon Mobil are proceeding despite low gas prices, high costs and a competing pipeline proposal from BP Plc and ConocoPhillips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is our belief that working with TransCanada and the state of Alaska ... provides the best opportunity to bring together all the necessary parties to deliver a successful project," Marty Massey, Exxon Mobil's U.S. joint interest manager, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the plan, the partners will devise a new cost estimate for the project in the first quarter of 2010. Plans call for startup of the pipeline in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil's involvement would mark progress in its efforts to rehabilitate its reputation in the state, 20 years after the Exxon Valdez oil spill fouled more than 1,200 miles of Alaskan coastline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot of bad blood, there's a lot of resentment over the Exxon Valdez and the handling of the payments," state Sen. Bill Wielechowski, an Anchorage Democrat who co-chairs the state Natural Resource Committee, said. "At the same time, they're valid leaseholders on the North Slope and it's very hard to build the gas line without them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project would unlock as much as 35 trillion cubic feet of gas stranded within Arctic oil fields. The line would run about 1,700 miles to TransCanada's pipeline network in Alberta from Prudhoe Bay, delivering 4 billion to 4.5 billion cubic feet a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts have said recent shale-gas discoveries close to major markets in the Lower 48 states threaten development of Arctic gas, which requires the massive transport system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Palmer said he believes Alaskan gas can be competitive if the partners can keep development costs within budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, TransCanada won a state license for the pipeline under a bidding process championed by Gov. Sarah Palin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That license remains intact with Exxon Mobil's involvement, Palin said. Exxon Mobil said it aims to become a fully certified as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By recognizing the value of Alaska's relationship with TransCanada, Exxon Mobil has made a strategic decision that I believe makes good sense," she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Palin's Alaska Gasline Inducement Act, TransCanada is eligible for a $500 million subsidy and a pledge that the state will not negotiate with any competitors as long as a series of commitments are met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massey said the new partners will keep trying to attract support for their project from BP and ConocoPhillips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may not be easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BP-ConocoPhillips proposal, called Denali, has been designed outside of the AGIA process. Exxon Mobil declined an invitation to join that project last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Denali is moving forward. This doesn't change that," BP spokesman Steve Rinehart said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denali partners also intend to solicit shippers next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil shares rose 21 cents to $74.05 on the New York Stock Exchange, while TransCanada shares rose 68 Canadian cents to C$33.68 in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=$1.10 Canadian)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Televisa eyes fiber optic, spectrum auctions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Company could launch mobile phone services in Mexico&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Will have new cable sports channel in July
 (Adds details on sports network, closing quotes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Gina Keating and Cyntia Barrera Diaz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES/MEXICO CITY, June 11 (Reuters) - Broadcaster
Televisa said on Thursday it wants to offer mobile phone
services in Mexico, elbowing into the market dominated by
billionaire Carlos Slim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A top Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) (TV.N) official told Reuters
that the Mexico City-based company, the biggest producer of
Spanish-language content in the world, is interested in bidding
for a fiber optic network and wireless spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico's government says it will launch tenders for the use
of mobile telephone frequencies before the end of 2009 in a bid
to boost competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Mexican mobile phone market is led by America Movil
(AMXL.MX) (AMX.N), controlled by Slim, with nearly 60 million
subscribers. Spain's Telefonica (TEF.MC) stands in a distant
second place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Televisa source said mobile phone services would be
offered through its cable companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa owns Cablevision (CABLECPO.MX), Cablemas and
Cablevision Monterrey, which recently teamed with
Guadalajara-based Megacable (MEGACPO.MX) to offer a low-priced
video, fixed phone and Internet package, known as triple-play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Some of these big media conglomerates may be doing triple
play over their television networks, but really the icing on
the cake would be to also provide mobility services," said
Michael Minges, senior market analyst with consulting firm
Telecommunications Management Group in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission plans
to tender two strands from its 27,000 kilometer fiber optic
network to create a new telecom backbone for the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts believe launching new telecom infrastructure
across Mexico could hurt dominant fixed-line operator Telefonos
de Mexico TMX.N TELMEXL.MX -- also part of the Slim empire
-- which owns most of the country's telephone cables and even
the copper wire leading into home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SPORTS GALORE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source also said on Thursday that Televisa will launch
a new sports cable network  in Mexico in July, competing
against giants like ESPN and Fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The network, which will use mostly Televisa-generated
content, will be available in the United States and other Latin
American countries afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa owns three professional soccer teams in Mexico --
America, Necaxa and San Luis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares rose 0.47 percent to close at 47.47
pesos and its New York-listed shares gained 2.3 percent to
$17.78.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Freed from the grip of the U.S. Treasury's bailout program, Goldman Sachs Group Inc might seek to shed its commercial bank holding company status and reclaim its role as Wall Street's iconic investment bank, some investors believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the worst of the crisis has passed and as financial markets are showing signs of healing, Goldman could look to reverse a hastily planned move that it is reported to have viewed as a necessity at the height of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I were the CEO, it would be one of the top things on my game plan to set up a time to do it," said Marshall Front, chairman at Chicago-based Front Barnett Associates, which does not own Goldman stock. "That would remove a layer of the regulation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas von Praag denied that the company has any intention of shedding its bank holding company status, assumed in the aftermath of the market tsunami that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers and American International Group Inc in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley accepted commercial bank status, and the increased regulation that entailed, after seeing their shares spiral lower amid concern about their viability and in return for access to Fed lending facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move eased investor fears but effectively killed off both firms' investment banking model, decades in the works. The Fed became their primary regulator, replacing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REGULATORY YOKE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both faced significantly tighter regulations and much closer supervision by bank examiners from several government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Morgan Stanley has moved closer to becoming a traditional bank through moves like a joint venture with Citigroup's Smith Barney wealth management unit, Goldman has mostly stayed an investment bank in all but name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why it could be tempting for it to embrace that strategy and throw off the regulatory yoke, especially after the announcement earlier this week that it is among 10 major banks allowed to repay its loans from the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are repaying TARP -- that's one hook out of them," Front said. "If they are trying to end the bank holding company adventure, that's another."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the worst of the financial crisis seemingly over, the benefits of being a bank holding company are outweighed by the restrictions and conditions, said Tom Sowanick, the chief investment officer of Princeton, New Jersey-based Clearbrook Financial LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Goldman became a commercial bank, industry watchers have said the change would expose the firm to stringent capital requirements, dampening its ability to use borrowed money to boost profits for its lucrative proprietary trading business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the huge profits to which Goldman had grown accustomed could be a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman will try to give up its bank license in order to gain leverage in trading activity," said Sowanick, whose firm has $22 billion in assets. Sowanick's firm does own financial stocks, including Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little recent precedent for banks changing their charter from banking holding company, although giant mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp made such a move in March 2007, when it changed its charter from a bank holding company to a federal thrift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'FRONTAL ASSAULT'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a year, Countrywide, which was eventually taken over by Bank of America Corp, crumbled under the weight of bad loans amid the mortgage and home lending crisis. Goldman's is a very different business and would not end up under the same regulator as Countrywide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Morgan Stanley received expedited approval to become bank holding companies as some of their longtime competitors, particularly Lehman Brothers, collapsed or disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In testimony before Congress, Lehman head Richard Fuld said his firm would have been helped if it had been allowed to become a bank holding company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Morgan Stanley's move to Fed regulation told investors they were safe, said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the more calm environment of today as compared with last September, presumably they have less need to reassure the markets that they are in a safe environment," White said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, White doesn't expect such a brash move as dropping a commercial bank charter now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would be such a high-profile and probably adverse public event that I'm not sure Goldman or Morgan Stanley wants to do it as a direct frontal assault," White said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White instead envisions a scenario in which one of the two spins off its investment banking unit, "which reconstitutes itself as the old investment bank with higher levels of risk and less oversight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 11 (Reuters) - Mortgage bond veterans from
Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) and Citigroup Global
Markets are teaming up as chief investment officers of a new
real estate investment trust (REIT) seeking to profit from
guaranteed and non-guaranteed securities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The REIT, Two Harbors Investment Corp, is merging with
Capitol Acquisition Corp CLA.A, a special purpose acquisition
company that will offer about $260 million, less expenses and
any payments to existing Capitol shareholders, for mortgage
investments, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two Harbors will be managed by a unit of hedge fund Pine
River Capital Management LP, with investments co-led by Steve
Kuhn, who joined the fund from GSAM last year. Bill Roth, a
former managing director in mortgage and asset-backed trading
at Citigroup, will join Kuhn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among strategies, Two Harbors will seek relative value
trades in mortgage bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
the home funding giants taken over by the U.S. government in
September. The focus of the two companies on public policy over
relative value opens an opportunity to fill that void, Kuhn
said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The REIT also expects to profit if the Federal Reserve
approves non-guaranteed mortgage securities for investors to
purchase under its Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility
(TALF), Kuhn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Residential mortgage bonds are proving difficult for the
Fed to include in TALF, a program that aims to lower consumer
borrowing costs and boost lending by funding investors who buy
eligible securities. Among hurdles is the diverse nature of
credits behind each residential mortgage bond, relative to the
assets in other eligible securities such as auto loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those hurdles may be overcome over time, Kuhn said.

&lt;p&gt;  ANCHORAGE, ALASKA, Jun 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
TransCanada Corporation (TSX: TRP) (NYSE: TRP) (TransCanada) today
announced that TransCanada and ExxonMobil have reached an agreement to
work together on an Alaska gas pipeline.

    TransCanada's Alaska Pipeline Project is designed to deliver a reliable
and secure source of clean energy to markets for decades to come. With an
initial forecasted capital cost of US$26 billion, the project would
provide a variety of benefits to Alaska and Canada, as well as the rest
of the United States, including substantial revenues, jobs, business
opportunities and new, long-term stable supplies of natural gas.

    "TransCanada's Alaska Pipeline Project will connect Alaska's natural gas
resource to new markets. We are pleased that TransCanada and ExxonMobil
have reached agreement on initial project terms to progress this exciting
initiative," said Hal Kvisle, TransCanada president and chief executive
officer. "TransCanada envisions that our combined activities with
ExxonMobil, along with the support of the State of Alaska, the U.S. and
Canadian governments, and other interested parties, will result in the
timely completion of the project. Today's announcement is an important
step toward that goal."

    Rich Kruger, president of ExxonMobil Production Company, said,
"ExxonMobil and TransCanada have the experience, expertise and financial
capability to undertake this project. We have on-the-ground knowledge of
Alaska and Canada, experience working in the Arctic, a strong history of
technology and innovation, and the proven ability to build and operate
projects of enormous scale in the most challenging environments."

    TransCanada Alaska Company, LLC and subsidiaries of Foothills Pipe Lines
Ltd. will remain the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act (AGIA) licensees and
TransCanada will continue as the primary point of contact with the State
of Alaska and the general public for this project. As TransCanada and
ExxonMobil work together with the goal of successfully advancing a
pipeline project, the AGIA contract obligations of TransCanada to the
State remain unaffected.

    In November 2007, TransCanada Alaska and Foothills jointly submitted an
application under AGIA to build a 4.5 billion cubic feet per day 48-inch
diameter natural gas pipeline running approximately 2,700 kilometres
(1,700 miles) from a new natural gas treatment plant at Prudhoe Bay on
Alaska's North Slope to Alberta, Canada with an LNG option to deliver gas
supplies to a liquefaction facility at Valdez. In December 2008,
TransCanada was awarded the AGIA license after prevailing in an open and
transparent competitive bid process and receiving the approval of the
Alaska legislature. TransCanada has moved forward with project
development, which includes engineering, environmental reviews, Alaska
Native and Canadian Aboriginal engagement, and commercial work to
conclude an initial binding open season by July 2010.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster
Televisa is interested in bidding for a fiber optic network and

top company official told Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mexico's government says it will launch tenders for the use
of mobile telephone frequencies before the end of the year in a

launch in Mexico a new sports cable network, which would
compete against giants like ESPN and Fox.

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects asset figure in next-to-last paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
on Thursday said Highbridge Capital Management LLC co-founder
Henry Swieca plans to leave by year end as the big bank
completes its takeover of the hedge fund giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, which originally bought a 55 percent stake in
Highbridge in 2004 for $1.3 billion, has been increasing its
ownership over the past five years. In the latest move, it will
raise its stake from 77.5 percent for undisclosed terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan did not return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swieca and Glenn Dubin, Highbridge chief executive and
co-founder, will retain small stakes in the firm. At the time
of the deal, both executives agreed to stay on for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swieca is leaving to pursue "other opportunities" in
financial services after a transition period ending late this
year, the firm said. The departure will end his 17 years at
Highbridge and a 25-year partnership with Dubin, a childhood
friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The big bank's alliance with Highbridge has been one of the
most successful in the hedge fund industry, as the New
York-based unit remained independent and key personnel stayed
with the firm. Dubin, JPMorgan noted, will continue in his CEO
role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm's assets under management have tripled over the
past five years to $21 billion, while employment more than
doubled to 310 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm has expanded into new markets and regions of the
world to make Highbridge one of the world's largest hedge fund
managers. The unit also has built up a traditional asset
management business and launched a business of making principal
investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund, like others in the industry, posted poor
performance last year and suffered a wave of redemptions. Assets
under management at Highbridge plunged by more than a third last
year from $27 billion to $17 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Highbridge's flagship fund fell 25 percent in 2008, and the
firm stopped clients from withdrawing all their cash. The firm
has rebounded in the first half this year, as the main fund has
climbed 17 percent through May and total assets surged to $21
billion.

&lt;p&gt;PARIS--(Business Wire)--
Disneyland Paris chose Orange Business Services to create and launch a portal of
mobile information accessible via Flashcode technology. With this technology,
guests can easily access in real-time, from their mobile devices, useful
information on their trip to help better organize their stay. 

As a part of its collaboration with Disneyland Paris, Orange Business Services
provided the advice, support and technical setup needed for the Flashcode
solution. 

&#9642; Innovate to improve the quality of guest experiences

With the Internet application, accessible through mobile phones via Flashcode
technology, Disneyland Paris is able to offer its guests useful and important
information, before, during and after their visit:

* Making available useful information beforehand to help plan their trip. 
* Offering up-to-date information in real-time throughout the visit: show times,
special offers on restaurants and gift shops, etc. 
* Providing access to multimedia content: games, videos, etc.

Flashcode complements Disneyland Paris` innovation strategy to supply its guests
with the latest information technology to guarantee an optimal experience. 

&#9642; A simple and innovative solution

As the first two-dimensional smart bar code (2D), Flashcode offers the
possibility to quickly and simply access multimedia content via a mobile device.
With the quick scan of a 2D bar code with a camera phone you are able to connect
to a mobile website loaded with information. 

Simple to use Flashcode technology from Orange Business Services does not
require the installation of any additional infrastructures. Bar codes can be
placed and activated on any support: signs, handouts, screens, etc. 

The strong relationship between the two companies has made this new initiative
possible, considering that Orange is placed amongst the twelve strategic
partners of Euro Disney Associates S.C.A., the operating company of Disneyland
Paris, since 1992.

&lt;p&gt; * Pill seen cheaper, more convenient than injected anti-TNFs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Appears more effective than Abbott's Humira in monotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer Phase III programme under way, rivals in Phase II&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ben Hirschler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, June 11 (Reuters) - An experimental oral drug from
Pfizer (PFE.N) could shake up the rheumatoid arthritis market,
after impressive results were presented at a medical meeting in
Denmark this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug, known only by the code CP-690,550, is likely to
prove a cheaper and more convenient alternative to costly
anti-TNF biotech treatments, which have led the field in the
past decade, medical experts and industry analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The next wave of drugs will be oral. I think what companies
are trying to develop are oral agents that can be at least as
effective or almost as effective as an anti-TNF," said lead
investigator Roy Fleischmann of University of Texas, Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Having a compound that is more convenient and cheaper, with
a similar risk-benefit ratio to a more expensive biologic, is
very important, particularly in these tough economic times," he
told Reuters in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Data presented by Fleischmann at the European League Against
Rheumatism meeting in Copenhagen showed that three-quarters of
patients had at least a 20 percent improvement in their
condition after 12 weeks of treatment with the new drug. A
quarter of them experienced a 70 percent improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was a better result than for patients given Abbott
Laboratories's (ABT.N) anti-TNF drug Humira, known chemically as
adalimumab, although the nature of the mid-stage clinical trial
meant it was not possible to make a direct comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the 384-patient Phase II study, the drugs were given as
monotherapy and Humira is known to produce better results when
combined with the older drug methotrexate, Fleischmann noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Adalimumab obviously works better with methorexate. JAK
(Pfizer's drug) may not need methotrexate," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some results with the new drug were released on June 9, with
more details outlined at the conference on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's new drug is a potential competitor not only for
Humira, which sold $4.5 billion last year, but also Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ.N) and Schering-Plough's SGP.N Remicade, Amgen

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COMPELLING DATA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Parkes, a research analyst at Piper Jaffray, said
the threat from orally administered medicines was increasing and
their profile had been raised by the "compelling" Pfizer data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This and other oral RA (rheumatoid arthritis) drugs
currently in Phase II development from Incyte (INCY.O) and Rigel
(RIGL.O) represent an increasing long-term threat," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CP-690,550, which is given twice daily, is a so-called JAK-3
inhibitor that works by blocking enzymes involved in
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most common adverse events were mild to moderate urinary
tract infection, diarrhoea, bronchitis and headaches. There were
also significant dose-dependent decreases in white blood cells
and increases cholesterol, which Fleischmann said were
"manageable".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer started a large final-stage Phase III clinical
programme with CP-690,550 February. It is also studying the drug
as a potential treatment for other autoimmune diseases,
including psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, and for the
prevention of organ rejection following transplant.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background; updates stock activity)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley
(MS.N) will have to face challenging negotiations with the U.S.
Treasury regarding valuation of warrants they sold, Bernstein
Research said, and cut its 2009 profit estimates for the two
companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the companies, which were allowed to repay $10
billion in TARP money, can now focus on their core businesses
and take full advantage of the trading opportunities that the
recovering capital markets provide, Bernstein analysts led by
Brad Hintz said. [ID:nWNAB8796]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We continue to believe both firms will book strong
revenues in fixed income sales and trading as improvement in
the credit markets and fewer competitors provide a unique
earnings opportunity for both Goldman and Morgan Stanley,"
Hintz said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The long-term outlook for both these firms is favorable, as
when corporate earnings pick up, equity underwriting markets
will reopen and this high-margin revenue source will come back,
boosting companies like Goldman and Morgan Stanley, Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and eight other top U.S.
banks won clearance on Tuesday to repay $68 billion in taxpayer
money given to them during the credit crisis, a step that may
help them escape government curbs on executive pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Treasury said banks repaying bailout funds also
can repurchase warrants that the government holds in their
firms "at fair market value," and many of the approved banks
said they intended to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The warrants give the government the right to buy common
stock at a predetermined price for up to 10 years and were
intended to give taxpayers a chance to share in the profits of
healthy banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bernstein said Goldman Sachs will be the clear winner
during a credit recovery and normalization of the fixed income
market, and given the firm's business strategy and capital
strength, it is poised to take advantage of improving market
conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With liquidity returning to the market, the post Lehman
panic now history, and Goldman's competitors either under the
strict government oversight of TARP or focused on strategic
shifts away from the institutional businesses, we rate Goldman
Sachs Outperform," the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Fox-Pitt Kelton raised its second-quarter
profit estimates on Goldman Sachs, citing better-than-expected
underwriting activity and some principal investment gains.
[ID:nWNAB8820]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman were down 61 cents at $146.07, while
Morgan Stanley shares were up about a percent at $29.54 in
Thursday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;June 11 (Reuters) - JP Morgan upgraded Citi Trends Inc
(CTRN.O) to "overweight" from "neutral," saying the
value-priced apparel retailer is among the best square footage
growth stories in retail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company rose as much as 11 percent early
Thursday morning, before shedding some gains to trade up 9.83
percent at $23.92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Evren Dogan Kopelman said the Savannah,
Georgia-based company can potentially double its store-base,
has an attractive store economic model, and boasts of a strong
competitive positioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In May, Citi Trends posted quarterly results above
estimates, helped by reduced freight costs and lower markdowns,
and also raised its fiscal 2009 outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The retailer, which is a smaller rival to TJX Companies Inc
(TJX.N) and Ross Stores Inc (ROST.O), saw comparable sales up
between 1 percent to 3 percent in the past 6 months, ahead of
industry declines, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Comps were positive in November  December, when even ROST
and TJX comped flat to down," Kopelman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And even though its shares are down 21 percent over the
past six trading days -- against a 1 percent fall of the SP
500, the analyst believes the company's fundamentals and
earnings power have not changed.

 (Adds further details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Kate Holton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, June 11 (Reuters) - ESPN, the Walt Disney-owned
(DIS.N) sports network, said on Thursday it had no current plans
to buy the stricken Irish broadcaster Setanta, after days of
speculation that it could make a bid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The board of Setanta has spent the week in emergency
refinancing talks to try to prevent the group from falling into

the rights, the spokesman said it was a hypothetical situation
and a question for Setanta and the rights holder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Setanta currently holds the rights to show two English
Premier League packages, or 46 live matches a season, but it
lost out in the auction for the next three-year deal to BSkyB
(BSY.L) and will only show 23 games per season against BSkyB's
115 from 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The failure to win the rights and the economic downturn
prompted Setanta to conduct a review of its business and attempt
to renegotiate rights payments with a range of sporting bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It missed a 3 million pound payment to the Scottish Premier
League last week and faces a more than 30 million pound payment
to the English Premier League next week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rescue talks are being led by the group's founders

 (Recasts, adds details, stock price, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Cyntia Barrera&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEXICO CITY, June 11 (Reuters) - Mexican retailer Comercial
Mexicana said three key creditors agreed to give it more time
to come up with a long-awaited debt restructuring, but JPMorgan
chose to resume a fight in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) tightened its grip on the
struggling supermarket chain, known as Comerci, refusing to
extend a standstill agreement that had frozen legal action in a
U.S. court against the Mexican firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comerci defaulted on its debt in October after the global
credit crisis sparked massive losses on extensive derivatives
bets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, Barclays Plc (BARC.L), Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), which were
counterparties to Comerci's losing derivatives positions, say
they are owed more than $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All but JPMorgan extended for the ninth time a deadline for
Comerci to reach a restructuring agreement, giving it until
July 10, the retailer said in a stock exchange filing on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comerci (COMEUBC.MX) said it responded to the JPMorgan suit
and countersued in a New York state court. Comerci sources were
unable to give further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The retailer's shares rose 1.68 percent to 7.25 pesos after
the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's latest restructuring proposal included a
possible equity stake for creditors, the payment of an
undisclosed amount of debt over six to eight years, and asset
sales over two to six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source consulted by Reuters last month said Comerci was
offering to repay $1.45 billion of debt, or about half of what
creditors claim they are owed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About $950 million would come from ongoing operations paid
over seven years, and $500 million would be paid over six years
and would be guaranteed by Comerci's Costco (COST.O) warehouse
retail venture and land reserves, according to the source.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) on Thursday said Highbridge Capital Management LLC co-founder Henry Swieca plans to leave by year end as the big bank completes its takeover of the hedge fund giant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which originally bought a 55 percent stake in Highbridge in 2004 for $1.3 billion, has been increasing its ownership over the past five years. In the latest move, it will raise its stake from 77.5 percent for undisclosed terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan did not return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swieca and Glenn Dubin, Highbridge chief executive and co-founder, will retain small stakes in the firm. At the time of the deal, both executives agreed to stay on for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swieca is leaving to pursue "other opportunities" in financial services after a transition period ending late this year, the firm said. The departure will end his 17 years at Highbridge and a 25-year partnership with Dubin, a childhood friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big bank's alliance with Highbridge has been one of the most successful in the hedge fund industry, as the New York-based unit remained independent and key personnel stayed with the firm. Dubin, JPMorgan noted, will continue in his CEO role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm's assets under management have tripled over the past five years to $21 billion, while employment more than doubled to 310 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm has expanded into new markets and regions of the world to make Highbridge one of the world's largest hedge fund managers. The unit also has built up a traditional asset management business and launched a business of making principal investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund, like others in the industry, posted poor performance last year and suffered a wave of redemptions. Assets under management plunged by more than half last year from $44.7 billion to $17 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highbridge's flagship fund fell 25 percent in 2008, and the firm stopped clients from withdrawing all their cash. The firm has rebounded in the first half this year, as the main fund has climbed 17 percent through May and total assets surged to $21 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt;June 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it is becoming
incrementally more positive on U.S. regulated utilities given
their valuation levels versus historical trends, the interest
rate environment, and the group's relative underperformance
versus the Standard  Poor's 500 .SPX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The subsector is down 12 percent year-to-date, while the
SP 500 which is up almost 4 percent over the same period,
analyst Michael Lapides wrote in a research note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The consensus forecasts have come down after first-quarter
2009 reporting and seem in line with our estimates, thereby
removing the negative earnings-per-share revision overhang on
the group," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lapides believes the current interest rate environment
should favor the group as the regulated utilities' dividend
yield of 5.7 percent looks attractive versus an expected
10-year Treasury yield of 2.8 to 3.0 percent as forecast by
Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Share prices of regulated utilities generally benefit from
low interest rate environments, said the analyst, who remained
"neutral" on the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, we expect weak near-term electricity demand will
continue to weigh on revenues as demand declined approximately
3 percent in the first few months of 2009, and second-half of
2009 and 2010 growth will be below trend," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lapides upgraded Great Plains Energy Inc (GXP.N) to "buy"
from "neutral" and said the company was one his top picks among
the small- and mid-cap regulated utilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He downgraded Portland General Electric Co (POR.N) to
"neutral" from "buy" on valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP.N) remained the
analyst's favorite among large-cap stocks within his coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lapides reiterated his "conviction sell" rating on
Consolidated Edison Inc (ED.N) and "sell" rating on NStar
NST.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For alerts, please double-click on [ID:WNAB8759] .

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

99 Cents Only`s Strong Results

Today, 99 Cents Only Stores (NYSE: NDN) reported strong results for its fiscal
fourth quarter. NDN's revenue rose 13%, to $329.2 million from $290.5 million,
while same-store sales increased 6.2%. The company earned $7 million, or
$0.10/share, up from a loss of $4.4 million, or $0.06/share in the year-ago
quarter. The Zacks consensus called for sales of $317 million and EPS of $0.05. 

The earnings upside was due to product margin improvements and cost-cutting
efforts. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, NDN's gross margin rose 210 bps
to 39.9%; selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation)
as a percentage of sales fell 360 bps; and its operating margin increased 630
bps to 3.0%. These results include the company's operations in Texas, which the
company is in the process of exiting. The company's operations outside of Texas
were even better. 

Looking ahead, the company believes it can increase its gross margin to 40.5%
and its operating margin to at least 5% by fiscal year 2012. Based on annual
sales of $1.45 billion, the company would have earnings power of $0.70 per
share. That is an over 200% increase in earnings per share from fiscal year
2009. 

We think that EPS forecast could turn out to be conservative if the company
decides to increase its store openings more than expected in the next few years.
The retailer currently operates 271 stores in California, Arizona, Nevada and
Texas, where it is still has 34 stores. 

While we wouldn't chase the stock here (it is up about 16% after its fourth
quarter earnings release), we would become more positive on the stock after a
decent pullback. 

In our view, 99 Cents Only Stores should be able to deliver higher earnings
growth than most of the stocks in retail industry. That growth will come from a
growing trend of consumers looking to become more frugal and trading down to
lower-cost alternatives of the things they need to buy. Other stores that will
benefit from this trend toward frugality include Big Lots (NYSE: BIG) and Family
Dollar (NYSE: FDO). 

Beige Book Blues

"Labor market conditions continued to be weak across the country, with wages
generally remaining flat or falling. Two Districts also mentioned employers'
plans to scale back employee benefit programs. The Atlanta, Chicago and St.
Louis Districts reported that some state and local governments faced hiring
freezes or outright job cuts.

"While manufacturing employment levels remained low, some Districts saw signs
that job losses may be moderating. With few exceptions, Districts reported that
prices at all stages of production were generally flat or falling. The notable
exception to the downward pressure on prices was the widely-reported increase in
oil prices."

Expect labor market conditions to stay weak for some time now. Flat or falling
wages will keep retail sales soft and consumer focused on less expensive
necessities. The good news is that for now, core inflation is not going to be a
problem. 

Rising oil prices will make headline inflation a bit more problematic. Dollars
going to Exxon (NYSE: XOM) at the pump cannot be spent at J.C. Penney (NYSE:
JCP) for more discretionary goods.

Inventory Drop Supports Oil Rally

A bigger-than-expected drop in crude oil inventories and the seasonal uptick in
gasoline demand is helping sustain the spectacular rally in crude oil prices
that has pushed the commodity to a new high for the year. 

While an improving economic outlook and favorable currency moves account for the
bulk of the commodity's gains, recent moves on the inventory front have also
been helpful. Crude oil stockpiles, still at multi-year highs, have been
steadily coming down over the last few weeks. Including today's report from the
Energy Information Administration (EIA), crude oil inventories have dropped in
four of the last five weeks. 

We continue to believe that there are good fundamental underpinnings for the
ongoing oil rally. We continue to favor early-cycle leverage through oilfield
service names, such as Weatherford (NYSE: WFT) and Ensco (NYSE: ESV). Our
long-term favorites remain Exxon (NYSE: XOM), Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) and
Diamond Offshore (NYSE: DO).

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, June 11 (Reuters) - Alaska officials said
Thursday an announcement was imminent on a deal that would have
energy giant Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) team up with
Calgary-based TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO) to design and possibly
build a long-sought Alaska natural gas pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; An announcement by the companies and Gov. Sarah Palin was
expected as early as Thursday morning, said State Sen. Lesil
McGuire, an Anchorage Republican who chairs the Senate Energy
Committee and co-chairs the Senate Natural Resources Committee.
However, details were not clear, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It could be Friday. It could be next week," McGuire said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State Sen. Bill Wielechowski, an Anchorage Democrat who
co-chairs the resources committee with McGuire, said rumors
have been swirling about a pending deal between Exxon and
TransCanada, which holds a state license to build the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials at Exxon Mobil and TransCanada were not
immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a deal is struck, it would be a good sign for the
project because it brings one of the major North Slope oil
producers into the planning process, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Already, the other two major producers, BP (BP.L) and
ConocoPhillips (COP.N), are pursuing a competing proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If there is a proposed Exxon-TransCanada deal, I do think
that's a positive step," Wielechowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project, expected to cost at least $30 billion, would
allow North Slope oil producers to sell natural gas that is
currently stranded within the Arctic Alaska oil fields. The
pipeline would run about 1,700 miles from Prudhoe Bay to an
existing pipeline hub in Alberta, and would deliver 4 billion
to 4.5 billion cubic feet a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Government and industry officials have been trying for
three decades to make the Alaska natural gas pipeline a
reality, but poor economics have long precluded the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TransCanada last year was granted a state license for the
pipeline under a competitive bidding process championed by
Palin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bidding process, under a Palin-sponsored law called the
Alaska Gasline Inducement Act, offered a $500 million state
subsidy and a pledge that the state would not negotiate with
any competitors as long as a series of state-sanction
commitments were met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under terms of the license, TransCanada will hold an open
season next year seeking pledges from potential natural-gas
shippers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BP-ConocoPhillips project, called "Denali," has been
designed outside of the AGIA process. Like TransCanada, the
Denali group intends to formally solicit customers next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The North Slope holds known reserves of about 35 trillion
cubic feet, the largest proven but untapped conventional
natural gas reserves in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the 32 years that crude oil has flowed down the
trans-Alaska oil pipeline for shipment to Lower 48 refineries,
there has never been a method to ship that resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wielechowski said an Exxon commitment to the gas pipeline
would validate the competitive bidding process pursued by Palin
and embraced by most legislators.

&lt;p&gt;Global Phase 3 Clinical Program Enrolling Patients
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer announced today that data from two new mid-stage clinical studies of the
company`s oral JAK-3 inhibitor, CP-690,550, showed statistically significant
response versus placebo for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Data from
these two Phase 2 trials and one ongoing open-label safety study are being
presented this week at the 10th Annual Congress of the European League Against
Rheumatism (EULAR). These results confirm findings from two previously reported
Phase 2 studies in RA and have been used to support dose selection for Phase 3. 

Dose-Ranging with CP-690,550 Alone

Data presented from a 12-week interim analysis of a six-month, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study (Study A3921035), which evaluated 384 patients with
active RA who had not responded to a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug
(DMARD), such as methotrexate, showed that patients treated with 5, 10 and 15 mg
twice-daily doses of CP-690,550 experienced statistically significantly superior
outcomes compared to placebo. 

"This compound could represent a promising advance in rheumatoid arthritis
treatment for patients who need an alternative to currently available
therapies," said Michael Berelowitz, MD, Senior Vice President Clinical
Development and Medical Affairs for Pfizer Specialty Care. "The size of our
comprehensive Phase 2 program enabled us to identify doses for advancement into
late-stage clinical trials." 

The primary endpoint of the study was ACR 20 response rate, which signifies a 20
percent improvement in tender and swollen joint counts as well as other
criteria, at Week 12. ACR 20 responses for the 3, 5, 10 and 15 mg twice-daily
doses were statistically significantly superior (49.0 percent, 63.3 percent,
75.4 percent, 75.4 percent) versus patients treated with placebo (28.8 percent),
and these differences were seen as early as week two. In addition, statistically
significantly superior responses were also seen in ACR 50 response rates for the
5, 10 and 15 mg twice daily doses and in the ACR 70 response rates for the 10
and 15 mg twice-daily doses. The study included adalimumab as an active control.


In this study, most commonly-reported treatment-emergent adverse events were
urinary tract infections, diarrhea, bronchitis, and headache. All of these
adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Serious adverse events and
adverse events leading to discontinuation were infrequent. Significant,
dose-dependent decreases in mean neutrophil counts and increases in mean LDL,
HDL, total cholesterol and mean serum creatinine were consistent with what had
been observed in previous studies of CP-690,550 in RA. 

CP-690,550 with Methotrexate in Japanese Patients

In addition, data from a three-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
(Study A3921039) evaluating 136 Japanese patients whose RA was active despite
ongoing treatment with methotrexate demonstrated that patients treated with 1,
3, 5 and 10 mg doses of CP-690,550 in addition to stable background methotrexate
experienced statistically significantly superior ACR 20 response rates compared
to methotrexate plus placebo. The primary endpoint was ACR 20 response rate at
week 12. 

All doses (1, 3, 5 and 10 mg) were statistically significantly superior by week
12 (64.3 percent, 77.8 percent, 96.3 percent and 80.8 percent) compared to
methotrexate plus placebo (14.3 percent) and these differences were seen as
early as week two. In addition, secondary endpoints for the ACR 70 response
rates with the 5 mg and 10 mg doses (33.3 percent, 34.6 percent) at week 12 were
statistically significantly superior compared to methotrexate plus placebo (3.6
percent). 

In this study, most commonly-reported treatment-emergent adverse events were
nasopharyngitis, increased liver transaminases, increased blood cholesterol, and
stomach discomfort. All of these adverse events were mild or moderate in
severity. Serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation
were infrequent. Significant, dose-dependent decreases in mean neutrophil counts
and increases in mean LDL, HDL, total cholesterol and mean serum creatinine were
consistent with what had been observed in previous studies of CP-690,550 in RA. 

Ongoing, Long-term, Open Label Safety Study

Data from an ongoing, long-term, open label safety study (Study A3921024) were
also presented. In this interim analysis, CP-690,550 showed a safety profile
similar to that observed in previous randomized trials. Most adverse events were
mild or moderate. Most frequently reported adverse events (greater than or equal
to 1.5 percent) were urinary tract infection, diarrhea, anemia, nausea and
sinusitis. 

All studies were sponsored by Pfizer Inc. 

Phase 3 Program in RA Currently Enrolling Patients

Pfizer`s Specialty Care Business Unit initiated a large, global Phase 3 clinical
program with CP-690,550 in RA in February 2009 and is exploring the compound as
a potential treatment for other autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis and
inflammatory bowel disease and for solid organ transplant. 

About CP-690,550

CP-690,550 is an oral, selective, potent inhibitor of the JAK family of enzymes,
which are involved in numerous inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including
RA. By inhibiting these enzymes, which affect the signaling of multiple
cytokines (proteins released by cells to communicate with other cells) that are
involved in a broad spectrum of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, treatment
with CP-690,550 may lead to clinically meaningful improvement for patients. 

CP-690,550 was invented at Groton labs.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) Microsoft Corp is getting ready to unveil a long-anticipated free anti-virus service for personal computers that will compete with products sold by Symantec Corp and McAfee Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokesman said on Wednesday that the world's biggest software maker is testing an early version of the product with its own employees. Microsoft would "soon" make a trial version, or product beta, available via its website, he added, but declined to provide a specific date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symantec shares fell 0.5 percent on Nasdaq and McAfee fell 1.3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, while Microsoft was up 2.1 percent. The Nasdaq composite index was down 0.47 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are closely monitoring the free service, code-named Morro after Brazil's Morro de Sao Paolo beach, amid concern it could hurt sales of products from Symantec and McAfee, which generate billions of dollars of revenue a year protecting Windows PCs from attacks by hackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a long-term competitive threat," said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets, though he added that the near-term impact was minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said that Morro will offer basic features for fighting a wide range of viruses, which would likely make it comparable to low-end consumer products from Symantec and McAfee that cost about $40 per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their top-selling products are security suites that come with features including encryption, firewalls, password protection, parental controls and data backup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, Microsoft entered that market with Live OneCare, which turned out to be a commercial flop. It announced plans in November to kill that product suite, saying it would launch the free Morro service by the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said they are looking forward to Morro's beta to see exactly how its features compare to those in products from competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it will provide protection from several types of malicious software including viruses, spyware, rootkits and trojans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials with Symantec and McAfee have said they do not see Morro as a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's free product is basically a stripped down version of the OneCare product Microsoft pulled from the shelves," said Symantec Consumer division president Janice Chaffin. "A full Internet security suite is what consumers require today to stay fully protected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joris Evers, a spokesman for No. 2 security software maker McAfee, said his company is already enjoying strong growth despite competition from free anti-virus products that are on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On a level playing field, we are confident in our ability to compete with anyone who might enter the marketplace," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Trend Micro Inc, the No. 3 player, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Brian Moss, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded the European
capital goods sector to "attractive" from "neutral" saying
current share prices offer an attractive entry point into the
sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "While upcoming second-quarter results are likely to
highlight once again the current difficult operating
environment for capital goods companies, we believe this is the
right time to use any share price weakness to build positions
in the sector," Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note dated
June 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman sees potential for a structurally higher share of
fixed investment in global GDP, allowing the capital goods
sector to continue to grow at two times the global trend GDP in
the next up-cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fixed investment cycle is a key driver for the capital
goods sector, said Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our economists expect resilient domestic demand growth from
emerging markets, particularly the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India
and China), to be one of the driving forces of an export-led
recovery in advanced economies over the next couple of years,"
said Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also upgraded Electrolux AB (ELUXb.ST) and Sandvik
AB (SAND.ST) to "buy" from "sell" and added the companies to

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Opens IBM's first rail innovation centre &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Sees opportunities in China's $731 bln railway spending &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Eying joint ventures, other cooperative arrangements &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Michael Wei and Kirby Chien &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    BEIJING, June 11 (Reuters) -IBM's (IBM.N) first rail innovation centre will help it tap into China's 5 trillion yuan ($731 billion) spending in the sector, the firm said on Thursday at the centre's official opening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The products and services developed at the centre for China also could be applied to markets around the world, said Keith Dierkx, the director of the Global Rail Innovation Centre, which opened in Beijing on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "If you can build them for China, everything else is easier," Dierkx told Reuters in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM is working extensively with China's Ministry of Railways on projects dealing with system optimisation, digital video surveillance and asset management programs, he said, adding that IBM hopes the initial advisory role will develop into other commercial opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "There are potentially joint-venture types of things that could be done," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    China's planned investment over the next two years could make up more than half of the world's total railway equipment market, consisting of mostly rolling stock and wagons, according to consultancy McKinsey &amp; Co. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The rising populations of the world's major cities are straining transportation networks and energy resources, forcing state planners to consider building smart and efficient infrastructure to cope with the challenges, Dierkx said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM commissioned a report two years ago on railroads as investors such as Warren Buffett took big stakes in Northern Santa Fe Corp BNI.N and Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N), and knew that "something was going to happen" in the industry, Dierkx said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Rail obviously has a high level of focus for IBM," he said, without detailing the sector's contribution to IBM's business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Railroads were not good investments for a long time, but now investors realise railways can ease urban traffic congestion, improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM said in March that Netherlands Railways was using IBM products to match schedules of more than 4,800 trains per day with forecasts of passenger traffic across its system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For its part, China plans to spend $731 billion until 2020, adding 41,000 km &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(25,480 miles) to its already massive rail network, as the government tries to boost domestic demand and ease strains on a jammed system. [nPEK280781] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Beijing has also been spending billions to build out its air and water transport networks, hoping to improve access to China's vast and underdeveloped inland regions.  "In terms of their commitment and in terms of their vision, they intend to be a global leader," said Dierkx, referring to Beijing's ambitious plans to modernise its rail network. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM will be looking at a broad range of collaborative efforts with China in the rail sector, starting with the new centre and a focus, at least initially, as an adviser. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    McKinsey said the railroad industry is the heart and soul of China's economic development, and the severe winter storms last year that paralysed a large swath of the country's rail system was a wakeup call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "China needs greater efficiency and reliability in its railway system," said Evan Auyang, an associate partner at McKinsey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    About half of China's railway system is dedicated to hauling coal -- the source of about 75 percent of the country's electricity -- while 90 percent transports bulk cargo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    McKinsey reckons that foreign commercial participation in China's railway system is only about 1.5 percent currently and even domestic private investment is only 5 percent, percentages that could rise sharply as Beijing modernises its rail network. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Editing by Ken Wills) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  ($=6.83 yuan) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((michael.wei@thomsonreuters.com; +8610 6627 1003; Reuters Messaging: michael.wei.reuters.com@reuters.net)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((If you have a query or comment on this story, send an email to news.feedback.asia@thomsonreuters.com)) Keywords: IBM CHINA/RAILCENTRE  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - North Korea has suspended visas for tourists from Britain, a Beijing-based travel agency said, citing the state-run travel company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The head of oil company Chevron Corp said efforts to cut U.S. carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050 were unrealistic because so much current energy infrastructure would have to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES/LONDON (Hollywood Reporter) - "OceanWorld 3D," an underwater film that promises to be the first feature-length nature documentary filmed and released in 3-D, has signed a distribution deal with Disneynature, a unit of Walt Disney Studios devoted to nature films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disneynature has acquired North American and Mexican distribution rights to "OceanWorld," in a deal that marks its first collaboration with 3D Entertainment, a company founded in 2001 to produce story-driven 3-D experiences for audiences of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film, in which viewers are guided by a sea turtle from the Great Barrier Reef in Australia to Mexico's Roca Partida Island, is the result of seven years of production, 25 international expeditions and 200 hours of 3-D footage shot in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"OceanWorld," a presentation by Jean-Michel Cousteau, son of the legendary ocean explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, was directed and produced, respectively, by veteran filmmakers Jean-Jacques and Francois Mantello. They have made such water-themed movies as "Sharks 3D," "Ocean Wonderland 3D" and "Dolphins and Whales 3D: Tribes of the Ocean."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 85-minute film premiered at the Cannes festival last month. It will be released theatrically in France and Russia in August; its North American unveiling will come later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disneynature's first film, "Earth," opened in April in the U.S. and has grossed more than $106 million worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sheri Linden at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

said on Friday it had attacked one of Chevron's (CVX.N) oil
pipelines in the Niger Delta and threatened to sabotage another
facility operated by the U.S. energy company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND)

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

IEA Raises Oil Demand Forecast

While we have confidence in the economic underpinning of the current rally, a
souring of the global economic outlook remains a key risk factor. Also, given
the weak near-term supply-demand fundamentals, coupled with ample excess
production capacity within OPEC, there is limited room for a price spike at this
stage. 

The major international integrated oil companies, such Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and
global oilfield service players, such as Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) and
Weatherford (NYSE: WFT) are well placed to capitalize on this outlook. 

New Unemployment Claims Down

How do people cope with being out of work for an extended period of time,
especially after the benefits have run out? Well, first they tap their savings
-- but given the extremely low savings rates over the past several years, those
are likely depleted very fast. To the extent they were held in the market, the
recent rebound has helped, but the S 500 is still 31% lower than it was a year
ago. In the past, people might have tapped the equity in their houses to get by,
but the housing ATM long ago shut down. 

The only thing left is to run up the credit card balance. However, when they get
maxed-out, the only resort is to default and go into bankruptcy. Rapidly
increasing credit card defaults are going to be a serious problem for banks with
big exposures to credit cards like Capitol One (NYSE: COF) and American Express
(NYSE: AXP).

&lt;p&gt; * Refinery upgrade hangs in balance, judge ruling awaited&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Part of wider push to refine oil containing more sulfur&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Chevron: 1,100 jobs at risk, permits easier elsewhere&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RICHMOND, Calif., June 12 (Reuters) - Far from Chevron
Corp's (CVX.N) politically charged court battle in the
Ecuadorean jungle, the U.S. oil company faces a legal tussle in
its own backyard over an upgrade to its oldest refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A judge ruled that the environmental impact report for the
San Francisco Bay refinery upgrade was inadequate, which was
hailed by the environmental campaigners who brought the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The expansion at the 107-year-old Richmond refinery, which
will both make it more efficient and more flexible, is part of
a broader Chevron drive to improve profit margins on refining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Chief Executive David O'Reilly expressed frustration
this week at the judge's decision, while also floating the
possibility of the project being halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're in the middle of construction, so this is a very
difficult issue for us," O'Reilly told reporters after a debate
on environmental issues on Wednesday night in San Francisco.
[ID:nN10466283]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We haven't reached a final decision yet, but this is what
I think is wrong with California, where people are ... worried
about the gasoline price, and yet can't allow a project to be
built after four years of hearings and permits," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Construction of the new hydrogen plant at Richmond, which
started last September and will allow it to process crude with
higher sulfur content, has not stopped so far. According to
officials at the refinery, the project employs 1,100 people on
top of the 2,700 employees and 890 contractors who work there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "My greatest concern is that we may stop the work and lay
off 1,000 or more people at a time when people need jobs,"
O'Reilly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is a serious worry in the largely working-class area.
As of April, Richmond had 15.6 percent unemployment among its
54,100-strong workforce, while nearly a fifth of the workers in
neighboring San Pablo were out of a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Will Rostov of Earthjustice said this week there was a good
case for the project permits to be withdrawn. [ID:nN09381207]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOCAL PROBLEM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, is making similar
uprades to its other U.S. refineries, but O'Reilly said it had
not encountered the same sort of resistance elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Frankly we are having much more success getting permits in
other places than we are here in Richmond," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Chevron has not spelled out a specific business case
for the upgrades, there is a broader industry push to do so
because the average barrel of crude oil contains more sulfur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consequently, "sour" crude containing more sulfur has
traded at an average per-barrel discount of $3 to sweet crudes
since 2000, Credit Suisse analysts said in a report on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decision last week by Contra Costa County Judge Barbara
Zuniga hinged on the wording of the environmental impact report
(EIR) and the lack of specifics on crude oil measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plaintiffs worry the upgrade will lead to more pollution
because the refinery will process heavier crude oil. Chevron
argues that the density of the crude will not change, even if
the sulfur does, while staying within the permitted range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As stated in the EIR: "It is reasonably foreseeable that
Chevron would run a crude slate similar to that which is
currently processed at the refinery - but in a mixture that has
higher sulfur levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zuniga said the words 'reasonably foreseeable' and
'similar' detracted from the statement's certainty, and wanted
more current figures on the oil processed to determine whether
or not that changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industrial gas supplier Praxair Inc (PX.N) is building the
hydrogen plant and would operate it. A pipeline would run to
nearby refineries owned by ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) to deliver excess hydrogen, but Zuniga
also said the EIR did not properly account for its impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zuniga's decision on whether or not to stop construction in
the $1 billion project, which began last September, is now
awaited. But no further dates in the case have been set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is "Communities for a Better Environment v City of
Richmond" in the Contra Costa County Superior Court of
California, case no. MSN08-1429.

&lt;p&gt; * Imperial says no change in plan to advance Mackenzie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says economics would suffer if two pipes built at once&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Exxon, parent of Imperial, has interest in both projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jeffrey Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CALGARY, Alberta, June 12 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's
(XOM.N) backing of an Alaska pipeline does not change plans for
proponents of the C$16.2 billion ($14.5 billion) Mackenzie gas
line as they struggle to move past delays and rising costs, the
lead partner of the Canadian project said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, if the massive Alaska pipeline gains enough
momentum with Exxon Mobil's participation to put construction
on similar schedules, the already-fragile economics of
Mackenzie would suffer, Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO) said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The announcement yesterday doesn't change our approach to
advancing the project at all," Imperial spokesman Pius
Rolheiser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The proponent group remains committed to our project and
we're focused on doing the work that we can, and that includes
completing the regulatory process, completing the fiscal
discussion with the government and completing access and
benefits agreements with the First Nations along the pipeline
route."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil said on Thursday it agreed to support
TransCanada Corp's (TRP.TO) plans for a $26 billion pipeline to
Alberta from Alaska, which would allow it to tap its gas
reserves in Alaska's North Slope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The effort has the blessing and some financial backing from
the state of Alaska, and loan guarantees from Washington may
soon be raised to $30 billion from $18 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil also has an interest in Mackenzie, which would
carry up to 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas a day to Alberta from
the Mackenzie Delta on the Beaufort Sea. Besides its stake in
the project, the U.S. oil major owns 69.6 percent of Imperial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ottawa has said North America will ultimately require gas
from both projects, but it wants Mackenzie developed first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Should the two projects proceed in the same time frame, it
would obviously put greater economic strain on the (Mackenzie)
project," Rolheiser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TransCanada, which is also involved in both, has said it
aims to have the Alaska project in service by 2018. Imperial
had set a 2014 in-service date for Mackenzie in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since then, the regulatory process has dragged for the
Mackenzie pipeline, whose backers also include Royal Dutch
Shell (RDSa.L), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and the Aboriginal
Pipeline Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late last year, the panel weighing the line's social and
environmental impacts said it aimed to deliver its report by
December 2009, months past the previous deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Imperial and its partners are negotiating with
the Canadian government over a fiscal package, which
Environment Minister Jim Prentice offered in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With it, Ottawa would foot the bill for roads, airstrips
and other infrastructure, among other aspects of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There has been no agreement on that package, and Rolheiser
declined to say what the stumbling blocks are, or if the Alaska
project's new momentum would mean Ottawa may have to increase
its contribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For its part, Exxon Mobil has said its support for the
Alaska project does not preclude its involvement in Mackenzie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "From my understanding there's no change in our efforts to
progress Mackenzie," Marty Massey, Exxon Mobil's U.S. joint
interest manager, said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=$1.12 Canadian)

outcome it would have no impact on Internet Explorer's dominant
role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Then we would be very disappointed. That means Microsoft's
dominant position will continue," Wium Lie said, adding
operating systems should be sold with several browsers -- giving
consumers the choice -- not with no browsers at all.

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects first paragraph to show Windows will be sold in
Europe without Internet Explorer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, June 11 (Reuters) - The European Commission said
on Thursday a move by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to ship the newest
version of its Windows system in Europe without Internet
Explorer could be detrimental to consumer choice but may have
benefits in the computer manufacturer channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "...The Commission had suggested to Microsoft that consumers
be provided with a choice of web browsers," the Commission,
which is shortly due to rule on antitrust charges brought
against Microsoft, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Instead Microsoft has apparently decided to supply retail
consumers with a version of Windows without a web browser at
all. Rather than more choice, Microsoft seems to have chosen to
provide less."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As for sales to computer manufacturers, Microsoft's
proposal may potentially be more positive," it added, noting
that computer manufacturers would appear to be able to choose to
install Internet Explorer or another browser.

&lt;p&gt; * Chevron says output not affected by pipeline damage * Delta State's Makaraba pipeline breached, fire at facility   (Adds Chevron quote, background) By Randy Fabi ABUJA, June 13 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron (CVX.N) confirmed one of its Nigerian oil pipelines was damaged on Friday in the Niger Delta, but output was unaffected as the infrastructure had been shut down before the incident. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), Nigeria's main militant group, said late Friday it attacked the Chevron pipelines and threatened to sabotage another facility operated by the U.S. oil company in the region. There was a breach on the Makaraba-Utonana-Abiteye pipeline and fire at its Makaraba Jacket 5 facility in Delta State, Chevron spokesman Scott Walker said on Saturday. MEND, which has declared an all-out war against the military last month, has also threatened to attack a Chevron oil facility near the company's Escravos crude oil complex. [ID:nLC499553] The militant group seems to be targeting Chevron-operated facilities. It bombed an oil pipeline on May 24 that led to a loss in output of 100,000 barrels per day. [ID:nLP693007] The group also said it sabotaged Chevron's Otunana pumping station in Delta state on Tuesday, but the military denied any attack occurred. [ID:nLA242679] Our workforce is safe, relevant stakeholders have been informed and we are continuing to assess the situation, Walker said. Foreign companies in sectors ranging from telecoms to construction, as well as the oil industry, have already reduced staffing levels, particularly among expatriates seen at high risk of kidnap, and tightened security measures. Violence in the Niger Delta, home to Africa's biggest oil and gas industry, has slashed one fifth of Nigeria's oil production in the last three years. Militants have repeatedly targeted Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSa.L) facilities in the past three years as many of their pipelines and oil pumping stations are located in communities hostile to foreign oil firms. MEND said it is fighting for a fairer share of the wealth in the Niger Delta, but the breakdown in law and order has given criminal gangs an opportunity to profit from oil theft and kidnapping for ransom. Last month, the military launched its biggest offensive for years, bombarding rebel camps from the air and sea and sending three battalions of troops to hunt down rebels believed to have fled into surrounding communities.

&lt;p&gt;HANOI, June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron (CVX.N)
expects its natural gas project in Vietnam to be delayed until
late 2014 due to prolonged negotiations over gas prices with
oil monopoly Petrovietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron said last year it wanted to start gas production in
2012 from the project off the southwest coast of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The weekly Vietnam Investment Review quoted Chevron's
Vietnam representative, Jim Ollen, as saying the negotiations
with Petrovietnam were "progressing well".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A company official reached by telephone at the Chevron
representative office in Hanoi confirmed the details in the
report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "First production is expected in 2014, instead of 2012,"
she said, declining to elaborate. Ollen was not immediately
available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report also quoted Ollen as saying reference prices
provided by the Asian Development Bank of $5.8 to $8.2 per
million British thermal units could help the two companies
reach an agreement on prices soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, which has a 43 percent stake in the development,
would invest up to $2 billion in the $4 billion project that
includes a gas pipeline and power plants, Ollen was quoted as
saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other investors in the project, which comprises Blocks B,
48/95 and 52/97, include Thailand's PTTEP PTTE.BK and Japan's
Mitsui Oil.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeating to additional subscribers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By John Irish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUBAI, June 14 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's
largest drugmaker, is looking to conclude deals in emerging
markets over coming months to raise its share of a market worth
an estimated $80 billion, an executive said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly turning their
attention to developing nations as they face tougher conditions
in more mature markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drugmaker struck a $68 billion deal in January to
acquire U.S. rival Wyeth to help shore up profits and in May
signed licensing agreements with two Indian-based companies,
including Aurobindo Pharma Ltd, as it seeks new growth
opportunities in generics and emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will have other elements in the next few months,"
Pfizer's emerging market business unit president Jean-Michel
Halfon told Reuters when asked if the company was eyeing new
acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see opportunities coming from the financial crisis ...
opportunities to build partnerships in emerging markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Halfon declined to give further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer is seeking to add $3 billion in annual sales by 2012
in developing markets and is targeting China, Brazil, Mexico,
Russia, Turkey, India and to a lesser extent the Middle East to
help lift its 4 percent market share, Halfon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We start in position number three in emerging markets and
we want to be No. 1."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The emerging markets pie could increase to $120 billion by
2012 with China providing the greatest growth prospects, Halfon
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group saw 28 percent growth in sales in the world's
most populous nation in the first quarter, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, which posted $48 billion in revenue last year,
faces severe sales declines in the coming years from patent
expirations to its own products, including its blockbuster
Lipitor cholesterol treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has responded with the purchase of Wyeth, which Halfon
said the company was looking to complete "somewhere in the
fourth quarter," and the restructuring of its operating model
around separate units including generic drugs and emerging
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in a very competitive environment and need to make
decisions very fast in this area, so an example of what we're
doing is managing the acquisition of Wyeth ... It will add
significant revenues to our organisation in emerging markets by
adding footprint in vaccines, biological medicine ..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Halfon said he expected growth in the Middle East of about
10 percent to 12 percent over the next five years as
opportunities arise from sustained economic activity in the
world's largest oil exporting region.

&lt;p&gt; * Exxon ordered to pay 5.9 pct interest on 1996 judgment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Company ordered to pay own legal fees for appeal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Court affirms amount of punitive damages at $507.5 mln
 (Adds comments from plaintiffs' attorney, no comment from
Exxon, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, June 15 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on
Monday ordered Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) to pay 5.9 percent
interest back to 1996 on a judgment in the Valdez oil spill off
Alaska's coast, and to pay its own legal fees for the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an opinion on Monday, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
also affirmed the amount of punitive damages at $507.5 million
that Exxon must pay related to the 1989 spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon had previously agreed to pay that amount in
compensatory damages to fishermen, Alaska natives, business
owners and others who bore the economic brunt of the worst oil
spill in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A jury had awarded the litigants $5 billion in punitive
damages in 1996, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year
that the maximum ratio of punitive to compensatory damages was
1:1 under maritime law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon already has paid the $507.5 million in compensatory
damages and $383 million toward punitive damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jeffrey Fisher, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said
Monday's opinion added about $500 million in interest to the
punitive damages award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the opinion, Exxon had asked the court to
order the plaintiffs to pay all or at least 90 percent of
Exxon's legal fees for the appeal. The opinion said those fees
amounted to nearly $70 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a split decision, both parties were ordered to pay their
own legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The appeals court judge who dissented on the legal fees
noted in his opinion that to insure the original $5 billion
punitive damages verdict, Exxon had to pay $60.6 million to
several banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three judges were on the appeals panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon spokesman said the company was reviewing the
opinion and had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Exxon Valdez supertanker ran aground in Price William
Sound, leaking 11 million gallons of crude oil and blackening
1,200 miles of Alaska's coastline. The clean-up alone cost
around $2.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fisher said the ruling marks "the last real piece of the
case" except for some "minor side issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think they ought to pay now," he said.
 The case is In Re: The Exxon Valdez, No. 04-35182, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Exxon Throws Weight Behind Alaskan Pipeline

Exxon (NYSE: XOM) has finally decided to throw its weight behind the TransCanada
Corp. (NYSE: TRP)-sponsored Alaska Pipeline project that will bring stranded
Alaskan natural gas to consuming markets in the U.S. Lower 48. TransCanada`s
1,700 mile, 48-inch diameter pipeline has the support of the Alaskan and
Canadian governments. The Alaska government passed legislation last year that
would subsidize the initial project costs by up to $500 million. 

While details of the deal between the two companies were not released, it is
expected that TRP will remain the project`s operator. This pipeline, expected to
cost approximately $26 billion to build, would be the largest civil engineering
project in North America. The pipeline would stretch from the North Slope of
Alaska through Yukon and British Columbia to the Alberta border, where it would
be linked to existing infrastructure reaching the U.S. market. 

While a number of companies have natural gas reserves in Alaska, three are the
most important; Exxon, ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) and BP (NYSE: BP). The last
two have been sponsoring their own rival pipeline project. 

Without the inclusion of BP and COP, it would be difficult, if not altogether
impossible for the XOM-TRP project to get off the ground. But with Exxon, the
largest natural gas resource holder in Alaska, getting behind the project, its
prospects have brightened significantly. 

National Semi Results Digested

Yesterday afternoon after the bell, National Semiconductor (NYSE: NSM) reported
results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 ending May 2009. Revenue for
the third quarter was $280.8 million, down -4.0% sequentially and down -39.2%
year over year. 

The gross margin was 59.3%, up 37 bps sequentially. The slight increase was
mostly due to employee layoffs and cost reductions. 

The utilization rate remained very low, increasing from 37% in Q3 to 38% in Q4.
NSM is particularly hit by lower utilization rates as the company manufactures
around 90% of its products in-house.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - One of Wall Street's most influential strategists said on Monday the U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to ratchet back efforts to stimulate the economy soon, and that it was too early to worry about inflation choking off what would likely be a fitful recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby Joseph Cohen, senior investment strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), said the U.S. central bank "would like to do as little as possible for as long as possible" to let the economy regain its footing, and allow businesses to rebuild inventories and invest more. Some analysts believe the Fed may even pursue new measures to further ease credit conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflation fears are "spectacularly premature" in light of rising unemployment and excess supply, Cohen said at the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just don't see that inflation is going to rear its ugly head any time soon," she added. "That doesn't mean we won't see some rebound in some prices," including in some commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen predicted a "dramatic surge" in U.S. corporate profits in the third quarter and especially the fourth quarter from depressed year-earlier levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She expects a slow economic recovery, with annualized growth in gross domestic product of just 1 percent from July to December, in part because consumers are saving more and providing less of a "spunk" to activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen is known for correctly forecasting the bullish run for U.S. stocks during the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Fed having pushed benchmark interest rates to near zero, policymakers have tried other means to stimulate economic activity. The Fed is aggressively buying mortgage securities and other debt to add liquidity, while the Treasury Department has injected hundreds of billions of dollars to prop up banks and insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see anything happening in the short run" to reduce the stimuli, Cohen said. "These were intended to be transitional. (Until policymakers) see that markets are moving normally, and the economy is behaving normally, they're going to be reluctant to reverse what they have done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen added, though: "We have to be very careful in terms of defining what 'normal' is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRAISE FOR OBAMA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the U.S. budget deficit could reach $1.9 trillion in 2009, or 13.2 percent of gross domestic product, Cohen said the percentage could drop to a more manageable 6 percent in a couple of years, like levels in the Reagan administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen praised early efforts by the Obama administration to stimulate the economy, including a focus on energy efficiency, and trying to bolster the U.S. middle class, which has "fallen behind over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have been faced by a series of extraordinary problems, and in general I think they have gone about it in a very good way," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen also praised Ben Bernanke, whose term as Fed chairman ends next January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"History is likely to show that he was an extraordinarily effective Fed chairman," she said. "Financial markets have stabilized, and the economy appears to be moving toward a stable position." She declined to speculate on whether Bernanke will be reappointed chairman when his term ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Herbert Lash; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday ordered Exxon Mobil Corp to pay $507.5 million in punitive damages stemming from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska, plus 5.9 percent interest running from the 1996 trial judgment, the opinion said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team from University of Victoria Takes Winning Approach using Model-Based Design
to Address Real-World Automotive Challenges
NATICK, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
The MathWorks today announced that a student team from the University of
Victoria (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) has won The MathWorks 2009
Modeling Award, given as part of the EcoCAR Challengestudent competition. Chosen
from a field of 11 teams, the University of Victoria students were recognized
for excellence in using Model-Based Design, among other criteria, at EcoCAR`s
Year One Finals in Toronto, Canada. 

To be eligible for the award, teams must be active participants in the 2009
EcoCAR Challenge, a three-year competition organized by the U.S. Department of
Energy and General Motors. Competing teams of university engineering students
each re-engineer a GM Saturn Vue to improve its fuel economy and reduce
emissions. During the first year, the teams use Model-Based Design, an approach
in which a virtual model is at the center of system development, from initial
design and simulation through to testing and implementation. Winners of The
MathWorks Modeling Award are selected on the basis of their team`s innovative
use of modeling and simulation, as demonstrated through a presentation and Q
session, coinciding with the end of Year One of the challenge. 

"Our students have learned to use Model-Based Design in forming our new hybrid
vehicle design with fabulous performance. They developed a comprehensive plan on
model re-use as their designs progressed from Model-in-the-Loop to
Software-in-the-Loop to Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation," said Dr. Zuomin Dong,
one of the faculty advisors of the University of Victoria team. "The team has
benefited from the functions and flexibility provided by SimDriveline in testing
innovative hybrid powertrain architectures. Training provided by The MathWorks
allowed our students to quickly become effective users of modern modeling,
simulation, and optimization tools for addressing automotive technical
challenges. These lessons, gained from participating in the competition, will
benefit them when the time comes to pursue job opportunities and build careers."


"The EcoCAR Challenge is an important avenue by which students are exposed to
real-world automotive engineering practices, such as Model-Based Design,"
explains Liz Callanan, corporate relations manager, The MathWorks. "The
University of Victoria students embodied the spirit of the competition through
the team`s overall command of Model-Based Design." 

The Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (Terre Haute, IN) won second place. The
University of Waterloo (Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) placed third. 

The MathWorks is a key software sponsor for the EcoCAR Challenge and is
committed to advancing education in engineering, science, and math. The company
is donating tools for Model-Based Design, including its core software MATLAB and
Simulink. The company is also delivering intensive training to all student teams
and faculty advisors and providing experienced automotive industry experts as
mentors who work closely with students throughout the three-year competition.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - The dramatic recovery in risk appetite should mean more mergers and capital raisings, and a wave of flotations later this year, according to senior European investment bankers at JPMorgan. (JPM.N)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, JPMorgan also said its investment banking rivals, like investors, were again getting a taste for danger, echoing the "foolishness and foolhardiness" in the years leading up to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are seeing a wall of liquidity in every asset class in the capital markets," Viswas Raghavan, the bank's head of international capital markets, told at a media briefing in London on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time in a long time, every asset class is wide open ... this has not been the case for almost 18 months now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan said the bank was "bracing ourselves for the next IPO wave."

They have been extremely aggressive in their recruiting for the businesses they do not have today," Bombieri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that despite surprisingly bad "teething problems," the combined Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) was likely to prove itself a very strong competitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he was skeptical about Nomura's (8604.T) efforts to build an international investment banking franchise based on the European and Asian operations of Lehman Brothers, and questioned whether Lehman bankers would stay once guaranteed pay packages ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Nomura has a much bigger cultural challenge to resolve," he said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Quentin Webb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - The dramatic recovery in risk

with regards the second half of the year," Cristerna said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When we speak with our clients, there's no question that

"the foolishness and the foolhardiness which accompanied the
raging bull market of two years ago", with rival banks
pressuring prices and margins to win business in equity capital

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following ratings of Exxon Mobil Corporation
(ExxonMobil): 

-- Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AAA'; 

-- Senior unsecured debt at 'AAA'; 

-- Commercial paper at 'F1+'; 

-- Short-term IDR at 'F1+'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. 

The ratings reflect the unsurpassed depth, breadth, and quality of ExxonMobil's
asset portfolio and strong competitive position in all parts of the integrated
oil chain; the company's disciplined returns-based investment focus and
best-in-class ability to generate returns on capital employed (ROCEs) with low
levels of financial leverage; its very strong cash flow generation capability
and historical record of maintaining the highest levels of credit quality
throughout previous cycles in the oil industry; as well as the strategic value
the rating confers on the company in negotiations with National Oil Companies
(NOCs) and other international partners when it comes to long-term deals. 

ExxonMobil's strong cash flows and very low leverage translates into some of the
most robust credit metrics in the industry and across the corporate sector. At
March 31, 2009, total debt was just $9.2 billion, down modestly from the $9.43
billion level seen at year-end 2008. The company had just under $25 billion of
cash and cash equivalents, which exceeded its balance sheet debt by
approximately 2.7 times (x). Cash and equivalents have exceeded debt since 2003.
As calculated by Fitch, free cash flow over the latest 12 months (LTM) period
ending March 31, 2009 was $19.04 billion. Fitch notes that even under the trough
conditions presented in the first quarter of 2009 - with WTI crude bottoming out
at just $43/barrel on average but service costs not significantly reset -
ExxonMobil still earned $2.25 billion in free cash flow. Looking forward, Fitch
expects the company will remain meaningfully free cash flow positive in 2009
under Fitch's current stress case assumptions ($40 WTI crude oil, $3.50/mcf
natural gas). 

For the LTM period ending March 31, 2009, ExxonMobil's EBITDA/interest coverage
was 60x, while debt/EBITDA leverage was just 0.1x. 2008 E debt/proven reserves
(excluding equity affiliate and syncrude reserves but allocating 28% of debt to
other operations) was just $0.53 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe), according
to Fitch calculations, among the lowest of all peers in the sector. 2008 reserve
replacement was a respectable 103% on an all-in basis, while three year FD was
a competitive $10.89/boe, well below upstream peers. Distributions to
shareholders remain a sizable use of ExxonMobil's cash. For the LTM ending March
31, 2009, shareholder distributions were approximately $41.5 billion, comprised
of share buybacks of $33.4 billion and dividends of $8.1 billion. Despite their
size, management has indicated that buybacks remain the flywheel in ExxonMobil's
use of cash, and Fitch anticipates that buybacks will continue to be scaled
proportionately in line with organic cash flows. The company's asset retirement
obligation (ARO) is $5.35 billion and is primarily centered on upstream
environmental remediation (well plugging). At Dec. 31, 2008 the funding
shortfall across the company's U.S. and foreign pension funds totaled $15.37
billion. Expected pension contributions for the 2009 are $4.6 billion. 

Downside risks to the rating are limited. While a very large transaction could
in theory place some pressure on credit metrics if it were debt financed, Fitch
does not believe this is a serious concern given the company's huge financial
resources, its general reluctance to grow through debt-financed acquisitions,
and its conservative track record in financing the few deals it has done (note
the 1999 merger with Mobil was financed conservatively using stock and assumed
debt). 

Worldwide, ExxonMobil is the largest publicly traded integrated oil company in
terms of proven oil &amp; gas reserves, with some 21.2 billion boe proven reserves
(including equity affiliates). Total book assets at March 31, 2009 were $222.5
billion. On the upstream side, the company has a large proven reserve base and
production of approximately 3.92 million boepd. Downstream, ExxonMobil is the
largest refiner in the world with approximately 6 million barrels per day of
refining capacity in 37 refineries. The marketing arm of the segment sells
gasoline and other fuels at stations worldwide. The company is also a worldwide
leader in the chemicals business, and a significant portion of its
petrochemicals and lubes capacity is integrated with existing refinery
facilities. Overall, the upstream component of ExxonMobil provides the bulk of
the company's earnings and cash flow. The company is active in more than 200
countries and territories and had a worldwide regular employee count of 79,900
at year-end 2008, excluding company-operated retail site employees (of which
there were 24,800). 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance
and other relevant policies and procedures are also available from the 'Code of
Conduct' section of this site. The issuer did not participate in the rating
process other than through the medium of its public disclosure.

&lt;p&gt;Latest release is the first Social Knowledge Management platform to integrate
SharePoint capabilities-cost-effectively leveraging enterprise knowledge
repositories and resources
WOBURN, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Inmagic today introduced Inmagic&#174;Presto 3.1, the latest version of the company`s
Social Knowledge Management platform with new Microsoft SharePoint
interoperability capabilities. The compatibility allows users to augment and
leverage existing infrastructure and technology investments-extracting
additional value from systems already in place, without compromising access to
content or straining time, budget, or human resources. Other new benefits in
Presto 3.1 include improved collaboration, information discovery, and content
management functionalities driven by customer and market demand. 

"At MRA-The Management Association-we are focused on delivering outstanding and
cost-effective services to our members," says George Blomgren, Director of
Business Systems for MRA. "We chose Presto as the platform on which to make
available tools, templates, and information to our members because of its
robustness and ease-of-use. The Inmagic team is as attuned to customer service
as we are, and truly served as a partner in this project. Members indicate that
the tool is providing the value we had envisioned, thus helping us to fulfill
our mission of member success." 

As organizations increasingly turn to SharePoint for content management
infrastructure needs, they are faced with the question of how to extract the
most value from their investments. The new interoperability capabilities of
Presto 3.1, which include SharePoint-compatible Web Parts and a new Web Services
API, allow Presto 3.1 to easily integrate into an existing SharePoint
environment or other ASP.NET infrastructure. 

"Customers are looking for synergies between widespread infrastructural
technology and solutions focused on solving specific business problems, without
large internal development costs," says Phil Green, CTO of Inmagic. "With
Inmagic Presto 3.1, companies can enhance their SharePoint environment with a
cost-effective, off-the-shelf solution suited to their needs. They can create
internal, secure knowledge communities around enterprise content, with
sophisticated social, search, security, and library workflow capabilities not
found in SharePoint. The use of Web Parts, Presto, and SharePoint together can
deliver tremendous value to an organization`s bottom line." 

Presto 3.1 uses Web Parts technology that allows the search parts on the Presto
homepage to be embedded and used in a SharePoint deployment. A new Web Services
API lets SharePoint communicate with Presto to create, replace, update, and
delete records seamlessly. SharePoint often contributes to the creation of
disconnected information silos. Now, Presto can be used to bring these silos
together, in one location, with a single access portal and search. Presto also
complements SharePoint`s social functionality with "content centric" social
capabilities that are fully searchable and indexable, with built-in controls
that can both enable and disable social features for specific user groups. 

"We are looking forward to Presto 3.1 with great anticipation," says Michael
Payne, City Archivist at the City of Edmonton. "Its enhanced search
capabilities; simplified log-on; and advanced authentication, security, and
networking features will make it simpler to post new material to the Web,
interact with our archives users, and manage our catalog database and Web site
even more effectively." 

Other major new benefits of Presto 3.1 include:

* Enhanced interoperability with existing IT investments 
* Improved collaboration through enhanced social capabilities 
* Faster information discovery for improved individual and organizational
productivity 
* Improved content quality and access

These updates improve information richness, quality, and discoverability across
the enterprise. Presto adds significant value to any organization, either as an
augmentation to an existing SharePoint implementation or as a stand-alone
solution. More information on how Presto 3.1 complements SharePoint technology,
as well as details on the new feature set, can be found at:

* Inmagic Presto 3.1 Web page
* Inmagic Presto and Microsoft SharePoint Integration
* Inmagic Presto/SharePoint position paper

Inmagic Presto 3.1 will be generally available in Q3 of 2009.

&lt;p&gt;June 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Dell Inc
DELL.O to "neutral" and removed the world's No. 2 PC maker
from its Americas sell list, saying it saw cyclical pressures
easing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; PC shipments were rebounding in June, after a
weaker-than-expected May, and PCs should see more normal
seasonal patterns in the back half of the year, Goldman said in
a research note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dell's ongoing efforts to outsource its product development
and manufacturing will likely allow it to maintain or improve
margins over the intermediate term, said Goldman, which has a
price target of $14 on the company's stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Dell reported sharply diminished first-quarter
profit as the downturn hit tech spending, but said there was
hope for a surge in sales next year as corporations replace
their computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the Round Rock, Texas-based company which have
fallen almost 44 percent in the last year, closed at $13.39
Friday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background) ABUJA, June 15 (Reuters) - Nigeria's main militant group said on Monday it had sabotaged an oil pumping station in the Niger Delta operated by Chevron (CVX.N), the fifth attack claimed against the U.S. energy company in less than a month. Chevron facilities in the southern Delta state have become the main target of attacks by the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), which declared an all-out war against the military last month. (Militants) hit the Abiteye flow station operated by Chevron today ... triggering another systems failure which resulted in a massive fire outbreak that is consuming the entire facility, MEND said in an emailed statement. It was not immediately possible to independently verify the statement. Chevron officials were not immediately available for comment. On Saturday, Chevron confirmed damage to its Makaraba-Utonana-Abiteye pipeline and fire at its Makaraba Jacket 5 facility in Delta state. Militants have repeatedly targeted Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) facilities in the past three years as many of their pipelines and oil pumping stations are situated in communities hostile to foreign oil firms.(Reporting by Randy Fabi)

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, June 16 (Reuters) - Mexico's navy has seized more than a tonne of cocaine stuffed inside frozen sharks, as drug gangs under military pressure go to greater lengths to conceal narcotics bound for the United States. Armed and masked navy officers cut open more than 20 shark carcasses filled with slabs of cocaine after checking a container ship in a container port in the southern Mexico state of Yucatan, the navy and Mexican media said on Tuesday. We are talking about more than a tonne of cocaine that was inside the ship, Navy Commander Eduardo Villa told reporters after X-ray machines and sniffer dogs helped uncover the drugs. Those in charge of the shipment said it was a conserving agent but after checks we confirmed it was cocaine, he said. Drug gangs are coming up with increasingly creative ways of getting drugs into the United States -- in sealed beer cans, religious statues and furniture -- as Mexico's military cracks down on the cartels moving South American narcotics north. President Felipe Calderon has sent 45,000 troops and federal police across Mexico to try to crush powerful smuggling cartels. But traffickers armed with a huge arsenal of grenades and automatic weapons are far from defeated, worrying Washington as violence spills over into U.S. states like Arizona. Some 2,750 people have died in drug violence in Mexico this year, a pace similar to that of 2008, when 6,300 were killed. Led by Mexico's most wanted man, Joaquin Shorty Guzman, smugglers from the Pacific state of Sinaloa are fighting a turf war with rivals. Guzman seeks to control Mexican and Central American smuggling routes into the United States.  (Reporting by Robin Emmott; editing by Patricia Zengerle)

One of the underwriters mandated for the rights offer: JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's flip-flopping between clients breaks no rules, and some rival investment bankers say its maneuvering is a credit to its business relationships, financial muscle and top status in the global MA advisory league tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others say it may put itself in an awkward position -- even though the bank's latest mandate with Rio is for securities underwriting and not MA advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If both sides are comfortable, fine," said a rival investment banker involved in the Rio-Chinalco deal.

Chinalco is the parent of Chalco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With JPMorgan among those defending Rio from the BHP offer, the bank did not take part in Chinalco's 'dawn raid' last year in which it purchased a stake in Rio in a bid to block BHP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, two months after that bid fell through, JPMorgan was invited in to advise Chinalco as it sought to capture Rio assets and shares at the bottom of the commodity price cycle -- a deal that would have helped Rio pay down its huge debts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinalco was already being advised by Japanese bank Nomura (8604.T) -- a legacy relationship through Lehman Brothers -- Blackstone Group (BX.N) and China's CICC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The late addition of JPMorgan didn't sit well with the other bankers, sources say, and that discomfort has only grown now that JPMorgan is in a position to earn a hefty fee as a Rio underwriter following the collapse of the Chinalco offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happens in investment banking.

&lt;p&gt;With Full Support for IBM Virtual Client Solutions, Devon IT's Thin Clients
Provide Cost-Effective Approach to Managing and Accessing Virtualized Desktops
KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Devon IT-China today announced its new thin client products with IBM part
numbers are orderable from IBM. Devon has worked directly with IBM to launch
this complete line of thin client solutions that complements IBM's Virtual
Client Solutions (VCS) infrastructure. 

"We are committed to providing industry-leading and cost-effective thin client
technology for users," explained Joe Makoid, President, Devon IT. "When a market
and technology leader like IBM is progressing thin client/hosted client
architecture and collaborate with leaders such as Citrix and VMware, it is
obvious that the current approach to desktop computing is shifting. We have
always been proponents of server-centric computing and centralized management as
a way for IT managers to reduce costs dramatically. Devon Thin Clients provide
IBM customers an easy and cost-effective way to order complete hosted desktop
solutions from one source." 

"The China market is looking for new and innovative ways to provide cost
effective desktop computing," said Daniel Kum, Executive, IBM Greater China
Group, System x Platform. "The Devon alternative to the traditional desktop PC
provides increased security, centralized management, and adds operational
flexibility to desktop computing. The variety of virtual client solutions,
coupled with Devon IT's thin client, is a potent combination that makes it easy
for IT managers to evaluate, assess, and ultimately implement their own
virtualized desktop environments." 

The IBM Virtual Client Solutions bring important benefits to the information
technology (IT) department. In addition to delivering security and control, the
Virtualized Hosted Client Infrastructure will enable companies to support more
users with fewer resources, while offering the best possible desktop experience
from virtually anywhere and on virtually any device. 

Devon's thin clients with IBM part numbers provide a complete set of desktop,
mobile and specialized thin client solutions that will meet any end user
requirement. 

TC2

The ultra-small and inexpensive TC2 is an ideal desktop replacement for
businesses looking to downsize their infrastructure and reduce management and
power costs. The small form factor unit consumes only 8 watts and is completely
silent. Despite its size, it is fully-functioned and allows users to connect to
a variety of servers and virtual desktops. The TC2 is exclusively a Devon IT
product and is orderable through IBM using an IBM part number. 

TC5

The TC5 is a next-generation thin client from Devon IT for users who need high
performance from a small footprint client. The TC5 gives users the capability to
use multiple displays with one stateless unit. This ultra-advanced desktop
appliance supports dual DVI video, internal wireless (Optional) and comes with
either the DeTOS Operating System or Windows XP Embedded. The TC5 is exclusively
a Devon IT product and is orderable through IBM using an IBM part number. 

TC10

The TC10 is the highest performance desktop access device in the world. It is
the first desktop access device that gives the end user a true PC experience
with instant screen updates, full multimedia support, and full USB
compatibility. It connects to the HC12 Workstation Blade using PC-over-IP(tm), a
technology that changes the desktop computing model by enabling desktop
consolidation benefits to be realized across the enterprise. Unlike a
traditional RDP thin client, the TC10 is for demanding users that require real
time PC-like capability such as financial traders and power users such as CAD
engineers. The TC10 is equivalent to the IBM CP20. 

HC12

The HC12 is the latest remote workstation innovation from Devon IT. This
high-performance remote workstation uses the advanced PC-over-IP technology by
Teradici. PC-over-IP allows Devon IT to deliver centralized computing solutions
with powerful benefits and no trade-offs to demanding workstation users. The
HC12 connects to Devon IT's TC10 - the highest performance desktop access device
in the world. The HC12 is a Devon IT product and is orderable through IBM using
an IBM part number. 

Devon Thin Client Software

Devon's software, which includes its DeTOS operating system and its Thin Manage
management suite allows IT managers to easily create, deploy and manage their
virtual desktop infrastructure. VDI is complex and therefore requires a holistic
management framework to orchestrate the many components required for successful
virtual desktop delivery and management. Devon's suite of software streamlines
and simplifies desktop virtualization deployments, enabling IT organizations to
gain greater management and control, ensure data and asset security, deliver a
superior end-user experience, and provide enterprise business continuity and
cost reductions. 

"We are partnering with IBM to accelerate hosted client solutions like the VCS,"
noted Jiang Tao, General Manager of Beijing-based Devon IT. "Our thin clients
that are orderable from IBM can help customers immediately access any
application without changing the architecture, touching the infrastructure or
rewriting code and that is exactly what they are looking for in a secure access
hosted client solution."

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL, June 17 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Asset Management is
looking to to raise $1 billion in funds which will likely invest
in "green" businesses in South Korea such as renewable energy,
the South Korean government said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan Asset Management, part of JP Morgan Chase (JPM.N),
has signed a letter of intent with South Korea's economy ministry
on raising the funds, the ministry said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the initial plan JP Morgan Asset Management would raise
60-70 percent of the funds from Korean investors while the rest
would come from international investors or the U.S. asset manager
itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ministry expected investment targets of the funds would
mainly be Korean companies and projects in environment-friendly
technologies and infrastructure, such as solar power, light
emitting diodes and green cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan Asset Management has $1.1 trillion in assets under
management globally.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * To start selling netbook computers for kids &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Looking to expand reach abroad &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Aarthi Sivaraman &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is introducing $350 netbooks for children ahead of the holidays, even as other toy companies shy away from expensive items to appease recession-hit shoppers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The 'Disney Netpal' -- a laptop computer typically used for Internet browsing and e-mailing -- will start selling at Toys "R" Us stores in the United States and Canada and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) in late July. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company's move comes as toymakers such as Mattel Inc MAT.N and Hasbro Inc HAS.N, and retailers like Toys "R" Us, have pointed to demand for cheaper toys, as job losses, the weak housing market and tight access to credit have erased parents' ability to spend freely for their children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Many analysts have said that selling affordable toys will be a better bet to attract shoppers this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    This is Disney's first attempt at selling a laptop in North America and comes about five years after the No. 1 U.S. entertainment conglomerate tried to enter the personal computer space with a $1,000 desktop in 2004, according to Disney. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company's current reach in the electronics segment for kids includes products like "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "High School Musical" themed TVs, DVD players, speaker systems, alarm clock radios and boomboxes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Still, weak consumer spending has hit its consumer products unit's licensing business, which posted a 9 percent decline in sales, and a 24 percent drop in operating income in the fiscal second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Despite the prevailing need among consumers to save, they were willing to spend more money if they saw value in a product, said Chris Heatherly, vice president of global toys for Disney's consumer products unit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "What parents consistently told us is 'I'm not looking for the lowest price point. I'm looking for something that is good value for money that my kid is going to get use out of,'" he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Netpal's software lets parents control online safety and browsing content for children, Heatherly said. Aimed at kids aged 6 to 12, it also allows parents to choose who their kids can interact with by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The version to be sold at Toys "R" Us stores is sturdier but comes with less storage space, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney is in talks with various other retailers in the United States about selling the netbook, which is being made for Disney by Taiwan's low-cost PC maker, Asustek, Heatherly said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company also anticipates selling Netpal in international markets like Europe and Asia by the end of this year, Heatherly said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Netpal will be one of the more expensive products this holiday season, which has seen toy companies focus on the "affordable" tag to entice shoppers. Mattel, for example, is selling a $80 Mindflex game on the higher end, while its Barbie and Hot Wheels toys are much cheaper. Hasbro has a $28 toy puppy this year compared to a $180 toy dog in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Reporting by Aarthi Sivaraman; Editing by Richard Chang) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((aarthi.sivaraman@thomsonreuters.com; +1 646 223 6191; Reuters Messaging: aarthi.sivaraman.reuters.com@reuters.net)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    See here for SHOP TALK -- Reuters' retail and consumer blog Keywords: DISNEY/NETBOOKS  Keywords: DISNEY/NETBOOKS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO, June 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Tuesday
recommended that investors buy shares of Brazilian pulp
processors VCP VCPA4.SA and Suzano (SUZB5.SA) as prices for
pulp rise and the companies pare costs faster than competitors
in Europe and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs wrote in a report that investors who buy VCP
would be taking advantage of its imminent merger with Aracruz
Celulos ARCZ6.SA that will help VCP save about $2 billion
through 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts Marcelo Aguiar, Pedro Grimaldi and Eduardo Couto
said in the report that they were "more bullish on pulp than
paper stocks due to a better demand and pricing outlook." They
said risks included a strengthening Brazilian currency, lower
pulp and paper prices and weaker demand for paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report said an increase in pulp demand by China, caused
by its growing need for fiber to accommodate urbanization,
would help offset a decline in demand in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The average price for eucalyptus pulp is expected to rise
to $645 per tonne from a previous estimate of $608, according
to the Goldman report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VCP has agreed to take over Aracruz in a $1.7 billion deal.
The report said VCP was expensive at current prices. The
company's shares rose 2.2 percent to 21.45 reais on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Suzano gained 1.4 percent to 15.16 reais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman analysts also recommended adding Suzano on a
"bullish view on pulp price cycle, relatively inexpensive
multiples and high exposure to Chinese pulp market, which
should allow the company to keep sales volume high in the near
term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report noted that Goldman had received and was
intending to receive compensation for investment banking
services from some of the companies mentioned in the report.

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
AIG (NYSE: AIG), Citigroup (NYSE: C), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), JP Morgan

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Regulation Reform on the Way

We totally agree that the regulation of the financial system urgently needs to
be strengthened to avoid any crisis of current magnitude and dimensions in the
future. In addition to the lack of exercise of regulatory powers (for whatever
reasons), one of the main contributors to the current crisis was the complex and
uneven regulatory system, which gave way to gaps and differences in degrees of
oversight. 

As a result, the financial institutions were able to shift risky products to
less-regulated entities or entities having favorable accounting treatment. This
calls for consolidated supervision of parent companies and all related entities
as well as better coordination among all regulators. 

The OTC derivatives include credit default swaps that caused the near-collapse
of AIG (NYSE: AIG). In view of the enormous size of the market and the threats
these instruments pose to the financial system, their regulation is long
overdue. 

Also required is stronger coordination with regulators of other countries so as
to effectively regulate financial giants like Citigroup (NYSE: C), Bank of
America (NYSE: BAC) and JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), which have operations all
over the world. 

Hold Vale on Chinese Negotiations

Last week, Vale (NYSE: VALE) announced a price adjustment on iron ore between
-28.8% and -44.47% with Japanese and Korean clients. However, the negotiations
with Chinese clients continue as a seemingly endless soap opera. According to
market sources, the Chinese want price cuts between 40% and 45% on iron, while
the average cut for Japanese and Korean clients was around 35%. 

As we said last week, the Chinese have built enormous inventories during the
first quarter 2009 and is using them to pressure for better prices. However,
last Friday it was announced that Chinese steel production has increased 7% in
May from the previous month. In fact, steel production in China in May 2009
reached 46.5 million tons, quite close to the record level of 46.9 million tons
on June 2008.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (G.N) expects
the current downward movement in the price of copper to be
short-lived amid growing expectations of a recovery in global
economic growth, and it targeted copper at $5,800 per tonne by
the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The investment bank kept its 12-month copper price target
at $4,800 per tonne, unchanged from its May forecast.   
Copper for three-months delivery MCU3 on the London Metal
Exchange closed at $4,980 per tonne on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are moving to a much less cautious stance on metal
markets, and now view the current correction as likely to be
shallower and shorter in duration," Goldman said in a research
note released on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman pointed to stronger activity on the long end of the
forward price curve, which reflected an improvement in the
global growth outlook, particularly in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we still expect weaker current fundamentals to
create some weakness in time spreads this summer, such a
pullback would likely be very small in the context of the
upward pressure on long-dated prices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the beginning of the year, copper time spreads have
tightened by about $400, but improving emerging market growth
expectations have pushed the long-dated price $1,700 higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We estimate that only modest growth has been priced in,
leaving more upside in long-dated prices," Goldman said.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, June 16 (Reuters) - Payment card company Visa
Europe (V.N) has been given an extended, end-July deadline to
respond to EU charges of limiting competition between banks with
its transaction fees, the European Commission said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Commission's hearing officer thought that the reasons

Jonathan Todd said, adding the original deadline had been this
month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, the 27-country European Union's executive arm
accused Visa of setting fees for cross-border transactions that
inflated the cost of payment card acceptance for merchants,
ultimately increasing consumer prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa had said the charges were related to its previous
method of setting MIFs -- cross-border multilateral interchange
fees -- and not new methods under which it had lowered its
cross-border credit and debit transaction fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European retail body Eurocommerce filed on Monday a
complaint with the Commission, saying Visa's interchange fee
procedure was unfair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa's credit and debit cards account for about a third of
all payment cards issued in the European economic area,
according to the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Double click on the newslinks below for the relevant topics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [EU-REGS-RTRS-LEN] For stories on competition issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [EU-REGS-AID-BACT-RTRS-LEN] For stories on state aid, MAs

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) already meet standards set by the Treasury on executive compensation principles and any compensation reform may not be burdensome for the two surviving brokers, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a note to clients, Hintz said both companies have compensation committees made up of independent board members and executives at both Goldman and Morgan Stanley hold a substantial portion of their wealth in deferred common stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Obama administration stepped up efforts to push for measures to tie executive pay at all publicly traded companies more closely to performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With this proposal, the equity market breathed a collective sigh of relief. Investors had feared that compensation legislation would be structured to punish the financial services industry," Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such action would accelerate the talent drain that the banks have experienced since the beginning of the crisis"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hintz said the Treasury appears to have "pulled its punches."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is wide-spread public resentment across the United States on Wall Street executive pay as many top executives were paid hefty bonuses even as their companies posted record losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hintz said passage of the plan will be "painful" and investors should gear up for "substantial political theater" as Congress considers the Obama Administration's plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said investors should expect Congressional hearings in which industry executives are publicly criticized for their pay and forced into another round of mea culpa before a national audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if this is the price that the bank's CEOs have to pay to address the call for compensation limits and win Congressional approval of the Geithner plan, then it is an excellent trade, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Santosh Nadgir in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for Four OS Platforms Gives ActiveBatch Job Scheduler

Increased Flexibility For Job Execution Across Wider Range of Platforms
MORRISTOWN, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Advanced Systems Concepts, Inc. (ASCI), a leading provider of system software
solutions that enhance enterprise systems, today announced it has extended its
ActiveBatch&#174; Job Scheduling and Workload Automation execution system support to
include the HP NonStop Kernel (NSK), IBM i5/OS, SuSe Linux and SCO UNIX platform
families. With the added support, ActiveBatch further increases the flexibility
and cross-platform compatibility that has made it one of the world`s most
widely-used job scheduling and workflow automation applications.

and centrally manage jobs and workflows across multiple and disparate computing
platforms, applications and databases. Version 7 adds to these capabilities by
offering a dynamic Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and related Web Services
tools to support internal and external Web Services as part of scheduled
workflows. 

"ActiveBatch is well known for its cross-platform support. The addition of HP
NSK, IBM i5/OS, SuSe Linux and SCO UNIX gives enterprises operating large,
diverse computing environments the additional system support they need," said
Jim Manias, Vice President of Marketing and Sales for Advanced Systems Concepts.
"Our goal with this extension, as with all enhancements to ActiveBatch, is to
continually meet the real-world requirements of our full range of customers." 

HP`s NonStop Kernel, first introduced by Tandem, is used by many major financial
and telecom companies to provide fault-tolerant operation. ActiveBatch supports
the HP Integrity NonStop Server platforms (single and multi-core) as well as the
S-series MIPS based systems. IBM`s i5/OS (formerly named OS/400) operating
system on the company`s i-Series platforms, including both PowerPC5 and 6
systems. ActiveBatch already supports IBM e-Series, p-Series, and z-Series
platforms. 

SuSe Linux, sponsored by Novell, is one of the most popular open source
operating systems and is built atop the Linux kernel. SCO UNIX brings the
reliability, scalability and performance of the UNIX OS to a wide range of
enterprise systems. 

ActiveBatch`s new OS support is available to new purchasers of Version 7, as
well as via automatic upgrade to companies participating in ASCI`s ActiveBatch
Version Upgrade program.

CORVALLIS, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
RedRover Software Inc., a provider of productivity solutions for spreadsheet
risk mitigation, announced today that it has been granted Certified Partner
status in the Microsoft Partner Program. As a Microsoft Certified Partner,
RedRover proves that its products install easily, perform as advertised and run
favorably within the Microsoft computing ecosystem. 

RedRover products were built from the ground up to appear seamless within the
Microsoft Office Excel environment. The RedRover user interface is deeply
integrated with the Excel grid user interface. Both RedRover Detect and Audit
communicate their results to the user via a semi-transparent overly that floats
over the Excel workbook grid. This overlay means that results are communicated
to the user without altering their spreadsheets in any way. In addition, results
are viewed in the immediate context of the spreadsheet without needing to
cross-reference from a separate results document. RedRover users appreciate that
the integrity of their spreadsheets is maintained during both the analysis and
results presentation processes. 

"Achieving the Microsoft certified partnership is an important milestone for the
RedRover engineering team," said Paul Shirkey, vice president of engineering for
RedRover Software Inc. "With this partnership, customers know that our software
has been certified by Microsoft and successfully used by other satisfied
customers. New users can adopt our solutions with confidence." 

The Microsoft Partner Program was launched in December 2003 and represents
Microsoft's ongoing commitment to the success of partners worldwide. The program
offers a single, integrated partnering framework that recognizes partner
expertise, rewards the total impact that partners have in the technology
marketplace, and delivers more value to help partners' businesses be successful.


"One major company goal is to develop products that deliver ahead of the needs
of our customers," said Richard Burright, chief executive officer for RedRover
Software Inc. "Becoming a Certified Partner in Microsoft's Partner Program
allows us to stay up-to-date on any product and technology changes from
Microsoft that may impact RedRover's solutions. We see this partnership as a
continuation of our commitment to help our customers mitigate risk in their
businesses."

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Chief Clearly Uncomfortable With Ecuador Topic
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Amazonian leaders in Ecuador are blasting Chevron CEO David O`Reilly for
engaging in "lies and deceit" during a public debate last week in San Francisco
over energy-related topic that included the company`s expected $27.3 billion
liability in Ecuador. 

"David O`Reilly is an untrustworthy individual who is propagating lies and
deceit about Ecuador," said Pablo Fajardo, the lawyer for dozens of indigenous
and farmer communities in Ecuador`s Amazon. Fajardo, who lives in the Amazon,
commented after reading a translated copy of the debate transcript. 

O`Reilly had asked his debating partner, Carl Pope of the Sierra Club, to keep
the controversial Ecuador issue off the table during the debate. But the issue
was raised anyway by the debate moderator, Allan Murray, the deputy managing
editor of the Wall Street Journal. 

Chevron is accused of dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste into Amazon
waterways and abandoning more than 900 toxic waste pits gouged out of the jungle
floor, which continue to leach toxins into streams and groundwater used as
drinking water by the local indigenous population. Evidence in the case shows
cancer rates in the area have spiked and a team of court experts estimated 1,401
people have died of cancer due to the contamination. 

O`Reilly is already under fire in a separate fraud investigation by the New York
Attorney General over misleading statements made by the company to downplay its
financial risk in the Ecuador litigation. Two Chevron lawyers also are under
criminal indictment in Ecuador for lying about clean-up results. 

When asked by Murray about the Ecuador issue - one that he said "originated with
Texaco" with "horrible consequences" for the people - O`Reilly relied on one of
Chevron`s basic talking points. "A group of U.S. and Ecuadorian trial lawyers
are holding Chevron hostage," he said, appearing nervous. "The case is based on
false claims, and is an attempt to invalidate an objective decision by the
Ecuadorian government." 

Fajardo responded strongly. 

"Chevron admitted that Texaco dumped billions of gallons of toxic water of
formation into the Amazon and left hundreds of waste pits which have been
meticulously documented by independent experts," he said. "So what are the false
claims?" 

Fajardo said O`Reilly lied when he claimed Texaco cleaned its old sites to "EPA
standards". In reality, the EPA does not have standards for soil clean up -
states do, but scientific evidence at the trial shows Chevron is often hundreds
of times over typical U.S. state norms at its remediated sites. 

O`Reilly also failed to mention that two Chevron lawyers (along with seven
Ecuadorian government officials) are under criminal indictment for lying about
the results of the clean-up. An official investigation could uncover bribes
suspected to have been paid by Texaco to government officials to obtain a
release, said Fajardo. 

O`Reilly claimed that Texaco made "only" $500 million from its Ecuador
operations. However, hard data suggest Texaco had profits upwards of $30
billion, with the lower number the amount booked to the company`s fourth-tier
Ecuadorian subsidiary. 

Fajardo noted that neither O`Reilly nor any member of Chevron`s Board of
Directors had visited Ecuador. 

"Bottom line is that a court will decide this question, which clearly makes
O`Reilly uncomfortable," said Fajardo. "This is not a man accustomed to being
held accountable by indigenous people in the rainforest."

&lt;p&gt;  SAN CARLOS, CA, Jun 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Mark Logic(R) Corporation, a leading provider of software for
information-centric applications, today released the MarkLogic Toolkit
for Excel(R). This new offering provides users a free, simple way to
integrate Microsoft Office Excel 2007 with MarkLogic Server. Earlier this
year, Mark Logic also delivered a Toolkit for Word(R) and a Connector for
SharePoint(R). Together, these offerings allow users to extend the
functionality of Microsoft Office products and quickly build applications
leveraging the native document format, Office Open XML (OOXML).

    Distributed under an open source model, MarkLogic Toolkit for Excel comes
with an Excel add-in that allows users to deploy information applications
into Excel, comprehensive libraries for managing and manipulating Excel
data, and a sample application that leverages best practices. Toolkit for
Excel capabilities include:


--  Enhanced Search - the MarkLogic Toolkit for Excel offers greater
    search functionality, allowing organizations to search across their Excel
    files for worksheets, cells, and formulas.  Search results can be imported
    directly into the workbooks that users are actively authoring.  Workbooks,
    worksheets, formulas, and cells can be exported directly from active Excel
    documents to MarkLogic Server for immediate use by queries and
    applications.

--  Creation and Manipulation of Excel Workbooks - the MarkLogic Toolkit
    for Excel allows customers to easily create new Excel workbooks from
    existing XML documents.  Users can now manipulate and re-use workbooks
    stored in the repository with a built-in XQuery library.  For instance, a
    financial services firm can replace the manual process of cutting-and-
    pasting information from XBRL documents to create reports in Excel with an
    automated system.  Utilizing Toolkit for Excel, this streamlined process
    extracts relevant sections of XBRL reports, combines them, and saves them
    as an Excel file.  This method of manipulating documents is more efficient
    because customers can create high quality Excel documents without the need
    to run Microsoft Office.

--  Custom Metadata for Excel Documents - the MarkLogic Toolkit for Excel
    allows users to add and edit multiple custom metadata documents across
    workbooks.  This improves the ability for users to discover and reuse
    information contained in Excel spreadsheets.
    

    
"Now that Microsoft has opened up its document formats, Mark Logic is
extending the features in Office with the rich search, analysis, and
delivery capabilities of our XML server," said Jason Monberg, vice

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, June 16 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on
Tuesday it plans to double Russian sales in the next three years
as the Russian IT market has yet to catch up with more developed
peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "According to the active growth strategy, we are planning to
double sales in the next three years," Chief executive of
Microsoft Rus LLC, Nikolai Pryanishnikov, was quoted by a
Microsoft statement as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft does not disclose the size of its Russian sales
but says they had approached those in European markets in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To help achieve the target, Microsoft plans to promote its
software among telecom operators' subscribers -- the company
said it had appointed Sergei Korovin as director of telecom

&lt;p&gt;Industry-Standard Server Environments Offer Improved Service Levels, Reduced
Cost
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Clerity, a full-service provider of mainframe migration and modernization
solutions, is extending its industry-leading UniKix mainframe rehosting software
technology to support Microsoft Windows Server operating systems on
industry-standard x86, x64, and Itanium-based servers. 

Migrating business-critical applications to open systems using UniKix software
has lowered total cost of ownership (TCO) for enterprises by as much as 80
percent. 

"Support for Microsoft Windows Server is a natural evolution of Clerity`s
strategy to deliver the industry`s most comprehensive mainframe migration and
optimization solution portfolio," said Brandon Edenfield, president of Clerity.
"We know that one size does not fit all when it comes to moving complex legacy
environments to open systems, so we tailor the most appropriate path forward for
a company`s business and IT objectives." 

More than 1300 production sites worldwide have already been migrated to
Clerity`s robust mainframe rehosting software environment and the cost savings
generated by these moves has freed up IT budgets for continued business
evolution and subsequent modernization initiatives, such as SOA integration and
user-interface transformation. Now organizations will be able to deploy the same
technology used at NYSE Euronext, BNP Paribas, and the U.S. Department of
Defense on cost-effective x86 and x64-based architectures from vendors such as
HP, IBM, and Sun. 

Migration to industry-standard Windows Server systems can be further accelerated
by leveraging Clerity`s Mainframe Rehosting Reference Architecture. This
designed and pre-tested architecture reduces project complexity and minimizes
implementation risks. In addition to central rehosting software products for
online and batch workloads, Clerity`s Mainframe Rehosting Reference Architecture
for Windows Server platforms includes key components such as Microsoft Hyper-V,
which provides enterprise-level virtualization and partitioning functionality on
standards-based systems. 

"Addressing integrated schedulers, sort routines, output management solutions,
and other related infrastructure requirements that commonly surround
business-critical mainframe environments can be equally as important to
migration success as dealing with specific application and data components,"
said Barry Tait, technical pre-sales engineering manager at Clerity. "Operating
environments such as Microsoft Server 2008 provide unique and powerful building
blocks in effectively rehosting legacy workloads to standards-based systems." 

Additional information on Clerity`s mainframe rehosting software suite for
Microsoft Windows platforms can be found at http://www.clerity.com/windows.

&lt;p&gt;GOTHENBURG, Sweden--(Business Wire)--
PAR, the leading European data owner and information management company, has
further developed links between proprietary CRM systems and its pan-European
EuroContactPool business-to-business database. 

The company has announced a plug-in for SuperOffice CRM and an upgrade to its
highly-successful Microsoft Dynamics CRM plug-in. A plug-in for Salesforce.com
is due for release in August 2009. 

PAR has worked with SuperOffice vendor, Adwiza ApS in Denmark to develop the
plug-in, which will enable SuperOffice users to link seamlessly with more than
22 million company records in the EuroContactPool database. 

The plug-in, called `PAR Manager`, brings high quality data directly into
SuperOffice, enabling both single and mass creation of company data from 16
European databases. 

It also enables data cleansing and de-duplication within SuperOffice by matching
records against the EuroContactPool master database. 

New contact companies can be added quickly by using a simple, web-based search
function. This automatically transfers all information on the company - postal
address, telephone number, activity code, size of company, decision-makers`
names, etc. - into SuperOffice, reducing the time and errors involved in manual
inputting. 

New potential customers can be accessed using PAR Segmentation search tool.
Users can identify a target group and analyse this alongside existing data in
the SuperOffice CRM, ensuing that duplicates entries are not imported into the
target data list. 

PAR has also announced v2.0 of its Microsoft Dynamics CRM plug-in, launched at
the beginning of 2009. v2 enables users to enhance information on customers that
have, say, responded positively to a marketing campaign. Full company details
can be added direct from PAR`s EuroContactPool database and flagged for ongoing
monitoring, which continually improves the quality of the CRM database. This
process enables relatively inexpensive databases - containing small amounts of
information - to be added to the CRM and then enhanced when there is a genuine
business lead. 

For more information about PAR and its services, visit: www.par.se

EuroContactPool is the world`s fastest-growing business-to-business European

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft's new search engine takes more market share&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * CEO says long-term effort&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Clashes with Google on software issues
 (Adds Google comment, paragraphs 15-16)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DETROIT, June 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Bing
search engine won more market share from rivals last week,
according to new industry data released on Wednesday, but still
trails Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Challenging market leader Google -- which in turn is
looking to break into Microsoft's core software market -- is a
long-term project, said Microsoft chief executive Steve
Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have had some very good initial response," Ballmer said
at a conference in Detroit. "I don't want to over-set
expectations. We are going to have to be tenacious and keep up
the pace of innovation over a long period of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft grabbed 12.1 percent of U.S. Internet searches
for the work week June 8-12, according to data released by
industry tracker comScore earlier on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is up from 11.3 percent in the June 1-5 period -- the
week in which Bing was launched -- and up from 9.1 percent the
week before that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For comparison, Google got 65 percent of U.S. searches in
May, the last full month for which figures are available,
followed by Yahoo with 20.1 percent and Microsoft with 8
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts and investors are keenly awaiting data for all of
June to see if Microsoft can hold onto early gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer acknowledged the tough task of beating Google,
which he referred to as "a big dog competitor".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company has long been
determined to play a major role in the lucrative Web search
market after watching upstart Google take a stranglehold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the same time, Google is looking to take advantage of
its popularity to launch software that competes with
Microsoft's, which has created a new source of tension between
the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft ratcheted up that tension on Wednesday by
claiming that Google's new Apps Sync for Microsoft Outlook
software -- which allows users to share data between their
Outlook e-mail and Google's online offerings -- disables a key
function in Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The installation of the Google Apps Sync plugin disables
Outlook's ability to search any and all of your Outlook data,"
Outlook product manager Dev Balasubramanian wrote on a
Microsoft blog. "It is also important to note that uninstalling
the plugin may not fix the issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The problem, though relatively unimportant to users,
represents a crucial struggle between Microsoft and Google for
e-mail customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google's new product allows business users to continue
using Outlook for email and other tasks, but the back-end
functionality and data storage moves to Google, instead of
residing on a company's internal servers running Microsoft
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google acknowledged the Outlook problem identified by
Microsoft, and several other issues where its software does not
mesh well with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're working with Microsoft and other partners to help
fix these issues and support additional Outlook features like
multiple calendars," said Google Apps senior product manager
Chris Vander Mey in a blog post. "We'll keep you posted on our
progress."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares closed up just less than 1 percent at
$23.68, while Google's fell 0.2 percent to $415.16, both on
Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Recalled Hydroxycut products are defective and dangerous according to a lawsuit
filed today by Baum, Hedlund, Aristei &amp; Goldman in federal court in Los Angeles
on behalf of everyone who consumed any of the recalled weight loss Hydroxycut
supplements. 

The lead plaintiff in this class action, Marvin Thomas of Los Angeles, is
seeking compensatory, equitable, declaratory, and injunctive relief for himself
and everyone in the Hydroxycut class against the defendants for, among other
things, violations of various states` deceptive trade practices acts,
misrepresentation, fraudulent, false and misleading advertisements, and unjust
enrichment by distributing a product about which they had been making
unsubstantiated claims of safety and effectiveness. 

The class action lawsuit (CV 09-04337) was filed in the United States District
Court for the Central District of California, against the manufacturers of
Hydroxycut: Iovate Health Sciences USA Inc. (Blasdell, N.Y.); Iovate Health
Sciences Inc., (Ontario, Canada); and MuscleTech Research and Development, Inc.
(Ontario, Canada). 

According to the complaint, the Hydroxycut products that were the subject of the
May 1, 2009 and May 7, 2009 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalls, were a
series of dietary, weight loss and muscle building supplements and drugs which
posed serious health risks, including serious liver injuries, or hepatotoxicity
(chemical-driven liver damage). 

Because Hydroxycut is a dietary supplement and not a prescription drug, it was
not regulated by the FDA and did not require approval by the FDA, according to
one of Mr. Thomas` attorneys, Ilyas Akbari, also a bio-engineer. "In this case
they cannot hide behind the dubious FDA preemption defense. 

"We believe defendants have known for a long time that their products were
unsafe yet they continued to mass market them for profit," according to Mr.
Akbari. He went on to say that questions concerning the safety of Hydroxycut can
be traced back to 2003 when the state of Missouri filed a complaint alleging
that Hydroxycut`s claims of being "clinically proven" and "safe" were false and
misleading. That case settled but nothing changed. The first scientific
publications that Baum Hedlund was aware of which associated Hydroxycut with
liver injury were reported in March 2005. Since then, numerous publications have
reported injuries associated with these products and, recently, at least 23
adverse event reports were submitted to the FDA. The FDA informed Iovate of its
belief that Hydroxycut was not safe. The manufacturers finally agreed with that
assessment, which led to the May, 2009 recalls. 

Baum Hedlund warns that the number of adverse events has almost certainly been
under-reported. Approximately 15% of the U.S. population uses dietary/weight
loss supplements and Hydroxycut, which was promoted as "America`s #1 Selling
Weight-Loss Supplement," was by far the leading product in this market, selling
about 9 million units in 2008 alone. With such wide usage, the actual number of
reported cases likely underestimates the true incidence of injuries by several
degrees of magnitude, especially here in Southern California, which may have
been hit the hardest by this fraud. Californians have always been among the most
health conscious in the country and probably consume dietary supplements on a
larger scale than any other part of the nation. 

Anyone with a Hydroxycut-related injury should seek medical attention. For more
information about this class action please call 800-827-0087 or 310-207-3233.

Baum, Hedlund, Aristei &amp; Goldman is recognized as a preeminent plaintiff
national mass disaster law firm which handles personal injury, wrongful death
and consumer class actions across the U.S.They routinely handle complicated
evidence and choice of law issues in both state and federal courts throughout
the country.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney is a global brand with film studios and theme parks bearing his name, but now his family are unveiling a museum to tell the story of the animation pioneer they say has been lost behind the trademark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization established in 1995 to promote education and writing about Disney as well as scholarships in his name, will open the Walt Disney Family Museum on October 1 in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My father's name is probably one of the most well-known names around the world, but as the 'brand' or trademark has spread, for many, the man has become lost," Disney's daughter and museum founder, Diane Disney Miller, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The museum will trace Disney's life from his birth in Chicago and childhood in Missouri to his move to California in 1920s, where he married and his animation career took off with the creation of the "Mickey Mouse" character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the exhibits on display will be early animation drawings, film clips, scripts, cameras and many of Disney's numerous Academy Awards, including an honorary Oscar in 1939 for his first feature length animation film "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will also be a model of the Disneyland theme park he first envisioned, quite different from the park that opened in California in 1955, and a model of the Lily Belle train that ran on half a mile of track around his Hollywood home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Visiting my grandpa was pretty fun," Walter Miller, the foundation's president, recalled at a launch of the museum in New York on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REVOLUTIONIZED ANIMATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Perhaps my grandfather's greatest gift, without question his greatest pleasure, was to bring imagination to life," he said.

&lt;p&gt; *Opening set for Oct. 1 in San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *Disney's Academy Awards among exhibits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Michelle Nichols&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - Walt Disney is a global brand
with film studios and theme parks bearing his name, but now his
family are unveiling a museum to tell the story of the

drawings, film clips, scripts, cameras and many of Disney's
numerous Academy Awards, including an honorary Oscar in 1939
for his first feature length animation film "Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There will also be a model of the Disneyland theme park he

launch that Disney's development of "personality animation,"
beginning with Mickey Mouse, revolutionized the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Within a remarkably short period of time, a mere decade,
Disney set the course for animation in the 20th century and
beyond," Canemaker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There would be no 'Toy Story' and no Pixar (Walt Disney
Co's animation studio) without Disney personality animation,
nor other studios that yield to the pantheon of stories and
characters that fascinated throughout the years," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Benefield, executive director of the museum, said
the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) had made their resources and
archives available to the foundation and loaned several
exhibits to the museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Walt Disney reached people because he was a magical story
teller," he said. "Now it's our turn to tell his story, to
narrate the life of someone whose name is often confused with a
brand and to present him simply as a human being with an
extraordinary vision."

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

BRIC Nations Discuss the Dollar

China and India have sizable labor resources, while Russia and Brazil are rich
in natural resources. China is the main importer of natural resources, while
Russia and Brazil are the main exporters. While China and India benefit from
lower oil prices, Russia and Brazil seek higher oil prices. There is also a huge
competition among the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] nations for foreign
capital and investment. 

Further, even taken together, BRIC economies are smaller than the US economy and
as such their influence is rather limited as of now -- though it is rising
rapidly. Also, the reality remains that there is no immediate alternative to the
US Dollar, as no other markets in the world have the depth and liquidity of
those in the US. 

Emergence of an alternative reserve currency or a basket of currencies could
take many years. So, there is no immediate threat to the US Dollar`s role as the
world reserve currency, and any outcome of the meeting will be more symbolic at
present. 

However, if there are significant negative comments on the dollar or signals of
shifting the reserves composition away from the dollar (which seems to be a less
likely outcome in the present circumstances), it could weigh on the US currency.
Companies that derive a significant portion of their revenue from their overseas
operations, like McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), PepsiCo (NYSE:
PEP), Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL) benefit from
any weakness in the US Dollar.

reversal that began moving Canadian crude shipments to the Gulf Coast in 2006."

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's navy has seized more than a tonne of cocaine stuffed inside frozen sharks, as drug gangs under military pressure go to greater lengths to conceal narcotics bound for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed and masked navy officers cut open more than 20 shark carcasses filled with slabs of cocaine after checking a container ship in a container port in the southern Mexico state of Yucatan, the navy and Mexican media said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are talking about more than a tonne of cocaine that was inside the ship," Navy Commander Eduardo Villa told reporters after X-ray machines and sniffer dogs helped uncover the drugs. "Those in charge of the shipment said it was a conserving agent but after checks we confirmed it was cocaine," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug gangs are coming up with increasingly creative ways of getting drugs into the United States -- in sealed beer cans, religious statues and furniture -- as Mexico's military cracks down on the cartels moving South American narcotics north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Felipe Calderon has sent 45,000 troops and federal police across Mexico to try to crush powerful smuggling cartels. But traffickers armed with a huge arsenal of grenades and automatic weapons are far from defeated, worrying Washington as violence spills over into U.S. states like Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 2,750 people have died in drug violence in Mexico this year, a pace similar to that of 2008, when 6,300 were killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Mexico's most wanted man, Joaquin "Shorty" Guzman, smugglers from the Pacific state of Sinaloa are fighting a turf war with rivals. Guzman seeks to control Mexican and Central American smuggling routes into the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Robin Emmott; editing by Patricia Zengerle)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark SP 500 index .SPX should surge back to its October 2007 record above 1,500 by the end of 2012, provided the U.S. economy sees a V-shaped recovery, JPMorgan Chase Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Thomas Lee said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The global economy is in the midst of a synchronized recovery," Lee said at the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit. "If we end up with a V-shaped recovery, we could go back to our record high of 1,500 in 2011-2012," he added, referring to the SP 500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell 0.4 percent to 908 on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee also reiterated his year-end 2009 target of 1,100 for the SP 500, saying the United States will likely come out of its recession some time this summer, followed by the rest of the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2007, the SP 500 hit a record closing high of 1,565.15, before falling back. In March of this year, it slumped to a 12-year closing low, but has since rebounded by about 40 percent on hopes the recession that begun in December 2007 was moderating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee added that a market correction in the wake of the recent run-up would be "healthy," and could lure back investors who opted to sit out the recent rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This rally has left many investors uninvested or underinvested. The pullback is the entry point to really see more meaningful money put to work," said Lee, who has been named a top analyst in Institutional Investor magazine's annual all-star poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He favors the financials, industrials, technology and consumer discretionaries sectors, in that order, saying the sectors would be the biggest beneficiaries of an economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within financials, he favors asset managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SP financial index .GSPF is up 84 percent since the broader market's 12-year low on March 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are still favoring cyclicals over defensives," said Lee. Even so, he was mindful of potential risks to the recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest risk is that we're implicitly assuming the consumer is stabilizing. There's a lot of potential shocks. If oil goes to $100 a barrel, you can't have a recovery," said Lee, adding the other risk would be if savings rates somehow overshoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ellis Mnyandu; additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, Jun 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Editors Note: There is a photo and a video associated with this Press
Release. 

    The All England Lawn Tennis Club and IBM today unveiled smart mobile
applications designed to transform how fans access information and keep
up with the action at Wimbledon 2009. Since 1990 IBM has worked with the
Wimbledon team to send the captured score and statistical data around the
world in an instant, keeping on-site broadcasters, media and tennis fans
up to date with all the latest scores and statistics. 

    The Seer Android trial version features location-aware visualisation
technology developed for the T-Mobile G1. The augmented reality
application acts as a real-time guide and interactive map of the 2009
tournament allowing selected users to see what others can't, as well as
providing up to the second scores. 

    The Seer Aggregator is a downloadable Twitter application enabling fans
to receive specific Wimbledon real-time 'tweets' from a variety sources,
including players, commentators and a team of IBM scouts at the event. 

    "These smart applications were designed with tennis fans in mind and add
a whole new dimension to the event whether you are attending in person or
sitting in your garden 5,000 miles away," says Rob McCowen, Marketing
Director at The AELTC. "I can see the incredible potential here to change
the way people will engage with major sporting and other events both now
and in the future, as the applications help address common challenges
such as getting lost, encountering queues or momentarily missing some of
the action."

    "IBM has always been committed to helping the All England Club improve
everybody's experience at Wimbledon by making better sense of the data
and information that is all around us," said Alan Flack, IBM Client
Executive for the AELTC. "We recognised that people come to Wimbledon to
watch tennis, so anything we can do to help make their day smoother, to
help them find what they are looking for quickly and efficiently just
makes their visit more enjoyable. By exploring new technologies, we can
bring information to life by making it more useful, engaging and
accessible."

    Seer Android Beta

    The Seer Android Beta is an innovative application being trialled at
Wimbledon 2009, that takes a live video feed from the handset's camera,
and superimposes content and data associated with various points of
interest into that video stream. 

    From tennis to food courts, points of interest throughout the Wimbledon
grounds have been plotted using GPS. By making use of the T-Mobile G1's
digital compass and precise GPS coordinates, the application offers a
'heads up display' to show the user what they are looking at. It augments
this with other live data from the scoring systems and IBM scouts
reporting from around the grounds, to give the user a comprehensive and
dynamic insight into their surroundings. For instance, pointing the
camera lens towards a court will not only identify the court number, but
also display details about the current and subsequent matches.

    Seer Android Beta users can also use the phones' Map view, which
pinpoints their location on a detailed map of the grounds, and can be
used as a way finder. The Timeline view is an aggregation of news feeds
and updates from IBM scouts, and allows users to see in real-time what is
happening around the site. And a handy 'Radar' function indicates the
user's current position and nearby points of interest within range. 

    IBM will be demonstrating the application using T-Mobile G1 during the
tournament, giving fans an opportunity to interact with the future of
sporting applications. 

    Seer Aggregator 

    The Seer Aggregator is a Twitter application that aggregates all
Wimbledon based content into one channel. It's a straightforward but
intuitive way for fans to make sense of all the action taking place
during the two weeks of the tournament. With its easy-to-use filtering
menu system, fans onsite at Wimbledon and around the world can tune into
the information that interests them the most. 

    IBM scouts will be onsite throughout the duration of the tournament
providing firsthand accounts and real-time updates regarding queues, seat
availability, taxis, general travel information, live match updates and
order of play. 

    The Twitter Aggregator will work with most Java-enabled mobile handsets
and is available for download from www.wimbledon.org/ibm from 22 June,
2009. These tweets will also be available to all Twitter users at
www.twitter.com/IBMScout. 

    IBM &amp; Wimbledon

    IBM is the Official Supplier of Information Technology and IT Consultancy
to The AELTC who stage The Championships. Since 1990, IBM has worked with
the Club to introduce new technologies that help bring the wealth of
real-data captured during The Championships to life. 

    Around 40 data-entry staff are needed every year to analyse each shot
played across some 600 matches for the two-weeks of The Championships.
IBM sends the captured data around the world in an instant, keeping
on-site broadcasters, media and tennis fans everywhere up to date with
all the latest scores and statistics. Detailed analytical reports for the
players are also available as soon as the match has been completed.

    Wimbledon.org is but one example of this long-standing partnership's
success and this year, the official tournament site features increased
options for people to personalise their Wimbledon experience. Visitors
can follow the progress of their favourite players, view video highlights
of the day's action and get scores and results delivered in real-time.
It's an increasingly interactive, engaging and personalised online
experience that draws fans, players and the media in ever-greater numbers
- last year Wimbledon.org attracted over 10 million visitors during the
tournament fortnight alone.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - Fidelity International
[FIDLI.UL], GLG Partners GLG.N, and JPMorgan Asset Management
(JPM.N) were named as the fund industry winners at the Thomson
Reuters Extel awards on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Fidelity International picked up the award for leading
pan-European fund management firm, ahead of JP Morgan AM and
Capital Research  Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GLG was top in the hedge funds category, followed by
Landsdowne Partners and Citadel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan buyside analyst Asif Jeevanjee was given the gong
for top pan-European fund management individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other top awards were handed out to UBS (UBSN.VX) as top
pan-European brokerage firm for equity research, and to Credit
Suisse (CSGN.VX) as leading broker for equity trading and
execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 2008 Extel survey reflected the record contribution of
over 1,600 buyside firms, 150 brokerage firms/research houses,
and 450 of Europe's largest quoted companies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Survey findings included the view that market turmoil over
the past year has resulted in an average 40 percent decline in
commissions paid by fund managers to the brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asset managers, however, have actually increased the number
of research counterparties, and access more independents and
research boutiques than ever before, the survey found.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's navy has seized more than a ton of cocaine stuffed inside frozen sharks, as drug gangs under military pressure go to greater lengths to conceal narcotics bound for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed and masked navy officers cut open more than 20 shark carcasses filled with slabs of cocaine after checking a container ship in a container port in the southern Mexico state of Yucatan, the navy and Mexican media said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are talking about more than a ton of cocaine that was inside the ship," Navy Commander Eduardo Villa told reporters after X-ray machines and sniffer dogs helped uncover the drugs. "Those in charge of the shipment said it was a conserving agent but after checks we confirmed it was cocaine," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug gangs are coming up with increasingly creative ways of getting drugs into the United States -- in sealed beer cans, religious statues and furniture -- as Mexico's military cracks down on the cartels moving South American narcotics north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Felipe Calderon has sent 45,000 troops and federal police across Mexico to try to crush powerful smuggling cartels. But traffickers armed with a huge arsenal of grenades and automatic weapons are far from defeated, worrying Washington as violence spills over into U.S. states like Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 2,750 people have died in drug violence in Mexico this year, a pace similar to that of 2008, when 6,300 were killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Mexico's most wanted man, Joaquin "Shorty" Guzman, smugglers from the Pacific state of Sinaloa are fighting a turf war with rivals. Guzman seeks to control Mexican and Central American smuggling routes into the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Robin Emmott; editing by Patricia Zengerle)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "Disney Netpal" -- a laptop computer typically used for Internet browsing and e-mailing -- will start selling at Toys "R" Us stores in the United States and Canada and Amazon.com in late July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's move comes as toymakers such as Mattel Inc and Hasbro Inc, and retailers like Toys "R" Us, have pointed to demand for cheaper toys, as job losses, the weak housing market and tight access to credit have erased parents' ability to spend freely for their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many analysts have said that selling affordable toys will be a better bet to attract shoppers this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Disney's first attempt at selling a laptop in North America and comes about five years after the No. 1 U.S. entertainment conglomerate tried to enter the personal computer space with a $1,000 desktop in 2004, according to Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's current reach in the electronics segment for kids includes products like "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "High School Musical" themed TVs, DVD players, speaker systems, alarm clock radios and boomboxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, weak consumer spending has hit its consumer products unit's licensing business, which posted a 9 percent decline in sales, and a 24 percent drop in operating income in the fiscal second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the prevailing need among consumers to save, they were willing to spend more money if they saw value in a product, said Chris Heatherly, vice president of global toys for Disney's consumer products unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What parents consistently told us is 'I'm not looking for the lowest price point. I'm looking for something that is good value for money that my kid is going to get use out of,'" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netpal's software lets parents control online safety and browsing content for children, Heatherly said. Aimed at kids aged 6 to 12, it also allows parents to choose who their kids can interact with by e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The version to be sold at Toys "R" Us stores is sturdier but comes with less storage space, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is in talks with various other retailers in the United States about selling the netbook, which is being made for Disney by Taiwan's low-cost PC maker, Asustek, Heatherly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also anticipates selling Netpal in international markets like Europe and Asia by the end of this year, Heatherly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netpal will be one of the more expensive products this holiday season, which has seen toy companies focus on the "affordable" tag to entice shoppers. Mattel, for example, is selling a $80 Mindflex game on the higher end, while its Barbie and Hot Wheels toys are much cheaper. Hasbro has a $28 toy puppy this year compared to a $180 toy dog in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Aarthi Sivaraman; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brings Affordable, Enterprise-Class Communications and Security Solutions to
Companies
DENVER--(Business Wire)--
Qwest Communications International, Inc. (NYSE: Q) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today
announced a 5-year agreement to deliver highly proactive managed services to
mid-size businesses. Financial terms were not disclosed. 

Qwest and IBM will go to market with network management services that simplify
complex technology operations and enable customers to optimize their information
technology (IT) networks, while minimizing capital expenditure. Unlike many
Fortune 500 class enterprises, mid-sized businesses often lack the comprehensive
IT budgets, staff and technical skills required to upgrade their existing IT
infrastructure with the latest security solutions, communications and network
management tools. Through the Qwest and IBM partnership, customers will have
access to these advanced capabilities through the following services:

* Managed Security Services powered by IBM Internet Security Systems. These
services are designed to provide 24x7x365 protection against malicious Internet
activity including viruses, spam and attacks such as distributed denial of
service (DDoS). Backed by the world-renown IBM X-Force, an elite team of
security researchers, these services offer real-time adaptive protection against
a dynamic array of threats. 
* Network Management Services managed by IBM Express Remote Management
Infrastructure Services (ERMIS). An advanced, highly automated solution that
monitors data network performance, proactively identifies issues, notifies
customers and initiates resolution. The service is capable of managing a broad
range of network devices that will be offered with network configuration
functionality to support business` needs for flexibility. 
* Unified Communications Services also managed by ERMIS. These services,
supporting implementations of fewer than 100 IP phones, include remote
monitoring, reporting and management for a unified communications telephony
service. The new functionality enables customers with solution flexibility to
upgrade to a simple, yet powerful IP communications system, along with an
all-inclusive service of network connectivity, equipment, telephones, and
real-time monitoring and management.

The Qwest managed services offering will enable customers to monitor the
performance of their network services and make changes through a single, secure,
Web-based portal with real-time alerts and advisories. The portal is built on an
advanced platform, rich Internet applications and best practices in user
interface design. IBM Global Business Services will work with Qwest on the
portal design and implementation as well as the systems integration to ensure
the customer experience is seamless across all services and aspects of account
management. The companies also will work jointly to optimize the performance of
clients` network components and will provide competitive service-level
agreements. 

"Advanced, end-to-end IT services that are automated and easily integrated into
a client`s network are the value adds of this alliance," said Eric Bozich, vice
president of Qwest Business Markets Group Product Management. "The services we
will make available as part of this agreement are a very real example of Qwest`s
commitment to investing in its next-generation network to anticipate the
evolving needs of a savvy customer base." 

"Together IBM and Qwest are moving swiftly to offer mid-market clients a
comprehensive set of network infrastructure requirements," said Richard Stomp,
vice president and managing director for Qwest at IBM. "Through this
partnership, clients will have access to a powerful, yet simplified ecosystem
for unified communications, data protection and communications infrastructure
management."

&lt;p&gt;The Disney Netpal Makes Kids` Computing Fun, Web-Safe And Easy With A Unique
User Interface, Wi-Fi, Windows XP and Parental Controls
GLENDALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney Consumer Products (DCP) and ASUS, maker of the pioneering Eee PC netbook,
have collaborated to develop the Disney Netpal, a netbook computer for children
that`s fun, web-safe and easy to use. Developed with parents and kids in mind,
the Disney Netpal by ASUS is durable, with a reinforced mechanical design, and
offers a truly magical and engaging computing experience with a unique Disney
user interface. Features include more than 40 robust parental control options,
an 8.9-inch LCD display, Wi-Fi capabilities, Windows XP Home, and kid-friendly
software featuring Disney characters and icons in stunning visual environments.
Browsers and email have extra filters to assure that parents are able to control
online safety and content for their children, and can easily select with whom
their children can correspond via email. The Disney Magic Desktop "gadget tray"
offers a creatively designed 2D menu displaying Disney-themed email,
Disney-themed browser and a robust suite of Disney-themed parental control
options. 

With a user interface that is incredibly easy to use for both kids and parents,
from package to set-up in four simple steps, the Disney Netpal will be available
in late July in two models with prices based on features (see graphic below for
Netpal feature comparisons). The Disney Netpal by ASUS is designed for kids ages
6-12. Retailers include Toys"R"Us and Amazon.com, and the suggested retail price
is $349.99. Carrying cases will also be available separately. 

"Today`s kids are a digital generation," said Chris Heatherly, head of Disney`s
Toymorrow team and VP of Toys and Consumer Electronics for Disney Consumer
Products. "Parents are comfortable with their kids using the Internet, but they
want to be assured that their kids are having a safe online experience. The
Disney Netpal, designed together by ASUS and our Disney Toymorrow team, is a
no-compromise device. There are plenty of terrific features and fun applications
designed just for kids, but parents have ultimate control over the experience,
with the power to set limits on how their kids are using the PC." 

Disney`s Toymorrow team is an internal group of Disney inventors, designers,
engineers, researchers and product development experts. The Toymorrow team meets
several times a year to brainstorm and develop new products and product concepts
that focus on the convergence of toys and digital media in exciting, fun and
creative ways. 

ASUS is an established leader in the netbook category and is widely credited
with launching the netbook craze, with nearly 7 million Eee PC netbooks sold to
date. 

"We`re proud to be involved in the creation of this very unique netbook for
kids," said Eric Chen, Vice President of ASUS' Systems Business Group. "The
Disney Netpal is creatively designed in a way that truly keeps the Disney magic
alive, and its state-of-the-art features make it an excellent choice for kids
and families." 

Disney Netpal By ASUS Is Easy:Kid-friendly Disney Magic Desktop, Applications
and Widgets

The Disney Magic Desktop installed on the Disney Netpal by ASUS is an
easy-to-use interface specifically tailored to kids, with an intuitive visual
interface and instructions that make it easy for kids to operate the computer.
Right out of the box, the Disney browser launches numerous kid-friendly Disney
websites for kids to explore. The Disney Magic Desktop features a 2D "gadget
tray" that displays bold visual icons for easy access to applications. Rounding
off the Disney Netpal by ASUS` fun, kid-friendly features are a collection of 15
easily-accessible widgets, including a stopwatch, digital memo pad, which
inserts "reminder notes" on the Disney Magic Desktop, and a calculator. 

Disney Netpal By ASUS Is Fun, Customizable And Colorful

The Disney Netpal by ASUS features two choices of stylishly designed lids;
Disney Princess Pink boasts beautiful pink florals and Disney Magic Blue
cleverly displays rows of miniature Mickey Mouse icons. Kids can dress their
desktops with more than 10 customizable themes inspired by popular characters
from Disney`s and Disney&#8729;Pixar`s most popular franchises, including Cars, Club
Penguin, Disney Classic Characters, Disney Fairies, Disney Princess, Vintage
Mickey Mouse, Toy Story and WALL-E. Themes that appeal to slightly older kids,
such as the popular Disney Channel series Hannah Montana and JONAS styles, are
also available. Favorite character icons can be attached to email addresses. 

Additional Disney-developed applications include Disney Mix for music and media
management, and Disney Pix for photo customization and organization. The Disney
Pix application features fun Disney Bobblehead software, which lets kids insert
images of their faces on top of bodies, download them into videos and postcards
and play wacky moving dance scenes, for hours of fun. The Radio Disney widget
streams real-time music and lets kids simultaneously submit song requests, if
they wish. The Disney Netpal by ASUS also includes a driving game, number game,
memory game and photo scrapbook. 

Disney Netpal By ASUS is Optimized for Web-Safety and Sports a Sleek Durable
Design

The Disney Netpal by ASUS is designed to be kid-friendly, both in terms of
durability and content permissions. It`s rugged and durable, with a spill-proof
keyboard that protects against inadvertent liquid spills. The Disney Netpal by
ASUS` ShockShield data protection guards against data loss when the computer is
subject to impact. 

The Disney Netpal also allows parents to create a web-safe computing environment
with 40 parental control options. Parents can pre-select email correspondence
options, browsers, the websites their kids visit and the programs they use.
These permissions can also be scheduled on a calendar, providing parents with a
convenient, automated means of granting access on the days and times that they
choose. Parents can also pull up data to determine where children spent time,
and for how long. Additional websites can be added for access, but only if the
parent approves and submits the request within the password-protected system.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Now that Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has settled its $10 billion debt with the U.S. taxpayer, investors are wondering about the Wall Street firm's other looming presence -- Warren Buffett.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last September, shortly after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK went bankrupt, but before the U.S. Treasury unveiled plans to bail out the banking industry, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N)(BRKb.N) invested $5 billion in Goldman and acquired preferred shares and warrants to buy common stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which received $10 billion from the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, repaid that money on Wednesday. But Buffett's presence is large, not just because of his huge investment, but also given his reputation for integrity and as one of the world's savviest investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what will Buffett, the second wealthiest man in the United States, according to Forbes magazine, do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically not much," said Vahan Janjigian, author of the book 'Even Buffett Isn't Perfect.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He has a history of making fairly large investments in these kinds of companies and sitting back and letting the management team run the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janjigian expects Buffett to sit tight as Berkshire collects $500 million of annual dividends on the preferred shares and earns paper profits on accompanying warrants to buy $5 billion of common stock at $115 per share for up to five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman closed on Thursday at $143.09, meaning Berkshire would earn more than $1 billion in profits if it cashed the common stock warrants now. That is in addition to the 10 percent preferred stock dividend, which is twice the 5 percent rate the government was getting from the TARP investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment and Buffett did not return a message left with his assistant seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite what Goldman gave up, the Buffett deal was critical at the time, said Marshall Sonanshine, the chairman and managing partner of Sonanshine Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was sensible when it was done, but tragic it had to be done the way it was done," said Sonanshine. "The last four months of 2008 were such an extraordinary time of fear and financial collapse one cannot realistically ask: 'Should we have? Might we have? Could we have?' The point is Goldman is a very strong franchise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INVESTMENT PROSPECTS WERE DIM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett's investment didn't always look so promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, two months after he made his move, Goldman common shares were as low as $47.44. Some doubted the wisdom of Buffett's investment and began to question his stewardship of Berkshire itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Buffett stuck with Goldman through all the ups and downs -- even after his trusted investment banker, Byron Trott, announced planned to strike out on his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Bergman, an equity analyst with Morningstar Inc (MORN.O) in Chicago, recalled an October newspaper column in which Buffett said he planned to buy stock in U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No one is noticing now that the market is above where it was when he wrote the article," Bergman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bergman initially expected Goldman to be a safe and strong investment for Berkshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is what it looks like increasingly," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And making the deal even sweeter, Goldman's top executives are publicly committed to protecting Buffett's investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a regulatory filing in October, a group of Goldman executives, including Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, agreed not to sell more than 10 percent of their common shares in Goldman until October 2011, or until Berkshire redeems the $5 billion in preferred stock it purchased last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Townsend, the president and chief executive of Hill- Townsend Capital LLC, said it was obvious Buffett will stick with Goldman over the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Buffett tends to be a long-term holder," Townsend added. "I don't see him quickly leaving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with a deal like that, why should he?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is willing to invest up to 10 percent of its operating income in its Internet search business for up to five years, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Thursday, as its "Bing" search engine starts to gain ground with Web surfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bing -- part of Microsoft's perennially money-losing online services unit -- has been winning market share from rivals, according to industry data released this week, but still trails market leader Google by a long way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our shareholders, I told them we were willing to spend 5 to 10 percent of operating income for up to five years in this business, and we feel like we can get an economic return," Ballmer told a business lunch in Chicago, without elaborating on the timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new search engine grabbed 12.1 percent of U.S. Internet searches for the June 8-12 work week, up from 11.3 percent from June 1-5 but trailing Google Inc's 65 percent of U.S. searches in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't go from 8 percent to 80. You have to be patient," said Ballmer. "We invested in Xbox for years and now it generates nice economic returns for us," he added, referring to the company's popular gaming console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reported operating income of $4.4 billion last quarter, which would mean Ballmer is envisaging spending up to $440 million per quarter, or almost $1.8 billion per year, developing Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does not break out investment in its various projects, so it's not clear if that is a significant increase on previous spending. Microsoft has continued to invest in Internet projects, even though its online services business is a net drain on cash, losing $575 million last quarter alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing, fully launched on June 3, is just the opening salvo in Microsoft's campaign to counter the dominance of Google in the Web-search and related advertising business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company, which is in talks with Yahoo Inc over a potential partnership, has long been determined to play a role in that lucrative space after watching rival Google take a stranglehold on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer regretted that Microsoft had not entered the Internet search market earlier, saying that the company understood the technology's importance, but had not come up with a way to monetize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we could have one do-over I would probably say I would start sooner on search," said Ballmer. "Sometimes the error you make is what you don't do and don't see. Our mistake wasn't that we didn't see the technology change coming, we didn't see the business change coming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft closed down 0.8 percent at $23.50 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ian Sherr; Writing by Edwin Chan and Bill Rigby; Editing by Tim Dobbyn and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Salesforce.com Inc's outspoken chief executive took a few jabs at Microsoft Corp's lumbering efforts to build up its "cloud computing" services on Thursday, on a visit to  the world's largest software company's home town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc Benioff, a former Oracle Corp employee who founded Salesforce.com 10 years ago, rarely misses a chance to bash Microsoft as he spreads his gospel of cutting out software installed on users' computers and getting companies to use applications over the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are all about no software and they are all about software," Benioff said at a lunch in Seattle, when asked about Microsoft. "We are all about creating a whole new movement of cloud computing to move companies away from Microsoft's proprietary technology and monopolistic business practices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce, with a "Ghostbusters"-style logo with the word "software" in a red, barred circle, is not an immediate threat to Microsoft. The San Francisco-based company had just over $1 billion in revenue last fiscal year, compared to Microsoft's $60 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the smaller company has crept onto Microsoft's radar as it attracts more companies to run business applications over the web, saving money on software, servers and IT administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing so, Salesforce has put itself at the forefront of the broad phenomenon known as cloud computing, or selling software as a service. Microsoft -- led by chief software architect Ray Ozzie -- is moving in the same direction, the company says, but little has actually changed in its product line-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm a huge fan of Ray Ozzie, but I know how hard it is to operate within the culture of Microsoft," said Benioff. "That's why you really haven't seen them deliver any breaking technology in this area yet, even though they've been talking about it for many years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been investing heavily in date storage centers and is expected to roll-out its "Azure" platform for cloud-based applications later this year. But Benioff was skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I call it Azune, because it's got the same opportunities," Benioff joked, referring to Microsoft's relatively unpopular Zune digital music player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benioff did not offer any hopes for a quick recovery from the recession, but said his company was controlling costs and customers were adapting to conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Customers are starting to get their sea-legs, learning how to operate in this environment," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLANO, Texas &amp; ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
IBM (NYSE: IBM)and Siemens PLM Software, a global provider of product lifecycle
management (PLM) software and services, today jointly announced offerings that
help companies improve the management of products throughout their lifecycle --
from design and manufacturing to end-of-life planning and recycling -- and
simplify the process of sharing key product data and manufacturing plans. 

As products become more sophisticated and the number of suppliers and
manufacturers increases around the globe, companies need a more intelligent and
well-connected framework to support the accurate exchange of millions of data
transactions. These transactions are important in the design and manufacturing
of mechanical, software and electrical components critical in products from
planes and ships to global positioning systems and cell phones. 

Using IBM's Product Development Integration Framework (PDIF) as a development
platform and primary integration environment, Siemens is delivering ready-to-use
solutions built on its Teamcenter PLM software portfolio and IBM WebSphere and
Information Management (DB2). PDIF also enables a richer integration between
Siemens Teamcenter and Rational Software Platform for Systems. 

Additionally, IBM and Siemens will jointly provide a comprehensive range of
services including consulting and implementation, systems integration, and
application hosting. 

"Siemens PLM Software`s Teamcenter is the industry`s first PDIF-ready platform
to deliver tightly integrated IBM middleware offerings that reduce PLM software
acquisition and lifecycle costs," said Michael Wheeler, vice president, IBM PLM
and Supply Chain Solutions. "By using a flexible software environment, companies
have a framework for marrying key PLM business processes to technology
initiatives that offer a structured approach to managing the life of a product,"
added Wheeler. 

"For information technology groups the news translates into easier deployment
and technical support. For line-of-business users from product development to
supply chain it means faster access to information and better performance to
support collaboration for global product development," stated Michael Burkett,
leading industry analyst and vice president, AMR Research. "The technology
certification is significant in its depth where Teamcenter PLM is now optimized
to run on IBM applications including WebSphere and DB2," added Burkett. 

By exploiting the open computing flexibility of IBM's service-oriented
architecture (SOA) and IBM's PDIF, companies can address the challenge of making
sure millions of pieces of data and design plans are exchanged accurately
throughout the product lifecycle communities. The combination of PLM with SOA
helps companies build, extend and transform their existing infrastructures
incrementally over time by allowing multiple systems to re-use business services
and incorporate new technologies such as web-based collaboration across the
product supply chain. 

"One of the significant benefits of today`s announcement is the fact that
customers will no longer need to choose between IBM and Siemens when selecting
the best PLM solution for their organizations," said Chuck Grindstaff, executive
vice president of Products and CTO, Siemens PLM Software. "Companies now have
access to the performance and reliability of IBM middleware combined with the
scalability and instant access to product knowledge provided by Teamcenter. This
combination presents a unique advantage for companies as they address the
growing demand from their customers for more sustainable products." 

IBM and Siemens PLM Software are also working closely with IBM`s Business
Partner network to deliver PLM to the small and medium size business community.
In addition, the companies will deepen their joint client offerings by
optimizing Siemens PLM Software applications that can run IBM server and storage
devices.

&lt;p&gt; * Investment over next five years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Says should have got into search sooner
 (Adds Ballmer quotes, background on Microsoft, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ian Sherr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHICAGO, June 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is
willing to invest up to 10 percent of its operating income in
its Internet search business for up to five years, Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer said on Thursday, as its "Bing" search
engine starts to gain ground with Web surfers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bing -- part of Microsoft's perennially money-losing online
services unit -- has been winning market share from rivals,
according to industry data released this week, but still trails

developing Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft does not break out investment in its various
projects, so it's not clear if that is a significant increase
on previous spending. Microsoft has continued to invest in
Internet projects, even though its online services business is
a net drain on cash, losing $575 million last quarter alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bing, fully launched on June 3, is just the opening salvo
in Microsoft's campaign to counter the dominance of Google in
the Web-search and related advertising business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company, which is in talks
with Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) over a potential partnership, has long
been determined to play a role in that lucrative space after
watching rival Google take a stranglehold on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer regretted that Microsoft had not entered the
Internet search market earlier, saying that the company
understood the technology's importance, but had not come up
with a way to monetize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we could have one do-over I would probably say I would

&lt;p&gt;http://www.profit.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT) as the Bull of the
Day and Patterson-UTI (Nasdaq: PTEN) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), JP Morgan Chase
(NYSE: JPM) and AIG (NYSE: AIG). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We are reiterating our Buy recommendation on Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT), and are
raising our target price to $39.00 per share from $32.00 per share. 

Although the weak steel market will adversely impact earnings in 2009, it will
still realize favorable margins relative to other domestic coal producers, as it
produces some of highest quality low-vol. met coal in the world. 

We believe that the company's shift to a pure-play natural resource/energy
increases shareholder value as we are bullish on the long-term coal supply and
demand story. 

Bear of the Day: 

Our continued Sell recommendation on Patterson-UTI (Nasdaq: PTEN) shares
reflects our expectation of a sustained softness in onshore drilling activities,
resulting from a combination of commodity-price weakness, too much natural gas
supply and recession-hit demand, particularly in the industrial sector. 

Patterson-UTI remains particularly vulnerable to this weak macro environment
given its lack of contract coverage and heavy spot market exposure. 

While the company remains in strong financial health, its recent decision to cut
its quarterly dividend by 69% is a prudent move to conserve capital. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Obama`s Regulatory Reform Plan

The plan greatly extends the supervisory powers of the Federal Reserve as it
would become a consolidated supervisor over all large financial institutions
such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), AIG (NYSE: AIG),
etc., whose problems pose potential risks to the economic system. However, the
Fed would be required to receive approval from the Treasury for emergency
lending under "unusual and exigent" circumstances. 

The proposal will most likely be debated strongly as many critics of the Fed
argue that its loose monetary policy and failure to exercise the existing powers
over banks ultimately led to the current crisis. 

In order to fill in regulatory gaps and coordinate with the various agencies,
the plan would create a council of regulators headed by the Treasury Secretary. 

The plan also requires all hedge funds and private equity funds to register with
the SEC and open their books to regulators.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Software giant Microsoft Corp is launching a free PC security service next week in what could be the biggest challenge to date for anti-virus companies with billions of dollars in annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts who previewed the service, Microsoft Security Essentials, said its features and quality are on par with anti-virus products from Symantec Corp, McAfee Inc and Trend Micro Inc that cost about $40 per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is good news for consumers. It's bad news for competitors," said Roger Kay, a PC industry analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product offers protection from several types of malicious software, including viruses, spyware, trojans and rootkits. If its scanner detects a suspicious file that is not yet registered as malware, the program alerts Microsoft researchers for further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security companies have minimized the threat from Microsoft. Executives with Symantec and McAfee dismiss it as a lightweight alternative to full protection that they offer in their top-selling security suites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's offering only fights malicious software. The best-selling products from security rivals bundle in other features such as encryption, firewalls, data backup and parental controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Enderle, an analyst with Enderle Group who closely follows the industry, said consumers do not need all those bells and whistles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If what is 'good enough' is free, how do you justify paying more?" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said on Thursday that a beta version of the product will be available for download on its website on June 23. The company plans to offer a final version by this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The free service comes after a botched attempt to sell a suite of security software dubbed Live OneCare that Microsoft launched three years ago. It announced plans to kill that product in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney is a global brand with film studios and theme parks bearing his name, but now his family are unveiling a museum to tell the story of the animation pioneer they say has been lost behind the trademark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization established in 1995 to promote education and the study of Disney, will open the Walt Disney Family Museum on October 1 in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My father's name is probably one of the most well-known names around the world, but as the 'brand' or trademark has spread, for many, the man has become lost," Disney's daughter and museum founder, Diane Disney Miller, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The museum will trace Disney's life from his birth in Chicago and childhood in Missouri to his move to California in 1920s, where he married and his animation career took off with the creation of the "Mickey Mouse" character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the exhibits on display will be early animation drawings, film clips, scripts, cameras and many of Disney's numerous Academy Awards, including an honorary Oscar in 1939 for his first feature length animation film "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will also be a model of the Disneyland theme park he first envisioned, quite different from the park that opened in California in 1955, and a model of the Lily Belle train that ran on half a mile of track around his Hollywood home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Visiting my grandpa was pretty fun," Walter Miller, the foundation's president, recalled at a launch of the museum in New York on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REVOLUTIONIZED ANIMATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Perhaps my grandfather's greatest gift, without question his greatest pleasure, was to bring imagination to life," he said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc today announced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) has declared effective Pfizer`s Registration Statement on Form S-4. The
Form S-4 registers with the SEC Pfizer`s common stock to be issued in connection
with the pending acquisition of Wyeth. In addition, the Form S-4 includes
Wyeth`s Proxy Statement for its annual meeting of stockholders to be held on
July 20, 2009, at which Wyeth`s stockholders will vote on the merger agreement
with Pfizer. 

The Registration Statement on Form S-4 is available on www.pfizer.com. 

Completion of this transaction remains subject to the expiration of the waiting
period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the
U.S., governmental and regulatory approvals in certain other jurisdictions,
approval by the stockholders of Wyeth, and other usual and customary closing
conditions. Subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing conditions, it is
expected that the transaction will close at the end of the third quarter or

Forward-Looking Statements

This press release includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, but are not limited to,
statements about the benefits of the pending merger between Pfizer and Wyeth,
including future financial and operating results, the combined company's plans,
objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not
historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and
expectations of Pfizer's and Wyeth's management and are subject to significant
risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the
forward-looking statements. Neither Pfizer nor Wyeth undertake any obligation to
update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements. The following factors,
among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the
forward-looking statements: the possibility that the expected synergies from the
pending merger of Pfizer and Wyeth will not be realized, or will not be realized
within the expected time period, due to, among other things, the impact of
pharmaceutical industry regulation and pending legislation that could affect the
pharmaceutical industry; the ability to obtain governmental and self-regulatory
organization approvals of the merger on the proposed terms and schedule; the
failure of Wyeth stockholders to approve the merger; the risk that the
businesses will not be integrated successfully; disruption from the merger
making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; the
possibility that the merger does not close, including, but not limited to, due
to the failure to satisfy the closing conditions; Pfizer's and Wyeth's ability
to accurately predict future market conditions; dependence on the effectiveness
of Pfizer's and Wyeth's patents and other protections for innovative products;
the risk of new and changing regulation and health policies in the U.S. and
internationally and the exposure to litigation and/or regulatory actions.
Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those
described in the forward-looking statements can be found in Pfizer's 2008 Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") on February 27, 2009, Wyeth's 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as
amended, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2009, including in the "Risk
Factors" section of each of these filings, and each company's other filings with
the SEC available at the SEC's Internet site (http://www.sec.gov).

pharmaceutical industry regulation and pending legislation that could affect the
pharmaceutical industry; the ability to obtain governmental and self-regulatory
organization approvals of the merger on the proposed terms and schedule; the
failure of Wyeth stockholders to approve the merger; the risk that the
businesses will not be integrated successfully; disruption from the merger
making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; the
possibility that the merger does not close, including, but not limited to, due
to the failure to satisfy the closing conditions; Pfizer's and Wyeth's ability
to accurately predict future market conditions; dependence on the effectiveness
of Pfizer's and Wyeth's patents and other protections for innovative products;
the risk of new and changing regulation and health policies in the U.S. and
internationally and the exposure to litigation and/or regulatory actions.
Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those
described in the forward-looking statements can be found in Pfizer's 2008 Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") on February 27, 2009, Wyeth's 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as
amended, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2009, including in the "Risk
Factors" section of each of these filings, and each company's other filings with
the SEC available at the SEC's Internet site (http://www.sec.gov).

&lt;p&gt;DETROIT (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's Bing search engine won more market share from rivals last week, according to new industry data released on Wednesday, but still trails Google Inc and Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenging market leader Google -- which in turn is looking to break into Microsoft's core software market -- is a long-term project, said Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have had some very good initial response," Ballmer said at a conference in Detroit. "I don't want to over-set expectations. We are going to have to be tenacious and keep up the pace of innovation over a long period of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft grabbed 12.1 percent of U.S. Internet searches for the work week June 8-12, according to data released by industry tracker comScore earlier on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is up from 11.3 percent in the June 1-5 period -- the week in which Bing was launched -- and up from 9.1 percent the week before that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For comparison, Google got 65 percent of U.S. searches in May, the last full month for which figures are available, followed by Yahoo with 20.1 percent and Microsoft with 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts and investors are keenly awaiting data for all of June to see if Microsoft can hold onto early gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer acknowledged the tough task of beating Google, which he referred to as "a big dog competitor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company has long been determined to play a major role in the lucrative Web search market after watching upstart Google take a stranglehold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Google is looking to take advantage of its popularity to launch software that competes with Microsoft's, which has created a new source of tension between the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft ratcheted up that tension on Wednesday by claiming that Google's new Apps Sync for Microsoft Outlook software -- which allows users to share data between their Outlook e-mail and Google's online offerings -- disables a key function in Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The installation of the Google Apps Sync plugin disables Outlook's ability to search any and all of your Outlook data," Outlook product manager Dev Balasubramanian wrote on a Microsoft blog. "It is also important to note that uninstalling the plugin may not fix the issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, though relatively unimportant to users, represents a crucial struggle between Microsoft and Google for e-mail customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's new product allows business users to continue using Outlook for email and other tasks, but the back-end functionality and data storage moves to Google, instead of residing on a company's internal servers running Microsoft software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google acknowledged the Outlook problem identified by Microsoft, and several other issues where its software does not mesh well with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're working with Microsoft and other partners to help fix these issues and support additional Outlook features like multiple calendars," said Google Apps senior product manager Chris Vander Mey in a blog post. "We'll keep you posted on our progress."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares closed up just less than 1 percent at $23.68, while Google's fell 0.2 percent to $415.16, both on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Poornima Gupta, Gabriel Madway and Bill Rigby; Editing Bernard Orr and Lincoln Feast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  BURNABY, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Jun 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Spectrum Signal Processing by Vecima ("Spectrum") (TSX: VCM), an advanced
custom radio provider, announced today that the Future Multiband
Multiwaveform Modular Tactical Radio (FM3TR) waveform has been
successfully ported to Spectrum's flexComm(TM) SDR-4000 software
reconfigurable transceiver. Researchers at the University of California
San Diego division of the California Institute for Telecommunications and
Information Technology (Calit2) conducted the successful work under
support from the U.S. Joint Program Executive Office for the Joint
Tactical Radio System (JPEO JTRS) program. Calit2 researchers completed
the port in just four months after receiving the SDR-4000 equipment. This
waveform can now be readily employed by all of Spectrum's SDR-4000 users.

    "The FM3TR project with Calit2 demonstrates that with software defined
radio (SDR) technology, a Software Communications Architecture
(SCA)-enabled waveform can be rapidly ported to an industry
commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system, such as Spectrum's SDR-4000,"
said Dr. Richard North, Technical Director for JPEO JTRS. "The JPEO JTRS
is proud to support the adoption of SDR technologies through programs
like the JTRS Open Information Repository (IR)."

    The JTRS Open IR contains material donated by the JTRS JPEO as a courtesy
to the open-source SDR development community. The plan is that the IR
will continue to grow over time with additional contributions not only
from JPEO JTRS and Calit2, but the user community as well. The JTRS FM3TR
waveform code and documentation is available in the JTRS Open IR,
accessible at http://jtrs.calit2.net.

    "Spectrum offered a comprehensive solution that enabled us to begin our
development immediately, while remaining on schedule and on budget for
the completion of the FM3TR port," said Bill Hodgkiss, Principal
Investigator on the Calit2/JTRS SDR Project. He added, "The Spectrum
solution tightly integrated the hardware, software - including a complete
SCA Core Framework, a hardware abstraction layer and application protocol
interface (API) library, and all the necessary development tools."
Hodgkiss is also associate director of the UC San Diego division of
Calit2. The Calit2 team successfully demonstrated and presented the FM3TR
port at the joint meeting of JTRS Science and Technology Forum and the
SDR Forum 61st General Working Meeting, held earlier this year in San
Diego at Calit2.

    "Our work with the JPEO JTRS during the past year has been, and is, a
unique opportunity for a university to get an insight into the technology
challenges facing the defense industry in the communications area," noted
Per Johansson, a Calit2 Principal Engineer and the Project Manager of the
Calit2/JTRS Project. "It has been a chance for us to work in a real
commercial environment with equipment and tools. The close collaboration
we have with JTRS JPEO has been key for us to be able to get up to speed
in such a relatively short time."

    Johansson summed up, "It's been a great learning experience for us. With
this port, we became familiar with this environment, and knowing what we
know now, we can take the next step and start looking at something where
we design it from the start." Next, the team will build a Software
Communications Architecture (SCA)-enabled version of the APCO Project 25
(P25) public safety waveform, again using the SDR-4000; follow-on support
from JPEO JTRS began recently.

    "A healthy open-source SDR development community is essential to reduce
the costs of fielding these powerful radio technologies. FM3TR is a
waveform we believe will be useful not just to Spectrum's SDR-4000
customers, but to the entire community of developers," said Mark Briggs,
VP Marketing at Spectrum. "This program at Calit2 is an excellent example
of effective government, academic and industry partnership, producing
meaningful results for the good of the community."

    About the SDR-4000

    The SDR-4000 is a multi-purpose software reconfigurable transceiver that
comes with a comprehensive software stack including an SCA Core Framework
with development tools, Spectrum's quicComm(TM) hardware abstraction
layer and API library, and a real-time operating system (RTOS) with an
integrated development environment. The SDR-4000 has been proven to
support physical layer implementations of other JTRS waveforms including:

    - Wideband Networking Waveform Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
(WNW OFDM)

    - Soldier Radio Waveform Electronic Warfare (SRW EW)

    - Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS)

    About FM3TR and Calit2's ported version of FM3TR

    The Future Multiband Multiwaveform Modular Tactical Radio (FM3TR)
waveform is a test waveform developed and used as an instrument to
promote international interoperability. The FM3TR waveform provides
frequency hopping, over both VHF and UHF military bands (30 MHz - 400
MHz), using continuously variable slope delta (CVSD) modulation for voice
digitizing. The FM3TR waveform defines two operational modes: voice and
data. In the Calit2-ported version of FM3TR, the voice mode is used to
support a push-to-talk (PTT) application and the data service primarily
supports an instant text-messaging (ITM) application. Of these two
applications, the FM3TR base code only supported the voice mode and a PTT
application; therefore, the Calit2 team added a data mode to support the
ITM application. Wherever possible, the FM3TR base code was reused to
minimize additional development, this was also the case for the data mode
and ITM application. The Calit2-ported FM3TR code and documentation will
be available in the JTRS Open IR shortly; it is currently undergoing JTRS
conformance testing which will ease wider use and adoption.

 (Adds analyst comment, details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; June 18 (Reuters) - Irish engineering group Kentz Corp Ltd
KENZ.L said on Thursday its joint venture in Australia signed
a contract worth about A$500 million ($398.4 million) with a
unit of Chevron Corp (CVX.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company and its partners Decmil Pty Ltd and Thiess Pty
Ltd have been contracted to design and build a construction
village on Barrow Island, Western Australia, by Chevron
Australia Pty Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kentz's share in the contract is estimated to be around
$133 million, Evolution Securities analyst Keith Morris said in
a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The work is expected to start in the second half of the
year following a final investment decision on the
Chevron-operated Gorgon project, Kentz said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Gorgon project is a joint venture between the
Australian units of Chevron, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) to develop the Greater Gorgon gas
fields which contain resources of about 40 trillion cubic feet,
around a quarter of Australia's known reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Chevron's Gorgon project cleared some
environmental concerns on the potential damage to a protected
nature reserve in Barrow Island where flatback turtles come to
nest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The contract gives Kentz a key position in the $30 billion
development project, said Morris, who raised his price target
on the company's stock to 200 pence from 175 pence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst has a "buy" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the year ended December 2008, the company posted a
pretax profit of $40.7 million, before flotation costs, on
revenue of $643.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Kentz were trading up 1.5 pence at 159 pence at
0845 GMT on Thursday on the London Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Overseas Investment Trust has scooped up selected drugmakers on the cheap as other investors dumped the defensive stocks and chased oversold cyclicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors have been shifting out of drugmakers and other defensive stocks into cyclical plays this year, driving up the MSCI All-Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS 41 percent since March 9, as the pace of economic deterioration moderated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeroen Huysinga, manager of the 147 million pound fund, said he had bought Abbot Laboratories Inc (ABT.N) and Roche (ROG.VX) as they "are very, very interesting, reasonably high growth companies but have become extremely cheap."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not like AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), however, as they were not set to deliver the kind of growth rate he was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huysinga, who took over the fund on October 1, 2008, said the financial crisis, especially the immediate period after the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September, had created ample opportunities for stock pickers like him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Q4 (of 2008) was a good time to respond because everyone was panicking. All these hedge funds were blowing up, forced selling. It was (a) wonderful, wonderful opportunity. A moment like that was quite good," the 44-year-old fund manager said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund, which holds about 80 stocks, handed investors a 10.4 percent return for the year to June 16. That compares with a 7.2 percent gain for the MSCI All-Country World Index during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OUSTANDINGLY CHEAP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huysinga also said he liked Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) among the capital market banks, which have seen strong gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the end of Q4, Morgan Stanley at $12 looked outstandingly cheap. People thought they were going to go bust but we did not," Huysinga said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley closed at $27.48 on Wednesday, while Goldman Sachs was at $139.73.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are survivors. The industry has been consolidated, pricing power is stronger, activity levels have picked up sharply," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailed out U.S. insurer American International Group (AIG.N) has chosen Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Morgan Stanley as its joint global coordinators for a more than $4 billion IPO of its Asian life insurance unit, sources said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, European corporates, excluding financials, have issued 175 billion worth of euro-denominated bonds from the beginning of this year to early June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huysinga, who has 60 analysts in Tokyo, Singapore, London and New York to help him scrutinize 2,000 stocks around the globe, noted Chinese stocks also delivered strong returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among his holdings were China Merchants Bank (3968.HK), China Construction Bank (0939.HK), Bank of China (3988.HK), China Shenhua Energy Co (1088.HK), tobacco and food flavoring producer Huabao International (0336.HK) and personal hygiene producer Hengan International Group (1044.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked when he would cash in his Chinese holdings, Huysinga said: "These stocks are up 70, 80 percent, so you wouldn't expect me to hold on forever. It's not a buy-and-hold strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund manager also liked U.S. railroad CSX (CSX.N), as the industry in the United States had strong pricing power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Simon Jessop)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KSM`s Rendition of the Cheap Trick Classic "I Want You to Want Me" Set to Appear
in the New ABC Family Summer Original Series "10 Things I Hate About You"
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney Sound`s newest artist, KSM will kick off opening for the "Demi Lovato
Summer Tour 2009" on June 21 in Hartford, Connecticut at the XL Center through
July 22 in Kansas City, Missouri. KSM will open on 22 dates of Lovato`s 40-city
North American tour, produced by AEG Live. 

Late last year, KSM wrapped their first tour, opening for the 32-city 2008 Tour
of Gymnastics Superstars with Olympic medalists Nastia Liukin, Shawn Johnson and
others. Earlier this year, KSM opened for Jonas Brothers, Demi Lovato and Honor
Society. The girls` January appearance with Jonas Brothers in Detroit, resulted
in an MTV Buzzworthy mention: "But if you can (temporarily) snap yourself out of
your OMJ! euphoria, you might just notice that those chicks on stage are doing a
pretty good job of warming up the crowd. And from the sounds of their single,
`Distracted,` we`re thinking their LP may well be hyperventilation-worthy in its
own right." 

KSM`s first Radio Disney single, "Distracted" was written and produced by hit
makers Matthew Gerrard and Robbie Nevil -- the team responsible for
chart-topping songs from High School Musical, Hannah Montana, Jesse McCartney
and Hilary Duff. The track debuted on Radio Disney`s Music Mailbag "Pick it or
Kick it" feature with an impressive 96% of the listeners who voted to "pick" the
track. 

Most recently, KSM were invited to record their own rendition of the Cheap Trick
classic "I Want You to Want Me," which will appear in the new ABC Family summer
original series, "10 Things I Hate About You" premiering Tuesday, July 7 (8:00 -
8:30 p.m. ET/PT). A :60 music video promo featuring the cast of "10 Things I
Hate About You" began airing on ABC Family on June 17, and a full-length music
video featuring the band and show`s cast - including Ethan Peck, Lindsey Shaw,
Meaghan Martin, Dana Davis, and Nicholas Braun - with additional streams and
behind-the-scenes videos is available now on ABCFamily.com at
http://community.abcfamily.go.com/watch/10thingsihateaboutyou/music-videos-we-want-you-watch?icid=home_hero4_r_10things_watch_ksmfullvideo

KSM` debut album is set for release in September.

ABOUT THE BAND:

The Runaways, The Go-Gos and the Bangles&#8230;Those cutting edge all-girl groups had
a profound influence on what made a rock band and who could play in one. KSM may
not be the first all-girl rock band- but they are a force that will definitely
fit in the same conversation as many of the iconic female bands before them.
They are young but talented beyond their years with no pretense -- and they
rock. 

When it comes to making music, Shelby (lead vocals &amp; guitar), Katie (guitar &amp;
vocals) Shae (lead guitar), Sophia (bass) and Kate (drums), are a wrecking crew
unto themselves. They sing of the world they know -- boys, dating, texting,
playing and partying -- yet they also bring a surprising measure of depth to
their songs. 

Says lead singer Shelby, "Being all girl, all teen, we`re usually pre-judged.
People don`t expect that much, but we usually convince the audience that we`re a
legit rock band, not just a `chick band.` KSM...5 girls taking music into their
own hands and ready to show their generation what girl power is all about.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co said it expects to record a $1.1 billion charge in its second-quarter results after returning $25 billion in taxpayer funds to the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charge, relating to the early repayment of the government's investment, reduces second-quarter results by about 27 cents a share, the bank said in a regulatory filing on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also said it has paid more than $795 million in dividends on the preferred stock it issued to the government in the fall, as part of the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten large banks, including JPMorgan, repaid more than $68 billion to the TARP on Wednesday, in a bid to extract themselves from government restrictions on pay for top executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group said it paid a dividend of $425 million, reducing second-quarter earnings by about 77 cents a share, the bank said earlier in the week. Morgan Stanley said it expects a $892 million charge in the second quarter relating to the early repayment of the government investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley received $10 billion from the bank bailout fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors still hang on the words of Abby Joseph Cohen, the Goldman Sachs strategist whose staunch bullish calls in the 1990s made her a Wall Street legend, yet critics say she lost her touch a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cohen no longer predicts where the benchmark Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX will end the year -- calls that burnished her reputation in the 1990s when she held to her forecasts despite corrections that turned others bearish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She rightly understood early in the 1990s that earnings growth would be sustained longer than past business cycles. But this decade, Wall Street almost uniformly failed to grasp the magnitude of a credit bubble that would jack up U.S. home values and spawn the worst global recession in half a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics have panned Cohen's predictions ever since the tech bubble burst in early 2000. Her profile on Wikipedia ticks off a list over the past two years of bullish calls that fell short, and says her reputation was "further damaged" when she failed to foresee the market's deep plunge late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen takes it in stride. Told by a reporter at the Reuters Investment Summit Outlook this week that she has erred in the past, Cohen knocked back the accusation in a calm voice that was not testy as her words might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say that if you look at the record, you were wrong in terms of whether my forecasts have been wrong," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen, now senior investment strategist and president of Goldman's Global Markets Institute, said she feared many media rely on other media reports rather than review her record themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen said that in late 1999, when the bull market was still raging, she was criticized for providing a mild forecast that stocks were near fair value and were unlikely to rise notably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the height of the tech bubble in March 2000 "I suggested to our clients that they sell stocks. For some reason, many of the media indicated that I was extraordinarily bullish at that period of time. Why that is, I don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen is a consummate professional, known for taking copious notes at client meetings. Her thinking is clear and lucid, and she adheres to her models, said Joseph Battipaglia, market strategist at Stifel Nicolaus in Yardley, Pennsylvania, who has been on panels and other events with Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is "extraordinarily nice" and "just a very delightful person," said Battipaglia, a well-known bull in the 1990s who like many others, knew stock valuations were getting out of hand but failed to act. He credits Cohen for saying it was time to reduce equities just before the bubble burst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also has been phenomenally good for Goldman, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen is troubled by the focus on headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To focus on the number without understanding why markets move the way they do and the economy moves the way it does I think sets many investors, particularly individual investors, in a very difficult situation," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forecasting this decade has been difficult. Knowing when stocks would recover from the post-September 11, 2001, malaise and how high they would rise, then foreseeing the credit crisis and the depth of damage from unfettered lending has been painful for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen says she gets no credit for saying the SP 500 was 40 percent underpriced in early 2003 before the U.S. invasion of Iraq. The benchmark gained 41 percent from lows that March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then there is 2008, when in January she said the SP 500 would end at 1,675; it closed the year at 903.25. In March 2008 she stopped making short-term forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of us saw this unfolding in a negative way, and became very cautious," said Battipaglia, who so far has stayed correctly bearish throughout the deep market downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Battipaglia admits to getting smacked "pretty hard" by the tech wreck because "I just didn't have the courage to put out the sell now signal." He has learned his lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At least this time around I didn't make that mistake. In 2007, we talked about a recession, we talked about getting money out, so we went to cash and I was very happy with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So you do need to have, overall, a directional call that's more right than wrong," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

sector retreated earlier in the week. JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) gained 2.4 percent to $35 and ranked among the Dow's
biggest advancers. Bank of America (BAC.N) was up 2.5 percent

Enters Into Letter Of Intent With Enercor, Inc. For Purchase Of 20% Lease Assignment On Utah Oil Sands Prospect Located On Exxon Mobil Corp's Leases.</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Cobra Oil &amp; Gas Co. (OTCBB:CGCA) (Hereafter "Cobra Oil &amp; Gas"), an independent
oil and gas exploration and production company headquartered in Houston, Texas,
and focused on the strategic exploration and development of domestic energy
projects, has entered into a Letter Of Intent (LOI) with Enercor, Inc. (Enercor)
to purchase 20% lease assignment upon completion of financing activities.
Enercor holds a contract with Exxon Mobil Corporation regarding the conversion
of certain of Exxon Mobil`s leases covering approximately 26,000 acres of land
owned by the BLM (Bureau of Land Management) in the State of Utah purported to
hold an estimated potential of up to 1.4 billion barrels of oil in place in its
tar sands. That contract provides that the Company use its resources to convert
those leases into Combined Hydrocarbon Leases and then it will have the right to
exploit the tar sands on those leases at its expense, paying a 1/16 royalty to
Exxon Mobil on top of the 8% royalty that is due to the BLM. 

Max Pozzoni, President of Cobra Oil &amp; Gas, stated, "We look forward to
establishing a working relationship with our new partners, as we aim to work
together in what is the largest measured oil sands concentration in America." 

The final agreement is expected to be signed on or before September 15th 2009.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Welcome to another in a series of articles that examines the thought process
behind a variety of strategies using stock, index, and/or exchange-trade fund
(ETF) options. This column will examine the long straddle, the pros and cons of
putting on a straddle, and the profit and loss potential of this position. So,
let's jump into this interesting strategy. 

First off, I should define this strategy. A long straddle is the simultaneous
purchase of an equivalent number of calls and puts on the same underlying stock
with the same strike and same expiration. The straddle buyer is looking for a
large move by the underlying shares before the options expire, but is unsure of
the eventual direction of the move. The straddle buyer will begin realizing a
profit when the underlying stock's subsequent move exceeds the amount of the
combined premium paid for the two options. 

As we head into earnings season, the next few months will be ripe with
opportunities for potential straddle positions. One company that is set to march
into the earnings spotlight is software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The firm
is slated to post earnings after the close on July 23. Analysts are currently
anticipating a profit of 38 cents per share, which is significantly below the
firm's profit of 46 cents per share for the same period a year ago.

dividends on the preferred stock it issued to the government in
the fall, as part of the government's Troubled Asset Relief
Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ten large banks, including JPMorgan, repaid more than $68

themselves from government restrictions on pay for top

million, reducing second-quarter earnings by about 77 cents a

said it expects a $892 million charge in the second quarter
relating to the early repayment of the government investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley received $10 billion from
the bank bailout fund.

has stood as a distinctive reminder that drinking a Coke is part of summer`s
simple pleasures, just like being at a Braves game with your friends and
family." 

The Coca-Cola bottle, made of over 11,000 pieces of authentic Atlanta Braves
baseball equipment including 6,680 baseballs, 290 bats and 86 gloves, was built
as Coca-Cola Sky Field`s main attraction. Four hundred and thirty-five feet from
home plate and 80 feet above the field, the Coca-Cola bottle is positioned in
Turner Field`s most unique vantage point and is the source of many lasting
baseball memories. 

Fans are encouraged to visit the original bottle for one last photo and to post
these photos and their memories on the Coca-Cola Bottle Facebook page,
http://tinyurl.com/kt4hoc, created especially for the bottle`s official
retirement. In honor of the famous bottle`s retirement, the first 15,000 fans to
enter the stadium on July 2, will receive a commemorative 8-oz bottle with a
depiction of Coca-Cola Sky Field. 

"Coca-Cola Sky Field and the Coca-Cola bottle really set Turner Field apart from
other Major League Baseball stadiums," said Derek Schiller, executive vice
president, Sales and Marketing, Atlanta Braves. "The bottle is not only
entertaining, it reminds fans that one of America`s most iconic brands was
created right here in Atlanta. Braves baseball and Coca-Cola are both sources of
pride for Atlantans, so we do all we can to enhance the fan experience at Turner
Field." 

The new Coca-Cola bottle will be constructed in Coca-Cola Sky Field later this
summer. A special rendering of the new design will be revealed at an upcoming
game before the bottle makes its official debut. Promising to be a more
high-tech version of the beloved original bottle, the new bottle will offer even
more ways to entertain Braves fans. "We can't wait to build on the legacy of our
Braves partnership and share our new bottle with Atlantans later this summer,"
said Bayne.

&lt;p&gt;VIENNA (Reuters) - Colombia's cocaine production fell to its lowest in a decade last year as demand declined and crackdowns reaped rewards, but rose in Bolivia and Peru, the U.N. anti-crime agency said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cocaine production in Colombia, the world's No. 1 supplier, fell by 28 percent last year according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), but rose 4 by percent and 9 percent in Peru and Bolivia respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The increases for Bolivia and Peru show a trend in the wrong direction," UNODC Executive Director Antonio Maria Costa said in a statement. The two countries together produced about as much cocaine as Colombia in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Peru must guard against a return to the days when terrorists and insurgents, like the (guerrilla group) Shining Path, profited from drugs and crime," Costa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia produced less as demand from the world's main cocaine markets fell, but smaller suppliers Bolivia and Peru made more as production shifted slightly away from the biggest producer, according to UNODC findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In terms of ... production, the 2008 results are the lowest in Colombia in a decade," the UNODC said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug trafficking was being "seriously disrupted" thanks to action by local officials, it said. According to the agency, 200 tons of cocaine was seized in 2008, a 57 percent increase compared with 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of coca leaf, the raw ingredient of cocaine, is falling in Colombia, making it less attractive for farmers, it said. Cocaine supply is shrinking and the drug is getting harder to transport, boosting prices and lowering purity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This may also explain why cartels are becoming so violent," Costa said. Cocaine demand is also falling in the main North American markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall coca cultivation declined in Colombia last year, down 18 percent compared with 2007. Besides being made into cocaine, the leaf is also used as a remedy for altitude sickness and to stave off hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Championed by Bolivian President Evo Morales, a former coca farmer, the leaf is also chewed and used in teas, in cooking and for religious ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costa said the UNODC was working with farmers to ensure the plant was not being turned into cocaine, which was used at least once by between 15.5 million and 20.5 million people in 2007, according to UNODC estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Much more development assistance is needed throughout the Andean countries, particularly in poor regions like the Yungas of Bolivia, where coca is the only source of income," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N.'s annual World Drug Report is published next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andrew Dobbie)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 19 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) expanding
pre-provision earnings power and strong capital and reserve
position should result in faster earnings recovery relative to
its peers, said analysts at Robert W. Baird, who view the
company's shares as an attractive buying opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In addition, JPMorgan's above-average exposure to shorter
and early-cycle loan products such as card and home equity may
result in a more rapid earnings recovery than banks with
exposures to later-cycle products such as commercial real
estate and commercial and industrial loans, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They maintained their "outperform" rating and price target
of $42 on JPMorgan shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While JPMorgan's strong balance sheet and reserves have
made the stock defensive, the company's expanding earnings
power could make the stock offensive as the economy recovers,
the analysts added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, JPMorgan returned $25 billion in bailout
funds to the U.S. government, extricating itself from
restrictions on pay for top executives that were tied to the
bank rescue funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares were up about 1 percent to $34.53 in
pre-market trade. They closed at $34.17 Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange. The shares have risen 8 percent since the
start of the year.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Salesforce.com Inc's (CRM.N) outspoken chief executive took a few jabs at Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) lumbering efforts to build up its "cloud computing" services on Thursday, on a visit to  the world's largest software company's home town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc Benioff, a former Oracle Corp ORCL.O employee who founded Salesforce.com 10 years ago, rarely misses a chance to bash Microsoft as he spreads his gospel of cutting out software installed on users' computers and getting companies to use applications over the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are all about no software and they are all about software," Benioff said at a lunch in Seattle, when asked about Microsoft. "We are all about creating a whole new movement of cloud computing to move companies away from Microsoft's proprietary technology and monopolistic business practices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce, with a "Ghostbusters"-style logo with the word "software" in a red, barred circle, is not an immediate threat to Microsoft. The San Francisco-based company had just over $1 billion in revenue last fiscal year, compared to Microsoft's $60 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the smaller company has crept onto Microsoft's radar as it attracts more companies to run business applications over the web, saving money on software, servers and IT administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing so, Salesforce has put itself at the forefront of the broad phenomenon known as cloud computing, or selling software as a service. Microsoft -- led by chief software architect Ray Ozzie -- is moving in the same direction, the company says, but little has actually changed in its product line-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm a huge fan of Ray Ozzie, but I know how hard it is to operate within the culture of Microsoft," said Benioff. "That's why you really haven't seen them deliver any breaking technology in this area yet, even though they've been talking about it for many years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been investing heavily in date storage centers and is expected to roll-out its "Azure" platform for cloud-based applications later this year. But Benioff was skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I call it Azune, because it's got the same opportunities," Benioff joked, referring to Microsoft's relatively unpopular Zune digital music player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benioff did not offer any hopes for a quick recovery from the recession, but said his company was controlling costs and customers were adapting to conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Customers are starting to get their sea-legs, learning how to operate in this environment," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, June 19 (Reuters) - China's top offshore oil and

(GS.N) to advise it on a bid for a stake in Africa-focused oil

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and Russia could enjoy large windfalls if oil prices rose to as much as $63 per barrel this year and $90 next year, Goldman Sachs analysts said, adding they saw brighter prospects for the Gulf Arab nations when compared with Russia. Goldman's commodities research analysts have raised their oil price forecasts to $63/bbl from $50.5/bbl for 2009, and expect prices to reach $90/bbl in 2010, given intensifying supply constraints in the hydrocarbon sector and a likely return of demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the six-member GCC and Russia are both battling the current downturn, Russia is at a much less favorable spot to gain from a return of the petrodollars, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We argue that the severe recession there has been more the result of deleveraging than the direct impact of lower commodity prices," Goldman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prospects for the Gulf Arab nations are brighter even as the strength of recovery may vary between countries, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sustained oil price recovery would propel the more robust economies of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, while the more leveraged United Arab Emirates and Kuwait should take longer to rebound, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is likely that the (GCC) region as a whole will once again re-emerge as a leading capital exporter," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Russia, "this oil blessing" may push its ruble higher and aid the recovery in asset prices but would not make a significant difference to real growth in 2009, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
shares look "super cheap" even after recovering in recentmonths, as the company's new software and search engine Bing
help drive growth, business weekly Barron's said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A technology column in Barron's online edition published
this weekend said demand for its Windows 7 operating system,
due to launch later this year, was likely to be strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also cited strong data for its new Bing search engine,
saying that while Microsoft was still a distant third in the
online search market, it may have found a way to boost its
standing without buying Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The column also said Wall Street's consensus forecasts for
Microsoft may be "too grim," and noted the company's aggressive
cost cuts, below-market valuation and strong cash position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With both Windows 7 and Bing, Microsoft for the first time
in eons is giving off the aura of a company that is innovating
and listening to users. That has helped the stock rebound more
than 50 percent off the March low -- but there should be plenty
more to come," it said.

EUA 
* Tecnologia de perfura&#231;&#227;o e melhores pr&#225;ticas produzem mais g&#225;s com mais
efici&#234;ncia

HOUSTON, Texas--(Business Wire)--
A ExxonMobil Production Company anunciou hoje a conclus&#227;o da capacidade de
processamento de campo do seu Projeto Piceance , no lado ocidental das Montanhas
Rochosas, no Condado de Rio Blanco, Colorado. 

As novas instala&#231;&#245;es t&#234;m capacidade para processar at&#233; cinco milh&#245;es e
setecentos mil metros c&#250;bicos de g&#225;s natural por dia. As instala&#231;&#245;es incluem
sistemas de coleta de g&#225;s e l&#237;quido, esta&#231;&#245;es de tratamento, um duto de &#225;gua
produzida e um sistema de descarte no subsuperf&#237;cie, al&#233;m de um local de venda
de condensado e carga de caminh&#245;es. 

A ExxonMobil produz g&#225;s natural na Bacia de Piceance h&#225; quase cinquenta anos e
atualmente sua produ&#231;&#227;o atinge cerca de vinte e oito milh&#245;es de metros c&#250;bicos
por dia. A empresa est&#225; operando sete sondas para aumentar a produ&#231;&#227;o de
Piceance. 

"Um projeto como o Piceance representa uma vis&#227;o de longo prazo e o compromisso
com o desenvolvimento energ&#233;tico", diz Rich Kruger, presidente da ExxonMobil
Production. "A chave para liberar o potencial desse recurso de grande porte e
tecnicamente desafiador &#233; aumentar a produ&#231;&#227;o e as taxas de recupera&#231;&#227;o de cada
po&#231;o a baixo custo. Os cientistas e engenheiros da ExxonMobil est&#227;o trabalhando
muito para melhorar as tecnologias e processos que possibilitam isso". 

Espera-se que o g&#225;s natural seja, entre as principais fontes de combust&#237;vel, a
de crescimento mais r&#225;pido, orientado, em grande parte, pelo aumento de seu uso
na gera&#231;&#227;o de eletricidade. Os arrendamentos da ExxonMobil na Bacia de Piceance
t&#234;m recursos recuper&#225;veis potenciais de um trilh&#227;o e duzentos e oitenta bilh&#245;es
de metros c&#250;bicos de g&#225;s. "A ExxonMobil est&#225; comprometida com o desenvolvimento
desse recurso de maneira eficiente e com cuidado e sensibilidade em rela&#231;&#227;o ao
meio ambiente", afirma Kruger. 

Sucesso por meio de tecnologia exclusiva da ExxonMobil

Na Bacia de Piceance, o g&#225;s natural est&#225; aprisionado no interior de rochas t&#227;o
densas quanto o concreto e em uma &#225;rea descont&#237;nua, separada por camadas finas
de xisto. Para recuperar o g&#225;s acumulado nas camadas rochosas mais profundas &#8722; o
chamado "tight gas" &#8722;, a ExxonMobil est&#225; aplicando uma tecnologia propriet&#225;ria
da empresa e as melhores pr&#225;ticas. 

"Os po&#231;os de Piceance conclu&#237;dos com a nossa tecnologia propriet&#225;ria de
fratura&#231;&#227;o t&#234;m produ&#231;&#227;o significativamente maior que a dos po&#231;os com fratura&#231;&#227;o
convencional, al&#233;m de custo mais baixo", diz o executivo do Projeto Piceance,
Jim Branch. "Usamos o processo de perfura&#231;&#227;o r&#225;pida e a tecnologia de
estimula&#231;&#227;o multizona, ambos da ExxonMobil, com perfura&#231;&#227;o "just-in-time", para
obter acesso a at&#233; cinquenta &#225;reas contendo g&#225;s em um po&#231;o, processo esse
desconhecido at&#233; poucos anos atr&#225;s. Podemos perfurar de nove a dez po&#231;os a
partir de uma s&#243; almofada, com menor n&#237;vel de perturba&#231;&#227;o da superf&#237;cie. Cada
po&#231;o pode recuperar g&#225;s localizado em at&#233; a vinte acres abaixo do solo. O
processo, com boa rela&#231;&#227;o custo-benef&#237;cio, produz uma quantidade bem maior de
g&#225;s a partir das muitas &#225;reas que pode abrir em cada po&#231;o". 

A conserva&#231;&#227;o de &#225;gua &#233; prioridade do projeto. A ExxonMobil desenvolveu um
sistema que reutiliza a &#225;gua recuperada da produ&#231;&#227;o em outros processos. Isso
reduz o uso de &#225;gua fresca em cerca de 80%. 

A ExxonMobil faz um amplo levantamento arqueol&#243;gico, da vida silvestre e das
instala&#231;&#245;es de produ&#231;&#227;o, para ajudar a administrar o desempenho ambiental das
opera&#231;&#245;es na Bacia de Piceance. A empresa tamb&#233;m participa de estudos com
institui&#231;&#245;es educacionais locais e &#243;rg&#227;os governamentais para ampliar ao m&#225;ximo
a prote&#231;&#227;o aos habitats de animais e plantas nativos da &#225;rea de desenvolvimento
do projeto. 

A Enterprise Products Partners L.P. construiu a nova planta e as instala&#231;&#245;es da
tubula&#231;&#227;o do projeto Piceance, para fornecer servi&#231;os de compress&#227;o, tratamento
e condicionamento do g&#225;s natural produzido, que &#233; levado atrav&#233;s de diversos
sistemas de tubula&#231;&#227;o para atender a regi&#227;o.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background, league table, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michael Flaherty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, June 23 (Reuters) - One of the top mergers and
acquisitions bankers at Goldman Sachs (GS.N) in Asia is retiring
after 19 years with the firm, according to a memo obtained by
Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johan Leven, the co-head of mergers and acquisitions at
Goldman in Asia, excluding Japan, has decided to retire from the
firm in September, the memo says. Richard Campbell-Breeden will
become head of the division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Campbell-Breeden, formerly the European financial sponsor
group co-head, was appointed to join Leven in the MA co-head
role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman ranked 3rd in the Thomson Reuters Asia, ex-Japan, MA
fee rankings last year, with 37 deals worth an estimated $108.3
million in fees. The firm also ranked 3rd in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leven moved to Hong Kong in 2001 and became partner in 2004.
He worked in MA in London and Frankfurt before moving to Sydney
in 1999 to be COO of investment banking for Australia/New
Zealand.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, the world's largest payment networks, could face lower revenue and pressure on their stock prices amid a push for increased U.S. regulation of credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Congress is mulling regulations on interchange rates -- fees retailers and merchants have to pay to banks that issue credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most immediately, that would affect the banks that collect those fees. But some investors and analysts are concerned the banks -- already battered by credit losses and toxic assets -- could try to share the haircut with Visa and MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Longer term, I think it is a real risk for the model, but this could impact their stocks right now," said Donald Fandetti, an analyst at Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard said the companies would not be impacted by the legislation because they do not charge interchange fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But concern about the legislation has contributed to a 10 percent drop in Visa's shares in the last month and a 5 percent decline for MasterCard, and the shares could fall further, analysts and investors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an overhang on these stocks, at least until we have some clarity," said Moshe Katri, an analyst at Cowen  Co, who said the legislation could impact the profitability of 20 percent of MasterCard's revenues and 10 percent of Visa's revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the financial crisis, Visa's shares traded at 25 times future earnings and MasterCard stock was at 20 times. Now Visa's shares are trading closer to 20 times 2010 earnings and MasterCard stock is around 15 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These price-to-earnings multiples -- still high compared with many financials -- could become the new norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is heightened regulatory risk and we think investors will reflect that in a lower multiple," Fandetti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa's shares ended down 0.21 percent at $61.24, while MasterCard stock fell 2.83 percent to $156.78.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHARE THE PAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interchange fees laws currently under discussion would be in addition to recent legislation already approved limiting credit card fees and interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation would give merchants and retailers more power to negotiate interchange fees with banks. It follows longtime complaints from store owners that banks have colluded to set fee structures and block them from negotiating with Visa and MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, interchange fees rose 14 percent to about $48 billion, averaging about 1.75 percent of total purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard are partially insulated from the impact of the legislation because they make the bulk of their money every time a person swipes a card and do not collect interchange fees, but they could be affected by a retrenchment in the credit card industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, analysts estimate the companies receive around 10 cents per $100 transaction from the card issuers and, if banks were forced to cut interchange rates, the financial institutions could ask Visa and MasterCard to share the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also said the world's biggest payment networks could be near a renegotiation of their contracts with some big U.S. banks, which could ask for lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is adding some pricing pressure," said Walter Todd, portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard have said merchants already are able to negotiate lower fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't see Congress legislating interchange fees or setting prices," William Sheedy, president of Visa for North America, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The real question is whether the government is going to jump in and get into the game of price control in the free market. At the end of the day, this is price control and this just doesn't smell right," said Chris McWilton, MasterCard's president of U.S. markets, at an investor's conference earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheedy and MasterCard's spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said the pending legislation would not affect their companies revenue. Both added that, when Australia cut interchange fees, neither Visa nor MasterCard were hurt by the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. billionaire Len Blavatnik filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) on Monday, accusing the bank of mismanaging an investment account that held about $1 billion in assets owned by Blavatnik's industrial holding company, Access Industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik's lawyers blame Ted Ufferfilge, a JPMorgan banker appointed to manage the assets for Access, for losing $98 million of the company's money betting on risky subprime mortgage securities, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan and Mr. Ufferfilge implemented a series of ill-conceived investment strategies," wrote Access' law firm, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver  Hedges, in the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit contends that Access hired JPMorgan to manage the investment account, called CMMF, with conservative objectives and specific diversification and liquidity requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the bank and Ufferfilge invested the fund in risky and illiquid mortgage-related securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan and Mr. Ufferfilge made the reckless and unnecessary decision to saturate CMMF's portfolio with the riskiest and most illiquid residential real estate securities," according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These investments for Access were made at the same time as companies affiliated with JPMorgan were dumping similar real estate securities from their own portfolios, the lawsuit says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan intends to contest the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe this case is without merit," a spokeswoman for JPMorgan said. "We intend to defend it vigorously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has hired the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison to represent it in the case, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CMMF had tried to resolve the matter with JPMorgan without litigation, but it was unable to do so, said a spokesman for Access in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is: CMMF LLC vs. J.P.

It follows longtime complaints from store owners that banks have colluded to set fee structures and block them from negotiating with Visa and MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, interchange fees rose 14 percent to about $48 billion, averaging about 1.75 percent of total purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard are partially insulated from the impact of the legislation because they make the bulk of their money every time a person swipes a card and do not collect interchange fees, but they could be affected by a retrenchment in the credit card industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, analysts estimate the companies receive around 10 cents per $100 transaction from the card issuers and, if banks were forced to cut interchange rates, the financial institutions could ask Visa and MasterCard to share the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also said the world's biggest payment networks could be near a renegotiation of their contracts with some big U.S. banks, which could ask for lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is adding some pricing pressure," said Walter Todd, portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard have said merchants already are able to negotiate lower fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't see Congress legislating interchange fees or setting prices," William Sheedy, president of Visa for North America, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The real question is whether the government is going to jump in and get into the game of price control in the free market. At the end of the day, this is price control and this just doesn't smell right," said Chris McWilton, MasterCard's president of U.S. markets, at an investor's conference earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheedy and MasterCard's spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said the pending legislation would not affect their companies revenue. Both added that, when Australia cut interchange fees, neither Visa nor MasterCard were hurt by the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Suit alleges reckless bet on subprime securities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan calls suit without merit, intends to contest
 (Adds details from lawsuit, comments from JPMorgan, Access;
adds New York dateline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 22 (Reuters) - U.S. billionaire Len
Blavatnik filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) on
Monday, accusing the bank of mismanaging an investment account
that held about $1 billion in assets owned by Blavatnik's
industrial holding company, Access Industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blavatnik's lawyers blame Ted Ufferfilge, a JPMorgan banker
appointed to manage the assets for Access, for losing $98
million of the company's money betting on risky subprime
mortgage securities, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JPMorgan and Mr. Ufferfilge implemented a series of
ill-conceived investment strategies," wrote Access' law firm,
Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver  Hedges, in the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit contends that Access hired JPMorgan to manage
the investment account, called CMMF, with conservative
objectives and specific diversification and liquidity
requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, the bank and Ufferfilge invested the fund in risky
and illiquid mortgage-related securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JPMorgan and Mr. Ufferfilge made the reckless and
unnecessary decision to saturate CMMF's portfolio with the
riskiest and most illiquid residential real estate securities,"
according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These investments for Access were made at the same time as
companies affiliated with JPMorgan were dumping similar real
estate securities from their own portfolios, the lawsuit says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan intends to contest the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe this case is without merit," a spokeswoman for
JPMorgan said. "We intend to defend it vigorously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has hired the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton  Garrison to represent it in the case, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CMMF had tried to resolve the matter with JPMorgan without
litigation, but it was unable to do so, said a spokesman for
Access in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is: CMMF LLC vs. J.P. Morgan Investment
Management, New York State Supreme Court (New York County), no.

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Dell (Nasdaq: DELL), WellPoint, Inc. (NYSE: WLP), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS),

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

WellPoint Gets Tech Savvy with Dell

Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) announced that WellPoint, Inc. (NYSE: WLP) has signed a
five-year outsourcing agreement for field support and help desk services through
Dell Global Services. 

Dell will provide technical support to nearly all WellPoint employees in more
than 200 U.S. locations as well as its mobile work force. WellPoint employees
can now experience a consistent support program across all locations while Dell
resolves technical issues in a timely manner. 

We remain positive with management's efforts to increase operational
efficiencies, which include outsourcing as in the case of the Dell deal and
divestment of non-core division as in the recent sale of its PBM division to
Express Scripts the second-largest pharmacy benefits manager in the U.S. based
on prescriptions. 

The Fed's New Power

There were several steps the Fed could have taken to have prevented the crisis
or at least greatly minimized its impact. Not all of them require remarkable
20/20 hindsight. 

On the other hand, the Fed does have considerable expertise in these matters,
and proper supervision of banks is closely tied to monetary policy. The Fed
already has some expertise in dealing with non-commercial banks -- for example
the investment banks that are also primary dealers in government securities,
such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS). As both a plus
and a minus, of all the regulatory agencies the Fed is the most independent and
the least susceptible to political interference (and oversight). 

Taking UAL to Lower Atmosphere

We are significantly reducing our estimates on UAL Corporation ([Nasdaq: UAUA],
United or UAL) to a per share loss of $8.05 from a loss of $1.50 for 2009 and to
a loss of $1.50 from earnings of $1.75 for 2010. 

We have lowered our revenue estimates following UAL's recent investor update on
June 17, in which UAL estimated that second quarter mainline revenue passenger
miles are expected to fall 11.7-12.7% and mainline unit revenue should drop
20.1-21.1%, while mainline unit operating costs excluding certain items will
decline about 19.8-20.1%. 

On a more positive note, at the end of the second quarter, UAL expects to be in
full compliance with credit facility covenants, and increased its total cash
balance during the quarter by $100 million to $2.8 billion.

&lt;p&gt;* Facilities in place to steadily increase supplies to U.S. markets 
* Drilling technology, best practices produce more gas more efficiently

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Production Company announced today the completion of new field
processing capacity at its Piceance Project on the western slope of the Rocky
Mountains in Rio Blanco County, Colorado. 

The new facilities have the capacity to handle up to 200 million cubic feet per
day of natural gas. They include gas and liquid gathering systems, treating
facilities, a produced-water pipeline and subsurface disposal system, and a
condensate sales and truck-loading site. 

ExxonMobil has been producing natural gas in the Piceance Basin for nearly 50
years and is currently producing about 100 million cubic feet per day. The
company currently is operating seven drilling rigs to increase its Piceance
production. 

"A project such as Piceance represents a long-term view of and commitment to
energy development," says Rich Kruger, ExxonMobil Production Company president.
"The key to unlocking the potential of this large, technically challenging
resource is increasing production and recovery rates from each well at lower
cost. ExxonMobil scientists and engineers are working hard to improve the
enabling technologies and processes to do just that." 

Natural gas is expected to be the fastest-growing major fuel source, driven
largely by its increased use to generate electricity. ExxonMobil`s leases in the
Piceance Basin hold a potential recoverable resource of 45 trillion cubic feet
of gas. "ExxonMobil is committed to developing this resource efficiently and
with environmental care and sensitivity," says Kruger. 

Success through ExxonMobil proprietary technology

Natural gas in the Piceance Basin is trapped within rock as dense as concrete
and in discontinuous zones separated by thin layers of shale. To recover the
"tight gas," ExxonMobil is applying proprietary technology and best practices. 

"Piceance wells completed with our proprietary fracturing technology produce
significantly more than conventionally fractured wells and at less cost," says
ExxonMobil`s Piceance Project Executive Jim Branch. "We use ExxonMobil`s
proprietary Fast Drill process and Multi-zone Stimulation Technology with
Just-in-Time Perforation to access up to 50 gas-bearing zones in one well, which
was unheard of just a few years ago. We can drill up to 9 to 10 wells from a
single pad, with less surface disturbance. Each well can recover gas located
across 20 acres below ground. The cost effective process produces substantially
more gas from the many zones it can tap from each well." 

Water conservation is a priority at the project. ExxonMobil developed a system
that reuses the water recovered from production for other processes. This
reduces fresh water use by about 80 percent. 

ExxonMobil conducts extensive plant, wildlife and archaeological surveys to help
manage the environmental performance of the Piceance Basin operations. The
company also participates in studies with local educational institutions and
government agencies to maximize protection of native wildlife habitats and plant
species in the project development area. 

Enterprise Products Partners L.P. constructed new plant and pipeline facilities
at the Piceance project to provide compression, treating and conditioning
services for the produced natural gas, which is delivered to various pipeline
transmission systems that serve the region. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Estimates, expectations, and business plans in this
release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including demand
growth, resource recoveries, production rates, project plans and schedules, and
the impact of new technology could differ materially due to changes in market
conditions affecting the oil and gas industry or long-term oil and gas price
levels; political or regulatory developments; reservoir performance; timely
completion of development projects; technical or operating factors; and other
factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in the
Investor Information section of our website (www.exxonmobil.com) and in Item 1A
of our most recent Form 10-K. References to "recoverable resources" and similar
terms include quantities of oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved
reserves but that we believe will be produced in the future.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is on pace to make record bonus payouts after a robust first half, the Guardian newspaper reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman staff in London were briefed on the outlook and told they could look forward to the bonus hikes if the company registers its most profitable year ever, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge in projected profit can be attributed to a lack of competition and increased revenue from trading foreign currency, bonds and fixed-income products, the newspaper said, citing insiders at the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonuses have been a point of contention between the Obama administration and Wall Street, which last fall endured a credit crisis that paralyzed the financial markets. The U.S. Treasury responded with the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which made $700 billion in loans available to banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs received $10 billion from TARP, which it repaid last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In letters to lawmakers last week, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein said the firm is obligated to "ensure that compensation reflects the true performance of the firm and motivates proper behavior."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesman in New York was not immediately available to comment on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Joint Venture Called Jefferson Apartment Group 
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Local office and mixed-use developer, Akridge, together with the former
principals of major east coast multi-family developer, JPI East, today announce
a new venture they have formed to build on the success the JPI East operations
have achieved over the last 10 years. The new venture, to be called Jefferson
Apartment Group, will invest in multi-family residential properties in the
mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions of the United States. 

Jim Butz, former President of JPI East, will be an owner and the Managing
Partner of the new venture. Greg Lamb, former Executive Vice President of JPI
East, will be an owner and Executive Vice President. 

JPI East and Akridge both have a service oriented brand focus, lead the industry
in innovative and sustainable development solutions, are champions of workplace
excellence, are committed to the communities in which they work, and have
similar priorities and company culture. 

For Akridge, the new venture provides a diversity of skill, product type and fee
stream, and expands its institutional reach in the broader commercial real
estate market. Executives from both firms acknowledge the cultural fit to be the
most important component for the success of the venture. 

"In recent years, it has been one of our goals to have a more significant
presence in the multi-family sector," said Matthew J. Klein, Akridge President.
"I have known Jim and Greg for years and have great confidence in their
capabilities, integrity and market knowledge. This is a great opportunity to
align with proven market leaders." 

The Jefferson Apartment Group team will be initially headquartered in Tysons
Corner, Va. 

"Jefferson Apartment Group will represent the same top-quality capabilities the
market is accustomed to getting from JPI East and Akridge," said Jim Butz,
President and Managing Partner of Jefferson Apartment Group. "We are pleased to
enter the market with Akridge as our partner and we look forward to acquiring
and developing more first class multi-family properties in Washington and other
East Coast cities." 

While at JPI, Butz and Lamb were responsible for acquisition, development,
construction and management of over 15,000 units, valued at $3 billion, in
fifteen cities on the East Coast. Jefferson Apartment Group will focus on
acquisitions and development as well as construction and property management in
markets with a high barrier to entry. 

The JPI parent company is not involved with this new venture and continues to
own and operate almost $2 billion in multi-family assets around the country with
operations based in Irving, Texas.

 (Adds ESPN results, changes news label used by some

network ESPN has won the right to show 46 live English Premier
League soccer matches for the 2009/10 season after picking up
the broadcasting rights from troubled group Setanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Setanta was forced to hand back the rights to the games

games after also defaulting on a payment.

&lt;p&gt;Songs from the Hit Disney Channel Series Set for Release on July 7
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Have you ever seen a field filled with parents and their kids - all hopping?
That was the scene at the Imagination Movers` triumphant hometown show at this
year`s New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, and it`s similar to the scene that
plays out in living rooms across the country when viewers tune into the
Imagination Movers` hit Disney Channel series. Now, fans of the Imagination
Movers have one more reason to bounce, pogo and hop, when the smart kid-pop
quartet releases its newest CD For Those About to Hop nationwide on July 7. 

The Movers - Rich Collins, Scott Durbin, Dave Poche, and Scott "Smitty" Smith -
formed in 2003 when a group of New Orleans friends started writing songs
together and testing them out on their own kids. The band`s dynamic, high-energy
shows and wide-ranging pop sensibilities (with a special nod to 1980s alt rock)
made them an immediate hit at the local parks and children`s museums. Not even
losing homes to Hurricane Katrina (during which Smitty served as a first
responder) scuttled their dreams. After signing to Disney, the Movers released
their label debut Juice Box Heroes in March 2008, and are now currently working
on the second season of their Playhouse Disney (Disney Channel`s learning-based
programming block for preschoolers) show. Since its release, Juice Box Heroes
has consistently ranked in the Top 10 on iTunes Children`s Music chart. National
recognition includes a Parenting Magazine "Parenting Pick," and Common Sense
Media recently recognized the Imagination Movers among the Best TV of 2008,
citing the quartet`s "addictive sense of humor and quest for fun." 

These qualities are in full display on For Those About to Hop. With a quick wink
at AC/DC in the title, the Movers keep their fans on their feet throughout the
generous 22-song set. Show favorite "Jungle Room" is a swinging, horn-drenched
musical safari, while tunes like "Now We`re Cooking," "Paint the Day Away" and
"Playing Catch" are equal parts funk, hip-hop and sing-along rock, with
infectious beats and typically catchy lyrics that celebrate learning, growing
and fun. Fans of the show will recognize set pieces from the Movers`
brainstorming adventures in the Idea Warehouse, but these songs all stand on
their own as bright, finely crafted kid pop tunes. 

A special release of For Those About to Hop is currently available at Target
stores nationwide and includes five bonus tracks. An exclusive iTunes version of
the release offers another set of five bonus songs and will be available on July
7. All versions include downloadable lyrics and a coloring sheet, along with an
interactive game featuring the TV show`s popular puppet character Warehouse
Mouse.

&lt;p&gt;  PORTLAND, OR, Jun 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
CompanionLink(R) Software, a leader in synchronization solutions, touts
their Google(TM) Sync compatible product line as an alternative to
Microsoft(R) ActiveSync(R) for Microsoft Exchange users. PC users who
need their contacts and calendar on their mobile phones can use
CompanionLink along with the free Google Sync service for complete
two-way synchronization. CompanionLink allows sync for Exchange sites
that lack Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) or BlackBerry Exchange Server (BES).

    "CompanionLink reads contact and calendar data using Microsoft Outlook
installed on a PC," says Wayland Bruns, CTO for CompanionLink Software.
"The connection to Exchange Server is authenticated by the user's PC.
CompanionLink moves data to Google contacts, Gmail contacts, and Google
Calendar. Once this data is in Google, you can use Google Sync or Palm(R)
Synergy(TM) to automatically synchronize contacts and calendar with your
phone. This is a two-way sync, so new contacts and calendar events created
on the phone will sync via Google and CompanionLink back to your PC and
Exchange Server."

    CompanionLink synchronizes a variety of resources including Exchange
public folders contacts and calendar, and Microsoft Outlook Business
Contact Manager (BCM) accounts and tasks. Google Sync supports
BlackBerry, Apple iPhone, Windows Mobile, and Symbian phones. Palm Pre is
supported via the Palm Synergy(TM) sync service with Google. Google
Android phones are also natively supported. CompanionLink does not
interfere with other installed systems, including EAS or BES, which may
be serving other users or devices. "CompanionLink is a simple client-side
alternative to more complex synchronization systems," says Bruns.

    CompanionLink for Google is available for use free of charge for 14 days
at www.companionlink.com/google. CompanionLink also offers a server-based
solution, called DoubleLook Enterprise, which can provide Google
synchronization for multiple users from one server-side application. A
remote configuration service called RunStart, starting at $29 per
configuration, and a Premium Support service for $99 per year is also
offered by CompanionLink.

    About CompanionLink Software

    CompanionLink Software is a pioneering developer of data synchronization
solutions for mobile phones and CRM software and services. They are also a
leading OEM synchronization and solutions provider for companies like Sage

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 22 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said Monday a
boiler shutdown at its 562,500 barrel-per-day refinery would not affect
production, according to a filing with state regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The boiler was being restarted after tripping offline, the filing with
the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality said. The incident also
resulted in flaring from the gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking unit,
according to the filing.

(GS.N) is on pace to make record bonus payouts after a robust
first half, London's Observer newspaper reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman staff in London were briefed on the outlook and
told they could look forward to the bonus hikes if the company
registers its most profitable year ever, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The surge in projected profit can be attributed to a lack
of competition and increased revenue from trading foreign
currency, bonds and fixed-income products, the newspaper said,
citing insiders at the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bonuses have been a point of contention between the Obama
administration and Wall Street, which last fall endured a
credit crisis that paralyzed the financial markets. The U.S.
Treasury responded with the Troubled Asset Relief Program,
which made $700 billion in loans available to banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs received $10 billion from TARP, which it
repaid last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In letters to lawmakers last week, Goldman CEO Lloyd
Blankfein said the firm is obligated to "ensure that
compensation reflects the true performance of the firm and
motivates proper behavior."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman Sachs spokesman in New York was not immediately

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. billionaire Len Blavatnik is planning to file a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) on Monday, accusing the bank of mismanaging an investment account that held $1 billion in assets owned by Blavatnik's industrial holding company, Access Industries, the New York Times said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the proposed lawsuit, Blavatnik's lawyers blame Ted Ufferfilge, a JPMorgan banker advising Access, for losing $98 million of the company's money betting on risky subprime mortgage securities, according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed lawsuit contends that Ufferfilge told Access that its funds were being invested in conservative instruments, not securities that wound up at the center of the American mortgage crisis, the paper said, citing a draft of the complaint prepared by the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver  Hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Access spokesman told the paper that JPMorgan bought the subprime securities for Access "at a time when the bank itself was unwinding its positions in similar investments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan intends "to defend this matter vigorously," a spokeswoman for the bank told the paper. "We believe this lawsuit is meritless and a transparent attempt to recover losses resulting from the unprecedented market downturn," she told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has hired the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison to represent it in the case, the paper added. JPMorgan and Access Industries could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Chakradhar Adusumilli in Bangalore; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Salesforce.com Inc's (CRM.N) outspoken chief executive took a few jabs at Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) lumbering efforts to build up its "cloud computing" services on Thursday, on a visit to  the world's largest software company's home town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc Benioff, a former Oracle Corp ORCL.O employee who founded Salesforce.com 10 years ago, rarely misses a chance to bash Microsoft as he spreads his gospel of cutting out software installed on users' computers and getting companies to use applications over the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are all about no software and they are all about software," Benioff said at a lunch in Seattle, when asked about Microsoft. "We are all about creating a whole new movement of cloud computing to move companies away from Microsoft's proprietary technology and monopolistic business practices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce, with a "Ghostbusters"-style logo with the word "software" in a red, barred circle, is not an immediate threat to Microsoft. The San Francisco-based company had just over $1 billion in revenue last fiscal year, compared to Microsoft's $60 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the smaller company has crept onto Microsoft's radar as it attracts more companies to run business applications over the web, saving money on software, servers and IT administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing so, Salesforce has put itself at the forefront of the broad phenomenon known as cloud computing, or selling software as a service. Microsoft -- led by chief software architect Ray Ozzie -- is moving in the same direction, the company says, but little has actually changed in its product line-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm a huge fan of Ray Ozzie, but I know how hard it is to operate within the culture of Microsoft," said Benioff. "That's why you really haven't seen them deliver any breaking technology in this area yet, even though they've been talking about it for many years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been investing heavily in date storage centers and is expected to roll-out its "Azure" platform for cloud-based applications later this year. But Benioff was skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I call it Azune, because it's got the same opportunities," Benioff joked, referring to Microsoft's relatively unpopular Zune digital music player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benioff did not offer any hopes for a quick recovery from the recession, but said his company was controlling costs and customers were adapting to conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Customers are starting to get their sea-legs, learning how to operate in this environment," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VALENCIA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
MannKind Corporation (Nasdaq:MNKD) today announced that it has completed its
acquisition from Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) of a quantity of bulk insulin and a
license to manufacture bulk insulin for use in pulmonary delivery pursuant to an
insulin sale and purchase agreement. Upon the closing, MannKind and Pfizer also
entered into an agreement pursuant to which MannKind agreed to maintain and
store the remainder of Pfizer`s bulk insulin inventory and acquired an option to
purchase the remaining insulin, in whole or in part, at a specified price, to
the extent that Pfizer has not otherwise disposed of or used the remaining
insulin. The total purchase price for this transaction, including consideration
payable to MannKind for its storage and maintenance obligations, was $3 million,
which MannKind paid in cash. 

MannKind had also entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Pfizer
relating to Pfizer`s insulin manufacturing facility in Frankfurt, Germany.
MannKind`s rights and obligations under this latter agreement were subject to a
right of first refusal in favor of Sanofi-Aventis. On June 8, 2009,
Sanofi-Aventis exercised its right of first refusal, thereby releasing MannKind
from any obligations under this agreement. 

About AFRESA

AFRESA is an ultra rapid acting insulin product that has completed Phase 3
trials. The pharmacokinetic profile of AFRESA sets it apart from all other
insulin products. The large surface area of the lung provides unique access to
the circulatory system. The pH-sensitive AFRESA particles immediately dissolve
upon contact with the lung surface, releasing insulin monomers that rapidly
enter the bloodstream. It achieves peak insulin levels within 12-14 minutes of
administration, effectively mimicking the release of meal-time insulin observed
in healthy individuals, but which is absent from patients with diabetes. 

About MannKind Corporation

MannKind Corporation (Nasdaq:MNKD) focuses on the discovery, development and
commercialization of therapeutic products for patients with diseases such as
diabetes and cancer. Its diabetes pipeline includes AFRESA, which has completed
phase 3 clinical trials, and MKC253, which is currently in phase 1 clinical
trials. MannKind has submitted an NDA to the FDA requesting approval of AFRESA
for the treatment of adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes for the control of
hyperglycemia. MannKind maintains a website at http://www.mannkindcorp.com to
which MannKind regularly posts copies of its press releases as well as
additional information about MannKind. Interested persons can subscribe on the
MannKind website to e-mail alerts that are sent automatically when MannKind

&lt;p&gt;  PHILADELPHIA, PA, Jun 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
MetaVis Technologies, Inc. today announced the general availability of
MetaVis ARCHITECT and MetaVis CLASSIFIER, software that extends the value
of Microsoft SharePoint by enhancing document search, findability and
eDiscovery. MetaVis products provide taxonomy support and metadata
management to SharePoint making it easier for information architects to
create, deploy and manage SharePoint sites. A trial version of the
products can be downloaded at www.metavistech.com. MetaVis will also be
demonstrating both products at the SharePoint Technology Conference in
Boston, June 22-24 at the Hyatt Regency Cambridge.

    Metadata management and efficient taxonomies enable enterprise content to
be easily found after it is categorized and tagged. Designing and
deploying SharePoint sites with structured metadata models is time
intensive and can require highly specialized professionals. More
importantly, once created these models cannot be reused -- meaning that
companies need to recreate them for each SharePoint site. MetaVis
believes that taxonomy management should not be complicated or require
additional IT support to implement and use. Both MetaVis ARCHITECT and
CLASSIFIER are based on an intuitive, graphical interface that is easy to
use and easy to install.

    "SharePoint's organic growth within company departments and business
groups have presented many IT challenges related to document consistency,
search and eDiscovery," said Steven Pogrebivsky, CEO and Co-founder of
MetaVis Technologies. "As a result, companies can be at greater risk of
not meeting corporate compliance or governance guidelines. We developed
MetaVis ARCHITECT and CLASSIFIER to help information architects,
administrators, and consultants simplify the management of SharePoint
content as well as improve document search and compliance. Our tools save
users valuable time and resources while providing a central management
tool to deploy and maintain SharePoint content."

    MetaVis ARCHITECT

    MetaVis ARCHITECT for SharePoint allows information architects to develop
and maintain efficient SharePoint taxonomies. ARCHITECT visualizes a
SharePoint environment through two-dimensional graphical diagrams
allowing users to edit diagram elements and provision or synchronize
updates to SharePoint. As an architect or a business user, the ability to
graphically visualize the metadata environment provides the system-wide
awareness necessary to design taxonomies that improve search and
eDiscovery. MetaVis diagrams not only expose metadata structures but also
their relationships, making SharePoint sites easily understood and well
documented.

    With MetaVis ARCHITECT users can:


--  Design and redesign taxonomy structures for a new SharePoint site or
    resuse taxonomy from other sites;
--  Replicate or consolidate columns, content types and lists;
--  Optimize search by enforcing standard content structure; and
--  Compare metadata models across different sites for consistency.
    

    
MetaVis CLASSIFIER

    MetaVis CLASSIFIER helps to organize and enhance SharePoint content and
its metadata. CLASSIFIER capabilities include importing and tagging
content with new values and content types; moving or coping content to
different folders, lists sites or servers; or doing all simultaneously.
By tagging files that share common metadata values, CLASSIFIER improves
metadata management making content more findable, compliant and usable.

    With MetaVis CLASSIFIER users can:


--  Tag and move previously loaded documents, en masse, with regulatory
    data, retention dates and useful keywords;
--  Import or migrate bulk content from both SharePoint and file systems;
    and
--  Classify multiple types of content at once with new metadata values.
    

    
About MetaVis Technologies, Inc.

    MetaVis Technologies is a provider of software that extends the value of
Microsoft SharePoint by enhancing search, findability and eDiscovery.
MetaVis products allow information architects and administrators to
develop and maintain reusable taxonomies and better organize SharePoint
content. The company believes that taxonomy management should not be
complicated or require highly specialized professionals to implement and
use. MetaVis products are based on intuitive, graphical interfaces that
are easy to use and easy to install. For more information and to download

&lt;p&gt; * Stage of bidding process still unclear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds detail, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Joseph Chaney&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, June 22 (Reuters) - China National Chemical Corp
(ChemChina), China's leading chemical producer, has retained
JPMorgan to advise it on a bid for Dow Chemical's (DOW.N)
agrosciences unit, sources said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow AgroSciences -- which sells crop protection chemicals
such as herbicides and insecticides -- booked 2008 sales of $4.5
billion, according to the company's website. The unit could be
sold for as much as $7 billion, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow Chemical, the largest U.S. chemicals maker, is selling
assets to to help pay a $9.2 billion bridge loan talen out to
buy chemical company Rohm  Haas Corp in April. [ID:nN01305800]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like other chemicals makers, Dow has been suffering from the
economic recession and has already sold Rohm's Morton Salt unit
for $1.7 billion and is evaluating options for other businesses
in its portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is unclear if the bidding process for the agrosciences
unit is at a preliminary or advanced stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, Dow Chemical chief executive Andrew Liveris told
Reuters the company would not be forced into selling assets on
the cheap. "We've designed a structure where we can control our
own destiny, rather than be forced to fire-sale," Liveris said
at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "More critically, we can retain very key assets like Dow
AgroSciences and Dow Corning," said Liveris, adding Dow would
consider selling a stake in Dow AgroSciences business if there
were strategic benefits from the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan declined to comment. ChemChina was not immediately
available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources declined to be named because they were not
authorised to speak publicly about the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In late February, media reports said private equity giants
Blackstone (BX.N) and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co [KKR.UL] were
in early-stage discussions about taking a multibillion-dollar
minority stake in the division.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical will demonstrate its technology leadership and commitment to
the global rubber industry at its booth (number 12-112) at the International
Rubber Conference (IRC) 2009 in N&#252;rnberg, Germany from June 29-July 2, 2009. Its
broad portfolio of polymer solutions, including butyl polymers, specialty
elastomers and polymer modifiers (PM) will be highlighted. 

At the forefront of innovation in the rubber industry since it invented and
patented butyl rubber in 1937, ExxonMobil Chemical will demonstrate its
continuous drive for product and process improvement to meet the evolving needs
of the industry. With the objective of doubling the number of tire innerliner
applications that can be served from existing halobutyl capacity, ExxonMobil
Chemical recently conducted a successful pilot plant demonstration of
next-generation butyl rubber that benefits from nanocomposite technology. The
company also is working with its customers to develop a new material for tire
innerliners, Exxcore DVA resin, which will result in lighter and more durable
tires, that hold air longer and help reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide
emissions. 

A technology leader in specialty elastomers, ExxonMobil Chemical is expanding
the performance capabilities of its portfolio with innovative metallocene-based
polymers to meet the latest requirements of the rubber and elastomer industry.
These include new amorphous grades of Vistalon EPDM targeted at the extruded
weatherseals market and Vistamaxx specialty elastomers providing green strength
to rubber compounds. 

Santoprene TPVs are meeting the increased demand for recyclable, light weight
sealing solutions, and EPDM bondable Santoprene TPV is enabling hard-soft
material combinations for cost-effective system solutions. The recently
introduced Santoprene TPV 8211-85 M350 is providing a unique "comfort touch" and
excellent surface qualities for automotive interiors while offering significant
cost reduction opportunities. Additionally, ExxonMobil Chemical has developed
jointly with Troester GmbH &amp; Co. a new extrusion concept, combining hard and
soft thermoplastic materials that enables the replacement of the metal
reinforcement in EPDM profiles with a thermoplastic alternative. This provides
opportunities to lower part weight, while reducing production complexity
compared with conventional EPDM sealing solutions. 

ExxonMobil Chemical will feature its wide range of Elevast polymer modifiers
(PM) to the European rubber industry at IRC. Elevast PM are specialty
hydrocarbon fluids that can help formulators create innovative solutions for
polyolefin elastomer technical applications requiring improved mechanical
properties across an extended range of service temperatures. Elevast PM improve
polymer performance in applications ranging from wire and cable to automotive
and industrial belts, weatherstrip, hoses and mechanical goods such as seals,
gaskets and wiper blades. 

ExxonMobil Chemical will present three technical papers at the conference.
"Polymers for innerliner applications - new trends or new developments"
describes the latest developments to lower the rolling resistance of passenger
car tires, reduce weight and improve performance. "New metallocene EPDM`s for
expanded attribute range to meet new rubber market requirements" details recent
advances in metallocene solution polymerization and compares expected physical
properties with the properties provided by conventional Ziegler Natta
polymerization. "Elevast polymer modifiers (PM) - highly efficient plasticizers
for property enhancement of elastomers" looks at how Elevast PM can support EPDM
rubber innovation.

a liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea, is nearing
agreement on sales with three major buyers in Asia, putting the
project on track for a final investment decision later this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale of 4.3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), plus an
earlier 2 mtpa deal, would mean the project was fully
contracted for its proposed total output, cementing its
frontrunner status among a dozen competing LNG hopefuls in the
region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil said on Monday its subsidiary Esso Highland Ltd,
has "reached alignment on commercial terms" with three major
LNG customers in Asia for long-term LNG sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exclusive discussions will commence with these customers
to finalise binding sales and purchase agreements to establish

Australian-listed Oil Search Ltd (OSH.AX) has 34 percent and
Santos Ltd (STO.AX) owns 17.7 percent. Nippon Oil 5001.T and
PNG landowners own the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Oil Search were up 2.2 percent to A$5.64 in early
trade, while Santos shares rose 0.1 percent to A$14.90 in a
broader market up 0.6 percent .AXJO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project, also known as PNG LNG, is estimated to cost

&lt;p&gt;June 22 (Reuters) - U.S. billionaire Len Blavatnik is
planning to file a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) on
Monday, accusing the bank of mismanaging an investment account
that held $1 billion in assets owned by Blavatnik's industrial
holding company, Access Industries, the New York Times said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In the proposed lawsuit, Blavatnik's lawyers blame Ted
Ufferfilge, a JPMorgan banker advising Access, for losing $98
million of the company's money betting on risky subprime
mortgage securities, according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed lawsuit contends that Ufferfilge told Access
that its funds were being invested in conservative instruments,
not securities that wound up at the center of the American
mortgage crisis, the paper said, citing a draft of the
complaint prepared by the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart
Oliver  Hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Access spokesman told the paper that JPMorgan bought the
subprime securities for Access "at a time when the bank itself
was unwinding its positions in similar investments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan intends "to defend this matter vigorously", a
spokeswoman for the bank told the paper. "We believe this
lawsuit is meritless and a transparent attempt to recover
losses resulting from the unprecedented market downturn," she
told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank has hired the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton  Garrison to represent it in the case, the paper
added. JPMorgan and Access Industries could not be immediately
reached for comment by Reuters.

&lt;p&gt; * IBM waits on suit to bar ex-exec from working at Dell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, June 23 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) named one of its
executives, a former Morgan Stanley (MS.N) banker, to be its
new head of mergers and acquisitions on Tuesday after losing
its chief dealmaker to rival Dell Inc DELL.O, which is
beefing up its acquisition efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM named Elias Mendoza, who handled mergers and
acquisitions in Asia for the computer consulting and technology
company, to the top MA job as it waits for a U.S. federal
court to rule on a request that the man he replaces be banned

public embarrassment over its MA efforts, a failed attempt to
buy hardware maker Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It emerged as the lead contender in March to buy the
company but discussions collapsed in April mainly because both
sides were unable to agree on guarantees for IBM to be able to
walk away should the deal fail to pass regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Software developer Oracle ORCL.O swooped in with a
successful bid to buy Sun for more than $7 billion.

&lt;p&gt;Keller Rohrback Announces Preliminary Approval of Settlement in Arizona
Microsoft Operating Systems and Applications Litigation

SEATTLE, June 23, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Seattle law firm Keller Rohrback,
L.L.P., and its Phoenix, AZ affiliate, Keller Rohrback P.L.C.
(www.krclassaction.com), announced today that Judge J. Frederick Motz of the
U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland has preliminarily approved a
settlement in the pending class action litigation brought by Daisy Mountain Fire
District ("Plaintiff") on behalf of a class of all Arizona state and local
governmental entities that purchased Microsoft operating systems and
applications software between May 18, 1994 and December 31, 2008 (the "Class").

The preliminarily approved settlement will result in the payment of $4,415,258
by Microsoft Corp. ("Microsoft") (Nasdaq:MSFT) to the Class. The settlement
funds will be allocated across Arizona state and local governmental entities.
The litigation centered on allegations that Microsoft illegally obtained and
maintained monopoly power in the market for operating systems and certain
business productivity applications and used that power to charge higher prices
for its MS/DOS and Windows operating systems and for several popular
applications like Word, MS Office, and Excel. The Plaintiff alleged that
Microsoft engaged in conduct that violated Arizona's state antitrust statutes
and caused damage to all Arizona governmental entities that had bought such
equipment after May 18, 1994 until December 31, 2008. Microsoft denied these
allegations.

The preliminarily approved settlement gives each Arizona governmental entity its
share of the settlement, in cash, to be used for the purchase of various
computer equipment, not just Microsoft products. Because the litigation is a
class action, the settlement is subject the Court's final approval after notice
of the terms of the settlement has been provided to class members. Timing of the
approval process is dependent on the Court's schedule. Notice will be provided
to all involved Arizona governmental entities and they will have a period during
which they can comment or object to any aspect of the preliminarily approved
settlement, after which Judge Motz, who has overseen the private, state and
federal litigation, concerning Microsoft's monopoly power, will decide whether
the settlement is in the best interests of class members.

2.69 percent from 20 percent, the magazine estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan topped The Banker's annual list of the strongest
1,000 global banks, moving up from fourth place a year earlier.
The rankings, which have run since the 1970s, are based on
capital strength, or the amount of Tier 1 capital held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America (BAC.N) ranked second, Citigroup (C.N) was
third and RBS was fourth, despite the problems for all three
last year. JPMorgan was helped by its takeover of Bear Stearns
and Washington Mutual and Bank of America was boosted by its
acquisition of Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HSBC (HSBA.L) fell to fifth spot from first, but it was the
only one of the top five not to receive any government support,
and would rank third if government support was stripped out, The
Banker said. Mitsubishi UFJ (8306.T) was the highest ranked
Asian bank in seventh, a place ahead of China's ICBC (1398.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC was the most profitable bank last year with earnings of
$21.3 billion, the Banker estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The five most profitable banks were all from China or Spain.
China Construction Bank (0939.HK) ranked second with a $17.5
billion profit, followed by Santander (SAN.MC) ($15.8 billion),
Bank of China (3988.HK) ($12.6 billion) and BBVA (BBVA.MC) (9.6
billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were followed by Britain's HSBC ($9.3 billion) and
Barclays (BARC.L) ($8.9 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Steve Slater; editing by Elaine Hardcastle)

 (Adds details on Frade, Tombua Landana and Piceance Basin,
bylines, SAN FRANCISCO to dateline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Brian Ellsworth and Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RIO DE JANEIRO/SAN FRANCISCO, June 23 (Reuters) - Chevron
Corp (CVX.N) announced on Tuesday a slightly earlier start of
oil output at the Frade field, a $3 billion project off
Brazil's coast expected to produce 90,000 barrels per day by
2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crude oil from Frade, located some 230 miles (370 km) from
Rio de Janeiro in 3,700 feet (1,128 meters) of water, will be
shipped to other markets, while the natural gas is slated for
use in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frade's start-up, which had been due in the second half of
2009, will only add to a bullish view of Chevron's production
outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company reported first-quarter output of 2.66 million
barrels per day, versus its overall 2009 estimate of 2.63
million bpd, and it has since announced first oil at its Tahiti
field in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Look for a 2009 volume-target raise," Deutsche Bank
analyst Paul Sankey wrote in a research note on Tuesday, after
meeting with Chevron's management. Sankey has a "hold" rating
on the stock due to the bank's bearish view of oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Chevron rose 0.3 percent to $65.96, helped by a 2
percent rise in oil prices CLc1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said it expects about 30,000 bpd from Frade in its
initial phase in 2009. Overall, it estimates there are 200
million to 300 million barrels of recoverable oil there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The San Ramon, California-based company holds a 52 percent
operating interest, while state-run Petrobras (PETR4.SA) and
Japanese partners INPEX, Sojitz and JOGMEC hold the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project will help Chevron expand in "one of the world's
most promising deepwater oil and gas regions," George Kirkland,
Chevron's executive vice president for upstream and gas, said
in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frade is not part of Brazil's sub-salt reserves, which
aremassive oil fields found deep beneath a layer of salt that
have drawn investor interest and that analysts say could turn
the South American nation into a major oil exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE PROJECTS IN PIPELINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron anticipates a base business decline of 180,000 bpd
this year, and has recently had to shut in 100,000 bpd of
production in Nigeria's Delta state due to violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it will see more production from its deepwater Agbami
project off Nigeria, which was up to 170,000 bpd in March from
100,000 bpd late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also in western Africa, production is set to start this
year at the Tombua Landana project in Angola, in which operator
Chevron holds 31 percent and Total (TOTF.PA), ENI (ENI.MI) and
state operator Sonangol each hold 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Closer to home, Chevron said on Tuesday it still expects to
start natural gas production in Colorado's Piceance Basin this
year, despite a slowdown in drilling there due to weak prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) unveiled
new field processing capacity for Piceance natural gas.

r&#233;seau mobile pour d&#233;velopper les meilleures pratiques et des applications
destin&#233;es aux services financiers mobiles. &#187; 

Avantages et applications

L`initiative Visa-NeuStar permettra de proposer de tr&#232;s nombreux avantages aux
acteurs du mobile et des services financiers &#224; l`&#233;chelle mondiale en :

* Ouvrant de nouveaux canaux permettant aux institutions financi&#232;res clientes de
Visa d`atteindre leurs clients l&#224; et au moment o&#249; ils sont pr&#234;ts &#224; utiliser des
services financiers mobiles 
* Cr&#233;ant de nouveaux flux de revenus gr&#226;ce &#224; une nouvelle gamme de services
financiers tels que les alertes et les offres de transactions mobiles 
* Ouvrant les services financiers mobiles aux consommateurs situ&#233;s dans des
r&#233;gions o&#249; la p&#233;n&#233;tration des produits de paiement et des services financiers
est faible. Ces services peuvent comprendre le t&#233;l&#233;paiement &#224; distance pour des
services comme le paiement de facture et la recharge de minutes sans fil et le
transfert mon&#233;taire mobile 
* Raccourcissant le d&#233;lai de commercialisation des services financiers mobiles
en fournissant des infrastructures standardis&#233;es et &#233;volutives avec les
meilleures pratiques pour les applications mon&#233;taires mobiles.

Par exemple, les op&#233;rateurs mobiles pourront d&#233;sormais int&#233;grer leurs donn&#233;es &#224;
des informations fournies par l`institution financi&#232;re d`un client afin de
proposer des offres plus personnalis&#233;es et cibl&#233;es qui seront envoy&#233;es sur le
dispositif mobile d`un abonn&#233; par les services mobiles de Visa. Il serait ainsi
potentiellement possible d`augmenter le taux de r&#233;ponse des abonn&#233;s aux offres
tout en augmentant la pertinence des messages. 

La collaboration autorisera &#233;galement le transfert d`argent vers des comptes
mobiles en passant par le r&#233;seau Visa. Par exemple, le r&#233;seau Visa pourrait
envoyer des fonds vers le compte d`un utilisateur mobile en permettant au
destinataire de faire usage des fonds d&#233;pos&#233;s pour la recharge sans fil de
minutes pr&#233;pay&#233;es ou pour le paiement de facture de services sans fil. Le
destinataire peut &#233;galement acc&#233;der &#224; ces fonds par une carte Visa pr&#233;pay&#233;e ou
par retrait &#224; un DAB &#224; proximit&#233;. 

L`int&#233;gration des technologies Visa et NeuStar peut &#233;galement permettre aux
op&#233;rateurs de fournir des donn&#233;es pertinentes concernant les capacit&#233;s du
combin&#233; t&#233;l&#233;phonique. Visa serait alors en mesure de d&#233;tecter la marque du
t&#233;l&#233;phone, le mod&#232;le, la taille d`&#233;cran, le type de navigateur et les capacit&#233;s
multim&#233;dias pour adapter intelligemment le combin&#233; t&#233;l&#233;phonique &#224; l`usage qu`en
a l`utilisateur. 

Nouveaux mod&#232;les strat&#233;giques issus de la collaboration entre r&#233;seaux

Avec l`alliance annonc&#233;e aujourd`hui au forum Mobile Money Summit 2009 de la
GSMA, NeuStar et Visa consacrent des ressources pour soutenir le d&#233;veloppement
de programmes commercialement viables afin de g&#233;rer de nouveaux cas
d`utilisation d`applications. L`initiative est &#233;galement destin&#233;e &#224; mettre en
&#339;uvre une gamme de services de paiement mobiles plus &#233;tendue en permettant &#224;
Visa, aux institutions financi&#232;res et aux op&#233;rateurs de t&#233;l&#233;phonie mobile de
collaborer plus &#233;troitement pour fournir des transactions plus riches en
informations, &#224; m&#234;me d`augmenter la personnalisation, la fonctionnalit&#233; et la
s&#233;curisation des paiements mobiles.

&lt;p&gt;Two Grants to Improve Math and Science Education 

Focus on New Elementary School 


MEEKER, Colo.--(Business Wire)--
The Meeker School District announced today that ExxonMobil has made two
multiple-year grants to improve math and science education and teacher training.
The combined grants provide $590,000 to support facilities expansion, staffing,
equipment and professional training programs designed to deliver advanced math
and science learning opportunities primarily for students at the new Meeker
elementary school, currently under construction. 

A five-year $350,000 grant was awarded to the Meeker School District to provide
support in three key areas:

* Facilities. Build out and purchase equipment and materials for a
state-of-the-art math and science laboratory in the new Meeker elementary
school. 
* Staff. Provide assistance to fund the District`s first-ever Math and Science
Coach-Coordinator who will serve as a school-wide resource. 
* Equipment. Provide an interactive whiteboard system for each elementary school
classroom as well as for math and science classrooms in the District`s middle
and high school.

"The Meeker School District is honored to accept ExxonMobil`s contribution,"
Meeker Superintendent Dan Evig commented. "This funding will make the District`s
new elementary school a model for math and science education in the region." 

A three-year $240,000 grant will provide funding to the Department of
Mathematics and Computer Science at the Colorado School of Mines to develop a
collaboration to improve K-5 mathematics and science in the Meeker School
District. As part of the program, elementary school faculty will attend summer
workshops at the Colorado School of Mines and receive online educational support
and training throughout the academic year. The grant will also support
infrastructure for an interactive link to allow Meeker teachers access to the
Colorado School of Mines facilities. 

"ExxonMobil is pleased to make these grants to the Meeker School District and
the Colorado School of Mines," noted James F. Branch, Piceance Project
Executive, ExxonMobil Production Company. "We strongly believe in investing in
the communities in which we operate and improving math and science education is
a signature part of ExxonMobil`s community involvement program." 

Superintendent Dan Evig also stated that ExxonMobil has supported various
initiatives to improve math and science education in the Meeker School District
over the past three years.

&lt;p&gt;Strategisch samenwerkingsverband maakt samenwerking tussen exploitanten van
mobiele netwerken, financi&#235;le instellingen en Visa mogelijk, met als gevolg
snellere levering van mobiele financi&#235;le diensten
BARCELONA, Spanje--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), het grootste netwerk voor elektronische retailbetalingen
ter wereld1, en NeuStar (NYSE: NSR), een vertrouwd provider van
interconnectiediensten voor tal van toonaangevende exploitanten van draadloze
netwerken over de hele wereld, hebben vandaag bekendgemaakt dat zij een
strategisch samenwerkingsverband aangaan, met als doel de wereldwijde invoering
van mobiele financi&#235;le diensten te versnellen. 

Visa en NeuStar, beide marktleider in hun branche, hebben gemeen dat ze
voorwaarden scheppen voor complexe, veiligheidsgevoelige transacties en de
veiligheid en mondiale uitwisselbaarheid bieden die aan de basis staan van de
groei van het elektronische betalingsverkeer en de mobiele telecommunicatie,
twee bedrijfstakken die nu op nieuwe manieren moeten samenwerken. In dit
samenwerkingsverband zullen de betrouwbaarheid, schaal en veiligheid van Visa`s
wereldwijde betalingsnetwerk worden gecombineerd met NeuStar`s "carrier grade"
infrastructuur die zorgt voor interconnectiediensten die van cruciaal belang
zijn voor wereldwijd opererende netwerkexploitanten en hun partners en daarmee
naadloze levering van mobiele diensten aan consumenten over de hele wereld
mogelijk maakt. 

"Dankzij het samenwerkingsverband met NeuStar krijgt Visa direct toegang tot
mobiele netwerken over de hele wereld, een belangrijke ondersteuning voor Visa`s
wereldwijde strategie om zijn aanbod van producten en diensten uit te breiden
naar het mobiele kanaal", aldus Elizabeth Buse, Head of Product bij Visa Inc.
"Met dit initiatief kunnen we de levering van mobiele financi&#235;le diensten
versnellen, zowel in opkomende als ontwikkelde economie&#235;n. Die diensten omvatten
mobiele betalingen, het draadloos opwaarderen van prepaid rekeningen,
geldoverboekingen, waardetoevoegende diensten, zoals aankondigingen en
aanbiedingen, en mobiele acceptatie van elektronische betalingen." 

NeuStar fungeert als neutrale schakel die zorgt voor een veilige en betrouwbare
gegevensoverdracht tussen exploitanten van mobiele netwerken en andere partijen
die betrokken zijn bij de levering van mobiele diensten aan consumenten. NeuStar
voegt waarde toe door &#233;&#233;n centraal contactpunt voor alle diensten te bieden,
waardoor exploitanten van mobiele netwerken en hun partners veel gemakkelijker
verbindingen tot stand kunnen brengen en hun abonnees nieuwe diensten kunnen
aanbieden. NeuStar exploiteert tevens de PathFinder-dienst van GSMA, die zorgt
voor een gemeenschappelijk wereldwijd systeem voor adressering en automatische
ontdekking voor traditionele communicatiediensten en die uitbreidbaar is voor
opkomende diensten, zoals mobiele overboekingen. PathFinder biedt tevens een
belangrijke basis voor samenwerking tussen netwerkexploitanten en de door hen
gekozen handelspartners, waaronder andere netwerkexploitanten en financi&#235;le
dienstverleners, zoals Visa. 

"NeuStar, Visa en de met ons samenwerkende netwerkexploitanten vertegenwoordigen
vertrouwde merken: Visa in het betalingsverkeer, NeuStar in de uitwisseling van
netwerkgegevens, en netwerkexploitanten in de mobiele communicatie", aldus Steve
Edwards, Senior Vice President Converged Addressing Services bij NeuStar.
"Dankzij dit samenwerkingsverband kunnen netwerkexploitanten, financi&#235;le
instellingen, Visa en consumenten snel overgaan op mobiel betalen en
meeprofiteren van de opwindende mogelijkheden die in het verschiet liggen. We
zien ernaar uit om samen met Visa, met financi&#235;le instellingen en met mobiele
netwerkexploitanten te werken aan de beste praktijken en toepassingen voor
mobiele financi&#235;le diensten." 

Voordelen en toepassingen

Het Visa-NeuStar initiatief zal belanghebbenden in de mobiele en financi&#235;le
dienstverlening overal ter wereld een groot aantal voordelen opleveren:

* Financi&#235;le instellingen die klant zijn van Visa, krijgen nieuwe kanalen tot
hun beschikking om hun klanten te bereiken waar en wanneer deze toe zijn aan
mobiele financi&#235;le diensten. 
* Er worden nieuwe inkomstenstromen gecre&#235;erd door het aanbod van een nieuw
assortiment financi&#235;le diensten, zoals mobiele meldingen en aanbiedingen van
transacties. 
* Mobiele financi&#235;le diensten kunnen worden geleverd aan consumenten in regio`s
met een lage penetratie van betalingsproducten en financi&#235;le diensten;
voorbeelden van zulke producten en diensten zijn mobiele betaling op afstand
voor diensten zoals het betalen van rekeningen, het opwaarderen van beltegoeden
en het overboeken van geld. 
* De marktintroductietijd voor mobiele financi&#235;le diensten wordt korter dankzij
het aanbod van gestandaardiseerde en schaalbare infrastructuur en beste
praktijken voor mobiele betalingstoepassingen.

Exploitanten van mobiele netwerken kunnen nu bijvoorbeeld hun eigen gegevens
koppelen aan informatie geleverd door de financi&#235;le instellingen van hun
klanten, zodat via Visa`s mobiele diensten meer gepersonaliseerde en relevante
aanbiedingen naar het mobiele apparaat van een abonnee kunnen worden gestuurd.
Dit kan leiden tot meer gerichte reclame en tot een hogere respons van abonnees
op aanbiedingen. 

Het samenwerkingsverband maakt tevens overboeking van geld naar mobiele
rekeningen via het Visa-netwerk mogelijk. Het Visa-netwerk kan bijvoorbeeld geld
sturen naar de rekening van een gebruiker van een mobiele telefoon, waarmee deze
vervolgens zijn prepaid beltegoed kan opwaarderen of rekeningen voor draadloze
diensten kan betalen. De begunstigde kan ook toegang tot dit geld krijgen via
een prepaid kaart van Visa of door een geldopname bij een geldautomaat. 

De combinatie van technologie&#235;n van Visa en NeuStar zal netwerkexploitanten
misschien ook de mogelijkheid bieden om te zorgen voor relevante informatie over
de functies van het telefoontoestel. Visa zou dan merk, model, schermgrootte,
browsertype en multimediafuncties van een toestel kunnen detecteren en op basis
daarvan de gebruikerservaring voor dat toestel gericht kunnen aanpassen. 

Nieuwe bedrijfsmodellen door samenwerking van netwerken

In het kader van het samenwerkingsverband, dat vandaag is bekendgemaakt op het
jaarlijkse GSMA-congres over mobiel geld, bundelen NeuStar en Visa hun krachten
voor de ontwikkeling van commercieel levensvatbare programma`s ter ondersteuning
van nieuwe toepassingen. Het initiatief is tevens bedoeld om een steviger pakket
mobiele betalingsdiensten mogelijk te maken, omdat het Visa, financi&#235;le
instellingen en exploitanten van mobiele netwerken de mogelijkheid biedt nauwer
samen te werken en te zorgen voor informatierijke transacties die mobiele
betalingsdiensten persoonlijker, functioneler en veiliger kunnen maken.

NeuStar (NYSE: NSR) levert marktleidende en innovatieve diensten die veilige
communicatie tussen netwerken, toepassingen en bedrijven over de hele wereld

&lt;p&gt;La collaborazione con Telef&#243;nica e VisaNet Per&#250; evidenzia la domanda crescente
di servizi e pagamenti elettronici nell`America Latina
SAN FRANCISCO e BARCELONA, California--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), societ&#224; leader del settore dei pagamenti a livello globale,
ha annunciato l`istituzione di un programma per pagamenti mobili in
collaborazione con VisaNet Per&#250; e Telef&#243;nica. Pago M&#243;vil con Visa (Visa Mobile
Pay) &#232; un nuovo servizio che permette ai titolari di carte Visa peruviani di
pagare prodotti e servizi per mezzo della semplice inizializzazione di un
pagamento tramite la rete wireless. Potranno avvalersi di tale servizio tutti i
titolari di un conto Visa in possesso di una carta di credito o debito emessa da
Banco de Cr&#233;dito, Interbank, BBVA Continental e Scotiabank in Per&#249;. 

Il primo programma per pagamenti mobili per transazioni commerciali di Visa in
Per&#249;, il cui lancio &#232; stato annunciato quest`oggi durante il secondo vertice
annuale dedicato ai pagamenti mobili `GSMA Mobile Money Summit` tenutosi a
Barcelona, &#232; il primo programma del genere ad essere lanciato nell`America
Latina. Inizialmente, i titolari di un conto Visa potranno usare il proprio
cellulare per pagare corse in taxi e consegne a domicilio di bouquet floreali,
nonch&#233; per coprire il saldo del proprio servizio wireless prepagato. &#200; prevista
l`aggiunta di ulteriori segmenti commerciali, quali consegne di prodotti
farmaceutici, erogazione del gas e ordinazioni tramite catalogo. 

"Stiamo per raggiungere una pietra miliare nel settore dei pagamenti
nell`America Latina" ha dichiarato Jurgen Wassmann, Direttore della divisione
Prodotti e canali emergenti presso Visa Inc., responsabile della regione America
Latina e Caraibi. "Visa sta introducendo nell`America Latina il futuro dei
pagamenti con una tecnologia che semplifica la vita ai consumatori permettendo
loro di effettuare pagamenti in qualsiasi momento, ovunque e in modo semplice e
pratico." 

Il servizio Pago M&#243;vil con Visa &#232; particolarmente attraente per i commercianti
ubicati in aree remote e per le imprese mobili sprovviste di accesso a
un`infrastruttura per telecomunicazioni cablate. Il servizio permette ai
commercianti di accettare pagamenti elettronici tramite la rete wireless,
ovviando alla necessit&#224; di disponibilit&#224; di un terminale di pagamento
tradizionale (cablato). VisaNet Per&#250;, l`acquisitore della transazioni di
pagamento tramite carte di debito o credito Visa in Per&#249;, sta sovrintendendo
all`implementazione del servizio Pago M&#243;vil con Visa. 

Dal collaudo alla commercializzazione

"La domanda da parte dei consumatori di un accesso sicuro ed efficiente ai
servizi finanziari mobili sta registrando un aumento in tutto il mondo" ha
dichiarato Tim Attinger, Direttore della divisione internazionale Sviluppo
prodotti presso Visa Inc., durante il suo intervento tenuto in occasione del
vertice Mobile Money a Barcelona. "Stiamo per giungere a un punto di svolta, ove
le nostre prime iniziative di collaudo di tecnologie per l`effettuazione di
pagamenti mobili in varie parti del mondo hanno iniziato a promuovere il
passaggio del commercio mobile dalla fase di collaudo alla piena implementazione
commerciale." 

Il lancio di Pago M&#243;vil con Visa giunge a sole poche settimane di distanza dal
lancio del primo servizio al mondo per pagamenti mobili offerto da Visa per
transazioni commerciali presso il punto vendita usando la tecnologia per
comunicazioni a campo ravvicinato (Near Field Communications, NFC). Il programma
&#232; stato annunciato congiuntamente con Maxis, il maggiore operatore wireless
della Malesia con oltre 11 milioni di utenti; Nokia, il pi&#249; importante
produttore di cellulari a livello mondiale; e Maybank, un importante istituto
finanziario malese. Il lancio di questo servizio contrassegna la prima volta che
i consumatori potranno acquistare un dispositivo mobile abilitato alla
tecnologia NFC presso un punto vendita wireless che potranno usare per
effettuare pagamenti presso il punto vendita anzich&#233; dover far scorrere una
tradizionale carta di pagamento. 

Visa sta apportando al settore wireless le proprie competenze in materia di
pagamenti e sta collaborando attivamente con operatori di reti wireless,
istituti finanziari, produttori di cellulari e fornitori di piattaforme e
tecnologie. La strategia perseguita da Visa nel settore mobile consiste
nell`ampliare la portata della sua rete globale per l`offerta di servizi
finanziari mobili ai consumatori residenti sia in Paesi sviluppati che in Paesi
emergenti. La societ&#224; gi&#224; fornisce servizi per pagamenti mobili e altri servizi
annessi tramite operatori e istituti finanziari suoi partner in cinque
continenti. 

Informazioni di carattere generale su Visa Inc.: Visa Inc. gestisce la pi&#249;
grande rete del mondo per pagamenti elettronici per transazioni al dettaglio e
offre servizi per l`elaborazione di pagamenti, nonch&#233; piattaforme di pagamento.

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Today ExxonMobil took another important step in meeting the world`s growing
energy needs by announcing the sponsorship of an all-electric car-sharing and
rental program, called AltCar, at the Maryland Science Center in Baltimore, MD. 

The new electric vehicles at the science center, called the Maya-300, are
powered exclusively by enhanced lithium ion battery technology. They are one of
the first fleets of all-electric vehicles using this technology in a consumer
car-sharing and rental program in North America. ExxonMobil`s battery separator
film enables the use of Electrovaya`s Lithium Ion Superpolymer battery in the
vehicle. 

Under the program, Baltimore residents and tourists can rent these vehicles at
the science center in the Baltimore Inner Harbor during the day to drive around
the city to experience the feel of an electric vehicle. The five-door,
five-passenger urban vehicle is equipped with the safety, performance and
convenience features common to cars. 

"This program is a perfect example of the important role innovative companies
and organizations, such as ExxonMobil, Electrovaya and the Maryland Science
Center, will play in addressing the world`s need for safe, low emission,
fuel-efficient vehicles," said Sankar Das Gupta, president and chairman,
Electrovaya. 

Baltimore Mayor Sheila Dixon, and Malcolm Woolf, director of the Maryland Energy
Administration, also were in attendance at today`s event, expressing their
gratitude and support to Electrovaya and ExxonMobil, for their support of the
Maryland Science Center. 

In addition to the car-sharing program and to help raise awareness among
Baltimore residents and science center visitors about the future of energy
efficient transportation, ExxonMobil also has developed a state-of-the-art
exhibit for the science center that includes hands-on activities for children
and a full-scale car that showcases clean transportation technologies currently
being used in the automotive industry. 

ExxonMobil has invested more than half a million dollars in the car-sharing
program and exhibit, including the purchase of the vehicles and development of
the exhibit. 

"Through innovations like these showcased in this innovative program and
world-class exhibit, ExxonMobil is helping make vehicles more efficient," said
Jim Harris, senior vice president, polymers, ExxonMobil Chemical Company. "We
believe that advances in technology are the solution to many of the toughest
energy challenges. Our scientists and researchers are committed to finding and
applying those technologies where we can, including on the car you drive." 

The battery separator film, which is produced at a plant in Nasu, Japan together
with Japanese affiliate TonenGeneral, enables battery manufacturers to
significantly increase the power, capacity, mechanical strength and safety
margins of today`s lithium ion batteries. In addition to the film, ExxonMobil
also is working on a number of additional innovative transportation
technologies. These include a new blend of synthetic rubber and nylon that
enables tires to retain air pressure longer, as well as new lightweight plastics
that enable auto manufacturers to improve a car`s performance while maintaining
affordability and reducing fuel consumption. 

In the past five years, ExxonMobil has invested more than $1.5 billion to
increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gases.

available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5VQErRSnd0. Zoho will discuss this
announcement further with media, analysts, and end users via an open conference
call on 1-866-206-0240, PIN: 128660#, with an online presentation at

"Zoho Office for Microsoft SharePoint brings the collaborative advantages of
Zoho productivity applications to Microsoft SharePoint users," said Raju
Vegesna, Zoho evangelist. "We noticed that some businesses like the
collaboration capabilities of online productivity applications, but they prefer
to keep their data behind their firewall. With Zoho Office for Microsoft
SharePoint, we are offering the best of both worlds - collaborative productivity
apps integrated with Microsoft SharePoint behind the corporate firewall." 

Online Apps with Offline Data: Perfect Integration for Businesses

Zoho Office for Microsoft SharePoint is delivered as an add-on that installs on
top of Microsoft SharePoint 2007 and 2003. Once installed, Zoho Office for
Microsoft SharePoint lets users working in Microsoft SharePoint view, edit, and
create documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in Microsoft Office formats,
but using Zoho online applications. 

When a user clicks on a file in Microsoft SharePoint, the options will include
"Edit in Zoho Editor" and "View in Zoho Editor." The Edit option opens the file
for editing in a Zoho editor within Microsoft SharePoint - either Zoho Writer,
Zoho Sheet, or Zoho Show, depending upon the file selected. The view option
opens the file for viewing in appropriate Zoho applications within Microsoft
SharePoint. The user must be connected to the Internet to access Zoho
applications. 

"Collaboration is one of the key aspects for online productivity applications,
so we don't just call ours `Productivity Applications.` We call them
`Collaborative Productivity Applications,`" Vegesna said. "With Zoho Office for
Microsoft SharePoint, we bring collaborative editing capabilities to Microsoft
SharePoint." 

Zoho Office for Microsoft SharePoint enables multiple users to work
collaboratively on the same document at the same time, seeing each other's
changes instantly. That same functionality is available in online Zoho
applications. With this add-on, Zoho brings the advantage of online
collaborative editing to Microsoft SharePoint users. 

Vegesna continued, "With Zoho Office for Microsoft SharePoint, users can view
and edit files directly in their browsers, inside Microsoft SharePoint with no
additional installations required on client computers. This approach lets users
work on Microsoft SharePoint documents from any operating system and in this
economy, can help save some money on Microsoft Office licenses."

Zoho Office for Microsoft SharePoint is available today as a 30-day free trial
version. After the trial period, users may buy an annual subscription for
$24/user. A monthly subscription is also available for $3/user.

&lt;p&gt;Project is the Company`s First Major Upstream Development in Brazil
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) announced today that its subsidiary Chevron
Brasil Upstream Frade Ltda. has commenced crude oil production from the Frade
Field, the company`s first operated deepwater development in Brazil. 

The estimated $3 billion project, with continuing development drilling, is
expected to achieve peak production of 90,000 barrels of crude oil and natural
gas liquids per day in 2011. 

"Successful development of the Frade Field unlocks a great new source of energy
for the next two decades while establishing a significant platform from which
Chevron can grow its upstream business within one of the world`s most promising
deepwater oil and gas regions," said George Kirkland, Chevron's executive vice
president for Upstream and Gas. 

Chevron has a 51.74 percent operating interest in the Frade Field, which
contains an estimated 200 million to 300 million barrels of recoverable oil. The
field is situated in the Campos Basin in approximately 3,700 feet (1,128 m) of
water, approximately 230 miles (370 km) northeast of Rio de Janeiro. Frade is a
subsea development with wells tied back to a floating production, storage and
offloading vessel. Crude oil production is planned to be exported to world
markets, and natural gas production is expected to be provided for domestic use
in Brazil. 

Other partners in the project are Petr&#243;leo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras, 30
percent; and Frade Jap&#227;o Petr&#243;leo Ltda., a joint-vehicle company of INPEX,
Sojitz and JOGMEC, 18.26 percent. 

Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa and Latin America Exploration and
Production Co., said, "Today`s milestone is a direct result of the coordinated
expertise and commitment demonstrated by our employees, partners and contractors
in Brazil and around the world. Frade is an exciting asset that integrates the
unique skills of both Chevron and Petrobras to help deliver new jobs, new
facilities and new energy production in Brazil for Chevron." 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;Samenwerking met Telef&#243;nica en VisaNet Per&#250; onderstreept toenemende vraag naar
elektronische betalingen en diensten in Latijns-Amerika
SAN FRANCISCO &amp; BARCELONA, Californi&#235; (VS)--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), wereldmarktleider in betalingsdiensten, heeft bekendgemaakt
dat het in samenwerking met VisaNet Per&#250; en Telef&#243;nica een programma voor mobiel
betalingsverkeer gaat starten. Pago M&#243;vil con Visa (Visa Mobile Pay) is een
nieuwe dienst waarmee houders van een Visa-kaart in Peru voor producten en
diensten kunnen betalen door gewoon via het draadloze netwerk een
betalingsopdracht te geven. De dienst is beschikbaar voor rekeninghouders met
een Visa creditcard of pinpas die is uitgegeven door de Banco de Cr&#233;dito, de
Interbank, de BBVA Continental of de Scotiabank in Peru. 

Visa`s eerste commerci&#235;le programma voor mobiele betalingsdiensten in Peru, dat
vandaag is aangekondigd op het tweede jaarlijkse GSMA-congres over mobiel
geldverkeer in Barcelona, is het eerste programma in zijn soort in
Latijns-Amerika. In de eerste fase zullen VISA rekeninghouders hun mobiele
telefoon alleen kunnen gebruiken voor betaling van taxibedrijven en
bloemenbezorgdiensten en voor het opwaarderen van hun prepaid rekening. In een
later stadium zullen andere marktsegmenten worden toegevoegd, zoals
bezorgdiensten voor farmaceutische producten, gasleveranciers en
catalogusbedrijven. 

"We naderen een mijlpaal in de betalingsbranche in Latijns-Amerika", aldus
Jurgen Wassmann, directeur "Emerging Products and Channels" bij Visa Inc. voor
de regio Latijns-Amerika en de Cariben. "Visa brengt de toekomst van het
betalingsverkeer naar Latijns-Amerika, met een technologie die het leven van
consumenten gemakkelijker maakt doordat ze altijd en overal, snel en eenvoudig
kunnen betalen." 

Pago M&#243;vil con Visa is met name aantrekkelijk voor handelaren in afgelegen
regio`s en voor mobiele bedrijven die geen toegang hebben tot een infrastructuur
voor vaste telecommunicatie. De dienst biedt handelaren de mogelijkheid
elektronische betalingen te accepteren via het draadloze netwerk, zodat ze geen
traditionele (vaste) betalingsterminal meer nodig hebben. VisaNet Per&#250;, dat de
rechten op krediet- en debettransacties in Peru heeft verworven, zal de
invoering van Pago M&#243;vil con Visa begeleiden. 

Van testfase tot commercieel gebruik

"De consumentenvraag naar veilige, effici&#235;nte toegang tot mobiele financi&#235;le
diensten neemt wereldwijd toe", zei Tim Attinger, wereldwijd directeur "Product
Development" bij Visa Inc., tijdens de toespraak die hij als hoofdspreker hield
op de "Mobile Money Summit", het congres over mobiel betalingsverkeer in
Barcelona. "Wij zijn al vroeg begonnen met het wereldwijd opzetten van
proefprojecten voor mobiele betalingstechnologie. En nu naderen we het
omslagpunt waarop mobiele handel de testfase verlaat en commercieel volledig tot
ontplooiing komt." 

De introductie van Pago M&#243;vil con Visa komt slechts twee weken na de lancering
van `s werelds eerste commerci&#235;le mobiele betalingsdienst van Visa voor
kassatransacties waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van NFC-technologie (Near Field
Comomunications). Het programma is mede aangekondigd uit naam van een aantal
partners, namelijk Maxis, de grootste mobiele provider van Maleisi&#235;, met meer
dan 11 miljoen abonnees, Nokia, `s werelds grootste producent van mobiele
telefoons, en Maybank, een toonaangevende financi&#235;le dienstverlener in Maleisi&#235;.
De introductie van de dienst betekent dat consumenten voor het eerst in de
winkel een mobiele telefoon met NFC-functie kunnen kopen waarmee ze in winkels
kunnen betalen, zodat ze de traditionele betaalkaart niet meer nodig hebben. 

Visa brengt zijn expertise in betalingen mee naar de mobiele branche en werkt
actief samen met exploitanten van draadloze netwerken, met financi&#235;le
instellingen, met producenten van mobiele telefoons en met bedrijven die de
platformen en de technologie leveren. Met zijn mobiele strategie wil Visa het
bereik van zijn wereldwijde netwerk uitbreiden en zo mobiele financi&#235;le diensten
binnen het bereik brengen van consumenten in opkomende en ontwikkelde
economie&#235;n. Het bedrijf levert diensten voor mobiel betalingsverkeer en
aanverwante diensten via samenwerkingsverbanden met providers en financi&#235;le
instellingen op vijf continenten. 

Over Visa Inc.: Visa Inc. exploiteert `s werelds grootste elektronische
betalingsnetwerk voor de detailhandel. Visa Inc. zorgt voor de verwerking van
betalingsopdrachten en levert platformen voor het betalen van producten. Dit
omvat consumentenbetalingen d.m.v. creditcards en pinpassen, prepaid betalingen

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - Sunrise Power Co's 545-megawatt Sunrise
natural gas-fired power plant in California returned to service by Monday
afternoon, the California Independent System Operator said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The unit shut by June 19 for planned and normal reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Edison Mission, a subsidiary of power company Edison International

San Ramon, California, each own half of Sunrise Power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is run by Edison Mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combined-cycle generating plant is located in Fellows in Kern
County, about 35 miles southwest of Bakersfield, California, and 130 miles
north of Los Angeles. There are two 150 MW gas turbines and one 245 MW
steam turbine at the station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One MW powers about 700 homes in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Edison International, of Rosemead, California, owns and operates about
14,000 MW of generating capacity, markets energy commodities in North
America, and transmits and distributes electricity to about 4.9 million
customers in central and Southern California.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N), the world's largest payment networks, could face lower revenue and pressure on their stock prices amid a push for increased U.S. regulation of credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Congress is mulling regulations on interchange rates -- fees retailers and merchants have to pay to banks that issue credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most immediately, that would affect the banks that collect those fees. But some investors and analysts are concerned the banks -- already battered by credit losses and toxic assets -- could try to share the haircut with Visa and MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Longer term, I think it is a real risk for the model, but this could impact their stocks right now," said Donald Fandetti, an analyst at Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard said the companies would not be impacted by the legislation because they do not charge interchange fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But concern about the legislation has contributed to a 10 percent drop in Visa's shares in the last month and a 5 percent decline for MasterCard, and the shares could fall further, analysts and investors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an overhang on these stocks, at least until we have some clarity," said Moshe Katri, an analyst at Cowen  Co, who said the legislation could impact the profitability of 20 percent of MasterCard's revenues and 10 percent of Visa's revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the financial crisis, Visa's shares traded at 25 times future earnings and MasterCard stock was at 20 times. Now Visa's shares are trading closer to 20 times 2010 earnings and MasterCard stock is around 15 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These price-to-earnings multiples -- still high compared with many financials -- could become the new norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is heightened regulatory risk and we think investors will reflect that in a lower multiple," Fandetti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa's shares ended down 0.21 percent at $61.24, while MasterCard stock fell 2.83 percent to $156.78.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHARE THE PAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interchange fees laws currently under discussion would be in addition to recent legislation already approved limiting credit card fees and interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation would give merchants and retailers more power to negotiate interchange fees with banks. It follows longtime complaints from store owners that banks have colluded to set fee structures and block them from negotiating with Visa and MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, interchange fees rose 14 percent to about $48 billion, averaging about 1.75 percent of total purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard are partially insulated from the impact of the legislation because they make the bulk of their money every time a person swipes a card and do not collect interchange fees, but they could be affected by a retrenchment in the credit card industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, analysts estimate the companies receive around 10 cents per $100 transaction from the card issuers and, if banks were forced to cut interchange rates, the financial institutions could ask Visa and MasterCard to share the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also said the world's biggest payment networks could be near a renegotiation of their contracts with some big U.S. banks, which could ask for lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is adding some pricing pressure," said Walter Todd, portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard have said merchants already are able to negotiate lower fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't see Congress legislating interchange fees or setting prices," William Sheedy, president of Visa for North America, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The real question is whether the government is going to jump in and get into the game of price control in the free market. At the end of the day, this is price control and this just doesn't smell right," said Chris McWilton, MasterCard's president of U.S. markets, at an investor's conference earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheedy and MasterCard's spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said the pending legislation would not affect their companies revenue. Both added that, when Australia cut interchange fees, neither Visa nor MasterCard were hurt by the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Instalaciones preparadas para aumentar de manera constante el abastecimiento a
los mercados estadounidenses 
* La tecnolog&#237;a de perforaci&#243;n y las mejores pr&#225;cticas permiten obtener gas con
mayor eficacia

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Production Company anunci&#243; hoy la finalizaci&#243;n de la nueva capacidad
de procesamiento de campo de su Proyecto Piceance en la ladera oeste de las
Monta&#241;as Rocallosas, en el condado de R&#237;o Blanco, Colorado. 

Las nuevas instalaciones tienen la capacidad de manejar hasta 200 millones de
pies c&#250;bicos por d&#237;a de gas natural. Incluyen sistemas de recolecci&#243;n de gas y
de l&#237;quido, plantas de tratamiento, una tuber&#237;a de agua producida, un sistema
subterr&#225;neo de eliminaci&#243;n de desechos y un sitio condensado para ventas y carga
de camiones. 

ExxonMobil ha estado produciendo gas natural en la cuenca de Piceance por m&#225;s de
50 a&#241;os y actualmente produce alrededor de 100 millones de pies c&#250;bicos por d&#237;a.
En la actualidad, la compa&#241;&#237;a opera siete plataformas de perforaci&#243;n para
aumentar su producci&#243;n en Piceance. 

"Un proyecto como el de Piceance representa una visi&#243;n a largo plazo y un
compromiso con el desarrollo energ&#233;tico", afirma Rich Kruger, presidente de
ExxonMobil Production Company. "La clave para explotar todo el potencial de este
recurso enorme y t&#233;cnicamente exigente reside en aumentar los &#237;ndices de
producci&#243;n y de recuperaci&#243;n de cada pozo a menor costo. Para lograrlo, los
cient&#237;ficos e ingenieros de ExxonMobil est&#225;n trabajando en la optimizaci&#243;n de
las tecnolog&#237;as y los procesos facilitadores." 

Se prev&#233; que el gas natural ser&#225; la principal fuente de combustible,
fundamentalmente porque se utiliza cada vez m&#225;s para generar electricidad. Los
arrendamientos de ExxonMobil en la cuenca de Piceance poseen un recurso
recuperable potencial de 45 billones de pies c&#250;bicos de gas. "ExxonMobil est&#225;
comprometida a desarrollar este recurso de manera eficaz y con conciencia y
respeto por el medio ambiente", sostiene Kruger. 

&#201;xito mediante la tecnolog&#237;a patentada de ExxonMobil

El gas natural de la cuenca de Piceance se encuentra atrapado entre rocas densas
como el concreto y en zonas discontinuas separadas por delgadas capas de
esquisto. Para recuperar el "gas atrapado", ExxonMobil est&#225; aplicando tecnolog&#237;a
patentada y las mejores pr&#225;cticas. 

"Los pozos de Piceance excavados con nuestra tecnolog&#237;a patentada de
fracturaci&#243;n producen mucho m&#225;s que los pozos fracturados de manera convencional
y a menor costo", se&#241;ala Jim Branch, gerente del proyecto Piceance de
ExxonMobil. "Implementamos el proceso patentado de perforaci&#243;n r&#225;pida (Fast
Drill) de ExxonMobil y la tecnolog&#237;a de estimulaci&#243;n multizona con perforaci&#243;n
justo a tiempo (Just-in-Time Perforation) para acceder a unas 50 zonas que
contienen gas en un mismo pozo, algo que se desconoc&#237;a hasta hace pocos a&#241;os.
Podemos excavar hasta 9 &#243; 10 pozos desde una sola plataforma, con reducci&#243;n de
la superficie afectada. Cada pozo puede recuperar gas ubicado en un &#225;rea de 20
acres (8 hect&#225;reas) bajo tierra. Con este proceso rentable se obtiene mucho m&#225;s
gas de las numerosas zonas que cada pozo puede explotar." 

Para el proyecto, la conservaci&#243;n del agua es una prioridad. ExxonMobil
desarroll&#243; un sistema que reutiliza para otros procesos el agua que se recupera
de la producci&#243;n. As&#237; se reduce el consumo de agua dulce en un 80%. 

ExxonMobil realiza estudios exhaustivos de flora, fauna y arqueolog&#237;a para
ayudar a manejar el desempe&#241;o ambiental de las operaciones en la cuenca de
Piceance. Asimismo, junto con instituciones educativas locales y agencias
gubernamentales, la compa&#241;&#237;a participa en estudios con el fin de maximizar la
protecci&#243;n de los h&#225;bitats naturales y de la vegetaci&#243;n en el &#225;rea de desarrollo
del proyecto. 

Enterprise Products Partners L.P. construy&#243; nuevas instalaciones de planta y
tuber&#237;as en el proyecto Piceance para proporcionar servicios de compresi&#243;n,
tratamiento y acondicionamiento para el gas natural producido, que se env&#237;a a
varios sistemas de tuber&#237;as de transmisi&#243;n que abastecen a la regi&#243;n.

&lt;p&gt;* Anlagen zur kontinuierlichen Erh&#246;hung der Lieferungen f&#252;r den US-Markt
eingerichtet 
* Bohrtechnik und bew&#228;hrte Verfahren produzieren kosteng&#252;nstiger mehr Gas

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Die ExxonMobil Production Company meldete heute die Fertigstellung einer neuen
Verarbeitungsanlage f&#252;r ihr Piceance-Projekt westlich der Rocky Mountains im Rio
Blanco County, Colorado. 

Die neuen Anlagen k&#246;nnen bis zu 200 Millionen Kubikfu&#223; (5,66 Mio. m&#179;) Erdgas pro
Tag verarbeiten. Sie umfassen Gas- und Fl&#252;ssigkeitssammelsysteme,
Verarbeitungsanlagen, eine Pipeline und ein unterirdisches Entsorgungssystem f&#252;r
Formationswasser, eine Kondensatverkaufs- und eine Lkw-Beladestelle. 

ExxonMobil produziert im Piceance-Becken seit fast 50 Jahren Erdgas und erreicht
derzeit Produktionsmengen von 100 Millionen Kubikfu&#223; (2,83 Mio. m&#179;) pro Tag. Das
Unternehmen betreibt zurzeit sieben Bohrt&#252;rme zur Erh&#246;hung der Produktion im
Piceance-Becken. 

&#8222;Ein Projekt wie Piceance zeigt langfristiges Denken und Engagement in der
Energieentwicklung", sagt Rich Kruger, Pr&#228;sident der ExxonMobil Production
Company. &#8222;Der Schl&#252;ssel, um das Potential dieser riesigen, technisch
anspruchsvollen Ressourcen zu erschlie&#223;en, ist die Erh&#246;hung der Produktion und
des Ertrags aller Bohrungen bei geringeren Kosten. Wissenschaftler und
Ingenieure von ExxonMobil arbeiten hart daran, die technischen Voraussetzungen
und Verfahren zu genau diesem Zweck zu verbessern." 

Erdgas soll Erwartungen zufolge die am schnellsten wachsende Treibstoffquelle
werden, insbesondere infolge ihrer zunehmenden Nutzung zur Stromerzeugung. Die
Pachtfl&#228;chen von ExxonMobil im Piceance-Becken enthalten potenziell f&#246;rderbare
Ressourcen von 45 Billionen Kubikfu&#223; (1,27 Billionen m&#179;) Erdgas. &#8222;ExxonMobil
setzt sich daf&#252;r ein, diese Ressource auf effiziente und umweltbewusste Art zu
erschlie&#223;en", so Kruger. 

Erfolg durch gesch&#252;tzte Technologien von ExxonMobil

Im Piceance-Becken ist das Erdgas in Felsgestein mit einer Dichte wie Beton
eingeschlossen, in mehreren Zonen, die durch d&#252;nne Schichten Schiefer
voneinander getrennt sind. Um das &#8222;Tight Gas" zu f&#246;rdern, verwendet ExxonMobil
gesch&#252;tzte Technologien und bew&#228;hrte Verfahren. 

&#8222;Die Piceance-Bohrungen, die mit unserer gesch&#252;tzten Bruchtechnologie gemacht
wurden, produzieren deutlich mehr als auf herk&#246;mmliche Art hergestellte
Bohrungen, und mit geringeren Kosten", erkl&#228;rt der Leiter des Piceance-Projekts
von ExxonMobil, Jim Branch. &#8222;Wir nutzen das gesch&#252;tzte &#8222;Fast Drill"-Verfahren
und die &#8222;Multi-zone Stimulation"-Technologie von ExxonMobil mit
Just-in-Time-Perforation, um bis zu 50 Gaslagerzonen mit einer Bohrung zu
erreichen, was vor ein paar Jahren noch undenkbar war. Wir k&#246;nnen von einer
einzigen Plattform aus bis zu neun oder zehn Bohrungen durchf&#252;hren, mit deutlich
weniger Oberfl&#228;chenst&#246;rungen. Jede Bohrung erreicht so Gaslager, die sich &#252;ber
20 Acre (8 Hektar) unter der Erde erstrecken. Das kosteng&#252;nstige Verfahren
erzielt deutlich h&#246;here Gasertr&#228;ge aus den vielen Zonen, die es von einer
einzigen Bohrung aus anzapfen kann." 

Wasserschutz ist bei diesem Projekt sehr wichtig. ExxonMobil hat ein System
entwickelt, bei dem das bei der Produktion anfallende Wasser f&#252;r andere Prozesse
wiederverwendet wird. Dadurch sinkt der S&#252;&#223;wasserverbrauch um etwa 80 %. 

ExxonMobil f&#252;hrt umfassende Untersuchungen der Tier- und Pflanzenwelt und
arch&#228;ologische Untersuchungen durch, um die Umwelteinfl&#252;sse der Aktivit&#228;ten im
Piceance-Becken zu kontrollieren. Au&#223;erdem nimmt das Unternehmen an Studien von
lokalen Bildungseinrichtungen und Regierungsbeh&#246;rden teil, um die nat&#252;rlichen
Lebensr&#228;ume und Pflanzenarten im Projektgebiet bestm&#246;glich zu sch&#252;tzen. 

Enterprise Products Partners L.P. hat f&#252;r das Piceance-Projekt neue Anlagen und
Pipelines zur Komprimierung, Behandlung und Konditionierung des produzierten
Erdgases gebaut, das anschlie&#223;end in verschiedene Versorgungssysteme der Region
eingeleitet wird.

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Production Company a annonc&#233; aujourd`hui l`ach&#232;vement d`une nouvelle
capacit&#233; de traitement de champ dans le cadre de son Projet de Piceance situ&#233;
sur le versant ouest des montagnes Rocheuses dans le comt&#233; de Rio Blanco au
Colorado. 

La capacit&#233; des nouvelles installations permet de traiter jusqu`&#224; 5,66 millions
de m3 de gaz naturel par jour. Elles comportent des r&#233;seaux collecteurs de gaz
et de liquides, des installations de traitement, un pipeline d`eau produite et
un syst&#232;me souterrain d`&#233;vacuation, ainsi qu`un site de vente de condensats et
de chargement de camions. 

ExxonMobil produit du gaz naturel dans le bassin de Piceance depuis pr&#232;s de 50
ans et en produit &#224; l`heure actuelle environ 2,83 millions de m3 par jour. La
soci&#233;t&#233; exploite actuellement sept installations de forage afin d`augmenter sa
production au niveau de Piceance. 

&#171; Un projet tel que celui de Piceance repr&#233;sente une vision &#224; long terme du
d&#233;veloppement &#233;nerg&#233;tique et un engagement envers ce d&#233;veloppement &#187;, d&#233;clare
Rich Kruger, pr&#233;sident d`ExxonMobil Production Company. &#171; La cl&#233; si l`on veut
d&#233;bloquer le potentiel de cette ressource abondante, mais difficile d`un point
de vue technique est d`accro&#238;tre les taux de production et de r&#233;cup&#233;ration de
chaque puits &#224; un co&#251;t plus faible. Les scientifiques et ing&#233;nieurs ExxonMobil
font tout leur possible pour am&#233;liorer les technologies catalysantes et les
processus exactement dans ce but. &#187; 

On estime que le gaz naturel sera l`importante source de carburant &#224; cro&#238;tre le
plus rapidement, pouss&#233;e en grande partie par le fait de sa plus grande
utilisation pour g&#233;n&#233;rer de l`&#233;lectricit&#233;. Les concessions d`ExxonMobil dans le
bassin de Piceance jouissent d`un potentiel de ressources r&#233;cup&#233;rables de 1,27
billion de m3 de gaz. &#171; ExxonMobil s`est donn&#233;e pour mission de d&#233;velopper cette
ressource de mani&#232;re rentable en tenant compte de l`environnement &#187;, indique M.
Kruger. 

La r&#233;ussite gr&#226;ce &#224; la technologie exclusive ExxonMobil

Le gaz naturel dans le bassin de Piceance est pris dans une roche aussi dure que
du b&#233;ton et se trouve dans des zones dispers&#233;es s&#233;par&#233;es par de fines couches de
schiste. Pour r&#233;cup&#233;rer le &#171; gaz avare &#187;, ExxonMobil met en application une
technologie exclusive et des pratiques d`excellence. 

&#171; Les puits de Piceance qui ont &#233;t&#233; compl&#233;t&#233;s en utilisant notre technologie de
fracturation exclusive produisent consid&#233;rablement plus que les puits qui ont
&#233;t&#233; fractur&#233;s de fa&#231;on conventionnelle et &#224; un co&#251;t moindre &#187;, confie quant &#224;
lui Jim Branch, cadre ex&#233;cutif du Projet de Piceance d`ExxonMobil. &#171; Nous
utilisons la technologie exclusive d`ExxonMobil de processus de forage rapide
(Fast Drill) et de stimulation multi-zones (Multi-zone Stimulation) avec une
perforation Just-in-Time pour acc&#233;der &#224; un maximum de 50 zones gaz&#233;if&#232;res dans
un puits, du jamais vu il n`y a encore que quelques ann&#233;es. Nous pouvons forer
jusqu`&#224; 9 ou 10 puits &#224; partir d`une seule plateforme, en d&#233;rangeant moins la
surface. Chaque puits peut r&#233;cup&#233;rer du gaz situ&#233; sur environ 8 hectares sous la
surface. Le processus rentable produit consid&#233;rablement plus de gaz des
nombreuses zones dans lesquelles il est possible de puiser au niveau de chaque
puits. &#187; 

La conservation de l`eau est une priorit&#233; dans ce projet. ExxonMobil a &#233;labor&#233;
un syst&#232;me qui r&#233;utilise l`eau r&#233;cup&#233;r&#233;e de la production pour d`autres
processus. Ceci r&#233;duit la consommation en eau douce d`environ 80 %. 

ExxonMobil conduit des &#233;tudes pouss&#233;es sur la faune et la flore, ainsi
qu`arch&#233;ologiques afin de mieux g&#233;rer la performance environnementale des
op&#233;rations du bassin de Piceance. La soci&#233;t&#233; participe &#233;galement &#224; des &#233;tudes en
collaboration avec des agences gouvernementales et des &#233;tablissements
d`enseignement locaux afin de maximiser la protection des habitats de la faune
et des esp&#232;ces de plantes indig&#232;nes dans la zone de d&#233;veloppement du projet. 

Enterprise Products Partners L.P. a construit des installations telles que des
usine et gazoduc pour le projet de Piceance pour fournir des services de
compression, traitement et conditionnement pour le gaz naturel produit, qui est
livr&#233; dans divers syst&#232;mes de transmission par gazoduc desservant la r&#233;gion.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments from conference, Zimbabwe high commission) HARARE, June 23 (Reuters) - Britain has denied Zimbabwe's mines minister a visa for an investment conference, fuelling anger in President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party over continued Western sanctions on its officials. Mugabe formed a unity government in February with arch-rival Morgan Tsvangirai, now prime minister, to try to end an economic and political crisis worsened last year by a disputed presidential poll.  Tsvangirai is in London as part of a Western tour to drum up financial support for Zimbabwe's new government. But on Tuesday, a Harare government official said Britain had refused Mines and Mining Development Minister Obert Mpofu a visa -- under European Union travel sanctions against Mugabe and his top associates. The minister had wanted to travel to London to address a conference on investment opportunities in the southern African country. The minister did not get a visa and in our view all this does not make sense except to confirm that some people in London are pursuing their fight against ZANU-PF, the official said. They are trying to undermine the inclusive government with this sort of attitude.  A representative of the Zimbabwean High Commission in London said he had been excluded because he was on the British government's banned list as a member of Mugabe's circle. Denis Worrall, chairman of Omega Investment Mining Partners and one of the conference organisers, said Mpofu was absent  because he had been denied a visa. Other delegates criticised the decision, comparing it unfavourably with Britain's improved relations with Libya. Colonel (Muammar) Gaddafi has been rehabilitated. If he can be rehabilitated, who can't? Zimbabwe does not have a Lockerbie on its books, said Andrew Cranswick, CEO of African Consolidated Resources, a mining company with investments in Zimbabwe. Africa minister Mark Malloch-Brown said last week it was too early to lift sanctions on Zimbabwe but said there was room for flexibility in allowing ZANU-PF ministers to travel to Britain. There was no immediate statement from the British embassy in Harare, which traditionally does not comment on visa issues, nor from the British government in London. Britain pledged 5 million pounds ($8 million) to Zimbabwe on Monday but made clear more reforms were needed before it would start large-scale development aid to the shattered country. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told Tsvangirai there were great signs of progress, but the power-sharing government still had to meet a number of tests on the road to democracy.

&lt;p&gt;Zusammenarbeit mit Telef&#243;nica und VisaNet Per&#250; unterstreicht wachsende Nachfrage
nach elektronischem Zahlungsverkehr und anderen Diensten in Lateinamerika
SAN FRANCISCO &amp; BARCELONA (Kalifornien), USA--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), das weltweit f&#252;hrende Unternehmen f&#252;r Zahlungsdienste, hat
die Einf&#252;hrung eines mobilen Zahlungsprogramms in Zusammenarbeit mit VisaNet
Per&#250; und Telef&#243;nica angek&#252;ndigt. Pago M&#243;vil con Visa (mobil bezahlen mit Visa)
ist eine neue Dienstleistung, mit welcher Inhaber einer Visa-Karte G&#252;ter und
Dienstleistungen bezahlen k&#246;nnen, indem sie die Bezahlung einfach &#252;ber das
Mobilfunknetz ausl&#246;sen. Die Dienstleistung steht Inhabern einer Visa-Karte
(Kredit- oder Debitkarte) offen, die von der Banco de Cr&#233;dito, der Interbank,
der BBVA Continental oder der Scotiabank in Peru ausgestellt wurde. 

Das erste kommerzielle mobile Zahlungsprogramm von Visa in Peru, das heute vom
zweiten j&#228;hrlichen GSMA Mobile Money Summit im kalifornischen Barcelona aus
angek&#252;ndigt wurde, ist das erste derartige Programm in Lateinamerika. Inhaber
einer Visa-Karte k&#246;nnen &#252;ber ihr Mobiltelefon zun&#228;chst einmal den Fahrpreis im
Taxi bezahlen und Blumen verschicken, aber auch ihr Prepaid-Guthaben aufladen.
Weitere Handelssegmente sind vorgesehen, so etwa die Lieferung von
Arzneimitteln, die Gasverteilung und Katalogbestellungen. 

&#8222;Wir erreichen einen Meilenstein in der Zahlungsindustrie in Lateinamerika",
sagte J&#252;rgen Wassmann, Leiter der Abteilung f&#252;r entstehende Produkte und Kan&#228;le
f&#252;r Visa Inc. in Lateinamerika und der Karibik. &#8222;Visa bringt die Zahlungsmethode
der Zukunft nach Lateinamerika zusammen mit einem Verfahren, das den
Verbrauchern das Leben leichter macht, indem sie &#252;berall und zu jeder Zeit auf
einfache und bequeme Weise bezahlen k&#246;nnen." 

Pago M&#243;vil con Visa ist besonders attraktiv f&#252;r H&#228;ndler in abgelegenen Gebieten
und mobile Gesch&#228;fte ohne Zugang zu fest installierter
Telekommunikationsinfrastruktur. Der Dienst erlaubt H&#228;ndlern die Annahme
elektronischer Zahlungen &#252;ber das Mobilfunknetz, ohne dass sie ein herk&#246;mmliches
(fest installiertes) Zahlungsterminal ben&#246;tigen. Das Unternehmen VisaNet Per&#250;,
das Zahlungstransaktionen mit Kredit- und Debitkarten von Visa in Peru
abrechnet, betreut die Einf&#252;hrung von Pago M&#243;vil con Visa. 

Vom Versuch zur Kommerzialisierung

&#8222;Die Verbrauchernachfrage nach sicherem und gut funktionierendem Zugang zu
mobilen Finanzdienstleistungen verzeichnet einen weltweiten Anstieg", sagte Tim
Attinger, Globaler Leiter der Abteilung f&#252;r Produktentwicklung bei Visa Inc.,
anl&#228;sslich seiner Grundsatzrede am Mobile Money Summit in Barcelona,
Kalifornien. &#8222;Wir erreichen einen Wendepunkt, an dem unsere anf&#228;nglichen
Bem&#252;hungen im Zusammenhang mit mobilen Zahlungstechnologien rund um den Globus
im Bereich Mobile Commerce von der Versuchsphase in den kommerziellen Einsatz
&#252;bergehen." 

Die Einf&#252;hrung von Pago M&#243;vil con Visa folgt wenige Wochen nach der Einf&#252;hrung
des weltweit ersten kommerziellen mobilen Zahlungsdienstes von Visa mit
NFC-Technologie (Near Field Communications). Angek&#252;ndigt wurde dieses Programm
zusammen mit Maxis, dem mit &#252;ber 11 Millionen Abonnenten gr&#246;&#223;ten
Mobilfunkanbieter in Malaysia, dem weltweit f&#252;hrenden Mobiltelefonhersteller
Nokia und Maybank, einem f&#252;hrenden malaysischen Finanzinstitut. Mit der
Einf&#252;hrung des Dienstes konnten Verbraucher in einem Mobilfunkgesch&#228;ft zum
ersten Mal ein NFC-Mobilger&#228;t kaufen, mit dem sie am Verkaufsort bezahlen

qui existe pour des services et des paiements &#233;lectroniques en Am&#233;rique latine
SAN FRANCISCO &amp; BARCELONE, Californie--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE : V), leader mondial des paiements, a annonc&#233; le lancement d`un
programme de paiement mobile en collaboration avec VisaNet Per&#250; et Telef&#243;nica.
Pago M&#243;vil con Visa (Visa Mobile Pay) est un nouveau service qui permet aux

la livraison de produits pharmaceutiques, la distribution d`essence et les
commandes par catalogue.

&lt;p&gt;HARARE, June 23 (Reuters) - Britain has denied Zimbabwe's mines minister a visa for an investment conference, fuelling anger in President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party over continued Western sanctions on its officials. Mugabe formed a unity government in February with arch-rival Morgan Tsvangirai, now prime minister, to try to end an economic and political crisis worsened last year by a disputed presidential poll.  Tsvangirai is in London as part of a Western tour to drum up financial support for Zimbabwe's new government. But on Tuesday, a Harare government official said Britain had refused mines and mining development minister Obert Mpofu a visa -- under European Union travel sanctions against Mugabe and his top associates. The minister had wanted to travel to London to address a conference this week on investment opportunities in the southern African country. The minister did not get a visa and in our view all this does not make sense except to confirm that some people in London are pursuing their fight against ZANU-PF, the official said. They are trying to undermine the inclusive government with this sort of attitude.  The official declined to be named or to say how ZANU-PF would respond. There was no immediate statement from the British embassy in Harare, which traditionally does not comment on visa issues, nor from the British government in London. Britain pledged 5 million pounds ($8 million) to Zimbabwe on Monday but made clear more reforms were needed before it would start large-scale development aid to the shattered country. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told Tsvangirai there were great signs of progress, but the power-sharing government still had to meet a number of tests on the road to democracy.

&lt;p&gt;Intelligent Daily Forecasting project decreases inventory while improving
customer service levels
NORWALK, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) has won the Supply Chain Distinction
Award in the `Operational Excellence` category for their global implementation
of Terra Technology`s Demand Sensing (DS). The Intelligent Daily Forecasting
(IDF) project has enabled P to increase forecast accuracy, decrease inventory
and improve supply chain performance. The award was presented on 9 June at the
11th Annual European Supply Chain &amp; Logistics Summit in D&#252;sseldorf, Germany. 

"In the current economic climate -- with ever increasing volatility in demand --
it is crucial to extend the supply chain visibility as close to our customers as
possible," explains Nils Mueller, Global IDF Initiative Manager for Procter &amp;
Gamble. "Speed today is of the essence. Only those companies that can respond
quickly to customer and consumer needs will stay ahead. Terra`s software
provides P the ability to stay ahead of shifts in consumer demand." 

Procter &amp; Gamble implemented Terra Technology`s DS to improve short-term
forecast accuracy, enabling P to reduce inventory and facilitate supply and
demand collaboration. DS analyzes daily streams of demand data, using pattern
recognition mathematics to determine what available demand information is
relevant and creating a more accurate forecast. The enterprise-wide roll-out has
reduced forecast error by up to 45 percent for P In the next phase of the
project, P is focusing on integrating additional customer demand signals into
the planning process by implementing Terra`s Multi-Enterprise Demand Sensing,
which is expected to further improve forecast accuracy in order to achieve
superior customer service. 

Robert F. Byrne, President and CEO of Terra Technology, said, "Procter &amp; Gamble
continues to be recognized as a global supply chain leader, securing a spot as
one of the top five supply chains in the world by AMR Research for five
consecutive years. P maintains its supply chain advantage by investing in
innovative technologies to improve efficiency and decrease costs."

&lt;p&gt;Partnership with Telef&#243;nica and VisaNet Per&#250; Underscores Growing Demand for
Electronic Payments and Services in Latin America
SAN FRANCISCO &amp; BARCELONA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), the global leader in payments, announced the start of a
mobile payment program in collaboration with VisaNet Per&#250; and Telef&#243;nica. Pago
M&#243;vil con Visa (Visa Mobile Pay) is a new service that allows Visa cardholders
in Peru to pay for products and services by simply initiating a payment over the
wireless network. The service is available to Visa accountholders with credit or
debit cards issued by Banco de Cr&#233;dito, Interbank, BBVA Continental and
Scotiabank in Peru. 

Visa`s first commercial mobile payment program in Peru, announced today from the
second annual GSMA Mobile Money Summit in Barcelona, is the first program of its
kind in Latin America. Initially, Visa account holders will be able to use their
mobile phone to pay for cab fares and send flower arrangements, as well as to
top up their wireless prepaid account. Other merchant segments are scheduled to
be added, such as deliveries of pharmaceutical products, gas distribution and
catalog orders. 

"We are reaching a milestone in the payment industry in Latin America," said
Jurgen Wassmann, Head of Emerging Products and Channels for Visa Inc., Latin
America and Caribbean Region. "Visa is bringing the future of payments to Latin
America with a technology that makes consumers` lives easier by allowing them to
pay anytime, anywhere, and in a way that is both simple and convenient." 

Pago M&#243;vil con Visa is particularly appealing to merchants in remote regions and
to mobile businesses with no access to a wired telecommunications
infrastructure. The service enables merchants to accept electronic payments via
the wireless network, eliminating the need for a traditional (wired) payment
terminal. VisaNet Per&#250;, the acquirer of Visa credit and debit payment
transactions in Peru, is overseeing the implementation of Pago M&#243;vil con Visa. 

From Trial to Commercialization

"Consumer demand for secure, efficient access to mobile financial services is on
the rise globally," said Tim Attinger, Global Head of Product Development for
Visa Inc., during his keynote address at the Mobile Money Summit in Barcelona.
"We are reaching a tipping point where our early efforts in testing mobile
payment technology around the globe have begun to drive mobile commerce from
tests into full commercial deployment." 

The launch of Pago M&#243;vil con Visa comes just weeks after the launch of the
world`s first commercial Visa mobile payments service for point-of-sale
transactions using Near Field Communications (NFC) technology. The program was
announced jointly with Maxis, the largest wireless carrier in Malaysia, with
more than 11 million subscribers; Nokia, the world`s leading handset
manufacturer; and Maybank, a leading financial institution in Malaysia. The
service launch marked the first time consumers can purchase a NFC-enabled mobile
device at a wireless store, and use that device to make payments at the
point-of-sale instead of swiping a traditional payment card. 

Visa is bringing its expertise in payments to the wireless industry and is
actively collaborating with wireless network operators, financial institutions,
handset manufacturers, platform and technology providers. Visa`s mobile strategy
is to extend the reach of its global network to bring mobile financial services
to consumers in both emerging and developed economies. The company already
provides mobile payments and related services through partner carriers and
financial institutions on five continents. 

About Visa Inc.: Visa Inc. operates the world's largest retail electronic
payments network providing processing services and payment product platforms.
This includes consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments, which are
offered under the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and PLUS brands. Visa enjoys

largest global ATM networks, offering cash access in local currency in more than
170 countries. For more information, visit www.corporate.visa.com.

&lt;p&gt;Strategic Alliance Enables Collaboration among Mobile Network Operators,
Financial Institutions and Visa; Accelerates Delivery of Mobile Financial
Services
BARCELONA, Spain--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), the world`s largest retail electronic payments network1,
and NeuStar (NYSE: NSR), a trusted interconnection service provider to many of
the world`s leading wireless network operators, today announced a strategic
alliance designed to accelerate the adoption of mobile financial services
globally. 

Leaders in their respective industries, Visa and NeuStar share a heritage of
enabling complex, trusted transactions, and providing the security and global
interoperability that has enabled the growth of electronic payments and mobile
telecommunications, two industries that now must collaborate in new ways. The
alliance will combine the reliability, scale and security of Visa`s global
payment network with NeuStar`s carrier grade infrastructure which provides
critical interconnection services to global network operators and their partners
enabling seamless delivery of mobile services to consumers worldwide. 

"The Visa-NeuStar alliance provides Visa a single point of connection to mobile
network operators around the globe and supports Visa`s global strategy to extend
its products and services to the mobile channel," said Elizabeth Buse, Head of
Product at Visa Inc. "This initiative has the potential to accelerate delivery
of mobile financial services in both emerging and developed economies. Those
services include mobile payments, wireless top-up of prepaid accounts, money
transfer, value-added services such as alerts and offers and mobile acceptance
of electronic payments." 

NeuStar serves as a neutral intermediary to facilitate the safe and reliable
transfer of data between mobile operators, and other collaborating parties in
the delivery of mobile services to consumers. NeuStar adds value by providing a
single point of contact for all services, simplifying the task for mobile
operators and their partners to connect and offer new services to their
subscribers. NeuStar also operates the GSMA`s PathFinder service, which provides
a common global addressing and service discovery mechanism for traditional
communication services, and is extensible to emerging services such as mobile
money transfer. PathFinder also provides a key enabling foundation for the
collaboration between operators and their chosen trading partners, including
other operators and financial services providers, such as Visa. 

"NeuStar, Visa and our operator partners represent trusted brands, Visa in
payments and NeuStar in network data exchange, and operators in mobile
communications," said Steve Edwards, Senior Vice President of Converged
Addressing Services at NeuStar. "This collaboration enables network operators,
financial institutions, Visa, and consumers to move rapidly into the world of
mobile payments and take advantage of the exciting opportunities ahead. We look
forward to joining Visa, financial institutions, and mobile network operators in
developing best practices and applications for mobile financial services." 

Benefits and Applications

The Visa-NeuStar initiative will deliver a host of benefits to mobile and
financial services stakeholders globally by:

* Enabling new channels through which Visa`s financial institution clients can
reach their customers when and where they are ready to use mobile financial
services 
* Creating new revenue streams by offering a new suite of financial services
such as mobile transaction alerts and offers 
* Enabling delivery of mobile financial services to consumers in geographies
with low penetration of payment products and financial services. Those services
may include mobile remote payments for services such as bill payment and top-up
for wireless airtime minutes and mobile money transfer 
* Improving time to market for mobile financial services by providing
standardized and scalable infrastructure along with best practices for mobile
money applications

For example, mobile operators will now have the opportunity to combine their
data with information provided by a customer`s financial institution in order to
create more personalized and relevant offers delivered by Visa`s mobile services
to a subscriber`s mobile device. This has the potential to increase subscriber
response rates to offers while increasing relevancy of messaging. 

The collaboration will also enable the transfer of money to mobile accounts
using the Visa network. For example, the Visa network could send funds to a
mobile user`s account enabling the recipient to use funds deposited for wireless
top-up of prepaid airtime minutes or bill payment for wireless services. The
recipient may also access those funds through a Visa prepaid card or withdrawal
at a nearby ATM. 

The combination of Visa and NeuStar technology may also make it possible for
operators to provide pertinent data regarding handset capabilities. Visa could
then detect phone make, model, screen size, browser type, and multimedia
capabilities to intelligently tailor the user experience for that handset. 

New Business Models through Collaboration Across Networks

As a result of the alliance, announced at the GSMA Mobile Money Summit 2009
today, NeuStar and Visa are committing resources to support development of
commercially viable programs to support new application use cases. The
initiative is also designed to enable a more robust set of mobile payment
services by allowing Visa, financial institutions and mobile operators to
collaborate more closely and provide information-rich transactions that can make
mobile payment services more personalized, functional, and secure.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, June 25 (Reuters) - Hong Kong has reached a deal
with the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) to expand the local Disney
theme park, seen as necessary to bolster the park's long-term
prospects against a Shanghai rival, a newspaper reported on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The agreement is expected to be announced by June 30, with
details of the deal to be laid out to local legislators in a
special meeting, the Hong Kong Economic Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for the Commerce and Economic Development
Bureau, which oversees the Disneyland project, confirmed to
Reuters that a special meeting had been called, but disclosed
no specifics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report said the deal was expected to be worth HK$7
billion ($903.3 million) of which HK$4 billion would be used
for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The size of Hong Kong Disneyland, the smallest of Disney's
magic kingdoms, is expected to almost double, with construction
to begin within a year, pending approval from the city's
legislative council in July, the newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong's Financial Secretary John Tsang travelled to Los
Angeles in May, where he met senior Disney executives. The trip
is seen to have paved the way for the breakthrough after Disney
earlier said it would stall any expansion amid the credit
crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There was no immediate response from Tsang's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When contacted by Reuters, a Disney official in the United
States said discussions are ongoing, without giving any
specifics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) earlier indicated it would
likely invest more capital in Hong Kong Disneyland and allow
the Hong Kong government to convert its loans to equity to
maintain its majority share of the theme park, a source
involved in their talks told Reuters earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hong Kong government, which owns 57 percent of the
underperforming resort, desperately needs the expansion to
boost flagging attendance, with a much larger rival Disneyland
expected to be built in Shanghai in 2014 that could draw much
visitor traffic from the burgeoning mainland China market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At this stage, we have to support the expansion otherwise
it will be very difficult to compete with Shanghai in five to
six years time," said legislator Fred Li of the Democratic
Party, who said his party backed the expansion as long as
Disney boosted its financial transparency in future on
attendance figures.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The head of Microsoft Corp's $9 billion research unit thinks the debate over stopping climate change is being muddied by talk of renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts should be focused on stopping output of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas which helps heat the planet, rather than moving to a source that can be regenerated, said Craig Mundie, the man who replaced Bill Gates as the world's largest software maker's futurist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservation and radical technologies, including new nuclear, could be key, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you talk to the man on the street, there is a lot more awareness of the concept of renewable energy than there is about the need for a zero-carbon source," said Mundie, Microsoft Chief Research and Strategy Officer, in an interview on the sidelines of a major electricity conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even industry insiders were not looking hard enough at "the scarier or less understood technological approaches," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Congress is considering a massive climate bill and nations globally are preparing to negotiate a follow up to the Kyoto climate change treaty at the end of this year. Development of solar power, wind and other 'clean' energy sources are hot topics globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fastest way to cut carbon output is to cut use, Mundie offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first crucial step we have to take across the board is conservation," he said in the speech at the Edison Electric Institute after introducing software for consumers to monitor their own power use, called Hohm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He argued that humans will need energy alternatives that can be built in large arrays quickly to meet the demands of a growing, developing planet, and saw one such possibility as nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm probably more enchanted with the idea of these novel nuclear approaches than any other one technology. There's wind, there's solar, there's tides, there's geothermal, but I think each of these is going to be more challenging to harness at some very large scale," he said, stressing that he was not giving his company's official policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He referred in particular to research work on traveling-wave reactors, a technology that aims to use slow-burning reactions in waste fuel from current plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it would be a fascinating outcome if we woke up 10 years from now and said look, you can have all the nuclear you want, it doesn't have a weapons problem related to it, the cost of fuel is relatively low, there's no reprocessing requirements. It would be kind of a silver bullet for the energy problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Peter Henderson, Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - A Delaware bankruptcy judge
on Wednesday maintained control over a dispute between the
failed thrift Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK and JPMorgan
Chase  Co (JPM.N) over billions of dollars of deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Judge Mary Walrath also ruled that the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp, which is the receiver for Washington Mutual,
may intervene in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judge noted a public interest in how deposits are
disbursed, citing the FDIC's responsibilities under a federal
law passed in the wake of the 1980s savings and loan crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She rejected an argument by Washington Mutual lawyer
Michael Carlinsky that the FDIC no longer had an interest in
the case after selling the thrift's bank operations to
JPMorgan. He said allowing intervention could cause "months and
months and months of additional delay," hurting creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last Sept. 25, the FDIC seized the banking operations of
Seattle-based Washington Mutual and immediately sold them to
JPMorgan for $1.9 billion. The thrift's holding company filed
for bankruptcy protection the next day. Washington Mutual
remains by far the largest U.S. banking company to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The holding company subsequently filed separate lawsuits.
It sued the FDIC, contending that the $1.9 billion sale price
was too low, and seeking more than $13 billion of damages. It
also sued JPMorgan, claiming that the bank wrongfully withheld
more than $4 billion of cash from the bankruptcy estate, and
which it believes should be available for creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walrath concluded she has exclusive jurisdiction to decide
what belongs to the estate, and rejected requests to put two of
the adversary proceedings on hold or transfer the disputes to
the Washington, D.C., federal district court where Washington
Mutual sued the FDIC, the Associated Press said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main bankruptcy case is In re Washington Mutual Inc,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington), No.
08-12229. The lawsuit against the FDIC is Washington Mutual Inc
v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia, No. 09-00533.

&lt;p&gt;CANNES, France (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp, the world's largest software group, is still open to a partnership with search engine giant Yahoo Inc, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We remain open to a partnership with Yahoo," Ballmer told a seminar at the Cannes Lion 2009 advertising festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if a deal could be sealed in the next year, he said: "Who knows?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer did not give further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft offered to pay up to $47.5 billion for Yahoo early last year, but was rebuffed by Yahoo's former leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been talk of a partnership between Microsoft and Yahoo in recent months, but no deal has emerged. Microsoft is also trying to challenge Google Inc with its own new search engine called Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also gave a cautious view over the prospects for the world economy, which has been hit by the financial crisis that arose from bank losses on home loans and complex debt instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think we're in a recession," said Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't assume there is a recovery. I think we reset to a lower level and the world economy will grow again from this reset level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said he was not sure if a full recovery would occur in one year or in two years from now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he was worried about a pending European Union antitrust ruling about bundling browsers with operating systems, Ballmer replied: "We comply with EU law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Cyril Altmeyer; additional reporting by Dominique Vidalon; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   * IPO could bring up to $4.9 bln; Brazil's biggest-ever IPO

* Brokerages had released unapproved advertising material

* Brazil regulator says banning was appropriate response
 (Recasts first sentence, adds comments from Brazil securities
regulator)

 By Elzio Barreto and Alberto Alerigi Jr.

 SAO PAULO, June 24 (Reuters) - VisaNet, the Brazilian
affiliate of credit card network Visa Inc (V.N), said that 19
brokerages have been banned from participating in its massive
initial public offering because they had released unapproved
advertising material about the sale.

 VisaNet's IPO could bring 9.7 billion reais ($4.9 billion)
if underwriters exercise their option to sell additional shares
to meet demand. That would make it Brazil's largest ever and
among the biggest in the world the past year.

 Among the prohibited brokerages are Bradesco SA Corretora
and Agora Senior Corretora, both units of Brazil's
second-largest private-sector bank Bradesco (BBDC4.SA), as well
as ABN Amro Real and ICAP do Brasil.

 Bradesco BBI, the investment banking arm of Bradesco, is
the lead underwriter of the offering.

 Bradesco decided to ban several brokerages, including its
own, instead of risking the postponement of the massive stock
offering, according to an official at Brazil's securities
regulator, known as CVM.

 He said the regulator would not block the VisaNet IPO
because Bradesco made an appropriate decision by prohibiting
the brokerages from taking part.

 "From our point of view that was a suitable response," said
Felipe Claret da Mota, head of registrations at Brazil's CVM.

 "In a process where we see some irregularities, we could
suspend the offering. We see that Bradesco was able to stop the
problems."

 Four other brokerages had already been banned from the
offering because they released advertising material that
Brazilian securities regulators had not approved.

 Brazilian brokerage Ativa sent a statement to its clients,
saying their orders also had been canceled. The company said it
was recognized for "totally conforming to market rules and
regulations" and that it was looking into what happened.

 ICAP do Brasil, a unit of British inter-broker dealer ICAP
Plc (IAP.L), said it had not received an official statement
from the Brazilian securities regulator. Bradesco did not
return phone calls seeking comment.

 Shareholders of VisaNet VNET3.SA, whose formal name is
Cia Brasileira de Meios de Pagamento, plan to sell at least
477.67 million shares at 12 reais to 15 reais each.

 The company is controlled by Bradesco, with a 39 percent
stake; Banco do Brasil (BBAS3.SA), with 31 percent; and Spain's
Santander, with 14 percent. Visa Inc unit Visa International is
also part of the controlling group, with a 10 percent stake.

 Bradesco, Banco do Brasil, Visa Inc, Santander and the
Brazilian unit of HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) would be among the
VisaNet shareholders selling stock in the credit card
processing company and would receive proceeds from the sale.

How to Regularly Access Picks from the Zacks Rank Discovery for
Free:http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

Underlying the four free stock picks is a simple truth that first appeared in a
Financial Analysts Journal article published in 1979. Leonard Zacks, a Ph.D. in
Mathematics from M.I.T. found that "earnings estimate revisions are the most
powerful force impacting stock prices." Zacks #1 Rank is awarded to a stock when
analysts sharply upgrade their estimates of what the company will earn. 

Today, Zacks is promoting its stock recommendations by offering four daily picks
free to those who register at http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
LabCorp (NYSE: LH), Monogram Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: MGRM), Pfizer (NYSE:

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Monogram Acquired by LabCorp

LabCorp (NYSE: LH) and Monogram Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: MGRM) announced that
they have entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger under which
LabCorp will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Monogram in a cash tender
offer for $4.55 per share. 

The deal has an implied total equity value of approximately $106.7 million, or a
total enterprise value of approximately $155 million at March 31, 2009,
including net indebtedness. The closing of the acquisition is expected in the
third quarter of 2009. 

Monogram Biosciences, Inc. is a leading provider of companion diagnostics --
molecular diagnostic products that help guide and target appropriate treatments.
The company's focus is on infectious disease and oncology. Lead marketed
products include Trofile assay which identifies patients who are eligible for
the CCR5 class of HIV drugs, and is the widely-adopted companion diagnostic for
Pfizer's (NYSE: PFE) HIV drug Selzentry, PhenoSense and PhenoSense GT HIV tests,
which measure individual patient viral drug resistance, thereby enabling
physicians to design optimal, individualized treatment plans for each patient. 

PhenoSense and PhenoSense GT are among the most widely used HIV resistance tests
in the market today. Monogram's HIV tests are used routinely by physicians for
managing patient therapy and are an integral component of anti-HIV drug
development and clinical evaluations for the pharmaceutical industry. 

In the oncology front, Monogram's proprietary VeraTag technology has been used
to develop a sensitive means to assess HER-2 status in tissue samples and has
significant potential as a tool to help guide therapy decisions in breast cancer
patients. Based on the VeraTag platform, Monogram has multiple tests in
development for measuring a variety of protein markers that may have clinical
utility to help guide treatment decisions across a broad range of cancer drugs. 

More Deals Expected Following the Transaction

The transaction could have a significant impact for the whole molecular
diagnostics industry, in our view. The M activity has been very active in the
Pharma/Biotech industry for the last a couple of years. However, most of those
transactions have been focused on the area of therapeutics. 

Molecular diagnostics has enjoyed rapid growth in the past decade due to the
breakthrough in genomics and proteomics. Personalized medicine has played a
critical and important role to improve therapeutic agents and reduce whole
healthcare costs. Europe continues to outpace the US in the area of molecular
diagnostics. 

In the US, the diagnostic market is relatively fragmented with many small
players. Two relatively big players are LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:
DGX), which command a majority of the market shares. Small players like Monogram
and Myriad Genetics (Nasdaq: MYGN) are more focused on one or two areas in which
they have expertise.

&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan raises balance transfer fee to 5 pct from 3 pct&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Bank will raise fee from August&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N),
the second-largest U.S. bank, will raise the balance transfer
fee of some credit cards to up to 5 percent, one of the highest
rates in the industry, and ahead of tougher regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently, the balance transfer fee is 3 percent, in line
with most of JPMorgan's rivals. The change will be effective
from August, the company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A new credit card law, due to go into effect in February
2010, will restrict the ability of credit card issuers' to
raise interest rates on cardholders' existing balances, to
charge certain fees, and to impose penalties on consumers that
the government deemed unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks have said they would raise interest rates and fees,
and trim credit limits, before the law enters into effect, to
reprice their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit card companies enjoyed hefty gains in recent years
due to an explosion in credit, but now they are losing billions
as debt-burdened Americans lose their jobs and default on
credit card payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan -- the third largest credit card issuer by sales
volume -- lost $547 million in the first quarter at its credit
card unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank is the largest issuer of Visa branded credit cards
and the second largest issuer of MasterCard cards. Earlier this
month it reported that its charge-off rate rose to 8.36 percent
in May, one of the lowest in the industry.

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday morning, the world is sending tweets of dissatisfaction to Microsoft over Outlook 2010's poor display capabilities.  The Email Standards Project -- a group dedicated to improving Web standards support and accessibility in e-mail -- has started a grassroots Twitter campaign asking Microsoft to improve the way Outlook 2010 will render HTML-based e-mail.  Currently, Outlook 2010 is being tested in private beta.&lt;/p&gt;

If you include the fixoutlook URL, your Twitter profile picture will be displayed on the campaign Website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logic of the Campaign&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're an Outlook user, then you've probably noticed that any e-mail you receive containing images and other design elements looks completely different in Outlook than it does when you see it online or in another e-mail client. &#160; That's because Microsoft has, since the release of Office 2007, tied Outlook to Microsoft Word's HTML rendering engine instead of Internet Explorer's.  Microsoft says its primary reason for doing this was to let Outlook users take advantage of Microsoft Word's editing and formatting capabilities.  But that meant Outlook lost its capability to properly interpret e-mail messages based on HTML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be problematic, because many large and small businesses use design templates to send out newsletters, advertisements, bills, and other notices by e-mail.  Since these templates are based on the same design standards as a Web page, it would make sense to use a Web browser's rendering engine to display these messages -- something that Outlook did before Office 2007.  The result of not using IE's rendering engine is that any e-mail with background images, specifically placed headlines, or side panels doesn't look the way its designer intended when displayed in Outlook. Take a look at this picture comparing an HTML-based e-mail in Outlook 2000 and in Outlook 2010 to see the difference (click the image to enlarge it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's decision to tie Outlook to Word is very shortsighted, according to ESP, since Outlook 2007 has only a 7 percent market share among e-mail clients.  So while Microsoft Word's capabilities may augment the experience for Outlook-to-Outlook users, it handicaps anyone trying to open a Outlook-created e-mail with other e-mail clients like Mozilla's Thunderbird or Apple's Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlook 2010 Beta be Better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Office 2010 products, including Outlook, are currently in an invite-only beta testing phase.  Redmond often allows the general public to participate in its beta testing phase, but decided against this strategy for Office 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear how many people are testing Outlook, but when it announced Office 2010's beta phase, Microsoft said the test group would include thousands of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its smaller beta group, Microsoft may get more feedback about Outlook 2010 than it bargained for. At the time of this writing, ESP's Twitter campaign has registered well over 10,000 tweets and is growing fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2010 is slated to hit stores in the first six months of next year, and will come in 32- and 64-bit versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt; * Still open to partnership with Yahoo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Cautious about global economic prospects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds more CEO comments on world economy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Cyril Altmeyer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CANNES, France, June 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp
(MSFT.O), the world's largest software group, is still open to
a partnership with search engine giant Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O),
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We remain open to a partnership with Yahoo," Ballmer told
a seminar at the Cannes Lion 2009 advertising festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked if a deal could be sealed in the next year, he said:
"Who knows?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer did not give further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft offered to pay up to $47.5 billion for Yahoo
early last year, but was rebuffed by Yahoo's former
leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There has been talk of a partnership between Microsoft and
Yahoo in recent months, but no deal has emerged. Microsoft is
also trying to challenge Google Inc (GOOG.O) with its own new
search engine called Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer also gave a cautious view over the prospects for
the world economy, which has been hit by the financial crisis
that arose from bank losses on home loans and complex debt
instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think we're in a recession," said Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't assume there is a recovery. I think we reset to a
lower level and the world economy will grow again from this
reset level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said he was not sure if a full recovery would occur
in one year or in two years from now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked whether he was worried about a pending European Union
antitrust ruling about bundling browsers with operating
systems, Ballmer replied: "We comply with EU law."

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)will be recognized this evening by the Global
Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GBC) for its
longstanding commitment to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and
malaria around the world. Chevron will receive the GBC`s prestigious Richard C.
Holbrooke Award for Business Leadership in recognition of the company`s global
public health programs. 

The award recognizes Chevron`s leadership in delivering customized workplace and
community-based health education, awareness-building, prevention and treatment
programs across the company`s worldwide operations. Chevron`s global public
health programs continue to grow through the development of strategic
partnerships and sustainable programs in communities around the world. 

"These awards are given to an elite group of companies who set the standard for
excellence in business action to defeat disease," said GBC President and CEO
John Tedstrom. "They show what a business can do, and how to do it exceedingly
effectively. We need more businesses to take this kind of action. The fight
against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria cannot be won without the corporate
sector stepping up and playing an active role - and Chevron is doing exactly the
kind of thing that all companies can and should do. Chevron doesn`t just talk,
they take action. And their action saves lives." 

"Chevron believes that helping to eradicate HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria
is a clear example of how long-term business interests and commitment to
corporate responsibility are intrinsically linked," said Dr. Richard Wilkins,
Chevron`s general manager of Health and Medical Services. "With more than 62,000
employees and business operations around the world - including some of the most
severely affected by these health crises - responding to these epidemics is a
vitally important responsibility for our company." 

Chevron has been a leader in the fight for global health. In 2008, the company
became the first Corporate Champion of The Global Fund to Fights AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria - committing $30 million over three years to Global
Fund activities to help control and eradicate these diseases in Angola, Nigeria,
South Africa, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. Chevron also partnered
with Vestergaard Frandsen to manufacture special anti-malaria-treated curtains
for windows and doors for the company`s entire Angolan workforce. As a result of
the distribution of 90,000 treated curtains and other prevention and education
efforts, malaria cases among Chevron`s Angolan workforce dropped by more than 70
percent and the number of days away from work dropped from more than 1,000 to
fewer than 300. Additionally, among Chevron`s employees and dependents in Angola
there has not been a single case of a mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS
in more than two years. 

Chevron also partnered with North Star Foundation to establish an HIV/AIDS
Roadside Wellness Center at the heavily trafficked Oshoek border post between
Swaziland and South Africa. In 2008, the center provided HIV/AIDS prevention
education, distributed condoms, and offered basic medical tests and services to
4,500 drivers and the surrounding community. Chevron employees also have
demonstrated their support for company-sponsored HIV/AIDS programs by
contributing to Chevron`s AIDS quilts and participating in AIDS walks in San
Francisco, Houston, and Balikpapan, Indonesia. This year, Chevron reported that,
as of December 2008, more than 8,000 managers and 15,000 employees have
participated in the company`s global HIV/AIDS training program that provides
awareness and prevention training. Chevron also reported that awareness of the
company`s HIV/AIDS policy and prevention techniques increased from 55 percent to
77 percent. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;Latest Report Clears Path to Final Decision
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Evidence that two Chevron lawyers committed fraud in Ecuador apparently has
grown stronger with a new court-ordered report finding extensive levels of toxic
contamination at two oil well sites that the company claimed to have
"remediated" in the mid-1990s, representatives of indigenous and farmer
communities said today. 

The report was submitted this week to an Ecuador trial court in a high-profile
environmental lawsuit where Chevron faces a $27.3 billion liability for dumping
billions of gallons of toxic waste into the waterways of the Amazon rainforest
over an area roughly the size of Rhode Island. It covers information from the
final eight judicial inspections of 102 total performed in the case, clearing
the way for a decision in the coming months. 

The plaintiffs had charged that the eight inspections were requested by Chevron
earlier this year as part of an 11th-hour effort to further delay the end of the
trial. That move clearly backfired against Chevron with the results, which were
submitted by Dr. Marcela Munoz, a respected Ecuadorian scientist who was
appointed by the court but paid by Chevron for the work, said Pablo Fajardo, the
Ecuadorian lawyer who represents the communities in the class action case who
have pressed the lawsuit since 1993. 

"In this case, more inspections produces more evidence against Chevron," he
said. 

Chevron has reported it expects an "adverse" decision in the case and is
preparing for appeals, while representatives from the communities say they will
seek to enforce any judgment against the oil giant immediately in U.S. courts
based on evidence that Chevron has tried to corrupt the trial process and has
stated it will refuse to pay any judgment. 

The latest results likely will be used in a criminal fraud indictment pending in
Ecuador against two Chevron lawyers and seven former Ecuadorian government
officials for lying about the results of the purported remediation in the
mid-1990s in exchange for a release from government claims against the company,
said Fajardo. 

Chevron has attempted to use the remediation as a defense in the trial, but in
light of the evidence it has little or no value, said Fajardo. Chevron`s
continued use of the defense in the face of scientific evidence clearly exposing
the remediation as a sham calls into question the company`s credibility on all
aspects of the trial, he added. 

"Not only does the remediation fail as a defense at trial, it has backfired into
a criminal indictment against Chevron lawyers who orchestrated a fake clean-up
with the apparent help of corrupt Ecuadorian government officials," Fajardo
said. 

The so-called remediation, performed by Texaco between 1995 and 1998, consisted
largely of dumping dirt over a small portion of the 916 unlined pools of toxic
waste to hide them from local residents, said Fajardo. All 45 of the
"remediated" sites previously inspected during the trial showed extensive and
illegal levels of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs), some thousands of times
higher than Ecuadorian norms, according to a damages assessment produced in
April 2008 by a team of court-appointed experts. 

Of the final eight inspections, two were of well sites that Texaco claimed to
have "remediated" in the mid 1990s. Both of the sites - Auca 17 and Auca 19 -
contained levels of TPHs in the soil and water at levels several times higher
than the maximum allowed by Ecuadorian law. 

For example, Auca 19 had TPHs at 5,710 ppm, or more than five times the maximum
tolerance allowed under Ecuadorian law. Auca 17 reported TPHs at 1,580 ppm, or
more than 50% higher than the norm. Chevron had certified both sites as
"remediated" to Ecuador`s government in the mid-1990s as part of its clean-up
plan. 

Results from three other sites inspected - Yulebra, Yuca Central, and Auca
Central - also reported soil contamination several times higher than Ecuadorian
norms, according to reports submitted by Dr. Munoz. (No samples were tested for
hydrocarbons at three of the eight sites because the parties did not request
them.) 

The results are consistent with the damages assessment from April 2008, which
found that 100% of the 94 Chevron well sites previously inspected during the
trial were extensively contaminated with cancer-causing toxins, some at rates
hundreds of times higher than permitted by Ecuadorian law. 

The earlier damages report found the oil giant might be liable for up to $27.3
billion in damages for polluting the soils with the unlined waste pits and
systematically dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways
while Texaco (now Chevron) was the sole operator of an oil concession from 1964
to 1990. Experts have dubbed the disaster the "Amazon Chernobyl" and said a
clean-up would involve the largest decontamination effort in history. 

Chevron`s top lawyer in Ecuador, Rodrigo Perez Pallares, signed checks to Dr.
Munoz totaling more than $20,000 for his work in preparing the reports on the
final eight sites. This is significant because Chevron has tried to claim that
similar checks signed by the plaintiffs to other experts in the case prove undue
influence, when in fact they were ordered by the judge consistent with Ecuador
court rules -- as were Chevron`s payments to Munoz. 

Perez Pallares is one of two Chevron lawyers under indictment in Ecuador. The
other is Ricardo Reis Veiga, who is Chevron`s associate general counsel for
Latin America litigation. 

The case was transferred to Ecuador from U.S. federal court in 2002 at Chevron`s
request. As a condition of the transfer, Chevron agreed to submit to
jurisdiction in Ecuador and be bound by any ruling there. The trial in Ecuador
began in 2003.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - The Texas Department of

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Wednesday unveiled its Hohm website designed to help residential power consumers save money and reduce their environmental impact by conserving energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been selling technology to the energy industry for years and is now targeting the home power market as the weak economy forces consumers to find ways to save money and the government prepares to mandate the use of renewables and energy efficiency to curb carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Conservation is the cheapest source of energy," Troy Batterberry, product manager for Hohm, told Reuters. If consumers use less power, he said, utilities will not need to build as many new polluting power plants. Everyone saves money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hohm uses complicated algorithms to analyze information provided by consumers and participating utilities to help them better understand their power usage, get recommendations and save money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those recommendations can include replacement of a thermostat, purchase of a new refrigerator and, maybe in the future, the installation of solar panels on the roof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batterberry estimated consumers could save about 5 percent to 10 percent on their energy bills, depending on how many recommendations they follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Hohm is available for free to all 120 million households in the United States, whether their utility is a partner or not. Microsoft is partnering with utilities and meter vendors to capture information about consumer power use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Inc this year rolled out a similar program called PowerMeter, which is available to a limited group of customers served by partner utilities. Google plans to expand PowerMeter this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said all meter providers, technology companies and consulting firms could be both partners and/or the competition for Hohm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKING MONEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, Microsoft expects there to be potential to make money through advertising. If Hohm recommends a furnace upgrade, the site could provide a link to furnace vendors. The vendors would pay Microsoft for the ad or referral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, Microsoft hopes Hohm will make money as a scalable demand-side management tool. Demand-side management programs pay consumers to reduce power use, especially during grid emergencies and times of very high demand, like summer heat waves when air conditioning usage stretches generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand-side management can also help utilities meet renewable and efficiency goals by offsetting the intermittent nature of renewables by reducing consumption when the wind stops blowing or the sun is not shining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get started with Hohm, users input household information over a secure website -- www.microsoft-hohm.com -- or, if their utility is a partner, they can upload their energy usage data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has partnered with Xcel Energy Inc, Puget Sound Energy, Seattle City Light and Sacramento Municipal Utility District, and plans to name more partners soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more information the homeowner provides the more relevant the recommendations will be. As a default, Hohm will base recommendations on local and national averages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been working on Hohm, code named Niagara, for about two years. The company did not disclose how much it spent on Hohm or how much it expects to make from the venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In about six to nine months after receiving feedback from users and refining and improving the application, Jon Arnold, managing director of Microsoft's Worldwide Power and Utilities Industry, told Reuters, Hohm should exit the Beta version. Ultimately, Microsoft wants Hohm to go international.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Walter Bagley)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers Benefit from Wide Variety of PHP Applications and the Productivity,
Performance, and Low Cost of Ownership of Zend Solution for PHP


CUPERTINO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Zend Technologies, Inc., the PHP company, today announced that IBM will ship
Zend`s solution for PHP in every IBM Smart Business system in order to provide
their customers with reliability, performance, and security for PHP-based Web
applications. Today`s announcement marks a significant expansion of the IBM and
Zend partnership by now including PHP on Linux operating systems and x86
hardware in addition to IBM i OS and Power Systems hardware. 

Software vendors participating in IBM`s Smart Business market are providing
turnkey PHP web applications and will benefit from the high performance and
automatic updates available with Zend`s web application solution. 

Turnkey PHP applications simplify business owner`s IT needs. Zend`s offering
includes PHP in a standardized form that is automatically updated via IBM`s
integrated support software for applications that are designed for IBM Smart
Business systems. This means a business owner`s IBM Smart Business system gets a
complete, certified PHP stack with automated software updates and security
patches. Zend supports the most popular databases, including DB2, as well as
broadly used operating systems, including Linux and IBM i. 

"Zend plays a key role in IBM`s Smart Business strategy to bring the breadth of
the vast PHP ecosystem to small and medium businesses. With Zend we`re able to
provide an integrated, reliable, and high performing business solution that
leverages popular PHP applications like CRM, HR management, ERP, supply chain
management, and other SMB solutions," said Juhi Jotwani, Vice President, IBM
Smart Business. "IBM Smart Business is about a radically simple new way to
acquire, use and manage IT." 

"With the entire IBM Smart Business program now shipping with Zend, a much
broader segment of the business community benefits from PHP`s reliability,
security, and high performance with our web application environment," said Andi
Gutmans, chief executive officer at Zend Technologies. "What`s really compelling
about today`s announcement is that ISVs and business owners participating in the
IBM Smart Business program can unlock the power of the wide, open market for PHP
applications by deploying them on our platform." 

Zend has begun working with independent software vendors (ISVs) who are
delivering one-stop PHP-based solutions for IBM`s Smart Business program,
including vendors such as OpenPro, OrangeHRM, WebConcepts, and vTiger.
WebConcepts offers a sophisticated retail inventory planning solution to their
customers that is built with PHP. 

"It only took 4 clicks on the Smart Business system to install everything, the
DB2 database, customizations, restore definitions, the application code...
everything! All of this took the skills of multiple people in the past and this
is now the simplest, most painless experience I have ever had with IT. I never
thought I would say that 'IT stuff' was fun, but this is simply amazing," said
Ray Young, chief executive officer at WebConcepts, a PHP-based ISV. 

"There is truly huge business value to our company as a provider," Young
explained. "With Zend on Smart Business, we are able to eliminate almost all
on-site cost. These resources can now be deployed on other tasks and our
business customers benefit from a much lower cost of deployment." 

"The benefits of Smart Market and Smart Business are that they allow WebConcepts
to reach businesses and markets that in the past we could not reach with our PHP
applications and deliver them quickly and easily, both for us and for our
end-customers." 

About Zend Technologies

Zend Technologies, Inc., the PHP Company, is the leading provider of products
and services for developing, deploying, and managing business-critical PHP
applications. PHP is used by more than 20 million web sites and has quickly

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Finishes Job Google Started, Giving Marketamerica.com State of the Art
Product Search
GREENSBORO, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Market America, an Internet Marketing and Product Brokerage company that
specializes in One-to-One Marketing announced today it has successfully
implemented Microsoft`s FAST ESP for the search of over 35 million SKUs (stock
keeping units - or references to specific products available from suppliers) on
marketamerica.com after Google was unable to fulfill Market America`s search
needs. 

"Microsoft stepped up to the plate and provided a solution that not only worked,
but offered so much more in search functionality than we have seen in the past,"
said James Ridinger, president and CEO of Market America. "FAST ESP allows
customers on marketamerica.com to search millions upon millions of SKUs and get
results in sub second response times. Microsoft realizes that people don`t want
to search for products, they want to find them. This is directly in line with
our philosophy of matching products with people." 

"Market America has an established reputation for bringing a high level of
service and functionality to their customers," said Bjorn Olstad, Microsoft
Distinguished Engineer and CTO of FAST, A Microsoft Subsidiary. "Through FAST,
we`re excited to help also bring strategic value to Market America`s business,
making it easier than ever for Market America customers to find the products
they`re looking for." 

Another crucial element in implementing FAST ESP on marketamerica.com is the
ability for consumers to comparison shop based on price, color, size, etc. "With
today`s consumer being more price conscious than ever, it was critical for us to
find a search partner who could provide our customers with the ability to search
tens of millions of SKUs, including over 2,000 Market America branded products
and those from over 2,500 partner stores to find the best deal and to do it
quickly," said Ridinger. "The implementation of Microsoft search technology
allows us to reach our goal of being the ultimate online shopping destination by
providing an endless shopping experience where the customer can fulfill all
their online needs at one URL." 

With the implementation of FAST and a number of new market-driven products and
partner stores being added to marketamerica.com daily, Market America plans to
increase the number of searchable SKUs to 50 million within the next several
months.

&lt;p&gt;CANNES, France (Reuters) - Mobile phone advertising will account for 5-10 percent of global media ad spending within five years, a leading Microsoft executive said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Five years from now mobile will be 5-10 percent of media spend but it won't happen all at once, it will happen gradually," Scott Howe, corporate vice president of the advertiser and publisher solutions group at Microsoft, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howe added that advertising would also be driven by demand from retailers and emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software group, recently launched its Bing search engine in a bid to counter the dominance of Google in the lucrative Internet search sector and its related advertising market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key feature of Bing is that users search with only one click, making it more mobile phone user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howe did not give details on market share targets for Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as we continue to make progress we will get where we want to be," he said at the Cannes Lions 2009 advertising festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing has been winning market share from rivals, according to industry data released earlier this month, but still trails market leader Google by a long way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new search engine grabbed 12.1 percent of U.S. Internet searches for the June 8-12 week, up from 11.3 percent in June 1-5 but behind Google's 65 percent of U.S. searches in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SECTOR SET FOR RAPID GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more consumers embrace new technologies and devices such as smart phones, personified by Apple's iPhone, mobile advertising is projected to grow at an annual average of 45 percent to reach $28.8 billion within 5 years from a current $3.1 billion or 0.6 percent of spending, according to Ineum Consulting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of third-generation mobile phones has led to better connection speeds and a rise of mobile Internet browsing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mobile phone advertising is going to be one of the fastest growing segments this year because it is growing out of a small base. The question is when does it really hit mainstream? That's probably still a year or more away," Howe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest bottleneck is going to be having enough case studies where major advertisers have done something really interesting in the mobile space," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile advertising could in the meantime attract interest from a niche of advertisers, such as small "mom and pop" local retailers which did not routinely embrace the mainstream online advertising, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These advertisers could decided to shift their ad budgets away from local newspapers to mobiles for local highly-targeted campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging economies such as Latin America and Africa, where people were likely to own a mobile phone before a wired PC, also looked promising, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by James Regan and David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategische Allianz erm&#246;glicht Zusammenarbeit zwischen Mobilfunkbetreibern,
Finanzinstituten und Visa und beschleunigt Entwicklung mobiler
Finanzdienstleistungen
BARCELONA, Spanien--(Business Wire)--
Die Unternehmen Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), Betreiber des weltweit gr&#246;&#223;ten Netzwerks
f&#252;r elektronische Zahlungen im Einzelhandel1, und NeuStar (NYSE: NSR), ein
Anbieter von zuverl&#228;ssigen Interconnection-Diensten f&#252;r viele der weltweit
f&#252;hrenden Mobilfunkbetreiber, haben heute eine strategische Allianz zwecks
Beschleunigung der weltweiten Einf&#252;hrung von mobilen Finanzdienstleistungen
bekannt gegeben. 

Die in ihren jeweiligen Branchen f&#252;hrenden Unternehmen verf&#252;gen &#252;ber viel
Erfahrung in den Bereichen komplexer, zuverl&#228;ssiger Transaktionen sowie
Sicherheit und globaler Interoperabilit&#228;t. Dadurch wurde auch das Wachstum im
elektronischen Zahlungsverkehr und im Mobilfunk erm&#246;glicht - zwei Branchen, die
nun auf neuen Ebenen zusammenspannen m&#252;ssen. Durch die Allianz werden die
Zuverl&#228;ssigkeit, Reichweite und Sicherheit des globalen Zahlungsnetzwerks von
Visa mit der Infrastruktur der Carrier-Klasse von NeuStar verbunden, welche
globalen Netzbetreibern und ihren Partnerunternehmen kritische
Interconnection-Dienste f&#252;r eine reibungslose Bereitstellung von
Mobilfunkdienstleistungen an Verbraucher auf der ganzen Welt bietet. 

&#8222;Die Allianz zwischen Visa und NeuStar bietet Visa eine Verbindung zu
Mobilfunkanbietern rund um die Welt und unterst&#252;tzt die globale Strategie von
Visa zur Ausdehnung von Produkten und Dienstleistungen auf den
Mobiltelefonbereich", sagte Elizabeth Buse, Leiterin Produkte bei Visa Inc.
&#8222;Diese Initiative hat das Potenzial, die Bereitstellung von mobilen
Finanzdienstleistungen sowohl in Industrie- als auch in Schwellenl&#228;ndern zu
beschleunigen. Zu diesen Dienstleistungen geh&#246;ren der mobile Zahlungsverkehr,
das Aufladen von Prepaid-Guthaben &#252;ber mobile Netze, Geld&#252;berweisungen,
Mehrwertdienste wie Benachrichtigungen und Spezialangebote sowie die Annahme von
elektronischen Zahlungen &#252;ber mobile Netze." 

NeuStar fungiert als neutraler Mittler und erleichtert den sicheren und
zuverl&#228;ssigen Datentransfer zwischen Mobilfunkbetreibern und anderen beteiligten
Parteien bei der Bereitstellung von Mobilfunkdiensten f&#252;r Verbraucher. Mit der
Bereitstellung einer Anlaufstelle f&#252;r alle Dienste bietet NeuStar einen Mehrwert
und vereinfacht die Verbindung zwischen Mobilfunkbetreibern und ihren
Partnerunternehmen, wodurch den Abonnenten auch neue Dienstleistungen einfacher
angeboten werden k&#246;nnen. NeuStar betreibt zudem den PathFinder-Dienst der GSMA,
&#252;ber den ein gemeinsamer globaler Adressierungs- und
Service-Discovery-Mechanismus f&#252;r herk&#246;mmliche Kommunikationsdienste
bereitgestellt wird und der auch auf neu aufkommende Dienstleistungen wie
Geld&#252;berweisungen &#252;ber mobile Netze erweitert werden kann. PathFinder bietet
auch eine entscheidende grundlegende Voraussetzung f&#252;r die Zusammenarbeit
zwischen Telefongesellschaften und ihren ausgew&#228;hlten Handelspartnern, zu denen
etwa andere Telefongesellschaften, aber auch Anbieter von Finanzdienstleistungen
wie Visa geh&#246;ren. 

&#8222;NeuStar, Visa und unsere Mobilfunkpartner sind vertrauensw&#252;rdige Marken - Visa
im Zahlungsverkehr, NeuStar im Datenaustausch zwischen Netzwerken und die
Betreiber im Mobilfunkbereich", sagte Steve Edwards, Senior Vice President der
Abteilung Converged Addressing Services bei NeuStar. &#8222;Durch diese Zusammenarbeit
k&#246;nnen Mobilfunkbetreiber, Finanzinstitute, Visa und Verbraucher rasch in den
Bereich des mobilen Zahlungsverkehrs vordringen und von den spannenden
zuk&#252;nftigen M&#246;glichkeiten profitieren. Wir freuen uns auf die Zusammenarbeit mit
Visa, Finanzinstituten und Mobilfunkbetreibern bei der Entwicklung von bew&#228;hrten
Verfahren und Anwendungen f&#252;r mobile Finanzdienstleistungen." 

Vorteile und Anwendungsbereiche

Die Initiative von Visa und NeuStar wird interessierten Kreisen aus Mobilfunk
und Finanzdienstleistungen auf der ganzen Welt zahlreiche Vorteile bringen:

* Bereitstellung neuer Kan&#228;le, durch die institutionelle Kunden von Visa im
Finanzbereich ihren Kunden &#252;berall und jederzeit mobile Finanzdienstleistungen
anbieten k&#246;nnen; 
* Einrichtung neuer Einkommensquellen mit dem Angebot neuer
Finanzdienstleistungen wie Benachrichtigungen und Spezialangebote im
Zusammenhang mit mobilen Transaktionen; 
* M&#246;glichkeit zum Angebot von mobilen Finanzdienstleistungen an Verbraucher in
Gegenden mit geringer Durchdringung an Zahlungsprodukten und
Finanzdienstleistungen - diese Dienstleistungen k&#246;nnten etwa das Bezahlen von
Rechnungen, das Aufladen von Telefonguthaben sowie das &#220;berweisen von Geld &#252;ber
mobile Netze umfassen; 
* K&#252;rzere Vorlaufzeit f&#252;r mobile Finanzdienstleistungen durch die Bereitstellung
standardisierter und skalierbarer Infrastruktur und bew&#228;hrter Verfahren f&#252;r
mobile Zahlungsanwendungen.

Mobilfunkbetreiber werden nun beispielsweise die Gelegenheit haben, ihre Daten
mit den Informationen des Finanzinstituts eines Kunden abzugleichen und &#252;ber die
mobilen Dienstleistungen von Visa individuellere und passendere Angebote an das
Mobiltelefon des Abonnenten zu versenden. Dies birgt das Potenzial f&#252;r h&#246;here
Antwortquoten der Abonnenten auf Angebote und erh&#246;ht gleichzeitig die
Nachrichtenrelevanz. 

Die Zusammenarbeit wird auch das &#220;berweisen von Geld &#252;ber das Visa-Netzwerk auf
mobile Konten erm&#246;glichen. &#220;ber das Visa-Netzwerk k&#246;nnte beispielsweise Geld auf
das Konto eines Mobiltelefonnutzers &#252;berwiesen werden, mit dem der Empf&#228;nger
sein Prepaid-Guthaben aufladen oder in Anspruch genommene Mobilfunkdienste
bezahlen kann. Der Empf&#228;nger kann dieses Geld aber auch mit einer Prepaidkarte
von Visa nutzen oder am n&#228;chsten Geldautomaten abheben. 

Die Verbindung der Technologien von Visa und NeuStar k&#246;nnte es auch m&#246;glich
machen, dass Betreiber sachdienliche Informationen zu den Funktionen eines
Mobiltelefons bieten k&#246;nnen. Visa w&#228;re so in der Lage, die Marke, das Modell,
die Bildschirmgr&#246;&#223;e, den Browsertyp und die Multimediaf&#228;higkeiten eines Telefons
zu erkennen und dem Benutzer genau auf sein Ger&#228;t abgestimmte Erlebnisse zu
erm&#246;glichen. 

Neue Gesch&#228;ftsmodelle dank Zusammenarbeit &#252;ber Netzwerke hinweg

Als Folge der heute am GSMA Mobile Money Summit 2009 bekannt gegebenen Allianz
stellen NeuStar und Visa Mittel zur Unterst&#252;tzung der Entwicklung kommerziell
brauchbarer Programme f&#252;r neue Anwendungsf&#228;lle bereit. Die Initiative soll auch
solidere mobile Zahlungsdienste erm&#246;glichen, indem Visa, Finanzinstitute und
Mobilfunkbetreiber enger zusammenarbeiten und informationsreiche Transaktionen
t&#228;tigen, durch die mobile Zahlungsdienste individueller, funktioneller und
sicherer gemacht werden k&#246;nnen. 

&#220;ber NeuStar

NeuStar (NYSE: NSR) bietet marktf&#252;hrende und innovative Dienstleistungen f&#252;r
zuverl&#228;ssige und gesicherte Kommunikation &#252;ber weltweite Netzwerke, Anwendungen

&lt;p&gt;L`alleanza strategica permette la collaborazione tra operatori di reti mobili,
istituti finanziari e Visa ed accelera l`offerta di servizi finanziari mobili
BARCELLONA, Spagna--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE : V), la rete pi&#249; grande del mondo per pagamenti elettronici per
transazioni al dettaglio1, e NeuStar (NYSE : NSR), fornitore di fiducia di
servizi d`interconnessione destinati a molti dei maggiori operatori di reti
wireless a livello globale, hanno annunciato oggi di aver stretto un`alleanza
strategica intesa ad accelerare l`adozione dei servizi finanziari mobili in
tutto il mondo. 

Visa e NeuStar, due imprese leader nei rispettivi settori, godono entrambe di
un`ottima reputazione quanto ad abilitazione di transazioni fidate di natura
complessa e ad offerta della sicurezza e dell`interoperabilit&#224; globale che hanno
permesso la crescita dei settori dei pagamenti elettronici e delle
telecomunicazioni mobili, due settori che devono ora collaborare in modi
inediti. Questa alleanza abbina l`affidabilit&#224;, la portata e la sicurezza della
rete globale per pagamenti di Visa all`infrastruttura di grado carrier di
NeuStar che fornisce servizi d`interconnessione essenziali agli operatori di
reti globali e ai loro partner rendendo possibile l`offerta fluida di servizi
mobili ai consumatori in tutto il mondo. 

"L`alleanza tra Visa e NeuStar dota Visa di un singolo punto di collegamento
agli operatori di reti mobili in tutto il mondo e promuove la strategia globale
perseguita da Visa di estensione dei propri servizi e prodotti al canale mobile"
ha dichiarato Elizabeth Buse, responsabile di prodotto presso Visa Inc. "Questa
iniziativa pu&#242; potenzialmente accelerare l`offerta di servizi finanziari mobili
sia nelle economie sviluppate che nelle economie emergenti. Rientrano nei
suddetti servizi: pagamenti mobili, pagamenti complementari wireless di conti
prepagati, trasferimenti di denaro, servizi a valore aggiunto quali avvisi e
offerte promozionali e accettazione mobile di pagamenti elettronici." 

NeuStar funge da intermediario neutrale per l`agevolazione di trasferimenti di
dati sicuri ed affidabili tra operatori mobili e altre parti collaboranti
nell`offerta di servizi mobili ai consumatori. NeuStar aggiunge valore per mezzo
dell`offerta di un singolo punto di contatto per tutti i servizi, semplificando
in tal modo la connessione tra gli operatori mobili e i relativi partner e
l`offerta da parte di quest`ultimi di nuovi servizi ai propri utenti. NeuStar
gestisce inoltre il servizio di GSMA PathFinder, che fornisce un meccanismo
comune globale per l`indirizzamento e il reperimento di servizi per i
tradizionali servizi di comunicazione e che pu&#242; essere esteso ai servizi
emergenti quali quelli per il trasferimento mobile di denaro. PathFinder svolge
inoltre un ruolo chiave rispetto alla collaborazione tra gli operatori ed i
rispettivi partner commerciali preferenziali, tra cui altri operatori e
fornitori di servizi finanziari, come Visa. 

"NeuStar, Visa e gli operatori nostri partner rappresentano dei marchi fidati:
Visa nel settore dei pagamenti, NeuStar in quello dello scambi di dati di rete e
gli operatori in quello delle comunicazioni mobili" ha affermato Steve Edwards,
Vicepresidente Senior della divisione Servizi di indirizzamento convergenti
presso NeuStar. "Questa collaborazione permette agli operatori di rete, agli
istituti finanziari, a Visa e ai consumatori di muoversi rapidamente nel mondo
dei pagamenti mobili e di approfittare delle nuove ed entusiasmanti opportunit&#224;
che si profilano all`orizzonte. Siamo ansiosi di collaborare con Visa, istituti
finanziari e operatori di reti mobili allo sviluppo delle migliori pratiche e
applicazioni per i servizi finanziari mobili." 

Vantaggi e applicazioni

L'iniziativa congiunta di Visa e NeuStar apporter&#224; un'infinit&#224; di vantaggi agli
utenti e ai fornitori di servizi finanziari mobili a livello globale tramite:

* l`abilitazione di nuovi canali attraverso i quali gli istituti finanziari
clienti di Visa potranno raggiungere i propri clienti ovunque e in qualsiasi
momento essi siano pronti ad avvalersi di servizi finanziari mobili 
* la creazione di nuovi flussi di reddito per mezzo dell`offerta di una nuova
suite di servizi finanziari quali offerte promozionali e avvisi relativi a
transazioni mobili 
* rendendo possibile l`offerta di servizi finanziari mobili a consumatori
residenti in regioni con una penetrazione ridotta di prodotti per pagamenti e
servizi finanziari. Detti servizi possono includere pagamenti remoti mobili per
servizi quali il pagamento di bollette e pagamenti complementari per servizi di
comunicazione wireless al minuto e trasferimenti mobili di denaro 
* accelerando i tempi di commercializzazione dei servizi finanziari mobili
tramite un`infrastruttura standardizzata e scalabile e l`adozione delle migliori
pratiche per le applicazioni per pagamenti mobili

Gli operatori mobili potranno ora, per esempio, integrare i propri dati con le
informazioni fornite dall`istituto finanziario del cliente per la messa a punto
di offerte maggiormente personalizzate e pertinenti trasmesse dai servizi mobili
di Visa al dispositivo mobile dell'utente. Ci&#242; pu&#242; potenzialmente indurre un
aumento dei tassi di risposta degli utenti alle offerte accrescendo al tempo
stesso la pertinenza dei messaggi. 

La collaborazione permetter&#224; inoltre di effettuare trasferimenti di denaro da
conti Visa a conti mobili tramite la rete Visa. A titolo esemplificativo, la
rete Visa pu&#242; inviare fondi al conto mobile di un utente permettendo al
beneficiario di usare i fondi depositati per l'effettuazione di pagamenti
complementari per servizi di comunicazione wireless al minuto o per il pagamento
di bollette per servizi wireless. Il beneficiario pu&#242; inoltre accedere a detti
fondi tramite una carta Visa prepagata o un prelievo da uno sportello bancomat
nei dintorni. 

Il sodalizio tra Visa e la tecnologia di NeuStar potrebbe inoltre permettere
agli operatori di offrire dati rilevanti in merito alle caratteristiche del
cellulare usato. Visa potrebbe quindi rilevare la marca, il modello, le
dimensioni dello schermo, il tipo di browser e le funzionalit&#224; multimediatiche
del cellulare in uso per poi personalizzare in maniera intelligente l`esperienza
dell`utente in base alle caratteristiche del cellulare. 

Dalla collaborazione tra reti scaturiscono nuovi modelli commerciali

In considerazione di questa alleanza, che &#232; stata annunciata quest`oggi durante
il vertice `GSMA Mobile Money Summit` del 2009, NeuStar e Visa stanno destinando
risorse allo sviluppo di programmi robusti sotto il profilo commerciale volti a
promuovere nuove destinazioni d`uso per le applicazioni. L`iniziativa &#232; inoltre
volta ad abilitare una serie pi&#249; solida di servizi per pagamenti mobili
permettendo a Visa, agli istituti finanziari e agli operatori mobili di
collaborare pi&#249; strettamente e offrire transazioni ricche di informazioni per
rendere i servizi per pagamenti mobili pi&#249; personalizzati, funzionali e sicuri.

two other categories for their solutions and services in systems
management and collaboration:

    Advanced Infrastructure Solutions, Systems Management Partner of the Year

    For this category, the companies were recognized as finalists for their
next-generation data center solution, a dynamic infrastructure solution
based on the Microsoft platform that optimizes data-center operations. The
next-generation data center solution offers innovative tools,
methodologies and accelerators that extend the capabilities of Microsoft

    Information Worker Solutions, Portals and Collaboration Partner of the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on
Wednesday unveiled its Hohm website designed to help
residential power consumers save money and reduce their
environmental impact by conserving energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has been selling technology to the energy
industry for years and is now targeting the home power market
as the weak economy forces consumers to find ways to save money
and the government prepares to mandate the use of renewables
and energy efficiency to curb carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Conservation is the cheapest source of energy," Troy
Batterberry, product manager for Hohm, told Reuters. If
consumers use less power, he said, utilities will not need to
build as many new polluting power plants. Everyone saves
money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hohm uses complicated algorithms to analyze information
provided by consumers and participating utilities to help them
better understand their power usage, get recommendations and
save money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those recommendations can include replacement of a
thermostat, purchase of a new refrigerator and, maybe in the
future, the installation of solar panels on the roof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Batterberry estimated consumers could save about 5 percent
to 10 percent on their energy bills, depending on how many
recommendations they follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Hohm is available for free to all 120 million
households in the United States, whether their utility is a
partner or not. Microsoft is partnering with utilities and
meter vendors to capture information about consumer power use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google Inc (GOOG.O) this year rolled out a similar program
called PowerMeter, which is available to a limited group of
customers served by partner utilities. Google plans to expand
PowerMeter this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said all meter providers, technology companies
and consulting firms could be both partners and/or the
competition for Hohm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MAKING MONEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the short term, Microsoft expects there to be potential
to make money through advertising. If Hohm recommends a furnace
upgrade, the site could provide a link to furnace vendors. The
vendors would pay Microsoft for the ad or referral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the future, Microsoft hopes Hohm will make money as a
scalable demand-side management tool. Demand-side management
programs pay consumers to reduce power use, especially during
grid emergencies and times of very high demand, like summer
heat waves when air conditioning usage stretches generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demand-side management can also help utilities meet
renewable and efficiency goals by offsetting the intermittent
nature of renewables by reducing consumption when the wind
stops blowing or the sun is not shining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To get started with Hohm, users input household information
over a secure website -- www.microsoft-hohm.com -- or, if their
utility is a partner, they can upload their energy usage data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has partnered with Xcel Energy Inc (XEL.N), Puget
Sound Energy, Seattle City Light and Sacramento Municipal
Utility District, and plans to name more partners soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The more information the homeowner provides the more
relevant the recommendations will be. As a default, Hohm will
base recommendations on local and national averages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has been working on Hohm, code named Niagara, for
about two years. The company did not disclose how much it spent
on Hohm or how much it expects to make from the venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In about six to nine months after receiving feedback from
users and refining and improving the application, Jon Arnold,
managing director of Microsoft's Worldwide Power and Utilities
Industry, told Reuters, Hohm should exit the Beta version.
Ultimately, Microsoft wants Hohm to go international.

&lt;p&gt;L`alleanza strategica permette la collaborazione tra operatori di reti mobili,
istituti finanziari e Visa ed accelera l`offerta di servizi finanziari mobili
BARCELLONA, Spagna--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE : V), la rete pi&#249; grande del mondo per pagamenti elettronici per
transazioni al dettaglio1, e NeuStar (NYSE : NSR), fornitore di fiducia di
servizi d`interconnessione destinati a molti dei maggiori operatori di reti
wireless a livello globale, hanno annunciato oggi di aver stretto un`alleanza
strategica intesa ad accelerare l`adozione dei servizi finanziari mobili in
tutto il mondo. 

Visa e NeuStar, due imprese leader nei rispettivi settori, godono entrambe di
un`ottima reputazione quanto ad abilitazione di transazioni fidate di natura
complessa e ad offerta della sicurezza e dell`interoperabilit&#224; globale che hanno
permesso la crescita dei settori dei pagamenti elettronici e delle
telecomunicazioni mobili, due settori che devono ora collaborare in modi
inediti. Questa alleanza abbina l`affidabilit&#224;, la portata e la sicurezza della
rete globale per pagamenti di Visa all`infrastruttura di grado carrier di

agli operatori di reti mobili in tutto il mondo e promuove la strategia globale
perseguita da Visa di estensione dei propri servizi e prodotti al canale mobile"
ha dichiarato Elizabeth Buse, responsabile di prodotto presso Visa Inc. "Questa
iniziativa pu&#242; potenzialmente accelerare l`offerta di servizi finanziari mobili
sia nelle economie sviluppate che nelle economie emergenti. Rientrano nei
suddetti servizi: pagamenti mobili, pagamenti complementari wireless di conti
prepagati, trasferimenti di denaro, servizi a valore aggiunto quali avvisi e
offerte promozionali e accettazione mobile di pagamenti elettronici." 

NeuStar funge da intermediario neutrale per l`agevolazione di trasferimenti di
dati sicuri ed affidabili tra operatori mobili e altre parti collaboranti
nell`offerta di servizi mobili ai consumatori. NeuStar aggiunge valore per mezzo
dell`offerta di un singolo punto di contatto per tutti i servizi, semplificando
in tal modo la connessione tra gli operatori mobili e i relativi partner e
l`offerta da parte di quest`ultimi di nuovi servizi ai propri utenti. NeuStar
gestisce inoltre il servizio di GSMA PathFinder, che fornisce un meccanismo
comune globale per l`indirizzamento e il reperimento di servizi per i
tradizionali servizi di comunicazione e che pu&#242; essere esteso ai servizi
emergenti quali quelli per il trasferimento mobile di denaro. PathFinder svolge
inoltre un ruolo chiave rispetto alla collaborazione tra gli operatori ed i
rispettivi partner commerciali preferenziali, tra cui altri operatori e
fornitori di servizi finanziari, come Visa. 

"NeuStar, Visa e gli operatori nostri partner rappresentano dei marchi fidati:
Visa nel settore dei pagamenti, NeuStar in quello dello scambi di dati di rete e
gli operatori in quello delle comunicazioni mobili" ha affermato Steve Edwards,
Vicepresidente Senior della divisione Servizi di indirizzamento convergenti
presso NeuStar. "Questa collaborazione permette agli operatori di rete, agli
istituti finanziari, a Visa e ai consumatori di muoversi rapidamente nel mondo
dei pagamenti mobili e di approfittare delle nuove ed entusiasmanti opportunit&#224;
che si profilano all`orizzonte. Siamo ansiosi di collaborare con Visa, istituti
finanziari e operatori di reti mobili allo sviluppo delle migliori pratiche e
applicazioni per i servizi finanziari mobili." 

Vantaggi e applicazioni

L'iniziativa congiunta di Visa e NeuStar apporter&#224; un'infinit&#224; di vantaggi agli
utenti e ai fornitori di servizi finanziari mobili a livello globale tramite:

* l`abilitazione di nuovi canali attraverso i quali gli istituti finanziari
clienti di Visa potranno raggiungere i propri clienti ovunque e in qualsiasi
momento essi siano pronti ad avvalersi di servizi finanziari mobili 
* la creazione di nuovi flussi di reddito per mezzo dell`offerta di una nuova
suite di servizi finanziari quali offerte promozionali e avvisi relativi a
transazioni mobili 
* rendendo possibile l`offerta di servizi finanziari mobili a consumatori
residenti in regioni con una penetrazione ridotta di prodotti per pagamenti e
servizi finanziari. Detti servizi possono includere pagamenti remoti mobili per
servizi quali il pagamento di bollette e pagamenti complementari per servizi di
comunicazione wireless al minuto e trasferimenti mobili di denaro 
* accelerando i tempi di commercializzazione dei servizi finanziari mobili
tramite un`infrastruttura standardizzata e scalabile e l`adozione delle migliori
pratiche per le applicazioni per pagamenti mobili

Gli operatori mobili potranno ora, per esempio, integrare i propri dati con le
informazioni fornite dall`istituto finanziario del cliente per la messa a punto
di offerte maggiormente personalizzate e pertinenti trasmesse dai servizi mobili
di Visa al dispositivo mobile dell'utente. Ci&#242; pu&#242; potenzialmente indurre un
aumento dei tassi di risposta degli utenti alle offerte accrescendo al tempo
stesso la pertinenza dei messaggi. 

La collaborazione permetter&#224; inoltre di effettuare trasferimenti di denaro da
conti Visa a conti mobili tramite la rete Visa. A titolo esemplificativo, la
rete Visa pu&#242; inviare fondi al conto mobile di un utente permettendo al
beneficiario di usare i fondi depositati per l'effettuazione di pagamenti
complementari per servizi di comunicazione wireless al minuto o per il pagamento
di bollette per servizi wireless. Il beneficiario pu&#242; inoltre accedere a detti
fondi tramite una carta Visa prepagata o un prelievo da uno sportello bancomat
nei dintorni. 

Il sodalizio tra Visa e la tecnologia di NeuStar potrebbe inoltre permettere
agli operatori di offrire dati rilevanti in merito alle caratteristiche del
cellulare usato. Visa potrebbe quindi rilevare la marca, il modello, le
dimensioni dello schermo, il tipo di browser e le funzionalit&#224; multimediatiche
del cellulare in uso per poi personalizzare in maniera intelligente l`esperienza
dell`utente in base alle caratteristiche del cellulare. 

Dalla collaborazione tra reti scaturiscono nuovi modelli commerciali

In considerazione di questa alleanza, che &#232; stata annunciata quest`oggi durante
il vertice `GSMA Mobile Money Summit` del 2009, NeuStar e Visa stanno destinando
risorse allo sviluppo di programmi robusti sotto il profilo commerciale volti a
promuovere nuove destinazioni d`uso per le applicazioni. L`iniziativa &#232; inoltre
volta ad abilitare una serie pi&#249; solida di servizi per pagamenti mobili
permettendo a Visa, agli istituti finanziari e agli operatori mobili di
collaborare pi&#249; strettamente e offrire transazioni ricche di informazioni per
rendere i servizi per pagamenti mobili pi&#249; personalizzati, funzionali e sicuri.

customers' costs, maximize storage efficiency, and improve availability
in virtual environments. With NetApp, Microsoft customers can reduce the
amount of storage they need by at least 50% when they also use NetApp(R)
technologies such as thin provisioning and deduplication. Earlier this
year NetApp announced a unique storage efficiency program that guarantees
that customers running Hyper-V environments will use 50% less storage with
NetApp compared to traditional storage*. The NetApp guarantee can help
minimize investment costs and risks while enabling customers to achieve
greater storage utilization in their virtual server and desktop
environments.

    NetApp utilizes a variety of Windows(R) Server platform technologies to
improve storage system management and streamline backup, recovery, and
remote replication in Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V environments. In
addition, tight integration with the Microsoft System Center family of
products and additional application-integrated NetApp products help
maximize uptime for a wide variety of application environments, including
Microsoft Exchange Server, SQL Server, and SharePoint Server. Since NetApp
storage solutions are tightly integrated with Microsoft's technologies,
customers are backed by NetApp's global customer support infrastructure,
which integrates Microsoft Premier Support.

    By combining the ability to take snapshots of a running virtual machine
via Hyper-V with NetApp's unique approach to Snapshot(TM) copy backups,
NetApp also enables automated, consistent, space-efficient backup
creation in a matter of seconds. Not only can customers back up their
environments more frequently and meet existing or shrinking backup
windows, with NetApp they can store more backup copies and recover data
twice as fast as with other solutions in virtualized environments.
Effective and efficient backup and recovery also complement Microsoft
business continuity features and help customers implement more complete
disaster recovery schemes while keeping costs under control.

    "We are very excited about working with NetApp to deliver innovative
end-to-end solutions to our joint customers," said Kim Akers, general
manager, Global Partner Team, at Microsoft. "The combination of our
technology with NetApp's storage solutions gives our customers the tools
they need to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and drive their businesses
forward."

    "We are pleased to honor NetApp as our Advanced Infrastructure Storage
Solutions Partner of the Year," said Ross Brown, vice president, Solution
Partners and ISVs, Worldwide Partner Group, Microsoft Corp. "By pairing
its solutions with Microsoft's Hyper-V, NetApp is helping enterprise
customers leverage the power of virtualized environments to dramatically
reduce costs and increase availability so they can get the most out of
their IT infrastructure."

    "Being chosen as Microsoft's Storage Partner of the Year is a great honor
for NetApp," said Jay Kidd, chief marketing officer at NetApp. "While this
award establishes NetApp as the leading storage solutions provider for
Microsoft virtualization customers, more than anything it underlines the
customer success our partnership and close collaboration has delivered."

&lt;p&gt;    * Mobile ads to make 5-10 pct of media spend in 5 years &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Retailers, Emerging countries to drive demand &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Cyril Altmeyer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    CANNES, France, June 24 (Reuters) - Mobile phone advertising will account for 5-10 percent of global media ad spending within five years, a leading Microsoft (MSFT.O) executive said on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Five years from now mobile will be 5-10 percent of media spend but it won't happen all at once, it will happen gradually," Scott Howe, corporate vice president of the advertiser and publisher solutions group at Microsoft, told Reuters in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Howe added that advertising would also be driven by demand from retailers and emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft, the world's largest software group, recently launched its Bing search engine in a bid to counter the dominance of Google (GOOG.O) in the lucrative Internet search sector and its related advertising market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    One key feature of Bing is that users search with only one click, making it more mobile phone user-friendly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Howe did not give details on market share targets for Bing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "As long as we continue to make progress we will get where we want to be," he said at the Cannes Lions 2009 advertising festival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bing has been winning market share from rivals, according to industry data released earlier this month, but still trails market leader Google by a long way. [nN17358366] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The new search engine grabbed 12.1 percent of U.S. Internet searches for the June 8-12 week, up from 11.3 percent in June 1-5 but behind Google's 65 percent of U.S. searches in May. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SECTOR SET FOR RAPID GROWTH &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As more consumers embrace new technologies and devices such as smart phones, personified by Apple's (AAPL.O) iPhone, mobile advertising is projected to grow at an annual average of 45 percent to reach $28.8 billion within 5 years from a current $3.1 billion or 0.6 percent of spending, according to Ineum Consulting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The development of third-generation mobile phones has led to better connection speeds and a rise of mobile Internet browsing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Mobile phone advertising is going to be one of the fastest growing segments this year because it is growing out of a small base. The question is when does it really hit mainstream? That's probably still a year or more away," Howe said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The biggest bottleneck is going to be having enough case studies where major advertisers have done something really interesting in the mobile space," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mobile advertising could in the meantime attract interest from a niche of advertisers, such as small "mom and pop" local retailers which did not routinely embrace the mainstream online advertising, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    These advertisers could decided to shift their ad budgets away from local newspapers to mobiles for local highly-targeted campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Emerging economies such as Latin America and Africa, where people were likely to own a mobile phone before a wired PC, also looked promising, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Writing by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by James Regan and David Cowell) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((dominique.vidalon.reuters.com; +33 1 49495432; Reuters Messaging:dominique.vidalon.reuters.com@reuters.net))   Keywords: MICROSOFT/  Keywords: MICROSOFT/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

Honeycutt. "It has an abundance of space on the lakefront that gives the ability
to host more than 400 guests and still have the privacy of a quaint
neighborhood."

kitchen. The kitchen`s center island can seat up to 10 people, but can expand to
30 due to the layout of the adjoining breakfast-dining area and formal dining
room. 

The gourmet kitchen features Maroon Khabi granite countertops from Africa, hand
hammered custom copper hood, 4 large sub-zero refrigerators/freezers with 2 in
the pantry area, 2 dishwashers, food prep sink, 3 sinks between the dishwashers,
Wolf professional gas range with six burners, grill and double ovens. Additional

guest quarters, cabana, wine cellar, safe room, exercise room, and see-through
fireplace. In addition to this home`s amenities, a double two-car heated garage
contains in-floor hot water heat and a drain for washing vehicles. 

The property has an outdoor living area directly off of the lower level den that
features a pool overlooking Lake Hickory with an attached hot tub with
waterfall. The outdoor pavilion has a fireplace allowing for year round
entertainment. 

Lakefront Entertainment Center

The estate has a quarter mile of Lake Frontage on Lake Hickory and the lakeside
entertainment center is ideal for summertime entertaining. The dock area
contains a boardwalk, gazebo, dressing room, dock lift, slips, and kitchen area.
The main dock lift can easily accommodate up to a 30` boat and has slips for 3
jet skis. 

Equestrian Center

The property features a top-tier equestrian center that has a 4,800+/- square
foot outdoor riding ring that can also serve as a volleyball court or helicopter
pad, a 4,400+/- square foot indoor riding ring with wood stove and wiring for a
large screen television, a horse barn with 5 stalls, wash stall and guest
quarters with bedroom, bath, and kitchenette complete the facility. The
equestrian center serves not only riding purposes, but provides enough space for
entertaining up to 500 people. 

A paved drive wide enough for a golf cart leads from the home to both the
equestrian center and the lakeside amenities. 

Area

The estate is located minutes from downtown and a short distance from four
exciting golf courses, Hickory Motor Speedway and Hickory Airport. The lakefront
estate is a short drive from six snow skiing resorts, world-class trout fishing,
Pisgah National Forest, NASCAR Lowes Motor Speedway and central to Asheville,

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO, June 24 (Reuters) - VisaNet, the Brazilian
affiliate of credit card network Visa Inc (V.N), said on
Wednesday that it had banned 19 brokerages from participating
in its massive initial public offering because the firms
released unapproved advertising material on the sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; VisaNet's IPO might total 9.7 billion reais ($4.9 billion)
if underwriters exercise a so-called greenshoe option to sell
additional shares to meet demand, making it the largest ever in
Brazil and among the biggest in the world the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brokerages banned included Bradesco SA Corretora, ABN Amro
real and ICAP do Brasil. Bradesco BBI, the investment banking
arm of Brazil's second largest private-sector bank Bradesco
(BBDC4.SA), is the lead underwriter of the offering.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM named one of its executives, a former Morgan Stanley banker, to be its new head of mergers and acquisitions on Tuesday after losing its chief dealmaker to rival Dell Inc, which is beefing up its acquisition efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM named Elias Mendoza, who handled mergers and acquisitions in Asia for the computer consulting and technology company, to the top MA job as it waits for a U.S. federal court to rule on a request that the man he replaces be banned from working for Dell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before joining IBM in 2006, Mendoza worked for investment bank Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM claims that his predecessor, David Johnson, violated a 2005 non-compete agreement by taking the Dell post in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Johnson has possession of valuable confidential information of IBM and cannot undertake a senior strategy position at Dell without violating his obligations to IBM," the company said in a statement as it filed its lawsuit last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A judge in the U.S. District Court of Southern New York could rule on IBM's request as early as this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IBM spokesman declined to comment on the litigation on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The litigation comes as IBM seeks to rebound after a rare public embarrassment over its MA efforts, a failed attempt to buy hardware maker Sun Microsystems Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It emerged as the lead contender in March to buy the company but discussions collapsed in April mainly because both sides were unable to agree on guarantees for IBM to be able to walk away should the deal fail to pass regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software developer Oracle swooped in with a successful bid to buy Sun for more than $7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Plant Openings Mark New Wave of Investment in China
URUMQI, Xinjiang--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partner, COFCO Coca-Cola Beverages Ltd.,
continued their expansion in China with the opening of two new bottling
facilities this week in less developed central and western China. The new
facilities are testimonies to Coca-Cola`s long-term commitment to China as part
of a recently announced USD 2 billion 3 year investment plan aimed at bolstering
further growth in one of the world`s largest and fastest growing beverage
markets. 

From today consumers in China`s westernmost province, Xinjiang, will be able to
consume locally-produced Coca-Cola products with the establishment of the new
COFCO bottling plant, located along the historic Silk Road. The bottling
facility will provide a strategically important platform for continuous growth
of Coca-Cola in the Northwestern China where Xinjiang, with over 20 million
consumers, is the largest province. 

Yesterday, The Coca-Cola Company and COFCO officially opened another new
bottling plant in China. Located in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, this plant will
provide refreshing Coca-Cola products to the 44 million consumers in this
central province of China. 

The new investment has directly created 796 new jobs at the two bottling plants,
and is more broadly expected to create an additional 8,000 jobs with upstream
suppliers and a wide variety of service providers. 

Muhtar Kent, chairman and chief executive officer of The Coca-Cola Company, and
Frank Ning, Chairman of COFCO Limited, opened the plant in Nanchang together
with Hong Lihe, Vice Governor of Jiangxi province and the plant in Urumqi
together with Wang Lequan, member of the Political Bureau of CPC Central
Committee and party secretary of the CPC Xinjiang Committee. They were joined by
Glenn Jordan, group president of the Pacific group, Doug Jackson, president of
Coca-Cola China and Luan Xiuju, president of COFCO Coca-Cola Beverages Co Ltd. 

"This RMB 210 million (USD 30.1 million) investment in Jiangxi and Xinjiang
represents the Coca-Cola system`s strong commitment to China and to consumers
throughout China including in the less developed areas in central and western
China in creating job opportunities and building a better community," said Mr.
Kent. "Our business in China grew 19% in 2008 and China is now our third largest
market. By opening new plants in Jiangxi and Xinjiang, we will be able to
increase our geographic presence, enhance our competitive edge in China and
support local community development by sponsoring jobs, local procurements, and
education." 

Mr. Kent added: "In 2008, Coca-Cola helped bring the Olympic spirit to the
consumers in Jiangxi and Xinjiang, through its sponsorship of the Olympic Torch
Relay, where thousands of people got a chance to experience the Olympic spirit
when the Olympic Torch passed through the capital cities Nanchang and Urumqi.
Following the Olympic Games we are proud to be the Beverage Global Partnerof
Expo 2010 Shanghai China and keen supporter of the 2010 Expo. It is a privilege
for us to work with the Chinese Government on what is going to be the biggest
Expo event ever held and the largest public event in history." 

"COFCO has historically had positive relations with the Jiangxi and Xinjiang
governments and people. The currently favorable investment climate in Jiangxi
and Xinjiang has encouraged us to work with Coca-Cola in building and opening
new facilities here, which we expect to lead to more collaborative opportunities
between COFCO and these local communities and governments moving forward," said
COFCO Chairman Frank Ning. 

"I represent the Xinjiang people in welcoming the China National Cereals, Oils
and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO) and The Coca-Cola Company`s investment in
Xinjiang and expressing their sincere congratulations in establishing the new
bottling plant," said Wang Lequan, member of the Political Bureau of CPC Central
Committee and party secretary of the CPC Xinjiang Committee. "This well-known
international brand will bring in progressive management concepts and boost the
development of the local industry in Xinjiang." 

Following the plant openings in Xinjiang and Jiangxi The Coca-Cola Company and
its bottlers now operate 38 bottling plants in Greater China, employing more
than 30.000 people directly and indirectly creating around 300.000 jobs.
Coca-Cola opened a new 90 million USD new research and development center in
Shanghai in March 2009. 

Coca-Cola and its bottlers in China have always been active corporate citizens,
and been a part of the local social fabric. Over the past several years,
Coca-Cola has actively contributed to the development of the local communities
in Jiangxi and Xinjiang and more broadly across China. The Company has
contributed to disaster relief efforts, and is a continuing sponsor of Project
Hope, which aims to improve education for disadvantaged children. Since 1993,
Coca-Cola China, in partnership with Project Hope, has built 59 schools, 100
libraries, donated more than RMB 60 million helping 60,000 rural children gain
access to education. The Company has also invested 1 million USD in a project
with UNDP &amp; the Chinese Government to enhance clean water access and sanitation
in rural areas. 

Following last year`s devastating earthquake in the Sichuan region, The
Coca-Cola Company has committed to donate US$12 million to build schools in the
earthquake impacted areas over the next three years.

Meios de Pagamento, begins trading on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bradesco BBI, the investment banking arm of Bradesco,
managed the offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bradesco on Wednesday banned 19 brokerages, including its
own Bradesco SA Corretora and Agora, from participating in the
massive IPO because the firms allegedly had released unapproved
advertising material about the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before the IPO, Bradesco held a 39 percent stake in
VisaNet; Banco do Brasil, a 31 percent interest; and Spain's
Santander, a 14 percent stake. After the IPO, the three banks
still controlled a majority of VisaNet's shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa Inc unit Visa International was also part of the
controlling group but reduced its 10 percent stake to zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brazil's largest private sector bank, Itau Unibanco
(ITUB4.SA), and the Brazilian unit of HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBA.L), also sold their stakes.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released an online power management application designed to help you track your home energy consumption.  Called Hohm, the Web-based application also gives you personalized energy-saving recommendations such as placing new caulking on windows, removing air leaks, and installing a programmable thermostat.  Hohm provides these suggestions based on what appliances you have, your home's specific characteristics, and your energy usage patterns. If you're uncomfortable giving too much data to Microsoft, Hohm will base its recommendations on national and local energy consumption averages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hohm consumption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at launch it doesn't look like Hohm will be of much help when compared to a similar service from Microsoft rival Google.  When Hohm's beta service goes live, the application will focus on helping you understand your energy patterns based on a questionnaire. But Hohm won't be able to analyze actual energy consumption data from your energy provider - something that Google's PowerMeter service can do and is doing with select energy partners already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft says consumption tracking is coming later, and the company hopes to get into the nitty gritty of your electricity bill by providing you with information about your use of energy for heating, lighting, cooling and appliances.  Microsoft's application will also get smarter as it accumulates more data to base its recommendations on, and Microsoft is considering incorporating data from so-called smart meters in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google PowerMeter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft's working to get its Hohm up and running, Google already has a similar online application to provide you with feedback on your energy usage.  But unlike Hohm, Google PowerMeter will only work if your home has a smart meter to feed data to Google's application.  Once your smart meter is installed, however, PowerMeter can give you all kinds of information from a history of your personal consumption (post-smart meter installation of course) to how much energy your dishwasher sucked up today.  PowerMeter is also privacy conscious and Google says they won't share any personally identifying information with your energy provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hohm vs. PowerMeter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both programs look interesting, Microsoft's Hohm may have an edge over PowerMeter, as Hohm will give you specific instructions on how to save money.  Hohm will also be integrated with some social networking capabilities, allowing you to trade energy savings tips and see the usage patterns of other people in your area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's possible Microsoft's promises won't meet reality.  How, for example, will Hohm know if your windows actually need to be resealed?  It sounds to me like Hohm's money-saving 'tips' will end up being general suggestions based on probable causes for any energy consumption that is higher than normal.  It's hard to know for sure what Hohm entails, as Microsoft isn't providing much in the way of details at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with both Microsoft and Google in the game, energy consumption tools are definitely the next big thing in green tech.   Let's just hope we don't regret handing over our energy consumption patterns to two giant corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hohm is available only in the U.S, but international rollouts planned for the near future may include Germany, France, the U.K. and Canada.  Google's PowerMeter is currently available in the U.S., Canada and India in partnership with selected energy providers in each country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;http://www.profit.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Industry Outlook. Today`s interview is with senior
analyst Neil Malkin,who talks about the Coal Industry, including Peabody Coal
(NYSE: BTU), Arch Coal Inc. (NYSE: ACI), Rio Tinto (NYSE: RTP) and Walter Energy
(NYSE: WLT). 

A synopsis of today`s Industry Outlook is presented below. The full article can
be read at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

The larger coal players with strong balance sheets will be able to capitalize on
the current market environment in the form of acquisitions. With asset prices
coming down from mid-'08 levels and smaller producers feeling the strain on
margins, this represents opportunities to acquire reserves on the cheap. 

In particular, we like companies with exposure to the international coal markets
as well as the Powder River Basin (PRB) in the U.S. Companies like Peabody Coal
(NYSE: BTU) and Arch Coal Inc. (NYSE: ACI) look attractive currently. Both have
recently engaged in long-term growth acquisitions. 

Peabody is the largest pure-play coal producer, with significant leverage to the
Australian export market. Due to the high quality of coal produced and its
proximity to Asia (emerging markets) Australian seaborne coal trades at a
premium to all other coals. 

Peabody would benefit especially when China and other Asian emerging markets
begin to rebound. The stimulus packages enacted by the federal government during
the recent months should start to pay dividends toward the end of '09. 

Arch Coal has a significant amount of reserves and is a top-three producer in
the PRB. In our opinion, PRB coal will be in great demand over the coming years.
The significant coal-fired power plant build-out will increase annual thermal
coal demand by more than 60 MM tons; approximately 50% of this new demand will
be met by PRB supply. Its likely acquisition of Rio Tinto's (NYSE: RTP) Jacobs
Mine will increase ACI's PRB market share while gaining operating synergies. 

We also like companies with leverage to metallurgical coal markets. When the
global economy starts to turn around, likely in the beginning of 2010, demand
for steel and metallurgical coal should rise. Companies like Walter Energy
(NYSE: WLT) should fare well in this environment.

&lt;p&gt;http://www.profit.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Kroger (NYSE:KR) as the Bull of the Day and
Gerdau S.A. (NYSE:GGB) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research
provides analysis on Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Transocean (NYSE:RIG) and Ingersoll Rand
(NYSE:IR). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Kroger (NYSE:KR) reported better-than-expected first quarter earnings per share,
beating our estimate by $0.04 per share. We are increasing our EPS estimates for
this year and next to reflect the first quarter upside. 

For fiscal year 2009, Kroger expects identical-store sales of 3% to 4% and
earnings per share of $2.00 to $2.05. That said, we still believe that the
company may be able to beat its fiscal year 2009 EPS guidance, due to a higher
mix of private-label brand sales and continued market share gains. 

We reiterate our Buy rating on Kroger shares. Our six-month target price is $28,
up from $27. 

Bear of the Day: 

We are keeping our Sell recommendation on Gerdau S.A. (NYSE:GGB) based on poor
first quarter results and the worldwide crises. The company successfully
renegotiated part of its debt and banks accepted to relieve some covenants. 

The company's strategy to grow through acquisitions based on debt created huge
leverage and financial debt is expected to increase in the short-term. The huge
decline in steel prices and the international economic slowdown creates a more
challenging business environment for the steel industry. 

The company's strategy to grow through acquisitions based on debt is
contributing to the negative news. Moreover, huge exposure to the U.S. market
during a recession is a major concern. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Parsing the Fed`s Statement

In the April statement they referred to "inflation could persist for a time
below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer
term" which is Fed-speak for deflation. The Fed seems to be indicating that
deflation concerns are off the table. 

They also have acknowledged the recent rise in commodity prices, most
importantly for oil. This sets up a very real possibility for a big divergence
between core and headline inflation. If this is the case, then being invested in
the oil companies like Exxon (NYSE:XOM) or deep-sea drillers like Transocean
(NYSE:RIG) would be a good place to be. 

The resource slack is apparent in the labor market with an unemployment rate of
9.4% and rising, and in the industrial sector with record low rates of capacity
utilization. The low capacity utilization figures means that one wants to avoid
firms that make industrial equipment, like Ingersoll Rand (NYSE:IR).

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:

Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the free Profit from
the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Fed: No Changes

Regarding the economic backdrop, the relative improvement was clearly stated.
The Fed painted an accurate picture, describing the ongoing weakness but
acknowledging that the rate of deterioration is slowing. 

We are gradually moving towards what should become a period of slow growth. As
such, investors may want to shift towards companies that could benefit from a
rebound. These include Baker-Hughes (NYSE: BHI) and Weatherford (NYSE: WFT). 

At the same time, I would maintain exposure to companies like AutoZone (NYSE:
AZO) that benefit from the cautious high unemployment environment. This is
important, since the recovery will not feel like a recovery to many people. 

Pfizer-Wyeth Deal On Schedule

We currently rate shares of Wyeth, Inc. (NYSE: WYE) a Hold with a $49 price
target. Our target assumes Pfizer`s (NYSE: PFE) shares trade up near $16.00
(currently $14.85) by the expected close date in the third or fourth quarter. At
an exchange ratio of 0.985 and combined with the $33 cash per Wyeth share, this
equates to roughly $49 per share. 

Revenue in 2008 grew 2% and was up 1% excluding the benefit from foreign
exchange. EPS was flat from 2007 on lower interest income and a higher tax rate,
partially offset by lower SG spend. Revenue in the first quarter 2009 was
lower than our forecast. This was largely due to a stronger-than-expected impact
from foreign exchange, lower contribution from Alliance revenue (as a result of
softer U.S. sales of Enbrel) and weaker-than-expected international sales of
Effexor. 

Global economic weakness also appears to be taking a toll on sales of a number
of Wyeth`s pharmaceutical products as well as the consumer business. EPS of
$0.95 was ahead of our ($0.89) and the Street ($0.88) estimates and
significantly benefited from foreign exchange hedges and a lower-than-expected
tax rate during the quarter.

&lt;p&gt; *Arden strikes deal on hedge funds with JP Morgan unit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *Deal will boost Arden's assets to about $8 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, June 25 (Reuters) - Arden Asset Management, a hedge
fund of funds manager, and JPMorgan Chase, (JPM.N), the
second-largest U.S. bank, struck a deal on Thursday where the
hedge fund firm will run a $1 billion portfolio for the bank's
investment banking division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the agreement, which becomes effective on July 1,
Shakil Riaz, who has led the bank's proprietary hedge fund of
funds program since its inception in 1995, will join Arden, the
two said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Arden's high quality institutional infrastructure and
well-established investment processes were important in our
decision to select the firm to manage these assets," said
Robert Case, who heads JPMorgan's Principal Investment
Management for the investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan will also seed several new Arden funds and invest
in one of Arden's current flagship funds with this money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal will help Arden, which manages money for state
pension funds and others, boost its assets to about $8 billion
after they shrunk about 28 percent between July 2008 and April
2009, data from Pension  Investments show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a group, the world's largest hedge fund of funds lost
roughly 37 percent in assets during that time as investors
protested poor returns and high fees, PI data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry analysts also said wealthy private investors shied
away from hedge fund of funds after several had put the bulk of
their assets into financial swindler Bernard Madoff's $65
billion Ponzi scheme. Generally fund of funds promise to spread
the risk by putting money with a number of hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan's asset management unit offers its own hedge fund
of funds and is not included in the Arden deal.

&lt;p&gt;Murray, aiming to be the first British men's winner since Fred Perry in 1936, cruised through the opener before a break in game 11 of the second helped him earn a two-set advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Scot sealed victory with a crunching forehand crosscourt winner after one hour and 28 minutes to the delight of a sun-drenched Center Court crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will face either Serbia's Viktor Troicki or Spain's Daniel Gimeno Traver for a place in the fourth round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Miles Evans)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - Microsoft and VivaKi, the digital arm of Publicis, on Thursday unveiled a broad cooperation deal spanning the fast-growing digital advertising sector to targeted television advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal will lead to the creation of a customized VivaKi advertisement exchange for television advertising delivered via Microsoft's Admira software, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will enable more 'audience-specific' television buying by VivaKi, creating an audience on demand for television" it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement, VivaKi's units Starcom MediaVest Group, Zenith Optimedia and Digitas, will use Admira technology to help clients plan and buy media ads when Admira goes live in the fourth quarter 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admira, developed by Microsoft's Navic division, helps advertisers target specific television audiences, thus saving on the costs of placing ads in front of consumers who are unlikely to buy their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publicis, the world's third-largest advertising group by revenue, launched VivaKi a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VivaKi, which pools the digital capabilities of various Publicis units, aims to help advertisers access a single target audience through a global campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publicis aims to generate 25 percent of its revenue from digital activities by 2010 against 20.5 percent in the first quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Jason Benham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) will sell the standard home-user version of its new Windows 7 operating system for 8 percent less than the comparable version of its Vista system, as the global downturn hits spending on technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company, whose recent ads champion low-priced PCs against more expensive Apple Inc (AAPL.O) computers, said the new system will be available at even lower prices for a short time, as it looks to tempt buyers ahead of the holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new operating system, which Microsoft hopes will be a bigger hit than the poorly received Vista, will be generally released on October 22. It will be available on pre-order from U.S. stores such as Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N), online retailer Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and the company's own website from Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not detail how much it would charge PC makers such as Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), Dell Inc DELL.O and Acer Inc (2353.TW) for preloading Windows 7 on their machines, which is how most customers will come to use the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price Microsoft charges manufacturers is becoming a thorny point, as both sides look to maximize their share of profits as PC sales dip and prices are driven down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software giant said it would sell the Home Premium upgrade version of Windows 7 -- which most nonbusiness customers already using Windows will want -- for $49.99 from Friday until July 11 in the United States. The discs would be shipped after general release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After July 11, the pre-order price will be $119.99, 8 percent less than the current $129.99 price tag for the comparable version of Vista, which cost $159.99 at launch in early 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Professional upgrade version of Windows 7 -- aimed at small companies using multiple computers -- will be on sale until July 11 at $99.99, then at $199.99 afterward. The comparable Vista version is the same price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices for the full retail versions of the software -- for customers who want to install the system from scratch rather than upgrade their existing Windows system -- are also being reduced or held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will sell the full Home Premium version of Windows 7 for $199.99, 17 percent less than the comparable Vista version. Full versions of the more advanced Professional and Ultimate editions will be unchanged at $299.99 and $319.99, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further tempt buyers, Microsoft said it was making a free upgrade option available to computer makers, meaning that customers who buy a PC or laptop with all but the most basic Vista versions from Friday should be able to get a free upgrade to the equivalent Windows 7 version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How that offer is made available to customers is up to the individual PC makers. Both Microsoft and the manufacturers are hoping such an offer will avoid a sudden drop-off in already falling PC sales by persuading customers not to hold off on purchases until Windows 7 is launched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the upgrade option means Microsoft is essentially selling two operating systems for the price of one, the company is deferring half the revenue from Vista sales over the next several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, it said it would defer about $200 million to $300 million revenue from its fiscal fourth quarter, ending June 30, to later quarters, recognizing it either when a customer takes advantage of the upgrade, or at the end of the program on January 31, 2010. The move has no effect on cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Vista operating system, which was released in different language versions over several months, Microsoft said Windows 7 would be available in 14 languages on October 22 and a further 21 on October 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Versions for sale in Europe will not have Microsoft's Internet Explorer 8 web browser included, due to the company's recent decision to detach it in the face of a pending European Commission antitrust ruling on charges that Microsoft does not allow fair competition among browsers by including its own on its operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft said it will make IE8 available as a separate package for no extra charge. Customers can also install a competing browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said on Thursday it will only offer full versions of Windows 7 in Europe rather than both full and upgrade versions. For a short time it is offering the Home Premium version for 49 euros ($68) and the Professional version for 99 euros ($138).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said the packaging of discs for the operating system was being reduced and would use recyclable plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares were up 1.3 percent at $23.75 in midday trading on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 euro = $1.39)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; editing by Carol Bishopric and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies Pursue More Engaging Digital Content, Increased Marketing Performance
and Sharply-Defined Audiences
PARIS &amp; REDMOND, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
Regulatory News: 

Microsoft and Publicis Groupe (Paris:PUB) today announced a broad agreement to
closely cooperate on three core objectives enabled by the emergence of the
digital media world. Focusing on Content, Performance and Audience, respective
teams will work to bring better value and more efficacy to their clients across
the range of digital media experiences. 

The relationship will center on key components of the digital marketing and
advertising industry:

* CONTENT: The creation, production and distribution of programming, across the
wide array of capabilities, tools, and services on the digital palette. 
* PERFORMANCE: Technologies, methods and innovation focused on the delivery of
better performance including search, ad serving and the portfolio of performance
technologies and services. 
* AUDIENCE: The definition, delivery and measurement of specific audiences based
on a set of defined criteria

Through the Publicis owned studio PBJS, and in partnership with the Vivaki Nerve
Center, Microsoft will support a PBSJ-developed Content Studio to help enable
large scale, global programming opportunities. Publicis Groupe clients will have
first access to the programs delivered by the Content Studio. 

Microsoft and Publicis Groupe will also work together to explore technologies
and methodologies that will enhance engagement, performance and return on
investment in the digital marketing and advertising space. The first of these
efforts is an ongoing Microsoft commitment to The Pool, a VivaKi research
initiative that tests new online video ad formats and new digital ad models. The
first lane of the Pool, in test this summer, focused on online video. The second
lane, announced last week, will focus on short form video content. Future lanes
will encompass mobile, advanced television and social marketing. 

The focus on audience is the creation of a customized VivaKi ad exchange for
television advertising delivered via the Admira technology, developed by
Microsoft`s Navic subsidiary. This will enable more "audience-specific"
television buying by Vivaki, creating an Audience on Demand for television.
Admira aggregates anonymous audience intelligence that may be more challenging
to find using traditional sources of viewership measurement, and combines it
with additional audience characteristics currently not available on existing
television advertising platforms. Admira can continuously optimize ad placements
in response to near real-time viewing trends and report the actual audiences
that are delivered, which will help agencies and advertisers measure the success
of campaigns. 

As part of the agreement, Starcom MediaVest Group, Zenith Optimedia and Digitas
will be one of the first agency networks to use Microsoft Advertising`s Admira
technology to help clients plan and buy media when Admira goes live in the
fourth quarter of 09. 

"This agreement reflects our commitment to partner with the world`s largest
agencies to drive new ideas and innovations that address the complex marketing
needs and challenges facing advertisers today," said Darren Huston, corporate
vice president of Microsoft Corp`s Consumer &amp; Online group. "It illustrates our
belief that partnerships that bring creativity and technology together can be a
powerful combination for brand marketers looking to grow their share." 

David Kenny, managing partner of VivaKi and a member of the Publicis Groupe
Directoire, said of the agreement: "Maurice Levy founded VivaKi on the principle
of open source pursuit of digital solutions for clients. By partnering with
Microsoft and focusing on three critical components of content, performance and
audience, we are a stronger partner to our clients and can bring them solutions
ahead of the marketplace. Given the pace of change in today`s consumer
landscape, collaboration is the smartest approach to keep marketers ahead of the
curve."

Publicis Groupe, en partenariat avec Vivaki Nerve Center et Microsoft,
accueillera un &#171; Content Studio &#187; &#233;labor&#233; par PBJS (agence de production et
d`&#233;v&#233;nements de Publicis Groupe) permettant la cr&#233;ation de programmes de contenu
&#224; grande &#233;chelle. Les clients de Publicis Groupe b&#233;n&#233;ficieront d`un acc&#232;s
privil&#233;gi&#233; aux programmes produits par le &#171; Content Studio &#187;. 

Microsoft et Publicis Groupe collaboreront &#233;galement pour explorer de nouvelles
technologies et m&#233;thodologies visant &#224; augmenter l`attractivit&#233;, les
performances et les rendements publicitaires du marketing et de la publicit&#233;
num&#233;riques. La premi&#232;re &#233;tape est symbolis&#233;e par leur engagement avec &#171; The Pool
&#187;, programme de recherche lanc&#233; par VivaKi con&#231;u pour tester de nouveaux outils
et mod&#232;les de communication num&#233;rique et de vid&#233;o en ligne. Un premier projet &#171;
The Pool &#187; sur la vid&#233;o en ligne sera test&#233; cet &#233;t&#233;. Une autre initiative &#171; The
Pool &#187; se concentrera sur des contenus vid&#233;o de format court. De nouveaux
mod&#232;les seront ensuite disponibles sur tous les types de m&#233;dias : les t&#233;l&#233;phones
portables, la t&#233;l&#233;vision &#171; de demain &#187; et le marketing social. 

Pour am&#233;liorer le ciblage &#224; la t&#233;l&#233;vision, VivaKi disposera d`un outil
sp&#233;cifique &#224; la publicit&#233; t&#233;l&#233;vis&#233;e d&#233;velopp&#233; depuis la technologie &#171; Admira &#187;
con&#231;ue par une filiale de Microsoft, Navic. Ainsi, Vivaki sera en mesure de
cr&#233;er une &#171; Audience on Demand &#187; et de proc&#233;der &#224; des achats d`espaces
publicitaires t&#233;l&#233;vis&#233;s plus cibl&#233;s et rentables pour les annonceurs. &#171; Admira &#187;
permet de collecter des donn&#233;es plus approfondies sur les audiences, tout en
maintenant leur anonymat, qui, sans cette technologie, peuvent &#234;tre plus
difficiles &#224; obtenir via les m&#233;thodes de mesures existantes sur les diff&#233;rentes
plateformes de t&#233;l&#233;vision. &#171; Admira &#187; peut optimiser en permanence le placement
publicitaire en temps r&#233;el et ce, en fonction des tendances comportementales des
t&#233;l&#233;spectateurs. Elle peut transmettre les informations de comportement en ligne
des audiences et ainsi permettre aux agences et annonceurs de mieux mesurer le
succ&#232;s de leurs campagnes. 

Dans le cadre de cet accord, Starcom MediaVest Group, Zenith Optimedia et
Digitas seront parmi les premiers r&#233;seaux d`agences &#224; utiliser la technologie &#171;
Admira &#187; de Microsoft Advertising pour aider les clients du Groupe Publicis &#224;
planifier et acheter des espaces m&#233;dias lors de son lancement sur le march&#233; au
cours du quatri&#232;me trimestre 2009. 

&#171; Cet accord refl&#232;te l`engagement que nous avons pris de nous associer avec les
plus grandes agences du monde pour g&#233;n&#233;rer de nouvelles id&#233;es et innovations
afin de r&#233;pondre ainsi aux besoins et d&#233;fis marketing complexes auxquels les
annonceurs doivent faire face aujourd`hui &#187;, d&#233;clare Darren Huston, Corporate
Vice President de Microsoft Corp. Consumer &amp; Online group. &#171; Cela d&#233;montre que
les partenariats qui allient cr&#233;ativit&#233; et technologie repr&#233;sentent un atout de
poids pour les annonceurs cherchant &#224; augmenter les parts de march&#233; de leurs
marques. Cet accord est la parfaite illustration de notre conviction. &#187; 

David Kenny, Managing Partner de VivaKi et membre du Directoire de Publicis

&lt;p&gt;PARIS, June 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) and VivaKi,
the digital arm of Publicis (PUBP.PA), on Thursday unveiled a
broad cooperation deal spanning the fast-growing digital
advertising sector to targeted television advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The deal will lead to the creation of a customised VivaKi
advertisment exchange for television advertising delivered via
Microsoft's Admira software, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This will enable more 'audience-specific' television buying
by VivaKi, creating an audience on demand for television" it
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  As part of the agreement, VivaKi's units Starcom MediaVest
Group, Zenith Optimedia and Digitas, will use Admira technology
to help clients plan and buy media ads when Admira goes live in
the fourth quarter 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Admira, developed by Microsoft's Navic division, helps
advertisers target specific television audiences, thus saving on
the costs of placing ads in front of consumers who are unlikely
to buy their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Publicis, the world's third-largest advertising group by
revenue, launched VivaKi a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VivaKi, which pools the digital capabilities of various
Publicis units, aims to help advertisers access a single target
audience through a global campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Publicis aims to generate 25 percent of its revenue from
digital activities by 2010 against 20.5 percent in the first
quarter of this year.

&lt;p&gt;June 25 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) could
start a "large" share buyback program in 2010, said a Citigroup
analyst, who increased his second-quarter earnings forecast for
the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Analyst Keith Horowitz expects Goldman's Tier 1 capital
ratio to be at 13 percent as on June 30, and said that even if
Goldman managed a Tier 1 capital ratio of between 10 percent
and 11 percent, it would still be left with close to $11
billion in excess capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With this significant excess capital position, we would
expect Goldman Sachs to start a buyback program in the next
couple quarters, which could be a potential catalyst for the
stock," Horowitz said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst raised his second-quarter earnings estimate for
the company to $3.90 from $3.35 as he expects higher revenue
from Goldman's core fixed income, currency and commodities
(FICC) segment, strong equity underwriting volumes and
increased principal investment revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His forecast includes an estimated charge of 77 cents a
share related to the repayment of funds borrowed under the
Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Horowitz maintained a "buy" rating and a target price of
$160 on the company's stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's shares were up 41 cents at $143.06 in Thursday
morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  SEATTLE, WA and GAITHERSBURG, MD, Jun 25 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
Chinook Hosting, a leader in the hosted applications industry, today
announced that it has been selected to support BroadSoft's internal
Unified Communications (UC) deployment -- one of the industry's first
hosted UC deployments on Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007
Release 2. The deployment will enhance BroadSoft's workforce productivity
through more effective internal and external communications and
collaboration, and complete desktop collaboration with remote users.

    BroadSoft, Inc., the worldwide leader of VoIP applications, is a global
company with more than 300 employees dispersed across 22 countries. With a
workforce comprised of road warriors and highly-dispersed collaborative
teams, BroadSoft(R) seeks to streamline communications, increase
information sharing and automate business processes throughout the
company's worldwide operations. Given the company's global presence, it is
critical that employees can work anywhere and collaborate in real time.

    Chinook is delivering a premium Hosted UC solution that integrates
BroadSoft's BroadWorks(R) VoIP application platform and Microsoft Exchange
Server 2007, Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 and Microsoft
Office SharePoint Server 2007 hosted at Chinook. The solution combines
hosted e-mail, instant messaging and user presence with BroadWorks,
enabling BroadSoft to take advantage of new capabilities such as
click-to-call from the user's desktop. In addition, the solution provides
user real-time presence indication, secure instant messaging, and desktop
and application sharing over the network.

    BroadSoft expects to achieve cost savings and meaningful productivity
gains by enabling:


--  employees to know how and when to most efficiently contact each other
    through contextual user presence awareness
--  technical support staff to remotely control a customer's desktop
--  employees to view other employee real-time call status
--  geographically-dispersed developers to collaborate more closely on
    projects during design reviews
--  employees to use video conferencing capabilities, further reducing
    travel expenses
    

    
"Building on our expertise in UC, BroadSoft understands the vast
productivity and collaboration enhancements gained from the real-time
integration of Hosted PBX, mobility, video and Web 2.0," said Michael
Tessler, co-founder and CEO, BroadSoft. "We expect these benefits coupled
with the inherent value of a hosted solution -- rapid service turn-up,
limited capital expense, immediate global coverage, and improved
communications resiliency -- to generate extraordinary productivity
improvements that will positively impact our bottom line."

    Chinook Hosting's CEO Steve Schwartz stated, "Working in concert with
BroadSoft, both as a partner to develop and deliver Hosted UC to small and
medium-sized businesses, and in the planning and implementation of their
internal UC solution, has allowed Chinook Hosting to drive thought
leadership around these technologies. Our joint success has demonstrated
the great potential in integrating BroadWorks with the Microsoft UC
platform."

    BroadSoft completed interoperability testing and validation of Microsoft
Office Communications Server 2007 R2 in conjunction with Microsoft Corp.
in early 2009. To prepare for the deployment, Chinook collaborated with
BroadSoft's interoperability team to fully validate Office Communications
Server 2007 R2 with the latest BroadWorks releases, ensuring a seamless
transition for BroadSoft to the Office Communications Server 2007 R2
platform.

&lt;p&gt;  NIWOT, CO, Jun 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The IVI Foundation announces the release of the 64-bit IVI Shared
Components and VISA Shared Components. This release enables vendors to
provide 64-bit VISA and IVI drivers to test and measurement customers. In
addition, a VISA Router and VISA Conflict Resolver were added to the VISA
Shared Components and a C API for the IVIConfigServer to the IVI Shared
Components.

    "The release of these components keeps the IVI standards aligned with
evolving industry standards and customer requirements," said Jon Bellin,
Chairperson of the IVI 64-bit Working Group. "64-bit is an emerging
requirement and the updates to these components permit IVI vendors to
provide 64-bit VISA or IVI solutions."

    In addition to providing support for usage on 64-bit Vista, the VISA
Shared Components also include a VISA Router and a VISA Conflict
Resolver. Now, users can easily create solutions with I/O hardware and
software from various vendors. Previously, a user had to specify which
VISA was primary and then configure all the instrument communication to
route through that VISA. When I/O hardware used in a system was provided
by more than one vendor, it was possible for two different I/O devices to
be assigned the same address, resulting in a conflict that would generate
a VISA error. With the introduction of the VISA Router, a user no longer
has to identify one VISA as primary but can use the VISA of choice. The
VISA Conflict Resolver will automatically detect and notify the user if a
conflict exists between two different I/O devices. This allows the user
to identify and correct the problem immediately, before developing
applications using the erroneous information.

    In conjunction with the release of the IVI Shared Components, a C API has
been provided for the IVIConfigServer. This allows customers who use IVI-C
drivers to use native C interfaces instead of COM when using the Config
Server.

    About Shared Components

    The IVI Foundation provides a standard set of shared components which are
required by all compliant drivers and ancillary software. These components
provide common services to drivers and driver clients; the administration
of system-wide configuration is an example. The IVI Shared Components are
required when using an IVI driver. The VISA Shared Components are used
with a VISA library from a specific vendor.

    About the IVI Foundation

    The IVI Foundation is an open consortium founded to promote specifications
for programming test instruments that simplify interchangeability, provide
better performance, and reduce the cost of program development and
maintenance. To learn more, visit www.ivifoundation.org.

&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Standard home version 8 pct less than Vista&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Available on pre-order from Friday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Free upgrade for new Vista PCs offered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, June 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is to
sell the standard home-user version of its new Windows 7
operating system for 8 percent less than the comparable version
of its Vista system, as the global downturn hits spending on
technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company, whose recent ads
champion low-priced PCs against more expensive Apple Inc
(AAPL.O) computers, said the new system will be available at
even lower prices for a short time, as it looks to tempt buyers
ahead of the holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new operating system, which Microsoft hopes will be a
bigger hit than the poorly received Vista, will be generally
released on Oct. 22. It will be available on pre-order from
U.S. stores such as Best Buy (BBY.N), online retailer
Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and the company's own website from Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it would sell the Home Premium upgrade
version of Windows 7 -- which most non-business customers
already using Windows will want -- for $49.99 from Friday until
July 11 in the United States. The discs would be shipped after
general release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After July 11, the pre-order price will be $119.99, 8
percent less than the current $129.99 price tag for the
comparable version of Vista, which cost $159.99 at launch in
early 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Professional upgrade version of Windows 7 -- aimed at
small companies using multiple computers -- will be on sale
until July 11 at $99.99, then at $199.99 afterwards. The
comparable Vista version is the same price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prices for the full retail versions of the software -- for
customers who want to install the system from scratch rather
than upgrade their existing Windows system -- are also being
reduced or held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft will sell the full Home Premium version of
Windows 7 for $199.99, 17 percent less than the comparable
Vista version. Full versions of the more advanced Professional
and Ultimate editions will be unchanged at $299.99 and $319.99
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To further tempt buyers, Microsoft said it was making a
free upgrade option available to computer makers, meaning that
customers who buy a PC or laptop with all but the most basic
Vista versions from Friday should be able to get a free upgrade
to the equivalent Windows 7 version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How that offer is made available to customers is up to the
individual PC makers such as Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), Dell
Inc DELL.O and Acer (2353.TW).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and the manufacturers are hoping such an offer
will avoid a sudden drop-off in already falling PC sales by
persuading customers not to hold off on purchases until Windows
7 is launched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast to the Vista operating system, which was
released in different language versions over several months,
Microsoft said Windows 7 would be available in 14 languages on
Oct. 22 and a further 21 on Oct. 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Versions for sale in Europe will not have Microsoft's
Internet Explorer 8 web browser included, due to the company's
recent decision to detach it in the face of a pending European
Commission antitrust ruling on charges that Microsoft does not
allow fair competition among browsers by including its own on
its operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Microsoft said it will make IE8 available as a
separate package for no extra charge. Customers can also
install a competing browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said on Thursday it will only offer full versions
of Windows 7 in Europe rather than both full and upgrade
versions. For a short time it is offering the Home Premium
version for 49 euros ($68) and the Professional version for 99
euros ($138).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also said the packaging of discs for the
operating system was being reduced and would use recyclable
plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (1 euro = $1.39)

&lt;p&gt;PALO ALTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
HP (NYSE:HPQ) today announced it will offer the Microsoft Windows 7 operating
system on consumer and business PCs beginning Oct. 22. 

To meet customers` computing needs while protecting their investments, the
company is participating in the Windows Upgrade Option Program to help customers
transition easily to Windows 7. The program will enable customers who purchase
qualifying HP PCs to enjoy the benefits of a new Windows-based PC immediately
and receive a free(1) upgrade to Windows 7 when it becomes available in October.


Customers who purchase an HP PC starting today may be eligible for the upgrade
program. HP customers can visit www.hp.com/go/windows7upgrade to check for
upgrade eligibility, register and get answers about their PCs and current
operating systems. Following general availability of Windows 7 on Oct. 22,
qualifying customers will receive the Windows 7 upgrade and an upgrade utility
disk(2) with a step-by-step guide for installation at their convenience.(3)

Throughout the development of Windows 7, HP has had an unprecedented level of
collaboration with Microsoft to improve the user experience. HP has made a
significant investment in hardware and software testing to ensure broad
compatibility and a satisfying technology experience across its commercial and
consumer PC portfolios. 

"HP has helped guide Microsoft through the development of Windows 7,
collaborating and offering unique insight and counsel on emerging technologies,"

Group, HP. "Because of this early collaboration, HP has engineered truly
innovative PCs - from our thin and light notebooks and high-performance desktops
to our acclaimed TouchSmart PCs - providing advanced performance, compelling
user experiences and more functionality overall." 

For more than two years, HP`s collaboration with Microsoft has consisted of
sharing industry best practices and technology for mobility, touch innovation
and printing, and working to ensure a good customer experience when upgrading to
Windows 7. 

"We are thrilled with the level of collaboration between HP and Microsoft
throughout the development of Windows 7," said Nick Parker, general manager,
Worldwide Sales for HP, Microsoft. "Through the Windows Upgrade Option program,
we can help our joint customers get new PCs now and get ready to experience the
innovation and simplification that Windows 7 delivers." 

To help simplify the Windows 7 upgrade process, the HP Upgrade Assistant will
identify and preinstall most necessary drivers.(2) The HP Support website will
continue to be updated with drivers, allowing customers to easily update their
PCs without the burden of researching and downloading drivers for graphic cards
and attached peripheral hardware. 

HP PCs with Windows Vista on the market today meet the hardware requirements(4)
to run the Windows 7 operating system. Customers can continue to purchase new
PCs from HP with the confidence that they will run the Windows 7 operating
system when it becomes available later this year. 

Customers can join the conversation about the upcoming launch of Windows 7 on
the HP Consumer Support Forum or HP Business Support Forum for businesses. More
information about HP`s Windows Upgrade Option Program is available at
www.hp.com/go/windows7.

Simpana 8 Software Reduces Storage Infrastructure Costs for Microsoft Customers

* CommVault Simpana software leverages a Singular Information Management
approach to ensure superior data management and seamless integration with
Microsoft applications in virtualized (Hyper-V) and non-virtualized
environments, including Microsoft Windows Server 2008, Microsoft Exchange Server
2007, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, Microsoft
FAST content indexing, Microsoft Office Communications Server and Active
Directory. 
* Simpana software takes advantage of an expandable set of application modules
all developed on a single underlying code base to simplify enterprise data
management and maximize overall cost efficiencies. The integration of modules
for backup and recovery, archiving, replication, resource management and search,
including Microsoft FAST content indexing, enables customers to streamline data
growth management, lower overall costs, increase operational efficiencies and
reduce compliance risks. 
* Simpana 8 includes the industry's first global embedded software
deduplication, which spans both disk and tape tiers of storage more affordably
and more easily than the approaches used by hardware-based deduplication
appliances. With Simpana`s deduplication, Microsoft customers can use a simple
Windows Server and commodity disk as a deduplication target at a more attractive
price point than a comparable dedicated appliance. CommVault's unique,
end-to-end approach expands the benefits of block-level deduplication for
Windows file data, Exchange Server 2007 and Office SharePoint Server 2007 across
all backup and archive copies within an organization, resulting in
cost-effective scaling and increased performance across the entire data
management infrastructure. 
* CommVault`s software is "Release Independent," which helps simplify and
accelerate new installations or upgrades to Microsoft Office SharePoint Server
2007, Windows SharePoint Services 3.0, Exchange Server 2007 or the latest
version of Windows. 
* CommVault`s truly unified, single-platform approach also facilitates granular
recovery to ease the management of Exchange Server 2007 environments as well as
SharePoint, SQL, Office Communications Server, Active Directory and ADAM.

FSA Group Takes Advantage of Microsoft, Simpana software and FAST to Streamline
IT

* FSA Group, a financial services firm based in Sydney, Australia, standardized
on Windows Server 2003 and other core Microsoft software to streamline IT
operations. The company also deployed CommVault Simpana software for unified
data management, archiving, replication and resource management. 
* Using technology from FAST, FSA Group reports that it retrieves archived
documents in seconds instead of hours, which saves up to 40 hours a month on
user requests. FSA also claims that it has achieved "five nines" uptime while
streamlining its Microsoft software upgrades. 
* "CommVault Simpana is so well integrated with Microsoft software, it`s almost
like they were designed together," says Fred El-Tahche, chief information
officer of FSA Group. "There`s a lot of integration between CommVault software,
Windows search functionality and Active Directory, which makes setting up
permissions simple. It`s also so much easier now that we work with a single
console for data backup, recovery, archiving and email compliance."

Supporting Quotes

* "We are proud to once again receive this coveted recognition as a Microsoft
Partner of the Year finalist," says Randy De Meno, CommVault`s chief evangelist
and Microsoft relationship. "This latest honor and the continuing support from
Microsoft`s customers around the world further validates our decision to build
our core technology on the Microsoft platform. Our seamless integration and
compatibility with Microsoft technology has enabled CommVault to rapidly add new
features and functionality to our heterogeneous data management solution while
ensuring fully optimized Windows support." 
* "Over the years the enhancements to the Windows Server platform have enabled
us to rapidly extend the capabilities of CommVault`s Simpana software," says
Anand Prahlad, senior vice president of engineering for CommVault. "As a result,
we have been able to provide our customers with a better storage management
experience, which has been acknowledged by Microsoft in designating CommVault a
finalist for this prestigious award." 
* "Partners are the key to igniting business innovation through great technology
as well as helping customer drive down costs," said Allison L. Watson, corporate
vice president, worldwide partner group, Microsoft Corp. "Congratulations to the
2009 WPC Award finalists who have demonstrated a superior level of expertise as
well as a focus on delivering customer value. We look forward to seeing these
partners fulfill their limitless potential as they continue to provide customers
with world-class Microsoft solutions."

&lt;p&gt; * Progression-free survival 11.1 months vs 5.5 months

 * Result highly statistically significant

 * Study halted early due to Sutent benefit

 By Bill Berkrot

 NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) Sutent
delayed the worsening of the type of pancreatic cancer that
afflicted Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Steve Jobs by more
than five months longer than a placebo, according to data from
a clinical trial.

 The study, which involved 154 patients with advanced
pancreatic islet cell tumors, was stopped early by independent
safety monitors because Sutent had demonstrated significant
benefit and had met the primary goal of the trial.

 Median progression-free survival -- the time it took for
the disease to worsen in half the patients -- was 11.1 months
for those who took Sutent compared with 5.5 months in the
placebo group, according to data presented on Thursday at the
World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer meeting in
Barcelona.

 The result was deemed to be highly statistically
significant.

 "In this study, Sutent demonstrated an impressive
improvement in progression-free survival for patients with
pancreatic islet cell tumors," Dr. Eric Raymond, lead
investigator of the Phase III trial, said in a statement.

 "This is encouraging news for patients, especially given
that there are limited treatment options for this type of
advanced cancer," Raymond said.

 Apple's Jobs underwent surgery for the disease in 2004. He
recently had a liver transplant, but it was not clear if that
was related to the pancreatic cancer.

 Sutent, known chemically as sunitinib, is currently
approved to treat advanced kidney cancer and gastrointestinal
stromal tumor, a cancer of the digestive system.

 Pancreatic islet cell tumors, also known as neuroendocrine
tumors, are a rare form of the disease affecting two to four
people per million worldwide annually, or about 5 percent of
pancreatic cancer cases, according to the National Cancer
Institute. An expanded approval to include the disease would
likely not add significantly to Sutent revenue.

 Patients in the study had malignant tumors that had
progressed in the last 12 months. All received best supportive
care plus either Sutent or a placebo.

 The most common adverse events in patients who received
Sutent included low white blood cells, high blood pressure,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, low blood sugar and swelling of the
hands and feet. These were similar to side effects seen in
previous Sutent studies, Pfizer said.

 Mace Rothenberg, head of clinical development and medical
affairs for Pfizer's oncology business unit, called the study's
results welcome news, "as there is currently no standard of
care for patients with pancreatic islet cell tumors who
progress on prior therapy."

 Full analysis of the data is ongoing, Pfizer said.

&lt;p&gt;New Data from a Phase 3 Trial Presented
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer today announced results from a randomized Phase 3 trial of Sutent
(sunitinib malate) in patients with advanced pancreatic islet cell tumors, also
known as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, which is a different type of cancer
than the more common pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Study findings demonstrated that
median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.1 months in patients treated with
Sutent compared to 5.5 months in patients treated with placebo. Researchers
today presented these data at the 11th World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer
in Barcelona, Spain. The independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended
halting the trial earlier this year because Sutent showed significant benefit
and the study had met its primary endpoint. Full analysis of the data is
ongoing. 

"In this study, Sutent demonstrated an impressive improvement in
progression-free survival for patients with pancreatic islet cell tumors," said
Dr. Eric Raymond, MD, PhD, Professor of Medical Oncology and Head of University
Department of Medical Oncology (Service Inter Hospitalier de Cancerologie)
Bichat-Beaujon, Clichy, France, and lead investigator on this sunitinib Phase 3
study. "This is encouraging news for patients, especially given that there are
limited treatment options for this type of advanced cancer." 

Phase 3 Trial Results

This international, Phase 3 trial compared sunitinib to placebo in patients with
progressive, well-differentiated, malignant pancreatic islet cell tumors who had
progressed in the last 12 months. Patients were randomized to either the
sunitinib (n=75) (37.5 mg/day, continuous daily dosing) plus best supportive
care arm or the placebo plus best supportive care arm (n=79). 

Results showed that median PFS was 11.1 months in patients treated with
sunitinib compared to 5.5 months in patients treated in the placebo arm (Hazard
ratio 0.397, p&lt;0.001). 

Adverse events were similar to those observed in other sunitinib studies. The
most commonly reported grade 3-4 adverse events in the sunitinib arm were
neutropenia (12.3 percent), hypertension (8.8 percent), abdominal pain (7
percent), diarrhea (7 percent), hypoglycemia (7 percent) and hand-foot syndrome
(7 percent). 

This trial was initiated based on the results of an earlier Phase 2 trial of 107
patients published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (July 2008). A 16.7
percent overall objective response rate (RECIST) and 56.1 percent stable disease
rate (SD &#8805;6 months) were seen in the 66 patients with advanced pancreatic islet
cell tumors treated with sunitinib. 

"The observation of substantial improvement in progression-free survival in
Sutent-treated patients was the basis for the independent Data Monitoring
Committee`s recommendation to halt accrual to the study early," said Dr. Mace
Rothenberg, Senior Vice President of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs
for Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit. "This is welcome news, as there is
currently no standard of care for patients with pancreatic islet cell tumors who
progress on prior therapy." 

About Pancreatic Islet Cell Tumors

In contrast to exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinoma, pancreatic islet cell tumors
are rare, indolent tumors of the endocrine pancreas with an incidence of two to
four people per million annually worldwide. Pancreatic islet cell tumors include
insulinomas, glucagonomas and gastrinomas. Current treatment options are
limited. 

About Sutent() (sunitinib malate)

Sutent, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, is currently approved for both advanced
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and second-line gastrointestinal stromal tumor
(GIST), based on efficacy and safety data from large, randomized Phase 3
clinical trials. Sutent has played an important role in reshaping the treatment
landscape for these two difficult-to-treat cancers. To date, more than 60,000
patients globally have been treated with Sutent. 

Sutent works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important Sutent targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. Sutent also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Sunitinib Clinical Research Program

Pfizer is pursuing a broad development program for sunitinib malate and is
studying its role in the potential treatment of various solid tumors. 

Healthcare professionals who are interested in learning more about sunitinib
trials that are open for enrollment can visit the SUN program web site at
www.suntrials.com. Patients with questions should contact their treating
physician or obtain additional information through Pfizer, by calling
1-800-879-3477. 

Important Sutent() (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on Sutent. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with Sutent. 

The most common adverse reactions in advanced RCC and GIST clinical trials were
fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia,
abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin
discoloration, altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

&lt;p&gt; * Deal, seen worth about $903 mln, may be unveiled by June
30&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Seen as necessary to compete with rival park in Shanghai
 (Recasts with new sourcing, adds byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By James Pomfret&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, June 25 (Reuters) - Hong Kong has reached a deal
with the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) to expand the local Disney
theme park, seen as necessary to bolster the park's long-term
prospects against a Shanghai rival, a government source said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreement is expected to be announced by June 30, with
details of the deal to be laid out to local legislators in a
special meeting next Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government source, who asked not to be named, said the
meeting's agenda would include the Disneyland deal and that a
media report on the imminent announcement "was largely
accurate".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hong Kong Economic Times on Thursday reported that the
deal was expected to be worth HK$7 billion ($903.3 million) of
which HK$4 billion would be used for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a Disney spokeswoman in the United States told Reuters
that discussions were ongoing and that there was "no" deal yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The size of Hong Kong Disneyland, the smallest of Disney's
magic kingdoms, is expected to almost double, with construction
to begin within a year, pending approval from the city's
legislative council in July, the newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hong Kong government, which owns 57 percent of the
underperforming resort, desperately needs the expansion to
boost flagging attendance, with a much larger rival Disneyland
expected to be built in Shanghai in 2014 that could draw much
visitor traffic from the burgeoning mainland China market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At this stage, we have to support the expansion, otherwise
it will be very difficult to compete with Shanghai in five to
six years time," said legislator Fred Li of the Democratic
Party, who said his party backed the expansion as long as
Disney boosted its financial transparency in future on
attendance figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong's Financial Secretary John Tsang travelled to Los
Angeles in May, where he met senior Disney executives. The trip
is seen to have paved the way for the breakthrough after Disney
earlier said it would stall any expansion amid the credit
crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) earlier indicated it would
likely invest more capital in Hong Kong Disneyland and allow
the Hong Kong government to convert its loans to equity to
maintain its majority share of the theme park, a source
involved in their talks told Reuters earlier.

&lt;p&gt;Showing again the power of Twitter for quick social organizing, Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday was forced to defend itself against complaints that its market-leading Outlook e-mail program wreaks havoc on rich-HTML e-mails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outlook 2007 and the upcoming Outlook 2010's use of Microsoft Word to display rich HTML content is to blame, according to blog posts by Dave Greiner, the Sydney, Australia-based organizer of the protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greiner, whose firm sells e-mail marketing software called Campaign Monitor, argues that Word's poor display of HTML code results in garbled layouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greiner posted online how Outlook 2000 and 2010 display the same image-laden e-mail in a side-by-side comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though a slighty esoteric tech issue that most directly affects e-mail publishers and advertisers, it was seized upon by outraged Twitter users, no doubt for its similarity to Microsoft's long reluctance to have Internet Explorer follow accepted and de facto standards on displaying Web pages, something that Microsoft said would change last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greiner's Web site, Fixoutlook.org, was mentioned by about 20,000 tweets by the late afternoon U.S. east coast time, less than 24 hours after it was launched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That allowed the issue to overtake tweets about Transformers 2 starlet Megan Fox, and catching up to those about Iran's controversial presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlook 2000 used Internet Explorer to display HTML, which Greiner would like to see Outlook 2007 return to, or have Word made compliant with what Greiner says are existing HTML standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft defended itself in a blog entry posted on Wednesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft corporate vice-president for Office communications and forms, William Kennedy, confirmed that Microsoft plans to continue using Word as its HTML rendering engine in Outlook 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy disagreed that Word was not up to the task, saying it "has always done a great job of displaying the HTML which is commonly found in e-mails around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word is also more secure against phishing and virus attacks sent via HTML e-mail, he said, because "Word cannot run Web script or other active content that may threaten the security and safety of our customers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlook isn't the only e-mail program Greiner criticizes for going against accepted HTML standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's Gmail, IBM's Lotus Notes 8 and Windows Live Hotmail , Microsoft's consumer Web mail service, all display HTML e-mails poorly, Greiner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Google spokeswoman said in an e-mail that "[Google is] always looking to improve the way Gmail works, but we don't have anything new to announce regarding HTML support." IBM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greiner said he is singling out Outlook because of its No. 1 position in the market. "If Microsoft can shift to a standards-based approach for Outlook 2010, you'll see a lot more pressure on other e-mail clients to follow suit," he wrote yesterday (Australia time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy gave no indication that Microsoft would make any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Microsoft's determination to use Word is driven by the need to serve Outlook's primary customers: corporate workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Word to display rich e-mails in Outlook ensures that presentations, tables and charts created in Word by businesspeople will display properly when they are sent to co-workers using Outlook for e-mail, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designers concerned about ensuring their rich e-mails are displayed properly in Word and Outlook, said Kennedy, can refer guidelines published by Microsoft, Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that using Word for HTML is not an issue of Microsoft flouting standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no widely-recognized consensus in the industry about what subset of HTML is appropriate for use in e-mail for interoperability," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The 'Email Standards Project' does not represent a sanctioned standard or an industry consensus in this area. Should such a consensus arise, we will of course work with other e-mail vendors to provide rich support in our products," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt; * Senators want trial to run without U.S. interference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Chevron believes it cannot get a fair trial in Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, June 26 (Reuters) - Four senators have
written to U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, criticizing what
they understand is a push by Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to cut trade
benefits for Ecuador, where the oil company faces a $27 billion
claim in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We request that you allow the legal proceedings in Ecuador
to take their course without any undue intervention from the
U.S. government," the senators' letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A ruling in the long-running case over pollution of the
Ecuadorean jungle has been expected some time this year, but
the company has argued that public criticism of Chevron by
Ecuador President Rafael Correa makes a fair trial impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is our understanding that Chevron is seeking the
threatened withdrawal of the Andean Trade Preference Benefits
for Ecuador if this lawsuit moves forward," said the letter,
which was seen by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The letter, dated June 25, was signed by Democratic
Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon, Richard Durbin of Illinois,
Robert Casey of Pennsylvania and Patrick Leahy of Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron spokesman was not immediately available to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Corporate responsibility at home and abroad is critical,
particularly when it concerns human health and the
environment," the senators' letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2006, Leahy and then-Senator Barack Obama had urged the
U.S. trade representative to ignore Chevron's campaign to
exclude Ecuador from trade negotiations if the Ecuadorean
government did not shut down the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The four senators also said in the latest letter that it
was their understanding that Chevron earlier this decade had
urged a federal U.S. court to transfer the case to Ecuador,
"submitting 14 sworn affidavits from experts praising the
courts of Ecuador as fair and adequate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has said it is facing a "trial lawyer"-led campaign
to force it to settle in the case, including a shareholder
proposal for an environmental protection report that received
about 7 percent of the vote at its annual meeting last month at
Chevron headquarters in San Ramon, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has asked Chevron to
disclose information to investors about its potential liability
in Ecuador, though Chevron says it has communicated fully with
its shareholders. [ID:nN07374919]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 30,000 Ecuadorean plaintiffs say Texaco -- bought by
Chevron in 2001 -- polluted the jungle and damaged their health
by dumping billions of gallons of contaminated water over more
than two decades, before the company left in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a separate letter this month, Democratic Representatives
Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania and James McGovern of Massachusetts
wrote Kirk to say the Ecuadoreans "deserve their day in court"
and ask that his office and U.S. trade preferences not be used
as "pawns in the service of a corporate legal strategy."

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge turned down a request from International Business Machines Corp to bar its former head of mergers and acquisitions from working at Dell Inc over allegations that he would disclose trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ruling means the executive, David Johnson, will be able to continue to work as Dell's senior vice president of corporate strategy while IBM proceeds with a lawsuit that claims he violated a non-compete agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It often takes several years for such suits to work their way through the court system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM spokesman Doug Shelton said his company intended to appeal Friday's ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MA is a priority for both companies, which are looking to add technologies that will differentiate their products at a time when global technology spending is slumping.

In an amended complaint on Thursday, IBM said Johnson secretly misused company facilities, resources and personnel to help create a venture capital firm, JSJ Capital Management, to invest in technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He misled his superiors about his activities, secretly undertaken on his own behalf, misrepresented the nature and scope of his planned activities at Dell," said IBM's complaint filed in U.S. federal court in White Plains, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson has said in a court filing that he did not have access to confidential information at IBM that would provide a competitive advantage to Dell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal District Court Judge Stephen Robinson said in his ruling on Friday that IBM had yet to demonstrate what type of trade secrets Johnson might bring to Dell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Dell spokesman declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson has said he left IBM because the company broke a promise to consider him for a senior position that it made when it asked him to turn down an offer from another firm in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He maintains that the non-compete agreement is invalid because he intentionally signed his name in "the wrong spot" on the document in a bid to win time to work out his differences with his superiors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believed that IBM did not consider the non-compete agreement agreed upon or entered because IBM returned to me the one I had signed in the wrong spot unexecuted and asked me to sign a new form," Johnson said in an affidavit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his order, Judge Robinson said Johnson's argument appeared to have merit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Following its receipt of Mr. Johnson's improperly executed agreement, IBM's actions raise significant doubts as to whether it believed that Mr. Johnson had accepted its offer to enter into a non-competition agreement," he said in the order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is IBM vs. David Johnson, 09-cv-04826, U.S. States District Court, Southern District of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Chakradhar Adusumilli; Editing by Derek Caney, Richard Chang and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Rap star Coolio pleaded guilty on Friday to possession of cocaine and will avoid jail by entering an 18-month drug rehabilitation program, a spokeswoman for prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coolio, who had hits in the mid-1990s with "Gangsta's Paradise" and "Fantastic Voyage," faced three years in prison if convicted of all the charges against him, said Jane Robison, spokeswoman for the L.A. County District Attorney's Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charges stem from Coolio's March 6 arrest at Los Angeles International Airport, where authorities searched his luggage and found cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coolio resisted arrest, but in exchange for his guilty plea authorities said they dropped a charge of battery against him, as well as a charge of possession of a smoking device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coolio's real name is Artis Ivey. In recent years his recording career took a nose dive. He has acted on a number television shows, and earlier this year he starred in UK program "Celebrity Big Brother."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis: Editing by Bob Tourtellotte)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Tehran's U.N. envoy on Friday accused the United States of denying Iran's first vice president and members of his delegation visas to attend a U.N. conference on the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I am indeed delivering this speech on behalf of Dr. (Parviz) Davoudi, first vice president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who along with members of the Iranian delegation was not able to participate in the conference," Iranian U.N. Ambassador Mohammad Khazaee told the U.N. General Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their entry visas were not issued by the host country," he added, referring to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not clear whether the alleged visa denial was related to the Iranian government's crackdown on demonstrators who protesting against what they say was a rigged presidential election in which hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. official said he was looking into the allegation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington cut off diplomatic relations with Tehran in 1980, five months after Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. They held 52 Americans captive for 444 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As host country of the U.N. Secretariat in New York, Washington has followed a policy of issuing visas for members of U.N. delegations, in line with a 1947 pact with the United Nations, regardless of disputes with individual countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it does sometimes refuse entry to Iranian government officials and professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan Ambassador Jorge Valero Briceno told the conference his country's chief delegate, Finance Minister Ali Rodriguez, also had problems with his visa because the U.S. embassy in Caracas had "created obstacles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not the first time that such an event has taken place with a high official of the Bolivarian (Venezuelan) government," he said. An official at the Venezuelan mission said Rodriguez was expected to arrive later on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally Venezuela's left-wing President Hugo Chavez had been scheduled to attend but later decided to send Rodriguez.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Initial Claims Head Back Up

Instead of spending less than they were earning, people relied on asset
appreciation -- in both equities and real estate. As the appreciation turned to
depreciation, people were left with very little to fall back on. If the house is
underwater, there is no way to tap the equity in the house to make ends meet
until a new job is found. Instead, people turn to their credit cards (assuming
that their credit limits have not been slashed) as a last resort source of
liquidity. When they max the cards out, they start to default. 

This is a key reason why the credit card charge off rate is now at a record high
10.62% as of May, a sharp rise from 9.97% in April. This is very bad news for
the big players in the credit card market including American Express (NYSE:
AXP), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Capital One (NYSE: COF) and J.P. Morgan
(NYSE: JPM). 

GRO Misses Filing Deadline Again

This morning Agria Corp. (NYSE: GRO) announced that they would be unable to
complete their 20-F annual report for the period ending December 31, 2009 by the
required June 30, 2009 filing date. 

Agria attributed the delay to their inability to complete their financial
statements due to two ongoing investigations being conducted by independent
firms. The investigations surround the valuation of sheep and date tree assets,
the authenticity of certain sales contracts, bank statements and tax invoices of
P3A, and the verification of titles of farm land which were leased by P3A in
2008.

agreement agreed upon or entered because IBM returned to me the
one I had signed in the wrong spot unexecuted and asked me to
sign a new form," Johnson said in an affidavit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his order, Judge Robinson said Johnson's argument
appeared to have merit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Following its receipt of Mr. Johnson's improperly executed

it believed that Mr. Johnson had accepted its offer to enter
into a non-competition agreement," he said in the order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is IBM vs. David Johnson, 09-cv-04826, U.S. States

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) has snapped up market share for its investment banking unit and, amid the financial crisis, its large balance sheet may put it in a position to threaten Wall Street's dominant investment bank, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts largely expect the investment banking unit at the second-largest U.S. bank to again report strong second-quarter results, following record first-quarter revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A retail giant with a reputation for conservative risk-taking, JPMorgan has survived the financial crisis and benefited from its acquisition of near-collapsed investment bank Bear Stearns Cos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan can compete with, and beat, Goldman Sachs," said Dick Bove, a veteran banking analyst with Rochdale Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With $2.1 trillion in assets, JPMorgan dwarfs Goldman, which has $925 billion, and also Morgan Stanley (MS.N), the former investment bank traditionally seen as Goldman's closest rival, which has $1.1 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strength of its balance sheet could be an advantage, in particular since these banks this month returned billions to the U.S. government's bank bailout fund, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After TARP, "The cost of capital becomes key, and there JPMorgan has a clear competitive advantage," said George Ball, chairman of wealth and asset manager Sanders Morris Harris Group in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's size means it can lend more to more clients, giving it a better chance to sell other services, Bove said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan comes to the game with massive capital backing and a huge customer list -- it's going to do the greater number of deals," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEVEL PLAYING FIELD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has regularly ranked highly in global league tables for debt and equity underwriting but it has not always had as strong an advisory or proprietary trading effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet in the first quarter, JPMorgan said trading revenue was $2.5 billion versus a negative $1.0 billion in the same period a year earlier. The bank has warned that trading revenues may be volatile, but analysts believe it may be on track to report second-quarter trading revenue similar to the first quarter's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Trading results, while probably not as strong as the first quarter, will still be pretty strong," said Stuart Plesser, equity analyst at Standard  Poor's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the same period, Goldman -- which has sometimes been accused of acting more like a hedge fund than a bank -- has seen its proprietary investing hamstrung by new capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Morgan Stanley converted to bank holding companies in the fall, after investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, to reassure investors and gain access to Federal Reserve lending facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As bank holding companies, the former investment banks cannot leverage their balance sheets as they did in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The banks and the two surviving brokerage firms are really now on a level playing field in terms of trading," said Brad Hintz, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Goldman's investment bank is expected to perform well in the second quarter. Analysts at FBR Capital Markets on Tuesday raised their second-quarter estimate for the company, citing likely gains from a favorable trading and capital markets environment. It is also possible -- although the bank has denied this -- that Goldman may seek to shed its bank holding company status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's investment bank dominated the second quarter with global estimated second-quarter investment banking fees of $2 billion compared with $1.32 billion for Goldman Sachs, according to an exclusive tabulation by Thomson Reuters including income from merger and acquisition advisory activities, equity, debt and loan issuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan saw a drop of 14 percent in such fees from the year-earlier period, while Goldman suffered a 28 percent drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly, while other competitors may face rising credit losses, or labor to repay government funds, there will be more than enough business for both banks to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not one of those situations where there's only one winner," said Hintz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the near term, JPMorgan's strength and size give it an edge when it comes to winning business in uncertain financial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From the standpoint of force majeure, Goldman can't match JPMorgan at all," said Bove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; On the strength of the $4.3 billion VisaNet VNET3.SA deal
alone, Brazilian banks Banco Bradesco (BBDC4.SA) and Banco do
Brasil (BBAS3.SA) and Spanish bank Banco Santander (SAN.MC)
shot into the ranks of the 10 largest IPO underwriters in the
world so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before that deal, stalwart bookrunners Chinese bank CITIC
(600030.SS) and Citi (C.N) and Poland's Bank Rozwoju Eksportu
SA had underwritten enough business to land in the top 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the VisaNet IPO, the largest ever in Brazil and the
largest of the year so far, global IPO volume remains sluggish,
with total proceeds of $11.7 billion so far in 2009, 85 percent
less than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The top IPO bookrunners globally in the first half are JP
Morgan (JPM.N), UBS (UBSN.VX) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS bumped Morgan Stanley out of its previous second-place
position in the rankings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a result of the VisaNet IPO, UBS bumped Morgan Stanley
out of its previous second-place position in the rankings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please see [ID:nnN26338910] for the IPO league tables.

&lt;p&gt;UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Tehran's U.N. envoy on Friday accused the United States of denying Iran's first vice president and members of his delegation visas to attend a three-day U.N. conference on the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I am indeed delivering this speech on behalf of Dr. (Parviz) Davoudi, first vice president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who along with members of the Iranian delegation was not able to participate in the conference," Iranian U.N. Ambassador Mohammad Khazaee told the U.N. General Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their entry visas were not issued by the host country," he added, referring to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not clear whether the alleged visa denial was related to the Iranian government's crackdown on demonstrators who have been protesting for nearly two weeks against what they say was a rigged presidential election in which hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won a landslide victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. official said he was looking into Khazaee's statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington cut off diplomatic relations with Tehran in 1980 during a hostage crisis in which Iranian militants occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held a group of U.S. diplomats and officials captive for 444 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the host country of the U.N. Secretariat in New York City, Washington has followed a policy of setting aside bilateral disputes with individual countries regarding visas for members of U.N. delegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the United States has continued to grant the visas, it does sometimes refuse entry to Iranian government officials and professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Tehran said the United States denied visas to members of Iran's blind weightlifting team who were hoping to attend an international tournament in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Louis Charbonneau)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds trade comments, regulatory filing details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO, June 26 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil said on Friday a
hydrocracker at its 567,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Baytown,
Texas was back in operation after being shut for unplanned work
on June 18 but the status of other units remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neely Nelson, a spokeswoman for the company, said the
flexicoker was running at the plant, which on Thursday reported
flaring and emissions of hydrogen sulfide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She declined to discuss if there was any impact on other
units at the refinery, which is the largest in the United
State, citing company policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trade sources said that market talk was that the refinery
had "cooling tower issues", which could be impacting a crude
unit, a reformer and one of the refinery's gasoline-making
fluid catalytic cracking units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But there is no confirmation," said one Gulf Coast
products trader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two filings were made over the past week with state
environmental regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most recent filing with the Texas Commission for
Environmental Quality, filed on June 25, cited emissions events
associated with a pump failure beginning on Wednesday, June 24,
which resulted in a loss of cooling water supply, leading to
the shutdown of affected, yet unspecified units, safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monday's filing reported a problem with a boiler associated
with FCCU3, which said unit operations were adjusted to
minimize emissions while the boiler is being restarted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil said there was no impact on production and that
all customer needs were met.

&lt;p&gt;Idris Elba, Eva Pigford and Terri Vaughn Take Music Fans Behind The Scenes and
On the Red Carpet During the "BET Awards `09"


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
What does a hip-hop-loving dog have in common with a rock-and-roll-loving,
bald-headed body builder? On the surface not much, but take a closer look and
there are more commonalities than you might think. That`s the message behind a
new television ad from the current Coca-Cola Open Happiness campaign. 

The 30-second animated spot titled "Do You Speak Coke?" is designed to bring to
life the message that Coke not only refreshes, but helps African American teens
find the commonalities in each other. In the spot, music is the premise for
communicating uniqueness and expressiveness by the two characters representing
different walks of life. But in the end, it is the shared enjoyment of Coca-Cola
that serves as the great connector, bringing together these two very distinct
personalities who ultimately understand, appreciate and even find joy in their
differences. 

To further connect multicultural teens with the spot, Coca-Cola enlisted
Grammy-winning, multi-platinum selling producer and songwriter, DJ Toomp, to
create authentic music for the ad`s soundtrack. 

"Coca-Cola is a universal language, connecting and refreshing people around the
globe who have different interests and backgrounds," said Katie Bayne, chief
marketing officer, Coca-Cola North America (CCNA). "Our new spot demonstrates
this by showing how a simple pleasure such as enjoying a Coca-Cola together can
help people look beyond what`s on the outside and celebrate what makes them
unique." 

The commercial, debuting during the BET Awards `09 on Sunday, June 28 (the
special premieres LIVE at 8:00 p.m. ET), will also run on BET, ABC Family, Adult
Swim, Comedy Central, E!, Fuse, FX, G4, MTV2, the N, Nick at Nite, Spike, TBS,
VH1, and in movie theaters in the U.S. from September through November. 

In addition to the ad`s debut at the BET Awards `09, Coca-Cola is bringing
African American teens all of the glitz and glamour associated with the event
from two of the hottest locations - backstage from the Coca-Cola Studio Red Room
and live from the BET Awards `09 Red Carpet. Beginning July 1, music fans will
be able to access interviews and exclusive content about their favorite
entertainers, as well as go behind-the-scenes for a glimpse of what happens
offstage just by visiting www.bet.com/mycokerewards.com. 

Actors Idris Elba and Eva Pigford will pick up the action backstage as they host
the Coca-Cola Studio Red Room, an exclusive lounge offering a place for
connecting before the show. Elba and Pigford will catch up with celebrities,
including many of the night`s nominees, to find out how they "speak Coke."
Actress Terri Vaughn will be on the BET Awards `09 Red Carpet for Coca-Cola
interviewing 2009 nominees, performers and honorees, along with some of today`s
brightest stars as they arrive for one of the biggest awards shows of the year. 

The brand`s presence at the BET Awards `09 provides another layer to the
summer-long partnership, which also includes the BET contest on its popular
music series 106 &amp; Park. "Our integration into the BET Awards is the next phase
of our BET partnership and the latest example of our commitment to connecting
African American teens to our brands," added Yolanda White, assistant vice
president, African American Marketing, CCNA. "Teens have such a passion for
music that it was a natural fit for us to bring them the BET Awards in a way no
other brand can."

RUKARA, Rwanda--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil, in partnership with Malaria No More and Project Rwanda, announced
the Bikes for Rukara project today in Rwanda. 

The program will provide bicycles to community health workers at the Rukara
Health Facility, a faith-based operation in partnership with the government of
Rwanda, to help reach more families with their life-saving malaria prevention
programs. Bikes for Rukara is part of ExxonMobil`s commitment to supporting
organizations working to combat malaria. 

ExxonMobil`s Medical Director for Global Health Issues, Dr. Steven Phillips, is
in Rwanda as part of a United Nations delegation to examine the role of
faith-based institutions in helping to control malaria and was at the launch of
the bicycle project. 

"We are proud to be supporting the Rukara Health Facility, whose efforts have
demonstrated the effectiveness of malaria prevention and treatment programs,"
said Phillips. "These bicycles will increase the health workers` abilities to
significantly broaden community outreach and impact." 

Rukara is viewed as a model by the Rwandan government for tackling global health
issues. 

John Bridgeland, Vice Chairman of Malaria No More, Senior Advisor to the UN
Special Envoy for Malaria, and Board member of the Center for Interfaith Action,
learned of the community health workers` need for bicycles to visit more homes
in their village and surrounding villages to expand their network. 

ExxonMobil is spending $10,000 to distribute bicycles to the community health
workers supporting the company`s goal to strengthen the ability of Africans to
stop the spread of malaria. 

ExxonMobil is the largest non-pharmaceutical corporate donor to malaria research
and development efforts, and since 2000 has committed $130 million to Africa
community outreach programs, including $54 million on programs to fight malaria.
The company established its Africa Health Initiative in 2000 in support of the
Abuja Declaration on Roll Back Malaria in Africa and its goal to halve malaria
deaths by 2010. Since then, ExxonMobil has developed on-the-ground
public-private partnerships to fight malaria at the community level, progress
treatment and vaccine research and raise awareness and international support,
and contributes to anti-malaria efforts in more than 20 African countries.

&lt;p&gt; * Former exec, now at Dell, says IBM owes him $1.49 mln&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * IBM suit is over non-compete agreement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Court likely to rule on injunction on Friday
 (Adding details from Johnson's court filings)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jim Finkle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, June 26 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) accused its former
mergers and acquisitions chief of misusing resources, as part
of a lawsuit that seeks to remove him from his new job at rival
Dell Inc DELL.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The suit claims the executive, David Johnson, violated a
noncompete agreement by moving to Dell and bringing trade
secrets with him. Both companies are looking to acquisitions to
add technologies that will differentiate their products at a
time when global technology spending is slumping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a separate document filed on Thursday, Johnson accused
International Business Machines Corp of withholding $1.49
million from a retirement plan that he said was due to him upon
his departure from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Robinson is expected to
rule later on Friday on IBM's request to issue a restraining
order that could force him to leave his job at Dell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The technology giant filed the original lawsuit in May
after Johnson left for Dell, saying he violated a 2005
noncompete agreement. Johnson, whose lawyer could not be
reached for comment on Friday, has maintained that the document
is invalid because it was not properly signed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an amended complaint on Thursday, IBM said Johnson
secretly misused company facilities, resources and personnel to
help create a venture capital firm, JSJ Capital Management, to
invest in technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM alleged Johnson prepared investor presentations with
company resources and used an IBM-funded trip to the Middle
East to cultivate potential investors for JSJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said there was a "grave risk" Johnson would disclose
the company's proprietary information to its rival Dell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He misled his superiors about his activities, secretly
undertaken on his own behalf, misrepresented the nature and
scope of his planned activities at Dell," said IBM's complaint
filed in U.S. federal court in White Plains, New York, on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dell spokesman Jess Blackburn said Johnson began work at
the company earlier this month, but declined to discuss his job
responsibilities or comment on the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnson has said in a court filing that he did not have
access to confidential information at IBM that would provide a
competitive advantage to Dell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said that he left IBM because the company broke a
promise to consider him for a senior position that it made when
it asked him to turn down an offer from another firm in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnson maintains that the noncompete agreement is invalid
because he intentionally signed his name in "the wrong spot" on
the document in a bid to win time to work out his differences
with his superiors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I believed that IBM did not consider the noncompete agreement agreed upon or entered because IBM returned to me
the one I had signed in the wrong spot unexecuted and asked me
to sign a new form," Johnson said in an affidavit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM spokesman Doug Shelton declined to comment on the
charges levied by Johnson about the retirement account, saying
the court documents speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is IBM vs. David Johnson, 09-cv-04826, U.S. States
District Court, Southern District of New York.

&lt;p&gt;* Grant promotes education and careers in science, technology, engineering and

* ExxonMobil total support for SECME now more than $2.5 million

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil has awarded a $300,000 grant to the Atlanta-based SECME - a
non-profit alliance of universities, school districts, industrial and
governmental organizations - to help promote education and career opportunities
in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) for young minority
students. 

"ExxonMobil believes it is critical to America`s future competitiveness to
encourage U.S. students, in particular young women and under-represented
minority groups, to pursue careers in science, technology, education and math,"
said Truman Bell, senior program officer for education and diversity at
ExxonMobil. "SECME has an established record of success in helping promote
education and careers within the STEM fields." 

Michele Williams, interim executive director of SECME, said ExxonMobil has a
strong history of support. "ExxonMobil continues to show its dedication toward
assisting young minority students through this contribution," said Williams. "We
know the work done through SECME is making a difference in the lives of many
young people each year, and the scope of our work is significantly increased
through our continued relationship with ExxonMobil." 

Over the past 10 years, ExxonMobil has given more than $2.5 million to SECME to
support its educational programs, including its Summer Institute for teachers;
K-12 in-service professional development component; national and state program
development; and ExxonMobil SECME Scholars. The 2009 ExxonMobil contribution
will again support a summer teachers institute and other programs including a
scholarship program for young people pursing engineering and related fields. 

In surveys of graduating high school seniors who had participated in SECME, more
than 90 percent said they planned to enroll in college and 50 percent said they
will major in STEM related fields. The goal of SECME is to enhance the positive
experiences that middle and high school students have with math and science and

&lt;p&gt; (Adds JP Morgan strategists' comments, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 26 (Reuters) - The Standard  Poor's 500 index .SPX
is likely to see a correction to between 830 and 875 through
September, given its virtually uninterrupted rise since its
March lows, J.P. Morgan Securities said and urged investors to
use the correction to build positions in cyclical stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This correction could be followed by a strong rally to
between 950 and 1000 by the end of 2009, JP Morgan strategists
wrote in a note dated June 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A correction, even if it is two months in duration, we
believe should be used as an opportunity to build positions in
cyclicals, rather than a window to buy defensives," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan strategists upgraded U.S. industrials and
materials sectors to "overweight" from "neutral" in
anticipation of continued outperformance of cyclical stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For both, we believe visibility and earnings recovery will
not happen until later in this recovery," the strategists said.
"But... the groups have typically outperformed even as earnings
have deteriorated," they added. The SP 500 index has risen 32
percent since its March lows and much of this move has been
powered by cyclicals -- discretionary, technology, industrials
and materials -- and financials, JP Morgan strategists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They see a global synchronized economic recovery, with the
recent rise in equity markets eventually leading to a
four-to-six quarters of above-trend growth sometime in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 index gained 19.32 points, or 2.14 percent, to
close at 920.26 Thursday. The SP 500 is up 36 percent from a
12-year closing low hit on March 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 slid 0.28 percent by 1244 GMT
Friday.

&lt;p&gt;June 26 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) filed a complaint in a U.S. federal court in
New York alleging its former chief of mergers and acquisitions misused company
resources for his personal benefit, court documents show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an amended complaint filed on Thursday, IBM said its findings showed

facilities to prepare presentations for potential JSJ investors and used
IBM-funded trip to the Middle East to cultivate potential investors for JSJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said there was a "grave risk" Johnson would disclose IBM's proprietary
information to its rival Dell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnson's lawyer could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is IBM v. David Johnson, 09-cv-04826, U.S. States District Court,

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Too many regulators will only increase costs and reduce credit opportunities for consumers, JPMorgan Chase  Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon warned in a column he wrote in Saturday's Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While praising President Barack Obama's efforts to reform the U.S. financial system, Dimon said the emphasis should be on strengthening existing regulators over creating new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any regulatory overhaul should ensure that governmental oversight of the financial system is efficient," wrote Dimon, who is widely regarded as the top banker to have been least tarnished by the financial crisis. "We should avoid the temptation to have multiple regulators just for the sake of having them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Three or four different regulators all looking at (and fighting over) the same issue is not a wise use of taxpayer money," he said. "Companies can't operate that way. Neither should the government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama last week unveiled a sweeping package of reforms to rewrite the rules for banks and capital markets in response to a severe financial crisis that has dragged down economies worldwide for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said he supports the creation of a single bank regulator, a move he said was long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another major Obama goal is to do more to protect consumers by transferring consumer protection dealing with mortgages, credit cards, payday loans and other financial products out of 10 agencies and into a new agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon agreed with the need to boost consumer protection but warned regulators must be careful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before creating an entirely new federal bureaucracy, policy makers should first examine ways to strengthen and refocus the authority of existing regulators," he wrote. "Creating duplicative and overlapping functions could increase costs and reduce credit opportunities for the consumers we are trying to protect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key catalyst for the financial crisis has been the enormous amount of debt shouldered by Americans during a real estate bubble fueled by subprime mortgages that many borrowers could not afford or understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As defaults and foreclosures rose last year, exotic financial instruments backed by shaky mortgages broke down and the capital markets froze for a time amid uncertainty about the condition of banks' balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combined effects helped drag the United States into recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said financial institutions need to clean up their act and earn back the public's trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Company leadership must foster a culture within their institutions that focuses on integrity, strong execution, quality products, long-term value creation and doing the right thing," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Golden parachutes, special contracts, and unreasonable perks must disappear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ben Klayman; Editing by Bill Trott)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Billboard) - Ashley Tisdale knows it sounds silly, but her new album has a lot to do with the color of her hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"For the last few years everyone has thought of me as Sharpay," the 23-year-old singer/actor says, referring to her blonde-and-bubbly character in Disney's smash "High School Musical" films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So after I'd finished all the promotion for 'High School Musical 3' I dyed my hair back to its original color. I'd been a blonde for five years; Disney wanted us to be those characters. But the new songs I was working on felt edgier, sort of back to how I was before 'High School Musical.' I wanted to show people a side of me they haven't seen before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tisdale accomplishes that -- well, sort of -- on "Guilty Pleasure," due July 28 from Warner Bros. Like her 2007 debut, "Headstrong" (which, according to Nielsen SoundScan, has sold 471,000 copies in the United States), the new 14-track set offers plenty of catchy choruses and lyrics about boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with songwriting and production credits from "American Idol" judge Kara DioGuardi, among others, "Guilty Pleasure" is a more mature, guitar-driven outing than the dance-pop "Headstrong." In the opener, "Acting Out," she promises to "break these chains" over driving bubble-punk drums, while the lead single, "It's Alright, It's OK," could be the younger sister of Pink's "So What."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of the songs on the album are about survival and staying strong," says Tisdale, who co-wrote four cuts. "I really wanted it to be a statement and a reflection of what I've been through over the past year and how I've grown up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. senior VP of marketing David Grant says the first component of the label's album rollout was revealing Tisdale's new look with a relaunch of her Web site in March and the cover of Cosmopolitan's April issue. "We wanted to create a conversation and then follow quickly with the music," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Grant, "High School Musical" fans have aged along with Tisdale, and they still constitute a significant portion of her audience. "But she's taken it beyond that, too," he says. For "Headstrong" the label targeted tweens; this time, "we're definitely looking to teenage girls."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social-networking technology plays a central role in the label's plans to reach that demographic. Tisdale is an especially avid Twitterer, with more than 750,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She's very protective of it in terms of it sounding authentic," according to Warner Bros. senior VP of new media Jeremy Welt. "There have been a couple of times where we've said to her, 'Hey, why don't you mention so-and-so?' and she's told us, 'I wouldn't say that.'" (What would she say? One recent Tweet read, "Happy fathers day!!! Goin to dinner with my family and the most amazing dad ever! I love you daddy!")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook and MySpace also figure into Warner's new-media campaign, the latter particularly as an "important streaming partner," Welt says. MySpace is streaming two tracks from "Guilty Pleasure," and Grant expects the site to feature the entire album before release date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the realm of retail, Grant says Target and Wal-Mart will sell exclusive editions of the album with bonus material, while a direct-to-consumer version will feature six posters and two extra songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once "Guilty Pleasure" is out, Tisdale says she hopes to tour the United States and Europe (where the set was released earlier this month). "This album is so important to me," she says. "I really want to support it as much as I can. You put your heart and soul into something and it makes you a little bit vulnerable. It is who I am -- hopefully people will like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dean Gooodman at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has hired
Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to sell Razorfish, its digital agency, and
French marketing company Publicis Groupe SA (PUBP.PA) is thought
to be a possible bidder, the Financial Times said on its Website
late Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft acquired the agency, formerly called Avenue A
Razorfish, as part of its $6 billion takeover of aQuantive in
2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report cited an analyst valuing Razorfish at $600 million
to $700 million, based on sales of about $400 million last year
and profit margins for similar businesses of 12 to 13 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Publicis and Morgan Stanley were not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Razorfish is one of the largest interactive advertising and
marketing agencies, boasting a client list that includes
McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), Starwood Hotels  Resorts (HOT.N), and
Carnival Cruise Lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and VivaKi, the digital arm of Publicis, last week
unveiled a broad cooperation deal to develop new content, improve
marketing performance and better target digital advertising
audiences.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Mediaweek) - Disney Channel delivered the year's most-watched scripted program on cable, drawing 8.5 million viewers with Friday's premiere of its original movie "Princess Protection Program."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starring Mouse contract players and real-life BFFs Selena Gomez ("Wizards of Waverly Place") and Demi Lovato ("Sonny With A Chance"), "Princess" put up huge demo numbers, averaging 3.1 million kids 6-11 and 3.2 million tweens 9-14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Princess" now stands as the third-most-watched original movie in the Disney franchise, trailing only the June 22, 2008, premiere of "Camp Rock" (8.86 million viewers) and the August 2007 debut of "High School Musical 2" (17.2 million viewers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If history is any guide, deliveries for the Gomez-Lovato effort will increase significantly upon application of live-plus-seven-day data. With time-shifted viewing factored in, "Camp Rock" served up some 10.1 million viewers, according to Nielsen, while "HSM2" was seen by 18.6 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Princess" is Disney Channel's 76th original movie. The film stars Lovato as a princess who is dethroned when a dictator seizes control of her country. She is subsequently taken in by the family of Gomez, who plays a tomboy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dean Gooodman at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to close)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Luciana Lopez&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO, June 29 (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks closed
higher on Monday as investor interest in new shares of VisaNet
helped boost the overall market and a rally in energy prices
sparked buying in heavyweight commodity stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VisaNet's VNET3.SA $4.3 billion initial public offering
on Thursday was the country's largest ever and the world's
biggest so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VisaNet, the Brazilian affiliate of credit card network
Visa, jumped as much as 14.7 percent within the first 15
minutes of trading, before ending 11.8 percent higher at 16.77
reais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Bovespa is tending higher mainly because of VisaNet,"
said Eduardo Cortez, an analyst with Gradual Investimentos, in
a phone interview. "There's always a tendency for other big
companies to accompany those movements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Market rival Redecard RDCD3.SA fell 4.32 percent to 31
reais. Elsewhere in the financial sector, banking stocks headed
higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bradesco (BBDC4.SA) gained 1.04 percent to 29.20 reais,
Banco do Brasil (BBAS3.SA) put on 0.57 percent to 21.32 reais
and Itau Unibanco (ITUB4.SA) jumped 1.97 percent to 31.52
reais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benchmark Bovespa index .BVSP rose for the second
session in three, climbing 1.27 percent to close at 52,137.58
points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A rally of more than 3 percent in oil prices also helped
commodity shares close higher. Both crude oil and copper prices
rose after closing lower on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's better to look at the increase in commodities prices
as the trigger for the increase in the exchange," said
Alexandre Lintz, senior strategist at BNP Paribas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State-controlled energy company Petrobras (PETR4.SA) rose
2.48 percent to 33.05 reais, and mining giant Vale (VALE5.SA)
gained 0.66 percent to 30.30 reais. Those two stocks have the
biggest weighting in the 65-share index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock market was also buoyed after Brazil's government
announced on Monday that it would renew tax breaks for the
automobile, construction and home appliance industries as well
as cut industrial taxes for 70 capital goods, including
machinery and power generators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A separate tax exemption on wheat and bread was also
renewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grocery giant Pao de Acucar (PCAR4.SA) rose 0.91 percent to
37.53 reais, after having fallen most of the day. Homebuilder
Cyrela (CYRE3.SA) jumped 4.28 percent to 14.85 reais and Gafisa
SA (GFSA3.SA) rose 3.57 percent to 16.25 reais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REAL FALLS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brazil's currency, the real BRBY, fell against the
dollar, losing 1.2 percent to 1.964 reais to the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yields on Brazilian interest rate futures contracts
0#DIJ: rose slightly. The yield on the January 2011 contract
DIJF1, the most highly-traded, rose to 10.06 percent from an
opening of 9.93 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Minutes from the last meeting of the Brazilian central
bank's monetary committee released earlier in June hinted at
more cuts of the benchmark interest rate, the Selic, on
expectations of low inflationary pressure. Policymakers have
already cut the Selic to a record low 9.25 percent in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monday data on Brazil's broadest inflation measure, the
IGP-M index, showed a greater-than-expected fall, dropping 0.1
percent in June after slumping 0.07 percent in May.

&lt;p&gt;http://www.profit.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Strayer Education (Nasdaq: STRA) as the Bull of
the Day and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (Nasdaq: RRGB) the Bear of the Day. In
addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Forest Laboratories, Inc.
(NYSE:FRX), ViroPharma (Nasdaq: VPHM) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Financial results for the past thirteen quarters at Strayer Education (Nasdaq:
STRA) have been above expectations, and management's guidance for 2009 portends
continued double-digit EPS growth. 

The company benefits from positive pricing through annual 5% tuition increases
with the 2009 tuition increase having been announced concurrent with the third
quarter earnings report. 

Despite the stock's valuation being in the upper-half of the historical range,
the stock is rated a Buy. 

Bear of the Day: 

We believe shares of Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (Nasdaq: RRGB) will continue to
underperform both the larger market and the restaurant industry. 

Red Robin's traffic began declining long before the onset of rising gas prices
in October 2007, which began choking business in the casual dining sector -- a
victim of poor site selection in new markets. In spite of their poor
performance, the company has retained and even added to these sites as it
repurchased 45 franchises since 2005. 

Moreover, 2009 consensus EPS estimates are 10% higher than ours, and we think
our estimate may prove aggressive if the economic slowdown is deeper or more
protracted than we currently anticipate.

Good News for Forest Labs

Forest Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:FRX) announced positive results recently from
two global multi-center phase III studies which were conducted to evaluate the
efficacy, safety and tolerability of ceftaroline for the treatment of
community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). 

The top-line data in each of the studies (FOCUS I and II) showed that
ceftaroline met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority and achieved high
clinical cure rates compared with ceftriaxone (84.3% vs. 77.7%). Additionally,
ceftaroline was well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to
ceftriaxone. Earlier, Forest had reported positive phase III results on
ceftaroline for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections
(cSSSI). 

Ceftaroline is a novel, bactericidal, injectable, broad-spectrum cephalosporin
which is being developed for the treatment of cSSSI and CABP. The anti-infective
market, which is currently dominated by antibiotics, represents a significant
commercial opportunity for the company. 

Commonly prescribed anti-infective treatments include products like Vancocin
from ViroPharma (Nasdaq: VPHM) and Zyvox from Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) among others.
Improved clinical cure rates and a good side effect profile should help
ceftaroline gain share once approved and launched. We estimate peak sales could
be in the range of $250 - $300 million.

&lt;p&gt; * Shares jump as much as 15.7 pct on first day of trading&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Investors say gains reflect bet on Brazilian recovery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares of competitor Redecard tumble 4.3 pct
 (Updates to close)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Elzio Barreto and Guillermo Parra-Bernal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAO PAULO, June 29 (Reuters) - Shares of VisaNet, the
Brazilian affiliate of credit card network Visa Inc (V.N),
surged as much as 15.7 percent in the first trading day after
its record-setting initial public offering last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock VNET3.SA closed 11.8 percent higher than the
15.00 reais IPO price set last Thursday, at 16.77 reais, after
trading as high as 17.35 reais earlier. About 2.88 billion
reais ($1.48 billion) worth of VisaNet stock changed hands in
Sao Paulo, or 45 percent of the day's total trading volume at
the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock sale raised 8.4 billion reais ($4.3 billion),
making it the largest IPO ever in Brazil and the world's
biggest in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VisaNet's performance reflects optimism that more
Brazilians will use credit cards as the economy bounces back
faster than in some other emerging markets and developed
economies, investors said. Brazil's credit card market has
expanded by about 25 percent a year since 1995, according to
Itau Unibanco, the country's largest bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You have three elements playing here: first, that people
believe the use of banking services will grow, that more people
will use their credit cards, that Brazil's economy is firmly on
the rebound," said Frederico Mesnik, who manages 18 million
reais at Sao Paulo-based Humaita Investimentos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, the central bank cut the benchmark
Selic lending rate by 100 basis points to a record low of 9.25
percent. Consumer confidence readings rose in May to their
highest level since September, just when the global credit
crunch afflicting the developed world spread to Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Payroll jobs rose for a fourth straight month in May,
indicating that companies are returning to normal after a
655,000 net plunge in jobs in December, the government said
last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RIVAL TUMBLES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of rival Redecard RDCD3.SA tumbled as much as 10
percent. The drop was due to "euphoria over the start of
VisaNet, rather than eroding fundamentals" in Redecard, Mesnik
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Redecard finished 4.32 percent lower at 31.00 reais after
falling as low as 29.30 reais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both stocks might soon "find their equilibrium price" as
initial interest on VisaNet fades gradually, Mesnik said. The
central bank might tighten regulation on the credit card
industry, including a reduction in fees charged by credit card
operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VisaNet shareholders -- including Banco Bradesco
(BBDC4.SA), Banco Santander (SAN.MC), Banco do Brasil
(BBAS3.SA) and Visa International -- sold 559.81 million shares
at the top of the estimated price range of 12 reais to 15
reais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bradesco BBI, the investment banking arm of Brazil's
second-largest private sector bank Bradesco, managed the
offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before the IPO, Bradesco held a 39 percent stake in
VisaNet; Banco do Brasil, a 31 percent interest; and Spain's
Santander, a 14 percent stake. After the IPO, the three banks
still controlled a majority of VisaNet's shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa Inc unit Visa International was also part of the
controlling group, but reduced its 10 percent stake to zero.
Itau Unibanco (ITUB4.SA) and the Brazilian unit of HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) also sold their stakes.

&lt;p&gt;Sens. Wyden, Casey, Durbin and Leahy Sign Letter Expressing "Concern" About
Chevron Effort to Link Environmental Case to Trade Benefits
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Four U.S. Senators are urging the United States Trade Representative to reject
efforts by Chevron to threaten the cancellation of trade benefits for Ecuador
because the oil giant faces a $27.3 billion liability in the South American
nation for dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon
rainforest. 

A letter sent June 25 to USTR Ambassador Ron Kirk, signed by Senators Ron Wyden
(D-OR), Robert P. Casey, Jr. (D-PA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy
(D-VT), says: "We write to express our concern with Chevron Corporation`s
efforts to petition your office concerning a pending lawsuit it is facing in the
Ecuadorian legal system. It is our understanding that Chevron is seeking the
threatened withdrawal of the [trade benefits] for Ecuador if this lawsuit moves
forward." 

The Senators write: "Corporate responsibility at home and abroad is critical,
particularly when it concerns human health and the environment. We request that
you allow the legal proceedings in Ecuador to take their course without any
undue intervention from the U.S. government." 

Chevron is charged in the class-action lawsuit with dumping more than 18 billion
gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways when it operated a large oil
concession in Ecuador`s Amazon from 1964 to 1990. Chevron had requested that the
case, originally filed in 1993 in U.S. federal court, be transferred to Ecuador
where a trial began in 2003 and is expected to end later this year. 

The court will decide whether to accept a $27.3 billion damages assessment
prepared by a team of independent experts, who reviewed most of the evidence in
the case and submitted a 4,000-page report last April. 

Despite repeatedly praising the fairness of Ecuador`s courts in order to have
the case transferred to the South American nation, once the evidence became
clear Chevron began to claim Ecuador`s courts were biased against it. The
company launched a lobbying campaign in Washington to convince the Bush
Administration and later the Obama Administration to cancel trade preferences
for Ecuador as "punishment" for letting its citizens sue the oil giant in
Ecuadorian courts - even though Chevron had wanted the trial there to begin
with. 

Chevron`s lobbying effort on the issue, which began in 2005, has repeatedly
failed as Ecuador`s trade preferences have been extended. 

Ironically, in 2006, then-Senator Obama, along with Sen. Leahy, sent a similar
letter to the USTR asking that the agency reject an earlier Chevron lobbying
effort to use then ongoing trade agreement negotiations as leverage to pressure
Ecuador to dismiss the case. In that letter, Senators Obama and Leahy wrote that
the plaintiffs - indigenous people and farmers -- "deserve their day in court"
and that the USTR should steer clear of the matter, which it did. 

Earlier this month, Congressmen Jim McGovern (D-MA) and Joe Sestak (D-PA) wrote
a letter to the USTR along the same lines. The two representatives asked that
"the U.S. Trade Representative should not interfere in this judicial matter,
particularly when this case involves environmental, health and human rights
issues that have regional, and even global, importance." 

Rep. McGovern, who travelled to the affected area in November 2008, described
the region as a "terrible humanitarian and environmental crisis" in a letter he
sent to President Obama. 

The team of court-appointed scientists who conducted the damages assessment
identified more than 916 unlined toxic "waste pits" built by Texaco in the
rainforest that have been leaching toxins into soils, streams, and groundwater
for decades. The expert report estimated that more than 1,400 people have died
from cancer related to pollution caused by the company`s substandard operational
practices. 

Chevron's lobbying of Congress to undermine the legal case has sparked outrage
in Ecuador because Chevron had stipulated before a U.S. federal judge that it
would recognize the jurisdiction of the Ecuador court and be bound by any
judgment there, as a condition of the transfer in venue. 

"Chevron`s lobbying campaign against Ecuador in the United States violates both
the letter and spirit of the company`s legal commitments," said Luis Yanza, a
representative of the affected communities in Ecuador and the winner in 2008 of
the prestigious Goldman environmental prize. 

Steven Donziger, an American attorney and advisor to the Amazon communities,
added: "Chevron's lobbying on the Ecuador issue in Washington is an
inappropriate effort to involve U.S. foreign policy in a private litigation
matter. The letters from the four Senators and two Congressmen to the USTR
uphold the important principle that the rule of law must be respected at all
times, even by a powerful American oil company being sued by indigenous
communities."

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Xbox head says more deals to follow Canal Plus, BSkyB &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Aims to reach 100s of millions including via PC, mobile &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Natal body gesture technology won't need new Xbox &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments from head of Xbox, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Georgina Prodhan &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) announced a deal that will allow more than a million French users of its Xbox to watch content from pay-TV company Canal Plus, the latest in a series of such agreements designed to broaden its audience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The software giant is expanding beyond its core Xbox user base of young, male gamers to position the console as an entertainment hub in the centre of the home, as Sony (6758.T) is doing with its PlayStation and Nintendo 7974.OS with its Wii. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Our aspiration is to touch hundreds of millions of consumers around the globe," Don Mattrick, head of Xbox, told Reuters in an interview on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He said Microsoft would achieve this partly through supporting its Live gaming and media service on PCs and mobiles as well as the Xbox, and through partnerships like the Canal Plus deal and another recently announced with BSkyB (BSY.L). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft says one-third of those planning to buy an Xbox are female and 42 percent of typical users are parents with children under 18. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Under Monday's agreement, users of Microsoft's Xbox 360 in France will be able to watch films on demand, premium drama and soccer from Vivendi (VIV.PA) unit Canal Plus on their games console, and Mattrick said more such deals would follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    They will also be able to use Xbox Live technology to engage with friends via their avatars and to chat during games. Xbox Live has a community of 20 million members around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft and Canal Plus said they would eventually extend the partnership to other Canal Plus products as well as other Microsoft platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As part of its strategy to broaden the Xbox's appeal, Microsoft earlier this month unveiled "Project Natal," which tracks a user's movements via full skeletal mapping instead of through a controller, and recognises voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mattrick said Natal would be backwards-compatible, meaning any users who already own an Xbox would be able to use the new technology without having to buy a new console. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He declined to comment on timing or price, but said development kits had been shipped to partners to develop content. When asked whether this implied a 2010 release, he said: "I've heard that line of reasoning and it's very logical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Asked about the impact of the depressed economic environment on Xbox sales, Mattrick said the year to end-June would be the best ever for Xbox, which has become profitable over the last two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Our category -- entertainment, and home entertainment, particularly -- tends to do better in challenging times," he said. He declined to comment on whether Microsoft would cut the price of the Xbox 360 in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mattrick added that he would not be replacing executive John Schappert, who is returning to his previous company, Electronic Arts ERTS.O, after overseeing some of Microsoft's biggest games including Halo as head of the company's game studios. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He said that two managers heading Xbox's Live and studio businesses would now report directly to him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Gary Hill) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((georgina.prodhan@thomsonreuters.com; +4420 7542 7954; Reuters Messaging georgina.prodhan.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: MICROSOFT CANALPLUS/XBOX  Keywords: MICROSOFT CANALPLUS/XBOX  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Video Vender Transforms Simple Transactions into Brand Interactions
7 Awards Garnered at Prestigious Industry Event 


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
A new interactive Coca-Cola vending machine with a large format touch-screen and
Bluetooth capabilities has taken home the Gold Lion in the Point of Sale
category at the 2009 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. The
festival, widely considered as the world`s premier showcase for excellence in
advertising and design, concluded over the weekend in Cannes, France. 

The video vender, which debuted at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and is now in
select Simon Malls throughout the United States, integrates a Samsung 46-inch
LCD touch screen into the front of a Coca-Cola vending machine. The large-format
display combined with Flash technology, motion graphics, high-definition video
and Bluetooth capabilities for mobile downloads, creates a uniquely immersive
experience for consumers. 

"The video vending machine incorporates sight, sound and motion video to take
the vending experience from transaction to true interaction," said Anthony
Phillips, global marketing manager, The Coca-Cola Company. 

The new venders were developed by The Coca-Cola Company in partnership with
Samsung, a leading technology innovation company, and interactive marketing
agency Sapient. 

David Butler, vice president, Global Design, The Coca-Cola Company, said "The
video vending machine is a great example of our approach to creating value and
innovation through design. We created a user-friendly touch screen interface
that can be very functional when we need it to be, but also drive emotional
connections for our brands." 

The award is further recognition for the Company`s design efforts, building on
the 2008 success; when the Company won the Design Grand Prix - the competition`s
best in show award - for Coca-Cola`s new visual identity system. Last year
marked the first year that Cannes incorporated a design category into its Lions
awards program. 

Mr. Butler added "We are honored that our efforts in design are being recognized
by one of the most prestigious festivals in the industry. We are very focused on
building on our strong design legacy to drive competitive advantage for our
brands." 

Along with its impressive showing in the design category, the Company garnered
recognition for its marketing achievements across a wide span of media channels,
including online, outdoor and film. Notably, a 12-minute video created for
Schweppes picked up Gold Lion in the Viral Advertising category. Titled "Signs",
the video tells a simple story of love between two people who communicate across
office blocks using hand held signs. Within weeks of appearing on YouTube, the
video had been viewed over half a million times, making it onto the top 10 most
viewed viral films on YouTube worldwide. 

Jonathan Mildenhall, Global Advertising Strategy and Creative Excellence, The
Coca-Cola Company, who hosted a seminar for up-and-coming creatives at the
Cannes event, said "Creating compelling communications for one of the world`s
most valuable brands, across a mix of media, requires a balance of art and
science. We consider this great recognition for our work as testament to our
strong focus on producing creative that engages, excites and connects with the
millions of people who consume our products every day."

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Another earnings season is just around the corner and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:
CVX) is set to kick things off next week when it steps into the earnings
spotlight on Thursday, July 9. Analysts are expecting a profit of $1.18 per
share, which is down 59% from the company's earnings of $2.90 per share for the
same period a year ago. Historically, the company's results have been mixed, as
it has surpassed the consensus estimate twice and missed twice during the past
four quarters. 

Heading into the earnings report, options players have stocked up on the
equity's calls in anticipation of a sharp rally in the shares. The Schaeffer's
put/call open interest ratio for CVX stands at 0.51, as call open interest
nearly doubles put open interest among near-term options. What's more, this
reading is lower than all but 1% of those taken during the past year. In other
words, options speculators have been more optimistic toward the shares only 1%
of the time during the past 12 months.

&lt;p&gt;  SYRACUSE, NY and BROOKFIELD, CT, Jun 29 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
Validus DC Systems has been selected by Syracuse University to deliver
the direct current power infrastructure in one of the world's most
energy-efficient data centers. The data center project represents a
partnership between IBM (NYSE: IBM), Syracuse University and the New York
State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and is expected
to use 50 percent less energy than a typical data center today, making it
one of the "greenest" computer centers in operation.

    The Validus DC System will provide the core power infrastructure equipment
to create and deliver direct current power to the IBM z10 systems. The
center will expand Syracuse University's leadership in the development and
use of "green" innovations in nationally strategic domains. IBM intends to
showcase the data center and its energy-efficient technologies to help
clients design new data centers or improve their current operations.

    "By eliminating unnecessary power losses of a traditional alternating
current data center Syracuse University will be positioned to run IBM's
systems for significantly less cost and with a considerably smaller carbon
footprint," says Rudy Kraus, Chief Executive Officer, Validus DC Systems.
"The improved efficiency and reliability of a higher voltage direct
current system will allow Syracuse to experience a reduction in energy
costs while delivering overall system modularity and ease of integration
of current and future renewable energy sources."

    Validus was chosen by Syracuse University based on their extensive
experience in enterprise data centers and their industry leading high
voltage direct current technology. Delivering high-quality power
distribution technology is especially important because Syracuse will be
the home to the first university data center powered by onsite generation
in New York State. The electrical tri-generation system will use an array
of natural gas-fueled micro turbines to generate all the necessary
electricity and also provide cooling for the computer infrastructure. The
data center will be able to operate completely off-grid.

    The data center is expected to be completed by the end of 2009.

    About Validus DC Systems: Validus is the market leader in delivering
enterprise class direct current infrastructure power equipment ranging
from -600 VDC to -48VDC. Founded in 2002, Validus has patented technology
which allows companies to significantly reduce energy consumption while
increasing overall system reliability. Along with the ability to reduce
installation and ongoing maintenance costs Validus delivers the much
needed next generation topology that reduces operations costs for
enterprise data centers and readily enables the integration or renewable
and alternative energy sources. For more information about Validus DC
Systems, contact Ronald Ranaldi on 646-825-9551 or visit

&lt;p&gt;Latest in Series of Legal Setbacks for Oil Giant
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The U.S. Supreme Court today refused to hear an appeal by Chevron of a decision
by a U.S. federal trial judge that denied the oil giant`s attempt to shift a
$27.3 billion liability for environmental contamination in the Amazon rainforest
to Ecuador`s state-owned oil company. 

The Supreme Court`s move is the latest of several legal and political setbacks
recently suffered by Chevron in the 16-year-old case, considered the largest
environmental matter in the world. Experts have dubbed the contamination in
Ecuador the "Amazon Chernobyl" and say a clean-up would dwarf any
decontamination effort ever undertaken. 

The dispute before the Court was between Chevron and Ecuador`s government, but
it was spawned by a private lawsuit for environmental damages brought against
Chevron by thousands of private citizens in the country`s Amazon region. 

Damages in the private lawsuit, expected to end later this year, were estimated
in 2008 at up to $27.3 billion by a team of court-appointed experts. Texaco (now
Chevron) is accused of dumping billions of gallons of toxin-laden waste water
into the Amazon rainforest from 1964 to 1990, when it operated a large oil
concession in the area covering a 2,000 square mile area. 

Indigenous groups complain their cultures have been decimated, while the Ecuador
court report found high cancer rates related to oil contamination have caused
roughly 1,400 excess deaths. 

Chevron was challenging an order by U.S. federal district court judge Leonard B.
Sand that denied its attempt to obligate Ecuador`s government to take part in a
binding arbitration over the liability from the private lawsuit based on a
provision in a 1965 contract signed by Texaco and Gulf to operate a large oil
concession in Ecuador`s rainforest. Last October, a unanimous three-judge panel
for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found Chevron`s argument
was "without merit" and denied its appeal, prompting the petition to the Supreme
Court. 

The narrow legal issue involved whether Ecuador`s government could be subject to
an arbitration provision under a contract that it never signed, and whose only
signatories were two American oil companies. The implications of any arbitration
between Chevron and Ecuador`s government would have been highly significant
given the amount of damages, however. 

"From the beginning, the attempt by Chevron to tie up the nation`s highest court
on a relatively obscure legal issue was more of a delay tactic than anything,"
said Andrew Woods, an American legal advisor to the Amazonian communities who
brought the underlying legal case. 

The private lawsuit originally was filed in U.S. federal court in New York in
1993 against Texaco (now Chevron) and is currently on trial in Ecuador at
Chevron`s request. To transfer the case to Ecuador in 2002, the oil company
filed 14 sworn affidavits praising Ecuador`s courts and agreed to submit to
jurisdiction and be bound by any ruling there. 

Once evidence in the Ecuador trial pointed to Chevron`s culpability, the oil
company began to claim Ecuador`s courts were biased against it and tried to
shift the liability to Ecuador's government. It also launched a public relations
and lobbying campaign in Washington to try to convince the U.S. government to
pressure Ecuador`s government to quash the case, a strategy that up to this
point has backfired. 

Among Chevron`s recent setbacks:

* Four Democratic Senators (Wyden, Leahy, Casey, Jr., and Durbin), in a letter
sent June 25 to the office of the United States Trade Representative, accused
the oil giant of meddling in the private lawsuit by lobbying to cancel trade
preferences for Ecuador - a move that could cost Ecuador 350,000 jobs. 
* Two Chevron lawyers are under criminal indictment in Ecuador, along with seven
former Ecuadorian government officials, for lying about the results of a
purported remediation in the mid-1990s. One of those lawyers, Ricardo Reis
Veiga, had been supervising the case for Chevron but is now unable to travel to
Ecuador. 
* New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has opened a probe of the company to
determine if it is misleading shareholders about its financial risk in Ecuador. 
* More than $37 billion in Chevron shares (about 28% of all shares outstanding)
voted in May to support resolutions criticizing the company`s human rights
record in Ecuador, Myanmar and elsewhere.

If Chevron had won the right to arbitrate, it would have argued that a provision
in the 1965 operating contract required Ecuador to indemnify it for all or part
of the losses associated with the environmental lawsuit. A second issue -

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO, June 29 (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks opened
higher on Monday, as investors flocked to new shares of
VisaNet, sparking buying of industrial, financial and commodity
stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; VisaNet's VNET3.SA $4.3 billion initial public offering
on Thursday was the country's largest ever and the largest in
the world so far this year. Visanet jumped as much as 14
percent within the first 15 minutes of trading, only to give up
some of those gains later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Bovespa is tending higher mainly because of VisaNet,"
said Eduardo Cortez, an analyst with Gradual Investimentos in
Sao Paulo. "There's always a tendency for other big companies
to accompany those movements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark Bovespa index .BVSP rose for the second day
in three, climbing 1.2 percent in morning trading to 52,128.65
points, led by VisaNet, which rose 11.4 percent to 16.72 reais
around mid-day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two stocks with the biggest weighting in the 65-share
index rose as commodities edged higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State-controlled energy company Petrobras (PETR4.SA) rose
2.1 percent to 32.93 reais, and mining giant Vale (VALE5.SA)
gained 0.9 percent to 30.40 reais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Commodities also gained. Crude oil CLc1 rose 2.2 percent,
while copper HGN9 rose 2.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other strong movers included bank Itau Unibanco (ITUB4.SA),
which rose 2 percent to 31.53 reais, and steelmaker Gerdau
(GOAU4.SA), up 1.84 percent to 26.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the past week, the index had been pushing against the
51,700 point-mark, said Daniel Marques, an analyst with Agora
Investimentos. The Bovespa futures contract due in August
INDQ9 gained 0.9 percent ot 52,680.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An index breaking that ceiling means "I'll turn optimistic
for the short-term," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REAL FALLS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The real BRBY, Brazil's currency, slipped against the
dollar, losing 0.67 percent to 1.953 reais to the dollar. The
dollar had fallen for the previous two sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yields on Brazilian interest rate futures contracts 0#DIJ:
rose slightly, as well. The yield on the Jan. 2011 contract,
the most highly-traded, rose to 9.97 percent from 9.92
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Minutes from the last meeting of the Brazilian central
bank's monetary committee hinted at more cuts of the benchmark
interest rate, the Selic, on expectations of low inflationary
pressure. Policy makers already cut the Selic to a record low
9.25 percent in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monday data on Brazil's broadest inflation measure, the
IGP-M index, showed a greater-than-expected fall, dropping 0.1
percent in June after slumping 0.07 percent in May.

&lt;p&gt; The furnaces are 801 and 802, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Excess opacity observed from furnace as unit began to start
up after shut down," it said in a filing to the Texas Commission
on Environmental Quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said it had taken action to "immediately shut off fuel to
both furnaces. This event has ended. No impact to supply. All
customer needs are being met".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday the company said a hydrocracker at the Baytown
refinery was back in operation after being shut for unplanned
work on June 18 but the status of other units remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman had said the flexicoker was running at the
plant, which last Thursday reported flaring and emissions of
hydrogen sulfide. [ID:nN26319772]

&lt;p&gt;Significant Potential Seen for Carbonate Reservoirs in the Middle East
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that its subsidiary, Saudi
Arabian Chevron (SAC), has achieved first steam injection at its Large Scale
Pilot (LSP) steamflood project at the Wafra Field, an Eocene heavy-oil carbonate
reservoir in the onshore Partitioned Neutral Zone (PNZ). 

The $340 million LSP, which is the final test phase for the steamflood project,
is expected to lead to full-field steamflooding of the First Eocene reservoir,
marking the first commercial application of a conventional steamflood in a
carbonate reservoir anywhere in the world. 

"Full-field deployment of steamflood technology in the PNZ would significantly
increase recovery of crude oil reserves, confirm the technology`s potential
applicability in other carbonate oil fields and build on Chevron`s steamflood
capabilities that date back five decades," said George Kirkland, executive vice
president, Chevron Global Upstream and Gas. 

The LSP is the third in a series of staged tests to validate the feasibility of
applying the enhanced oil recovery technology of steamflooding to unlock the
producing potential of the heavy Eocene oil of the PNZ`s carbonate reservoirs.
Previous tests included the Small Scale Test (SST), which was successfully
completed in 2008, and simple steam stimulation testing, conducted in the late
1990s. 

Steamflooding involves injecting steam into heavy-oil reservoirs to heat the
crude oil underground, reducing its viscosity and allowing its extraction
through wells. 

Chevron has successfully employed steamflooding to produce heavy oil from
sandstone reservoirs at Kern River, Calif., for more than 40 years and at Duri
in Sumatra, Indonesia, for 25 years. The company is recognized as the world`s
leader in steamflood technology. 

SAC operates on behalf of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom`s 50 percent
undivided interest in the petroleum resources of the onshore PNZ between the
Kingdom and the State of Kuwait. SAC`s operating agreement with the Kingdom was
recently extended and amended, and runs until February 2039. 

The operations include four fields in the area - Wafra, South Umm Gudair, South
Fuwaris and Humma - that produce mainly heavy crude from 10 reservoirs. In 2004,
the 3 billionth barrel of oil was produced in the onshore PNZ. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business across the globe. The company's success
is driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops and commercializes the energy
resources of the future, including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is
based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron is available at
www.chevron.com. 

Cautionary Statement Relevant to Forward-Looking Information for the Purpose of
"Safe Harbor" Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995.

Some of the items discussed in this press release are forward-looking statements
about Chevron`s activities in the PNZ. Words such as "anticipates," "expects,"
"intends," "plans," "targets," "projects," "believes," "seeks," "estimates,"
"budgets" and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking
statements. The statements are based upon management`s current expectations,
estimates and projections; are not guarantees of future performance; and are
subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are
beyond the company`s control and are difficult to predict. Among the factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in prices of,
demand for and supply of crude oil and natural gas; actions of competitors;the
potential disruption or interruption of production and development activities
due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, or severe weather;
government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations and changes in fiscal
terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; and general economic and
political conditions. You should not place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press
release. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update
publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.

Note to Editors:

The LSP will evaluate production response to steaming, variability of response
by pattern, recovery efficiency in the reservoir contacted by the injected
steam, as well as the potential cost for installation and operation of
full-field development. A baseline of the non-steamflood production from the
LSP`s 25 producing wells has been established, and it will serve as an important
basis of comparison for establishing the effectiveness of steamflood production.
The LSP also includes 16 wells for injecting steam and 16 observation wells for
monitoring reservoir conditions. 

The LSP has benefited from the observations and test results recorded for the
SST. The SST demonstrated that poor-quality Eocene produced water could be
processed to generate high-purity water for steam generation and that the steam
could be injected over a long duration in the PNZ`s carbonate reservoirs. It
also has been employed to test mechanical and chemical strategies for coping
with subsurface corrosion and scaling from steamflooding. 

As of May 2009, the LSP had recorded more than 3 million worker hours for
employees and contractors without any lost time due to accidents, including
during several months of complex simultaneous operations involving drilling and
workover activities and installation of a range of surface infrastructure.

&lt;p&gt;Author of Microsoft Windows 7 Unveiled to Discuss Latest Features and
Functionality
SEBASTOPOL, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Safari Books Online (www.safaribooksonline.com), the leading on-demand digital
library for technology, creative, and business professionals, announced today
that it will host a complimentary webcast on Wednesday, July 8 at 10:30 a.m. PDT
/ 1:30 p.m. EDT with Windows expert and author J. Peter Bruzzese. Bruzzese will
discuss his latest book, Microsoft Windows 7 Unveiled, which highlights the
newest features and functionality of Microsoft`s newest operating system.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said a late stage trial testing its cancer drug Sutent in advanced colon cancer was discontinued after it was deemed to be no more effective than standard chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An independent Data Monitoring Committee found that adding Sutent to a chemotherapy regimen as an initial treatment for colon cancer that has spread would be unable to show a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared with the chemotherapy alone, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest drugmaker said no new safety issues were identified with Sutent, known chemically as sunitinib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setback comes just days after Sutent proved effective against a rare form of pancreatic cancer in another Phase III trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are disappointed with this result, but trial successes and failures are an integral part of cancer drug development and contribute to a growing body of knowledge on improving patient care," Mace Rothenberg, head of clinical development and medical affairs for Pfizer's oncology unit, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sutent is currently approved to treat advanced kidney cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumor, a cancer of the digestive system.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc announced today the discontinuation of the SUN 1122 Phase 3 trial
that evaluated Sutent&#174; (sunitinib malate) plus FOLFIRI (irinotecan plus
infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin) versus FOLFIRI alone for the
first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). The independent Data
Monitoring Committee (DMC) found that the addition of sunitinib to the
chemotherapy regimen FOLFIRI would be unable to demonstrate a statistically
significant improvement in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival
(PFS) compared to FOLFIRI alone, in this study. No new safety issues were
identified. 

"We are disappointed with this result, but trial successes and failures are an
integral part of cancer drug development and contribute to a growing body of
knowledge on improving patient care," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice
president of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology
Business Unit. "Pfizer remains committed to developing new agents for colorectal
and other GI cancers with ongoing clinical studies evaluating other agents in
its pipeline. Investigators will be consulted about the status of sunitinib
colorectal studies other than the SUN 1122 trial. Pfizer also continues to study
sunitinib in late-stage trials as a potential treatment for various other types
of cancer." 

Pfizer has notified clinical trial investigators involved in the study and
regulatory agencies of these findings. 

These results do not affect the approved indications with sunitinib as
monotherapy, where it has played a significant role in advancing the care of
patients. Sunitinib is currently approved for both gastrointestinal stromal
tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate,
and advanced / metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) based on efficacy and
safety data from large, randomized Phase 3 clinical trials. To date, over 50,000
patients have been treated globally. 

Sunitinib Clinical Research Program

Pfizer Oncology is committed to exploring and delivering innovative therapies to
patients with cancer, and is continuing to study the potential role of sunitinib
in the treatment of various solid tumors including advanced non-small cell lung
cancer, advanced breast cancer, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced
hormone-refractory prostate cancer, in Phase 3 trials. 

Healthcare professionals who are interested in learning more about sunitinib
trials that are open for enrollment can visit the SUN program web site at
www.suntrials.com. Patients with questions should contact their treating
physician. 

About Colorectal Cancer (CRC)

About 630,000 deaths from CRC were estimated to occur in 2007 worldwide,
accounting for eight percent of all cancer deaths. Five-year survival rates for
patients with metastatic disease, cancer that has spread to distant parts of the
body, such as the liver, are much lower, at 11 percent. 

About Sutent&#174; (sunitinib malate)

Sutent is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of GIST
after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate and advanced
RCC. 

Sutent works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important Sutent targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR) are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. Sutent also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Important Sutent&#174; (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on Sutent. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with Sutent. 

The most common adverse reactions in advanced RCC and GIST clinical trials were
fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia,
abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Research In Motion (Nasdaq: RIMM) as the Bull
of the Day and Canon (NYSE:CAJ) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity
Research provides analysis on American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP), General
Electric (NYSE:GE) and First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Research In Motion (Nasdaq: RIMM), the manufacturer of BlackBerry's smart-phone
devices, continues with robust financial performance in spite of facing a global
economic recession and an extremely competitive industry. 

The company's first quarter (ended May 30) financial results were above our
expectations. Highend Blackberry handsets experienced significant market
traction as the company maintains the momentum of net new subscriber additions.
Sequential improvement of gross margin is another positive factor. 

We expect the smart-phone device market to gain further momentum should economic
conditions improve and as demand for portable mobile access remains firm on a
global basis. 

Bear of the Day: 

We believe the sharp appreciation of the yen is eroding Canon's (NYSE:CAJ)
revenue and profits. 

Canon's first-quarter 2009 results were mixed with revenue below expectations
while earnings slightly exceeding our expectation. The company expects to
improve profitability through product launches and cost cutting efforts. As a
result CAJ raised its earnings forecast for the full year 2009, still below 2008
level. 

We expect revenue in 2009 to be hurt by weak consumer spending and believe the
company will struggle to meet expectations in fiscal 2009. We maintain our
estimates for the full year 2009.

On Friday, the House narrowly approved the Waxman-Markey bill. This legislation
will, for the first time, put a (indirect) price on CO2 emissions. 

Most of the permits will be given away at first rather than being auctioned off.
This will greatly ease the transition, much to the benefit to coal oriented
utilities like American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP). 

The bill will require that by 2020, that 20% of all U.S. electric power come
from renewable sources. The means that the Wind Turbine unit should be one of
General Electric's (NYSE:GE) best performing divisions going forward. However,
I'm not sure that it will be enough to totally move the needle on a firm the
size of GE. Still, GE will get a benefit, and is a fairly conservative way to
play it. 

More direct plays like First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR) are not exactly cheap, which
makes them more risky. However, the potential upside is also huge.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Fed Shuffling Off Vs. Quick Exit

The idea that the Federal Reserve may quicken its scaling back of its emergency
market lifelines appear to be a bit of a pipedream. 

While the Fed recently eliminated a liquidity program for money markets and
moderated a minimal number of other facilities, it basically kept its liquidity
safety net in place and extended the term of most of its programs, as it remains
concerned that present financial strains will continue for a while. 

Clearly the Fed's "exit strategy" will require extra finesse as to not decimate
the recovery, or spawn excessive inflation. 

Even though interest remains at a near historic low, a trip to any branch of a
major institution - such as, but not limited to, Citigroup (NYSE: C), Bank of
America (NYSE: BAC), J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) and US
Bancorp (NYSE: USB) - reveals that interest rates have crept-up by more than 100
bp over the past month, and these institutions also are charging a point or
more. 

What remains very interesting is that these same institutions are buying newly
minted loans from mortgage brokers (typically carrying lower interest rates).

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Supreme Court Rules Against Banks

In a surprising 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that national banks are still
subject to the laws of the states they operate in. What made the ruling unusual
is that Justice Scalia wrote the opinion and the other four conservative judges
were in dissent (Roberts, Thomas, Alito and the normal swing vote Kennedy). 

The ruling overturned an appeals court ruling that said that state attorney
generals cannot investigate banks if they operate in more than one state. 

The case in question involved the enforcement of fair lending laws in N.Y.
State, specifically allegations that some banks were charging minorities higher
interest rates. Instead, even though these are state laws, the appeals court had
said that only the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) had the power
to investigate. In practice, this means that the laws were null and void, since
the OCC has a lousy track record on such issues. 

Enforcing state laws is simply not a priority for a division of the Treasury
Department. While clearly there can be a problem if multiple agencies have
jurisdiction in regulation, allowing things to slip through the cracks, there
can also be problems when there is only one regulator and that regulator is in
the pocket of the regulated. It is harder to capture all 50 state attorney
generals and the OCC, than it is just the OCC alone. Make no mistake, the head
of the OCC, John Dugan, a holdover from the last administration, is very much a
creature of the big banks he is supposed to be overseeing. The OCC ranks just
behind the OTS in being an ineffectual regulator during the bubble. 

While the state attorney generals will not be able to issue subpoenas on their
own authority (they need approval from a state judge), it does mean that they do
not have to sit on their hands if they think the banks are breaking the law. It
also will mean a more fair application of the law. 

If the appeals court ruling had been allowed to stand, then the state attorney
generals would have been free to go after a little community bank that only
operated in their state, but unable to go after the big banks like J.P. Morgan
(NYSE: JPM), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Citigroup (NYSE: C) and Wells Fargo
(NYSE: WFC) that dominate the banking business. Sort of like telling them, yeah,
it`s okay for the state to go after the street level drug traffickers, but not
allowed to go after the kingpins. 

This is a major win for consumer protection, and a loss for the banks. It is
also a big win for states in the ongoing struggle between state and federal
jurisdiction. I guess the Supreme Court is not as susceptible to campaign
contribution influence as the Congress is. 

Omnicell Stays on Hold

Headquartered in Mountain View, CA, Omnicell Inc. (Nasdaq: OMCL) founded in
1992, develops and markets end-to-end automation solutions for the
medication-use process. 

These automation solutions contain medication and supply dispensing systems,
central pharmacy storage, retrieval and packaging solutions, a bedside
automation solution, a physician order management solution, a decision support
application, and a Web-based procurement application. These solutions enable
healthcare facilities to acquire, manage, dispense and deliver pharmaceuticals
and medical supplies, as well as enhance patient safety, reduce medication
errors, improve workflow, and increase operational efficiency.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Hasbro Scores With Transformers

The extremely strong opening delivered by the Transformers movie sequel could
bode well for Hasbro's (NYSE: HAS) sales in the coming months. 

The film, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, racked up domestic ticket sales
of more than $200 million in the 5 days since its opening on Wednesday. This
financial performance exceeded expectations, and narrowly missed setting the
record for 5-day revenues set last year by the Batman sequel, The Dark Knight. 

Owning the brand upon which the movie is based provides Hasbro with several
benefits that could give it an advantage relative to peers such as Mattel (NYSE:
MAT). 

Medivation - Dimebon Launch in 2012?

Medivation Inc. (Nasdaq: MDVN) reported first quarter 2009 financial results
following the market close on May 11, 2009. Revenue came in at $16.34 million,
exactly where we had it modeled. Revenue consisted solely of collaboration
revenue from Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). EPS was ($0.19), significantly ahead of our
forecast of ($0.34), due to substantially lower-than-expected operating
expenses. 

Pfizer makes quarterly true-up payments to Medivation as reimbursement for a
significant portion of Dimebon-related development and commercialization
expenses. In the first quarter 2009, Pfizer made a $5.8 million true-up payment
to MDVN, which is reflected as a reduction in operating expenses - approximately
$5.4 million of the true-up payment hit the R expense line-item. 

Raser Technologies (RZ) Update

Raser Technologies (NYSE: RZ) is gradually transforming itself from a
developmental stage company to an operating geothermal power producer, although
not a "pure play". 

Looking forward, this yet to break-even company will likely transform its barren
financials through the commencement of production at its first geothermal plant
in Utah, purchased power agreements (PPAs), turbine deliveries, extension of the
production tax credit (PTC), in addition to Symetron's progress in its SUV
demonstration vehicle and heavy duty alternators.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Jun 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Three nonprofit organizations, Freestore Foodbank, The New York Theatre
Experience, and the Pangea Foundation won top prizes in the Microsoft
Show Your Impact Story Contest by demonstrating their use of Microsoft
technologies to maximize or expand their impact on the communities they
serve.

    The contest, hosted by TechSoup Global (www.techsoupglobal.org), a
nonprofit organization devoted to making technology and technology
education available and affordable to nonprofits and libraries all over
the world, invited nonprofits and libraries in the United States and
Canada to describe how they had used Microsoft products acquired through
TechSoup Global's Product Donation program to help them achieve impact
and further their mission. Chosen from a field of 381 entrants, the three
winning organizations were awarded prizes in the following contest
categories:

    Stable and Secure Technology: Freestore Foodbank

    The Freestore Foodbank in Cincinnati, OH has employed Microsoft
technologies to expand food programs and services such as a Mobile Pantry,
Kids Cafe, and culinary job training to serve over 7,000 individuals a
month via 450 agencies in 20 counties while maintaining their IT stability
with server redundancy and back-up.

    Optimize Mission Delivery: The New York Theatre Experience

    Through their Web site www.nytheatre.com, The New York Theatre Experience
leverages Microsoft products to more effectively highlight, nurture,
promote, and advance the work of thousands of indie/nonprofit theatre
practitioners making groundbreaking and foundational art in New York City.

    Transformations to Maximize Impact: Pangea Foundation

    The Pangea Foundation utilized Microsoft technologies to develop
ReliefPoint(TM), an online solution that serves as a single, unified
communications platform for disaster relief organizations. It has been
used by organizations responding to the 2008 Midwest floods, Hurricane
Gustav, Hurricane Ike, the 2009 Santa Barbara fires and, most recently,
the H1N1 influenza (swine flu).

    "Software allows nonprofits to dramatically increase the reach and
efficacy of their organizations," said Akhtar Badshah, Sr. Director of
Global Community Affairs at Microsoft. "Microsoft works closely with
TechSoup Global as part of our ongoing efforts to provide access to IT
knowledge and software tools that may otherwise be inaccessible to
nonprofit organizations, allowing them to transform the way they pursue
their missions and deliver services. It was amazing to see and read the
stories about how -- for example -- technologies such as the Microsoft
Office platform have had such a huge impact on nonprofits and the
individuals they ultimately serve."

    "For all of the years that TechSoup Global has distributed donated
technology products to nonprofits and libraries, the organizations we
serve never fail to amaze us with the important work that they do and the
ways in which they leverage technologies to extend their reach and
impact," said Rebecca Masisak, Co-C.E.O, TechSoup Global.
"Congratulations to the winners and we're excited to have the opportunity
to showcase your stories and those of all the nonprofits and libraries
that entered."

    All three winning organizations each receive a $5,000 cash grant from
Microsoft plus $25,000 worth of donated Microsoft product. For further
information about these organizations and their winning submissions,
please visit www.showyourimpact.org/microsoft.

conventional Prime or Alt-A mortgage loans. The group-to-bond associations are
as follows: 

Group 1: Approximately 49% interest in the First Horizon Alternative Mortgage
Securities Trust 2005-FA5, class III-A-1. Credit Enhancement for the 1-A-1
certificate and each exchangeable class combination (1-A-3 through 1-A-10) is
provided by the structural support on the underlying transaction and by the 15%
class 1-A-2 bond. 

Group 2: Approximately 49% interest in the Bank of America Mortgage Securities
mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2005-C, class 2-A-1. Credit

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hong Kong said on Tuesday that Walt Disney Co will invest $452 million to expand its Hong Kong theme park, seen as necessary to bolster the park's long-term prospects against a planned rival park in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang said Hong Kong would not invest more capital in the joint venture but would convert a substantial part of its loan to the project into equity. He said Disney's capital investment would be about HK$3.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney will also convert the entire balance of its outstanding HK$2.76 billion loan to the theme park into equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Parks spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said the company was pleased to have completed an agreement "that will benefit both parties" after two years of negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The expansion deal will contribute to Hong Kong's appeal as an international, family-friendly tourist destination and the resort's long-term success," Goodman said in a statement, adding that the company was eager to start work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expansion consists of 30 new attractions in three new "lands," two of which will be exclusive to Hong Kong Disneyland for five years after opening, a source familiar with the plan said. The park will have exclusive rights in Asia to the third new "land" for five years, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first area will take three years to complete and the next two will begin over the following two years with the entire expansion set for completion in 2014, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong lawmakers are set to vote July 10 on the HK$3.63 billion deal to boost the park's total area by 23 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, Disney promised to boost transparency by disclosing its annual visitor figures and financial performance for the Hong Kong park. The first report is expected at the end of the park's 2009 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI RIVAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In total this means that the Walt Disney Company will invest about HK$6.2 billion new capital in demonstration of the company's confidence in Hong Kong Disneyland," said Rita Lau, Hong Kong's Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Disney's new investment and the government's debt-to-equity swap, Hong Kong will see its stake in the park fall to 52 percent from 57 percent in the theme park's first major expansion since it opened to great fanfare in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, however, the park's performance has been sluggish, with attendance falling short of initial targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government's outstanding loan to the theme park is about HK$6.89 billion. After the conversion, this balance will not drop below HK$1 billion, the government said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the expansion, with a mix of thrill rides, would "broaden the park's appeal" and act as a "catalyst" in improving the park's operating and financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there is no expansion, the attraction of the theme park will fall over time," government economist Helen Chan said at a briefing to announce details of the long-awaited expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong government desperately needs the expansion to boost flagging attendance, with a much larger rival Disneyland expected to be completed in Shanghai in 2014 -- assuming it gets approval from the Chinese government -- that could draw much visitor traffic from the burgeoning mainland China market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong is the smallest of Disney's five resorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're only increasing it (the size) by some 20 percent but the Shanghai Disneyland is going to be 10 times the size of Hong Kong Disneyland, how are we going to compete with them," said lawmaker Emily Lau during a briefing on the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But officials, who must still lobby lawmakers to green-light the deal, stressed the park's unique attractions would bolster the park's current reported attendance of about 4.5 million annually to between 5.2 million-8.4 million visitors by 2015 when the expansion is done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We often talk about uniqueness and exclusiveness and therefore it's not just about the size," said Hong Kong official Lau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total net economic benefit of the expanded theme park over 40 years would range from HK$64.7 billion to HK$117.3 billion, the government said, with the theme park having already added 0.2 percent to the city's annual GDP since opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = HK$7.8)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman, Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Welcome back to another in a series of articles that examines the thought
process behind a variety of option strategies using stock, index, and/or
exchange-traded fund (ETF) options. This column will examine the iron butterfly,
the pros and cons of putting on an iron butterfly, and the profit and loss
potential of this position. So, let's jump into this interesting strategy&#8230; 

&#8230;After doing some digging around, our theoretical trader has decided that Exxon
Mobil (NYSE: XOM) could make for an interesting long iron butterfly trade. The
security has hovered around the 70 level during the past several months and
appears likely to remain pegged to that region during the next few weeks.
Furthermore, the equity is hitting resistance at its declining 10-month moving
average. XOM has logged only one monthly close above this trendline since the
start of 2009.

 (Adds Disney comment, details; changes byline, dateline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By James Pomfret and Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG/LOS ANGELES, June 30 (Reuters) - Hong Kong said on
Tuesday that Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) will invest $452 million to
expand its Hong Kong theme park, seen as necessary to bolster the
park's long-term prospects against a planned rival park in
Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang said Hong Kong would
not invest more capital in the joint venture but would convert a

Disney's capital investment would be about HK$3.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney will also convert the entire balance of its outstanding
HK$2.76 billion loan to the theme park into equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Parks spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said the company was
pleased to have completed an agreement "that will benefit both
parties" after two years of negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The expansion deal will contribute to Hong Kong's appeal as
an international, family-friendly tourist destination and the
resort's long-term success," Goodman said in a statement, adding
that the company was eager to start work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The expansion consists of 30 new attractions in three new
"lands," two of which will be exclusive to Hong Kong Disneyland
for five years after opening, a source familiar with the plan
said. The park will have exclusive rights in Asia to the third new
"land" for five years, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first area will take three years to complete and the next
two will begin over the following two years with the entire

billion deal to boost the park's total area by 23 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the deal, Disney promised to boost transparency by
disclosing its annual visitor figures and financial performance
for the Hong Kong park. The first report is expected at the end of
the park's 2009 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHANGHAI RIVAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In total this means that the Walt Disney Company will invest
about HK$6.2 billion new capital in demonstration of the company's
confidence in Hong Kong Disneyland," said Rita Lau, Hong Kong's
Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After Disney's new investment and the government's
debt-to-equity swap, Hong Kong will see its stake in the park fall
to 52 percent from 57 percent in the theme park's first major
expansion since it opened to great fanfare in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since then, however, the park's performance has been sluggish,

the park's operating and financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If there is no expansion, the attraction of the theme park
will fall over time," government economist Helen Chan said at a
briefing to announce details of the long-awaited expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hong Kong government desperately needs the expansion to
boost flagging attendance, with a much larger rival Disneyland
expected to be completed in Shanghai in 2014 -- assuming it gets
approval from the Chinese government -- that could draw much
visitor traffic from the burgeoning mainland China market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong is the smallest of Disney's five resorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're only increasing it (the size) by some 20 percent but
the Shanghai Disneyland is going to be 10 times the size of Hong
Kong Disneyland, how are we going to compete with them," said
lawmaker Emily Lau during a briefing on the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But officials, who must still lobby lawmakers to green-light
the deal, stressed the park's unique attractions would bolster the
park's current reported attendance of about 4.5 million annually
to between 5.2 million-8.4 million visitors by 2015 when the
expansion is done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We often talk about uniqueness and exclusiveness and
therefore it's not just about the size," said Hong Kong official
Lau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The total net economic benefit of the expanded theme park over
40 years would range from HK$64.7 billion to HK$117.3 billion, the
government said, with the theme park having already added 0.2
percent to the city's annual GDP since opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1 = HK$7.8)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman, Phil Berlowitz)

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) will within two days pay $470 million in court-ordered interest on the punitive award for the 1989 Valdez oil spill, nearly ending all legal wrangling over the disastrous tanker grounding, an attorney for the spill plaintiffs said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon has agreed to wire the full interest charge to the plaintiffs by Wednesday, said Dave Oesting, an Anchorage attorney who guided the lawsuit filed by about 32,000 fishermen, Alaskan property owners and others who sought redress for the worst U.S. tanker spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has decided to stop challenging the much-shrunken punitive award, with the exception of $70 million in disputed legal costs, Oesting said. Other than that, "It is the end of the road as between plaintiffs and Exxon," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon is doing the right thing by stepping forward to compensate those Alaskans and others who are still feeling the effects of the oil spill 20 years later," said Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lives were permanently disrupted, businesses bankrupted, fisheries affected for generations, thousands of birds and wildlife killed," Begich said. "Paying the court-ordered compensation and interest is long overdue so I know Alaskans will appreciate Exxon's decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on June 15 ordered Exxon to pay $507.5 million in punitive damages, plus interest charged over the past 13 years. That appeals court decision followed a ruling last year by the U.S. Supreme Court that dramatically reduced the punitive fine Exxon would have paid for the 11 million-gallon spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 9th Circuit also ordered Exxon to pay 5.9 percent interest on the punitive award as accrued back to September 24, 1996, the date the judgment was entered in the original class-action case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ExxonMobil accepts the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court relating to the interest owing on the Supreme Court's punitive damages award. We expect to make payment of interest on this award in the next few days," Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers said in an emailed response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years earlier, a U.S. District Court jury ordered Exxon to pay a punitive fine of $5 billion, about equivalent to the corporation's annual profit at the time. The verdict was reached at the end of a summer-long civil trial in Anchorage over damages sustained by fishermen and other plaintiffs in the class-action case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon appealed the verdict and, through successive rulings, had it whittled down to $2.5 billion before the Supreme Court issued its decision a year ago. Exxon had argued that if any punitive fine was justified, it should be no more than $25 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that Exxon has ceased almost all of its challenges to the punitive award, most plaintiff payments would likely be distributed by August, Oesting said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously, the actual outcome was a disappointment for us, with the huge reduction in recoveries that we thought we had secured," the Alaskans' lead lawyer said. "I can't say that they'll be overwhelmed or overjoyed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oesting said he was not surprised that Exxon declined to continue challenging the interest charge. "It struck me, and I'm biased, of course, that they didn't have any possibility of prevailing on that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has already started paying the $507.5 million final punitive award, though it is subtracting a portion under a previous side deal with seven seafood processors, Oesting said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has petitioned the 9th Circuit to reconsider its ruling that the corporation is not entitled to a reimbursement of $70 million in legal costs, Oesting said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ExxonMobil has made an application to the Ninth Circuit Court for en banc rehearing of our claim for recovery of appeal costs, which we believe we are entitled to as a result of the Supreme Court's decision to reduce the punitive damages award. The Ninth Circuit panel was split on this issue with one of the Judges agreeing with Exxon's position," Exxon's Jeffers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the private civil case, Exxon in 1991 settled a combined state and federal government criminal and civil complaint for $1.025 billion. The corporation paid that settlement over a period of 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a special reopener provision in the settlement, Exxon could be liable for another $92 million in compensation to the state and federal governments for unanticipated ecological damages from the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeffers said he was not aware of the status right now regarding the reopener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Hezron Selvi in Bangalore; Editing by Gary Hill and Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  RESTON, VA, Jun 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Canton Township, home to about 85,000 in the suburban Detroit, Michigan
area, relies on Microsoft Exchange for communications. Joe Kocinski,
Canton's Network Administrator, is responsible for protecting Exchange,
geographic information systems, financial software, and other
applications that are vital for the delivery of police, fire, and other
critical local services. "No one, except me and the voices in my head,
appreciates e-mail until they don't have it," says Joe.

    He was using Microsoft Data Protection Manager for Exchange data backup
but explains that, "We needed to be able to restore lost messages and get
Exchange back online quickly if it ever went down. We couldn't just rely
on tape backup. If the server went down we'd have to retrieve the tape
libraries and then rebuild the whole server."

    Replay AppImage from AppAssure helped him solve part of the problem. "With
Replay's application pack for Exchange, I can mount the Exchange data
store, find a message, then restore it," he reports.

    Now, Joe protects 3 SQL servers, 1 back-end Exchange server, and a few
physical servers that run financial software and geographic information
systems with Replay AppImage. "Implementation was flawless," remembers
Joe. "It could not have been simpler."

    Replay AppImage takes snapshots of Canton's servers at various intervals:
every 15 minutes for Exchange storage, every 30 minutes for the Exchange
system, every 30 minutes for one file server, every 2 hours for another.
"I'm using repurposed hardware with 800 GB of storage space and, so far,
Replay AppImage has only used 23% of that capacity. Considering everything
I'm protecting, that's quite a feat."

    Replay AppImage allows Exchange administrators to browse, recover, search,
export, and analyze e-mail content directory from Microsoft Exchange Data
Stores (EDBs). Once messages are located they can be restored to a mailbox
on a live server or a .PST. Replay AppImage, an application-aware,
disk-based imaging solution, automatically and continuously images the
entire Windows application server and accelerates backups and disaster
recovery.

    Like many IT managers, Joe anticipates a virtual environment in the
future. "I have used Replay AppImage to restore data to a virtual test
environment and it worked perfectly," he says. "All the latest data was
there."

    Joe does have the same cost restraints as other public and private
organizations so server virtualization initiatives hinge on finding
solutions that fit his tight budget. He has been comparing costs and feels
that "Replay AppImage is more cost-effective than other solutions and
that's important."

    About Replay AppImage

    Replay AppImage is an application-aware, disk-based imaging solution that
automatically and continuously protects Windows applications. It is the
only solution that eliminates the backup window and continuously checks
for corruption. It also uniquely leverages virtualization to automatically

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical is investing in increased polypropylene (PP) compounding
capacity and capability at its Lillebonne Polypropylene Plant (LPP), France.
Capacity will increase by 45,000 tons to meet growing demand for Exxtral
performance polyolefins from automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
primarily in Europe. The expansion is due for completion by year end 2009. 

The LPP facility currently manufactures neat, filled and compounded PP such as
the new generation compound Exxtral BMU141 that was recently specified for the
instrument panel of the new Citro&#235;n Berlingo and Peugeot Partner. Exxtral
polyolefins were also specified for the door panel, and upper and lower trim of
these vehicles. 

Exxtral polyolefins have been used primarily for interior and under the hood
automotive applications but are increasingly being specified for exterior
applications, such as bumper fasciae which also are driving demand. 

"This expansion also increases the range of polymers manufactured at LPP. It is
yet another demonstration of ExxonMobil Chemical`s commitment to meeting the
needs of the growing global automotive industry. It follows announcements last
year of capacity and capability increases in North America and Asia Pacific,"
said Samuel Deboos, automotive and appliance sales manager, polypropylene,
Europe, ExxonMobil Chemical specialty compounds business. "As a result,
customers will have easier access to a broader range of Exxtral polyolefins
wherever they are located." 

In January 2008, ExxonMobil Chemical announced the start up of a new $20 million
specialty compounding facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana with an annual capacity
of 40 thousand tons. 

Under an agreement announced in September 2008, Resin &amp; Pigment Technologies
Pte. Ltd., Singapore will manufacture a broad range of ExxonMobil Chemical`s
specialty compounds, including Exxtral polyolefins, for use in automotive
interior and exterior applications. 

The portfolio of Exxtral performance polyolefins is becoming increasingly
popular with automotive designers and processors looking for new materials that
offer opportunities to reduce weight and cost without sacrificing performance.
Durable in adverse conditions, they provide outstanding surface hardness, good
"fit and finish" characteristics, fast cycle times and are competitively priced.

Banco do Brasil booked pretax profits totaling 3.4 billion
reais ($1.73 billion) from the record-setting initial public
offering of credit card operator VisaNet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bradesco (BBDC4.SA), Brazil's second-largest private sector
bank, said in a securities filing on Tuesday it will receive 2
billion reais from the sale of a 10.5 percent stake in VisaNet
VNET3.SA, which will impact its second-quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Federally-controlled Banco do Brasil (BBAS3.SA) said in a
separate statement its pretax profit from the sale of a 7.05
percent stake in VisaNet would reach 1.42 billion reais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bradesco retains a 28.76 percent stake in VisaNet, while
Banco do Brasil has about 24 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders including Bradesco and Banco do Brasil raised

largest IPO ever in Brazil and the world's biggest in the past
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VisaNet is the Brazilian affiliate of credit card network
Visa Inc (V.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bradesco also said it set aside 1.3 billion reais for bad
debt in the second quarter "to provide support for eventual
cyclical scenarios, with an increase in default rates and/or
changes in the risk profile of the credit portfolio."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brasilia-based Banco do Brasil will book 676 million reais
in additional provisions above the minimum required by
Brazilian banking regulators in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank lending in Brazil fell for a second straight month in
May as banks, concerned over a spike in loan delinquencies, cut
back on new loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Default rates, as measured by loans that have remained
unpaid for at least 90 days, rose to 5.5 percent of total debt
last month from 5.2 percent in April, reaching the highest
level since September 2000.

worth $13 million, it said on Tuesday, lifting its shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monitise said Visa International, the world's largest retail
electronic payments network, would also subscribe to a rights
issue of 73.2 million new shares to raise 5.1 million pounds
($8.4 million), giving it 14.4 percent of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monitise shares were up 19 percent to 6.30 pence by 1250
GMT, outperforming a flat London stock market .FTSE -- below
the 7 pence-per-share price of the new shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today's announcement provides a major boost to Monitise's
short-term revenue visibility and long-term strategic position,"
Investec analyst Gareth Evans wrote in a note, reiterating his
"buy" recommendation and 10 pence price target on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investec acts as a broker and adviser to Monitise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the deal, Visa will pay Monitise $13 million to help
it develop technology to provide SMS alerts and secure payment
mechanisms for holders of Visa's roughly 2 billion cards
worldwide -- plus licence, service and development fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's a whole raft of things you'll be able to do with
your phone in the years to come that you can do with your card
now," Monitise Chief Executive Alastair Lukies told Reuters in a
telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Existing shareholders UBS Global Asset Management and
Capital Group will also participate in the capital hike, keeping
their stakes at 12.9 percent and 5.8 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa's head of product innovation, Tim Attinger, will take a
seat on Monitise's advisory board, and Visa will also have the
option to nominate a representative to the main board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monitise said it planned to use the money from the new
shares plus existing cash balances of about 10 million pounds to
invest in its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it expected revenues for the year to June
30, 2009 to rise 80 percent, short of market expectations as it
focused on strategic goals rather than short-term deal timings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its operating loss will be slightly better than market
expectations, and it remains on track for its key milestone of 1
million customers by the end of the year, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monitise currently has live deployments in Britain and the
United States with partners such as HSBC (HSBA.L) and Vodafone
(VOD.L), and is in discussions with potential partners in Asia
and Africa.

 (Adds background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRUSSELS, June 30 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N)
has offered remedies aimed at tackling concerns that its $68
billion planned takeover of rival Wyeth WYE.N may be
anti-competitive, the European Commission said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission, which polices competition in the 27-country
European Union, said in a daily list of planned mergers under
scrutiny that it had extended the deadline for its review of the
deal to July 20 from July 6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parties in mergers often offer to divest some sectors or
activities to address concerns that their transaction could
infringe EU competition rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Pfizer executive was quoted in March as saying that the
company may have to shed some of its animal-health business so
that it can gain antitrust clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said in April that it had received a request for
additional information from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
regarding the proposed acquisition of Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it still expected to close the deal by the
end of the third quarter or during the fourth quarter of this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Double click on the newslinks below for the relevant topics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [EU-REGS-RTRS-LEN] For stories on competition issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [EU-REGS-AID-BACT-RTRS-LEN] For stories on state aid, MAs

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO, June 30 (Reuters) - Banco Bradesco (BBDC4.SA),
Brazil's second-largest private bank, said on Tuesday that it
would book about 2 billion reais ($1 billion) in pretax profit

VNET3.SA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Bradesco said in a regulatory filing that it would also set

Both items will affect second-quarter earnings, the Osasco,
Brazil-based bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, rival Banco do Brasil (BBAS3.SA) said it would
receive 1.42 billion reais in pretax profit from the sale of a

second quarter, it said in a regulatory statement filed on
Tuesday.

&lt;p&gt; * Will pay by Wednesday: attorney for Alaskans who sued&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * $470 mln payment ends most wrangling over 1989 spill
(Adds Exxon spokesman comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Yereth Rosen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANCHORAGE, Alaska, June 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) will within two days pay $470 million in court-ordered
interest on the punitive award for the 1989 Valdez oil spill,
nearly ending all legal wrangling over the disastrous tanker
grounding, an attorney for the spill plaintiffs said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has agreed to wire the full interest charge to the
plaintiffs by Wednesday, said Dave Oesting, an Anchorage
attorney who guided the lawsuit filed by about 32,000
fishermen, Alaskan property owners and others who sought
redress for the worst U.S. tanker spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has decided to stop challenging the
much-shrunken punitive award, with the exception of $70 million
in disputed legal costs, Oesting said. Other than that, "It is
the end of the road as between plaintiffs and Exxon," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon is doing the right thing by stepping forward to
compensate those Alaskans and others who are still feeling the
effects of the oil spill 20 years later," said Senator Mark
Begich, a Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Lives were permanently disrupted, businesses bankrupted,
fisheries affected for generations, thousands of birds and
wildlife killed," Begich said. "Paying the court-ordered
compensation and interest is long overdue so I know Alaskans
will appreciate Exxon's decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on June 15 ordered Exxon
to pay $507.5 million in punitive damages, plus interest
charged over the past 13 years. That appeals court decision
followed a ruling last year by the U.S. Supreme Court that
dramatically reduced the punitive fine Exxon would have paid
for the 11 million-gallon spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 9th Circuit also ordered Exxon to pay 5.9 percent
interest on the punitive award as accrued back to Sept. 24,
1996, the date the judgment was entered in the original
class-action case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "ExxonMobil accepts the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court
relating to the interest owing on the Supreme Court's punitive
damages award. We expect to make payment of interest on this
award in the next few days," Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers
said in an emailed response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two years earlier, a U.S. District Court jury ordered Exxon
to pay a punitive fine of $5 billion, about equivalent to the
corporation's annual profit at the time. The verdict was
reached at the end of a summer-long civil trial in Anchorage
over damages sustained by fishermen and other plaintiffs in the
class-action case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon appealed the verdict and, through successive rulings,
had it whittled down to $2.5 billion before the Supreme Court
issued its decision a year ago. Exxon had argued that if any
punitive fine was justified, it should be no more than $25
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now that Exxon has ceased almost all of its challenges to
the punitive award, most plaintiff payments would likely be
distributed by August, Oesting said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Obviously, the actual outcome was a disappointment for us,
with the huge reduction in recoveries that we thought we had
secured," the Alaskans' lead lawyer said. "I can't say that
they'll be overwhelmed or overjoyed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oesting said he was not surprised that Exxon declined to
continue challenging the interest charge. "It struck me, and
I'm biased, of course, that they didn't have any possibility of
prevailing on that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has already started paying the $507.5 million final
punitive award, though it is subtracting a portion under a
previous side deal with seven seafood processors, Oesting said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has petitioned the 9th Circuit to reconsider its
ruling that the corporation is not entitled to a reimbursement
of $70 million in legal costs, Oesting said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "ExxonMobil has made an application to the Ninth Circuit
Court for en banc rehearing of our claim for recovery of appeal
costs, which we believe we are entitled to as a result of the
Supreme Court's decision to reduce the punitive damages award.
The Ninth Circuit panel was split on this issue with one of the
Judges agreeing with Exxon's position," Exxon's Jeffers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to the private civil case, Exxon in 1991
settled a combined state and federal government criminal and
civil complaint for $1.025 billion. The corporation paid that
settlement over a period of 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under a special reopener provision in the settlement, Exxon
could be liable for another $92 million in compensation to the
state and federal governments for unanticipated ecological
damages from the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jeffers said he was not aware of the status right now
regarding the reopener.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, June 30 (Reuters) - The Hong Kong government on
Tuesday said Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) will invest HK$3.5 billion
(US$452 million) more to expand its Hong Kong theme park, seen as
necessary to bolster the park's long-term prospects against a
rival park in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang said the Hong Kong
government would not invest more capital in the joint venture but
would convert debt into capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hong Kong government, which owns 57 percent of the
underperforming resort, desperately needs the expansion to boost
flagging attendance, with a much larger rival Disneyland expected
to be built in Shanghai in 2014 that could draw much visitor
traffic from the burgeoning mainland China market.
